I can‚Äôt tell you how many voters, even strong trump voters, hate the twitter sprees.
Well actually if he dishonestly acts as the president‚Äôs personal attorney then while Attorney General he is the de facto president‚Äôs attorney. Only impeachment can change that, and Barr and Trump know that.
Mark levin Donald Trump needs to back out of the White House and you know it. And take you with him if you want to go. Make sure to keep his number
You should check the live feeds out. Streamers are giving tours across the street from the Federal building to show everyone that there is no mass destruction to any businesses. It's very eye opening. If you just use half your brain you'll see that Trump is lying to your faces.2/
Remember the good old days like 3 years ago when Trump talked about his dick during a presidential debate?  Good times back then.  Good Times.
And Rick, suggest people hand deliver their ballot to their city hall to ensure Trump‚Äôs #USPS doesn‚Äôt mysteriously lose it.
Trump just tweeted about his Republican friend who died of the Corona Virus today. Did you happen to catch that tweet?
Agreeing with Trump on what? Trump is telling people to wear a mask. Trump is also looking for a Corona Virus cure from a doctor that believes in Demon semen and Alien DNA. I never mentioned Fauci, I don't need Fauci. You see I was one of the fortunate born with a gene related 1/
I'm voting absentee, and it won't be for Trump. You can vote for him if you want. I just don't think it's a good idea.
My bubble is logic and common sense. You may not think so, but it is. Trump being president simply does not make sense to me. You have the right to your opinions. Allow me mine.
Will you beat up Trump please? lol. Mad love from Ferndale, Mi. ‚úä You're an Icon to generations. It started with my generation. So many memories listening to your music. Life was really good. Keep pumping out the rhymes. ‚úäüñ§‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüñ§‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüñ§ Black Lives Matter.
What's sad is that people support Trump at all. Say what you want about Biden, Trump is 100x worse.
You'll vote for Trump, lmfao.
Trump had 3 solid years of Republican control of both houses. That allowed this sociopath to run wild. Most of his shenanigans would not have been tolerated in normal circumstances. I agree we have to flip the senate as well as the presidency.
I know exactly what you mean Cher. We do need him more then ever right now. He made Trump cringe. And we need someone who can do that. Make Trump cringe and scared all at once. I loved watching Trump cringe with fear when John Lewis got after him.
McConnell says election will occur on time
I'll patiently wait. This sh*t show is only going to get worse. Trump has absolutely no idea what to do at this point.
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
Trump has no sense of humor.
Trump is just like that crazy boy in high school that can‚Äôt accept ‚Äú No‚Äù for an answer. Take a loss like a man!
Trump, probably is put on suicide watch everytime Obama speaks!
Trump is a big fucking baby!!
We can drop it off at City Hall. They have a drop box inside and out with a lock on it. Oh and did you watch any of John Lewis's funeral. Former President Barack Obama did a Eulogy for him. It was great. At one point he didn't mention any names. But he said a lot about TRUMP.
Hey Cher you want hear some great news. Michigan has several Thousand people who are mailing in there votes. We're going to PISS OFF TRUMP ROYAL LOL. I can't wait to see what he now with him. And best thing is it's called mail in voting. But we don't really have to mail it in.
Tweeting about pizza during  funeral. There is no bottom to Trump‚Äôs bottom. #GoodTrouble #BelovedCommunity #HumanDignity   #WeShallOvercome #restinpowerjohnlewis
All the MSM need to say is  Trump can‚Äôt do it instead of analyzing and debating a blatant lie.  Move on to the news that actually affects Americans.
POTUS can do multiple things at once, he has many who work with him. There is a valid argument for healing the country. There is also a valid legal argument for going after Trump..
What did like about Trump?
Since Trump &amp; everyone is talking about Demon Sperm and Aliens I feel that now is the time to point our that Trump has battled Chupacabra, Black-Eyed Kids and Satan. All those amazing stories and more can be found here.   #Maga #DemonSemen #AlienDNA #Ghosts
Mr. Cruz agreed. ‚ÄúI think election fraud is a serious problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, no, we should not delay the election.‚Äù  Election fraud ... ACTUAL material fraud you say?  BASED ON WHAT EXACTLY?  You're as bad as Trump when it comes to baseless conspiracy theories. SAD
Thank you, you expressed it perfectly. Much respect for Republicans who speak up against Trump.
Drop the new FBI building in a spot where‚Äôs there‚Äôs a hotel to be built by tRump‚Äôs.
If only he had worn a mask and not parroted Trump's conspiracy theories.  IF ONLY.
The Lewis family doesn't want trump their but I'm sure they would have welcomed him if he did show up. The current White House occupant, doesn't have character or moral fiber!
I don't say the H word lightly, but I fucking hate Trump.
He looks scared because he knows they should be wearing masks. He's scared of getting sick, but he's more scared of Donald Trump.
you take offense and claim that you were asked that question on TV because you are black when the name of the group you belong to is literally called ‚Äúblack voices for trump‚Äù.. fake outrage or jus completely oblivious?
Trump's only chance is if the virus does actually dissappear before election day.
did you just say this considering you cheerlead for a president who is paid to govern but instead watches fox news if he isn‚Äôt golfing or watching oan? at least the media matters people do it as part of their jobs. trump does it just because.
Today is for  and only for him. Even Trump can‚Äôt ruin this day.
hard for me to feel bad for herman cain dying of covid when he intentionally threw himself at it to coon for trump. i am more concerned about the people who aren‚Äôt financially comfortable being affected by covid. only a matter of time before trump unpersons him
Trump wanting to delay the election is the same as that dorky kid in third grade trying to change the rules to the game because he knows he‚Äôs about to lose.
One thing I DO respect about Trump is on the same day he opens up a constitutional crisis, he follows it up with this. Just an incomprehensible amount of range and hustle.
He contracted the virus after attending Trump‚Äôs death rally in Tulsa.  You know, the one where his staff removed the social distancing signs and the one that no masks were required to attend.
How's that China trade deal? How's that wall coming? How's the unemployment rate? How's crime control? How's the GDP? How's race relations? How's affordable health care? How's the infrastructure? How's the US debt? How's COVID-19 recovery? #MrMakeMattersWorse #Trump #KAG #Resist
That Trump rally really did it huh? RIP
"stop panicking he wants you to panic" while appreciated and interesting and cool-to-learn via logic chains, I've never actually seen Trump obey any of that shit so yeah I'm gonna be worried, TF
Wow it‚Äôs like everyone who says Trump can‚Äôt go any lower is certainly always wrong
There's a middle ground between dismissive and panic, which is just the recognition that this is another addition to the mile-long list of Why Donald Trump Shouldn't Be President.
Irony: I don't want to believe the Covid-19 is here and a problem; I won't wear a mask because it acknowledges that Covid-19 is here; Covid-19 won't go away because I won't wear a mask. This is what Trump has done.
will do anything he can to extend his reign. We're going to start seeing him "float" ideas about 3rd terms, unlimited terms, or the like in order to "protect" America and his disciples will go along with it #authoritarianism  via
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden‚Äôs presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
Donald Trump doesn't have the power to delay the election. Congress does.  1.4 million people filed first-time unemployment claims last week.   United States GDP fell 32.9% between April and June.  John Lewis is an American Hero. #Facts
I agree with you,  but I also think Trump is more damaging to himself than any Dem ever could.  Delaying the election is an absolute no-no, dictator move.  It's been telegraphed for months that he'd try that as well
another day..another distraction..its all Pumpkin Head is good at..150,000 dead..no health care initiative..no agreement for aid to states or unemployment extension..just rhetoric..its all the Trump has left..
Trump's trying to distract everyone from the worst quarterly GDP contraction in the last 70 years. His failure to prepare the nation for COVID-19 has done unimaginable damage to the economy. This is his disaster, and he has to face the voters in November.
This is where the Republican Party really needs to take a stand. There's nothing wrong with mail-in voting, and now Trump is trying to prevent the election from happening.
No surprise - all Trump does is throw out distracting, insane Tweets to deflect on the terrible economic data that just came out.  He's not fooling anyone
I want Trump‚Äôs secret police to forcibly remove these people when we‚Äôre all allowed to attend games again.
If this were Trump there would be 500 media around him - even the media knows this is a hoax.
You can‚Äôt be serious. There is NO chance that Jorgensen will win. A vote for Jorgensen is exactly the same as a vote for Trump. To suggest otherwise is plain stupid.

America thought trump would do a better job, even though he had no moral compass, intellectual curiosity, a short attention span, self absorbed mentality and thought all Black, Brown and Yellow people were below him.
Trump promoted a doctor. Watch what she said about demons  via
I don't know enough about China, but the WHO hasn't lied about the pandemic. In a somehow even more fucked-up Inception plot, Trump lied about them lying. I can't find any evidence to back up his accusations of the WHO.
I used to spend all of my time at an improvisational comedy club. I'm basically family there. It's pretty much the only reason I even have a social life. Opened in '08. Started going 1/2 year in. I feel empty inside without it. Trump took that from me and I DESPISE him for it.
Boo hoo hoo Trump will not resign Bill Barr will not resign. This is their only recourse now to attack Barr for doing his job. You got caught breaking the law now it's time to pay the price. The Dems and the Deep State abused their power with the entire Russia collusion fraud.
I didn't mean to be rude, sorry. Everyone's lives have changed under Trump. One of the big changes is having dozens of countries, including Canada, ban us from visiting. It's not like I live in the middle of the U.S. I live in Detroit. Canada is a stone's throw away.
In what way has my life changed under Trump? The fact that you felt the need to ask that question is astonishing to me.
I'm truly sorry about the loss of life, but no, I didn't criticize Obama. I never really followed politics 'til a madman took over in 2016. Now I can't escape it. I can't take four more years of Trump. America can't. When Obama was president, I'd never feared for my life. Now...
I don't care what anybody else said. They're not the president. Trump is responsible because he did nothing to take precautions when he first learned about the virus last year. Instead, he played, and continues to play, golf. Which he said he wouldn't do.
It's all about money. All of these guys would have taken a position in the Trump administration. Trump neutering Jeb and crushing Rubio cost these guys a ton of money and this is how they're making some of it back (besides not paying people who worked for them).
Its seems like rich/broke/Trump supporters white folks ain't scared to die of this virus, if they not then let them give up and die. Ima wear my mask been wearing since March, been working since May I work at a retail store
I can think of 6,422 reasons Trump has lost 10 points among white Michigan voters, and I'm a white Michigan voter.
As much as I miss him, Obama isn't president anymore. Stop comparing Trump to Obama. Trump should be able to stand on his own merits, but he can't/won't/doesn't.
Trump said four congresswomen of color should go back to the "broken and crime infested" countries they came from, ignoring the fact that all of the women are American citizens and three were born in the U.S. Take your pick:
Why would you support him? He has been completely behind trump since day one. This does not demonstrate integrity.
I hand deliver mine to the city clerk‚Äôs office.  Seeing Trump‚Äôs fear of a fair election is so satisfying.
Not New Tone Trump!
What happened? Trump happened.
I know. I couldn't believe it when I heard that Trump was sending them here to Detroit. Especially when all the protests we had weren't violent. I heard its because of all the shootings. So now we'll have double of the shootings with these guys.
surprisingly in this case not only do Republicans disagree with Trump, but also Trump disagrees with Trump
TRUMP ALTERNATIVE MOTIVE  M.‚àÖ.
Trump's speeches have been nothing but one big run-on sentence that doesn't have a point.
Trump says he is sending his toy soldier mercenaries to Detroit.  Why? I thought they needed to be invited in. I'm sure Governor Gretchen Whitmer did not invite him, nor would Mayor Mike Duggan. So, where's the invite. They didn't come to Lansing...for Nazis.
This is racism. Trump will spin it as part of his sick and twisted bullshit ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù narrative and keeping suburbs safe, but at its core it‚Äôs racism. He‚Äôs a racist. His supporters...well...all I know is I typically vote for those who align with my views.
Watching television in #Michigan just got a whole lot better
Trump is scared of Putin. Either Putin has something on him (likely) or trump really is just a giant chicken shit.  Or he really doesn‚Äôt give a shit about this country. Which is it?  None are good for America.
Unfortunately watching the Trump Admin‚Äôs serious missteps in Feb, it was sadly obvious we‚Äôd be here today. In #Michigan we have a Gov who is working hard to follow public health &amp; science guidelines but to succeed this must be a national response!   Predict fall will be bad. üòî
It‚Äôs kind of like the Trump Campaign being ‚ÄúThe Death Star‚Äù (it doesn‚Äôt end well).
I like to know what GROWN man gets on national TV and cries about nobody liking him. Anybody that spends 30 minutes with Trump can tell something not right with him. Damn !
I‚Äôm assuming your referring to Charlottes Vill Trump never called white nationalist fine people, he said that ther were fine people on both sides referring to those protecting history, and the protesters against it. Then he noted that there were also not good people him...
A twelve year old is more intelligent than Trump.

BREAKING NEWS: Donald Trump says he is looking at BANNING TikTok
Look, Trump‚Äôs running to the left of Dems by telling white people icky degenerates won‚Äôt ruin their neighborhoods  Holy shit this man is trash
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
Just because Trump hates Barack Obama. And I'm right about this. Trump does hate Obama just by what he's doing with all the things Obama did when he was in office. Trump is repealing everything. That's so he can have all the White people hate all the Black people like he does.
#PortlandProtests The announcement by Trump that he is sending Federal Troops to Detroit IS A TACTIC. Detroit has not had violent riots at all. But it's a majority black city (rapidly changing though). He wants TV video of black people revolting against the Federal invasion.
Terrible interviewer, he let Trump ramble and didn‚Äôt seek clarification or push back. There is no dispute on the bounties. Trump is an idiot no doubt but this mumbling from Axios interviewer is inexcusable.
Yep keep the inner city communities (predominantly black) further away from better circumstances. You vote for Trump, unfollow me.
Potentially? IT IS. More insider trading for Trump and his lemmings.
She was right about one thing though. There‚Äôs no bigger demon than the one causing Trump Derangement Syndrome.
As soon as I read that Trump tweet I knew we'd hear from Racism Watchdog.
I didn't have "People who live by the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ support racist, dictatorial, prideful, idolater, greed-filled, American President" or I would have shouted BINGO on the day Trump got elected.
I *cant* remember the last Trump sign
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you‚Äôre going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.

Fact check: Trump targets protesters by continuing to falsely describe laws protecting federal monuments and buildings
Trump is running the conservative version of the Obama 2012 campaign. Scorched-earth mixed with targeted regulatory action towards the base and a little side of over the top rhetoric.
I suggest that we all start calling it the Trump Virus, like he insists on referring to it as the China virus. He‚Äôs put our country in this dire situation. Make it go viral. It‚Äôll make him crazy! #trumpvirus
Some say Trump says the quiet stuff out loud. I say he says the most heinous stuff out loud.

#wednesdaymorning  Trump was ordered to resume DACA applications by the Supreme Court of the United States. His response. üñïThat makes him a "rogue, impeached" person running a police state. Check your voter registration (he probably asked Russia to help).
You implied we would be better off with AG Barr ‚Äúgone‚Äù, which insinuates pos Nadler is good. in fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. I agree that there are too many people in politics that haven‚Äôt done shit in all their years. That‚Äôs precisely what so many hoped trump would change.
Peaceful protest...  You mean the Trump rally?
Trump is a dangerous idiot. Even if you love his racism, I don't understand how you can look past his blatant disregard for U.S. troops.
Trump had the govt. purchase millions of doses early on in case it worked...it doesn't.
Just watched Trump interview with Axios . Conclusion: Trump is a Dangerous IDIOT!
Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases which recently surfaced internal memos have showed.  Brett needs to resign effective immediately since he has shown deep bias amid growing tensions in the fight against abortion rights
It only took 3 years to withdraw over 100,000 troops from Iraq between 2008 - 2011. Had President Trump given this order in 2017 instead of 2020, ALL troops from Germany would have been back home by now. Good move, but too little too late. #JoJorgensen2020

Trump holds another ego filled, rant, spewing his normal dangerous, emotional BS &amp; propaganda so the big crybaby can make himself out to be the ‚Äúpoor, weak, pathetic victim‚Äù.  Incompetency &amp; denial at the highest level during a pandemic.America deserves so much better. Vote Biden
In trump‚Äôs America. But he‚Äôs going to project it onto VP Joe Biden, who hasn‚Äôt held office in four years.
Doesn‚Äôt take away from you the being the most corrupt, dishonest, untrustworthy, self serving, out of touch, dangerous, deadly, science denying, corrupt, crooked, racist, sexist, misogynistic, delusional, deluded, ignorant POTUS ever which makes you, Trump #WORSTPOTUSEVER
So, Kodak is now a drug company, thanks to trump and our tax dollars. Can‚Äôt wait until Toys ‚ÄòR Us is brought back to life as a weapons manufacturer, thanks to orange twat.
But it‚Äôs okay for Trump to be bought &amp; controlled by the highest bidder.
By trying to rip away healthcare &amp; social security?  Great plan selfish,entitled, out of touch, greedy corrupt GOP &amp; Trump political hacks who are more concerned about their personal agendas and bank accounts than doing what is best 4 America &amp; Americans. America deserves better!
It doesn‚Äôt erase any of the blood on Trump &amp; his administrations hands.
How much of that did Trump and his crooked, goon squad pocket of that money for their personal bank accounts?
Trump‚Äôs 4 point plan to beat Covid- 1. Tell my follower‚Äôs not to wear masks. Liberals are just wearing masks to make me look bad. 2. Discredit and attack experts who are looking out for the best interest of  health &amp; society.    3.  DENY REALITY, SCIENCE &amp; Facts. 4.  Blame Obama.
Total BS, as usual. GOP snuck in there so called ‚Äústimulus plan‚Äù a way 2 cut SS because they don‚Äôt give a damn about seniors. They want to cut SS &amp; Medicare during a pandemic because Trump &amp;GOP  don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about Americans being sick or dying. Only care about their $$$
Prea. Trump is more concerned about his popularity than the 150,000 Americans lost to this virus and their grieving families.   Selfishness on Sterioids
That‚Äôs not a protest, it‚Äôs a riot...which I don‚Äôt support and obviously demands police intervention.   The other is a bunch of people holding a Trump rally because they don‚Äôt want to wear a mask.   Your points don‚Äôt make any sense.
Kind of wish they can ask the question then Barr gets 5 mins to respond...that still doesn‚Äôt excuse  and his misrepresentation of the protests not showing the peaceful protests and not saying shit about the guns trump supporters used...we need a overhaul of both sides
trump replaced Michael Cohen with Barr, as his personal fixer
Listening to poor Pumpkin Head whine/lament about his lack of popularity compared to Dr Fauci yesterday was well...so 3rd grade..I'm so sorry he doesn't have a mommy to make it feel better..we know Fred Trump would have just slapped the fuck out of him..
Democrats are the new republicans and republicans are just trump loyalists now

I hate to say this but trust me there is no enlightenment that will change them. I have lost friends too. Not because I attacked them about their political choices but because they attacked me. They're all like little Trump robots. They talk the same, and they act the same.
Biden most likely does have some type of disorder. I wish I could prove to you how wrong you are about Trump, though. Smart people shouldn't need to brag about "acing" a cognitive test. You're confusing his political instincts with business instincts, which are also terrible.
Trump's not all there, himself. It'd be foolish to deny that.
OMG, what a line of bull.  The Trump administration lies so much it's so embarrassing.  This is dispicable leadership.
ANYBODY could have made that chart. What has led you to believe that Trump cares about people? His word? HA!
More propaganda. At this point, you're probably thinking "This guy is crazy. What kind of government would lie to and purposefully misinform their own citizens?" Trump's government. We're living in a real-life George Orwell novel. And yes, BLM. Are they not human beings?
The REALLY crazy thing is that 40% of Americans will follow tRump right over that cliff.
No matter who you stand with, it is NEVER okay to do what those cops(?) just did. People have rights. Hell, I hate Trump, but I DO think he has rights. The right to remain silent. The right to an attorney. Etc. Etc.
It's also not the way Trump has made it. He's a horrible person, let alone president, and it is impossible to make me think otherwise. There's a staggering amount of evidence to support my views. You seem a reasonable person, so I wish you well, regardless of your views.
Correction: Nobody who can see through layers of bullshit likes Trump.
It doesn't matter how likely it is. That fact that it's killing people at all should be cause for alarm. I don't know why this is so hard to understand, but Trump only cares about Trump. He's outright stated so in interviews.
This is a perfect example of biased mainstream media. They tell you who to vote for when it comes to public office. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, AND Jo Jorgensen are running for President. Jorgensen is the BEST candidate BY FAR, but CNN disagrees. #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteLibertarian
You are obviously a Trump follower, be amidst of what you wrote is garbage.
I'm usually very good with sarcasm, but this threw me for a loop. Where exactly do you stand? If you're for Trump, whatever. Just genuinely curious.
You won't like the results for Trump. Have you SEEN the test he keeps bragging about acing?
Yes they all bought stock in it after their tRump god touted it.
I know I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks there seem to be no urgency in Trump, Graham or McConnell re-election campaigns. Oh, I know maybe because of Trump‚Äôs late night phone calls with Putin.  Putin told them ‚ÄúNot to worry bout a THANG‚Äù!

Trump has clearly turned a corner
This whole "Trump's going to refuse to leave office" thing is skipping way too many steps ahead.
No, because we only learned about it this year. If Trump had acted when he was first warned of the virus, I would've been wearing a mask since late last year. Tell the families of the nearly 150K (that's just the U.S.) who died from Covid-19 that it's bullshit. It's still deadly.
Not new tone Trump!
Trump's entire national plan to protect our kids and teachers returning to school fits easily in a Tweet because there isn't one.
I dont listen to Tom Perez. Half the time he doesn't even know what he's talking about Cher.  That's probably because Trump is telling him what to say. And Trump doesn't know what he's talking about every time he opens his mouth. All I hear when Trump talks is BLAH BLAH BLAH.
Also definitive: "The media‚Äôs fetish with 'tone' seems to tell us more about the media than Trump. It is part of the mainstream media's collective determination to avoid spelling out how irrational and impulsive he actually is." --
Hey Cher did you see the picture of the watch. I love it. I'm a girl but you know what i would wear it. It looks so cool. Ok back to the post office thing. We can't let Trump get a way with this. But look on the bright side. I can't get my bills. I dont have to pay them. RIGHT
I am usually all for 3rd party voting. Both major parties are flawed. The problem is if we take stand and refuse to vote for "the lesser of 2 evils", Trump gets a second term. His base will out in full force on election day. One of those 2 men will be president. It's that simple.
Mr Tiffany, they do not know who killed Bernell Trammell.
only had one shot muskets in their time doesn't mean that If It was written today It wouldn't include modern weaponry. I agree that we don't need to have machine guns. What Trump is doing across this country right now, Is a prime example why It was written.

Nope not at all because your still in Michigan living under Our Governor and it‚Äôs obvious that Trump crazy ass is losing in November so ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è nothing I can say but don‚Äôt worry we will keep you safe üò∑ Mask up my friend
If you voted for Trump, make sure to flush your head in the toilet today.
So who is doing a better job? Trump? His republican governors like in Florida? You can go down there if you want....
Twitter Suspends Donald Trump Jr. for Tweeting COVID-19 Misinformation  via
Um, WHAT? Stella Immanuel, Trump‚Äôs New COVID-19 Doctor, Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine
Trump et al have been laying the groundwork here for a very long time. He has no intention of going quietly.
Donald Trump Jr, and quite a few others, have had their tweets in favor of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) removed. If you want to tweet about HCQ, I'd suggest you do so in an oblique manner, or that you link to approved sources. Twitter isn't bad on this, it's just not an open forum.
Oh really? So you think Trump‚Äôs dangerous racist, misogynistic,sexist,corrupt, crooked actions &amp; words, his total incompetency &amp; abuse of power is winning over the middle? Aren‚Äôt u suppose to be a genius or something? Shows even a genius can be moronic, ignorant &amp; ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù.
Trump reinstilling what an idiot he is by investing taxpayers money in a drug he had a ‚Äúhunch‚Äù &amp; investment in. Trying to cover up his incompetency and science denying incompetency &amp; wasteful government spending while profiting personally off his BS. America deserves better!
Yes that plus John's family probably doesn't want Trump to come anyway. Especially how Trump treated and talked to and down to John Lewis. I wouldn't want him there either President or no President.
I 0% trust you. You went from calling Trump a kook to being a sycophant. I listened to you try to unconvincingly explain it on the  podcast, The Daily.  I‚Äôd like a new country but I‚Äôll settle for leaders I can at least mildly respect.
Also, someone has been dipping into the same tanning lotion and hairspray which will truly be Trump's "greatest (only) legacy".
Nothing but a trump hot air bagYou could make a bingo card of all the stories Trump was trying to distract us from. I‚Äôm gonna zero in on... losing a third of our GDP.
Wow. After what happened to you there is still that suck up to Trump.  You are in deep
Mark my words: if Trump loses, the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day will be the most dangerous 78 days in American history. Especially if he loses so decisively that he can‚Äôt make a case to contest it.
Trump was bad from the start even at his rally‚Äôs he was a rascist made fun of reporters and spread lies and fake news we can‚Äôt afford to allow trump to continue his presidency he‚Äôs a terrible person and is allowing his own people suffer the lower class are homeless oron the brink
We had an election during the civil war, ww1 and ww2. Also the great depression but we can't have one now because Trump's gonna lose. It doesn't matter if if it's vote by mail or in person. Doesn't matter if it's by carrier pigeon or mental telepathy. Trump will lose.
Really? What makes you think we're worrying about Trump tweets. We have more important issues here in the real world! We Vote Biblically not politically.
That‚Äôs rich coming from a Trump supporter. You ever hear the so called potus talk or read any of his tweets?
But with Trump tweeting this he could depress turnout on his own base. We need to look at that as a good thing as it may tilt a state
And I don‚Äôt want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn‚Äôt question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. üôÑNo wonder
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), on the other hand, has publicly feuded with the White House, so much so that Trump issued an empty threat to block Vice President Pence from speaking with her. Whitmer's handling of the virus stands at 67 percent approval, a 5-point increase
Everybody talks about well we got to take out Trump so what really is the plan what comes next?
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn‚Äôt for progressive policies
You mean, the guy Trump hired? Funny how when they are working for Trump and kiss his ass they‚Äôre great, but when he inevitably fires them, they‚Äôre unreputable. Lol.
Let‚Äôs hope so!!! Keep dicking it up trump...
Herman Cain would still be alive if it weren't for Trump.
Remember guys if you can vote early do it don‚Äôt wait till last minute. Find your LOCAL POLING stations. Check hours. Please retweet. Trump is going too try to mess with post office‚Äôs.
Fuck Twitter! Trump 2020!!!
You meant to say Trump, right?
Shut up! He died promoting flawed Republican ideologies. He didn't wear a mask because Trump and the Republicans said it violated their rights. The virus was a hoax. His blood is on Trump's hands.
The 5 pm shit show about the virus w/Trump
He meant the Trump virus
New polls wednesday by a democratic pollsters shows Presieent Trump closing gaps in all battleground states
And not one tweet from Donald j Trump.
The unfortunate truth is to Trump and the GOP Mr Cain was just a token who forgot who he was because of his success and got caught up in Trump's political madness and paid the ultimate price for which the Republicans can care less. Just another black man caught up in the mix.
Part of the reason that Trump Tweeted out his wacky "delay the election" today was to create a shiny object to distract from coverage of the John Lewis funeral coverage today.
Why not? I thought Trump was funding these small businesses. Oh I forgot he only funds billionaires like kanye and elons businesses
Donald Trump supports cancel culture.
I know exactly what you mean Cher. We do need him more then ever right now. He made Trump cringe. And we need someone who can do that. Make Trump cringe and scared all at once. I loved watching Trump cringe with fear when John Lewis got after him.
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
Trump bad  police bad Trump will steal election
Yup unfortunately I learned that lesson this year I was never much into presidency until I realized with trump how much power a president really has thru executive power and how he can skip congress and do what he wants on multiple occasions
I think the turtle has drinking some of that alien sperm. He's been drinking it right outta the alien's (Trump) sperm sack.
Our problems started with George w bush who bankrupted America and we were looking at a depression and Obama took over with his help of quantum easing ethics he managed to put us in a recession and put the economy in the positive then trump took over and undid everything obama
The most dangerous president in history of presidents Bernie vowed to take down trump no matter what for his supporters to turn their back on him for making a tough decision he had to make is completely unethical and shameful everyone needs to do their part to save this country
I was waiting for some piece of crap to tie the 2 together. You libs don't miss a chance to jab one of the best Presidents of our time, just like one of the worst presidents of our time (Obamy mammy) doing a EULOGY and bashes Trump NO CLASS
trump also didn‚Äôt listen to medical professionals when they told him what to to to handle Covid.
TRUMP 2020!!!! üá∫üá∏
No kidding.  Trump is a genius on triggering the left. ü§£
I agree. I was talking about individuals that are dumb enough to believe what Trump says, i.e masks don‚Äôt work, we don‚Äôt need to social distance. Not that anyone deserves to die, that‚Äôs horrible.
Sorry for your luck Herman.  Guess you shouldn't have listened to the smallest stupidest man to ever enter the WH!  Now that what I call voter suppression.  PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW TRUMP'S ADVICE DIE AND CAN'T VOTE!  #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K  #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #CorruptGOP
LOL, We wanted to reach out because we just got off a call with President Trump to review the most recent list of Patriots who contributed to our critical $25,000,000 July End-of-Month Goal, and he noticed your name was MISSING.
Question? Does anyone know if Donald Trump or any off his family owns stock in company pushing hidroxycloriken? Sorry about spelling guys.
And to see people tweeting President Pelosi shows you how people really just don‚Äôt get it. You need strong leaders that will actually do something that will fight and call shit out Pelosi has done the bare minimum to take Trump out.
Didn‚Äôt that lawyer guy that went to jail say that Trump was going to be really difficult to take him out of the White House so here is my thing why didn‚Äôt Pelosi and Schumer do everything they could to take his ass out. I mean seriously people should be outraged and angry at
In the wake of peaceful demonstrations on the streets of Portland, President  sent in "federal" law enforcement to protect the federal courthouse, and made it clear that the Governor &amp; Citizens his Blackwater Trump Troops would use violence.  #PortlandProtests
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden‚Äù
You‚Äôre not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you‚Äôre not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Trying to imagine the ‚Äútizzy‚Äù Republicans would be in if Obama had suggested half the shit Trump ‚Äújokes‚Äù about.  Left or right, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing funny about a sitting president acting like an autocrat.
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn‚Äôt a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I was pissed when I found out Obama asked Bernie to step down I was pissed at Bernie for agreeing and Obama for even getting involved but we can‚Äôt allow trump to win again think of the kids under the age of 18 suffering with their parents on corners They are everywhere inMichigan
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally‚Äôs when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it‚Äôs time to put others before myself we can‚Äôt allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don‚Äôt vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren‚Äôt gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn‚Äôt my first pick either
Well, the blood is on trump‚Äôs hands here. Way to have a super spreader event, refuse masks &amp; social distancing, then offer thoughts &amp; prayers when your friend dies. Just sick. #TrumpPandemicFailure
Interesting how Trump has turned the left into war hawks...
We can drop it off at City Hall. They have a drop box inside and out with a lock on it. Oh and did you watch any of John Lewis's funeral. Former President Barack Obama did a Eulogy for him. It was great. At one point he didn't mention any names. But he said a lot about TRUMP.
Hey Cher you want hear some great news. Michigan has several Thousand people who are mailing in there votes. We're going to PISS OFF TRUMP ROYAL LOL. I can't wait to see what he now with him. And best thing is it's called mail in voting. But we don't really have to mail it in.
I‚Äôd eat a dogshit sandwich if it meant Trump was gone tomorrow
Please give this diease to that child molester trump
Trump is a disgrace
Trump‚Äôs selfish policies,are helping Texans to die.
You of course,are referring to the Trump virus.
Yeah, You Donald Trump, are a joke.
I love when Big Gretch posts, she brings out the Trump supportersü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Republican Jesus,has granted Trump and friends,special powers,to override,the constitution.
The emoluments clause,doesn‚Äôt apply to Trump.
Trump's folly
Trump is winning over the ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù vote.
Trump economy failure. Sad. Trump pandemic failure. 150,000 Americans have died. Heartbreaking. Trump continues divisive &amp; racial rhetoric, meant to keep us divided. Pathetic. #TrumpFamilyGrifters #PackYourBags #YouHaveToGoNow
One day you'll be embarrassed to admit that you swallowed every line, every talking point from known grifter and con man Donald Trump.
It would be interesting to see his medical records and treatment from the hospital. Maybe he was given Trump's wonder drug.
DO NOT MISS THIS STORY!!! Major NEW Trump Bank &amp; Tax Fraud Uncovered in ...  via
Democrat governors killed half those people in nursing homes and trump was called a racist when he blocked China travel,  but yeah,  it's all his fault. The entire government is at fault,  both sides are despicable
Ahh yes, more reason for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdelay distraction,‚Äù looks like a cavalcade of bad news is hitting today.   Cain‚Äôs passing, the GDP report and now Flynn‚Äôs case being heard by the full panel, not a good news day for big Donny.
If you really care about reacting to COVID, you wouldn‚Äôt provoke trump in to being defensive about the economy
So of all the fools following trump, the black fool died first? Interesting ü§î
Why? I always wonder about those who continue to support trump. #TrumpLetPutinKillOurTroops #TrumpIsARacist #AreYouARacist
Really getting tired of Trump distracting us from his horror show of an administration with even more impeachable offenses.
If at this point you still support trump, there's no hope for your smooth brain.
Gtfoh if your tweeting PresidentPelosi. Pelosi has done nothing to stop Trump she has only enabled him and the Republicant party.
Wish I could be reassured about the things Trump ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù but somehow always gets away with after doing them.
This is clearly a power play by Trump. We could hold an election, but he refuses to even try
Out and out cowards of the highest degree. Tell Trump to fuck off or resign.
Trump‚Äôs been calling them fake news so long they started believing it themselves. It‚Äôs battered wife syndrome.
Herman Cain died after contracting the virus from the trump rally in Tulsa. Man spoke on stage a day after Juneteenth. God don‚Äôt like ugly.
Trump has the media on his side.He would never have won the nomination in 2016 without it.
Whitmer Puts Trump On Blast Over Election Comments
I'm awaiting the day I wake up and not find myself in Trump's gaslighting blender.
Trump when are you going to get it!!!!!! You really think that the majority of Americans are Soto vote for you. after you have done nothing during the pandemic the protesting especially after you down playing the virus and not listening to what the people are
Makes you wonder if Trump could be charged with manslaughter.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He will receive a much more heartfelt tweet from Trump than John Lewis did.
‚ÄòHe should be immediately impeached‚Äô: Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòdangerously authoritarian‚Äô suggestion of election delay sets off alarm bells
Donald Trump in the next week or so: "Since everybody hates me and doesn't want to postpone the election I'm going to deploy my Federal goon squad to *insert majority black city here* to make sure elections go SUPER GOOD. FRAUD!"
Gov. Whitmer blasts President Trump over suggestion to delay election  via
Trump may be a mere proto-fascist, but he's part of the unfortunate nationalist trend that's gaining mass appeal. I think it's safe to say Poland and Hungary have definitely descended all the way to fascism.
True.  The counterpoint to the "hidden Trump voter" would be that lots of people in 2016 had bought the con and for *some damn reason couldn't see the coming shitstorm.  My neighbor across the street displayed a Trump sign in 16.  It's not there this year.
Every1 show up to the protest set for Friday&amp;Saturday. We need a MASSIVE amount of people to show up. The Feds are coming to OUR CITY apparently. If you aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs going on in Portland well buckle the fuck up, bc ur precious President Trump is starting a god damn war.
That's why President Donald Trump has been such a breath of fresh air, in my opinion. He has been going on the offensive since he was a Presidential candidate &amp; has not stopped. He is now benchmark by which I judge any Republican politician. Do they fight? No? Then forget them.
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
I'm awaiting the day I wake up and don't find myself in Trump's gaslighting blender.
Each day I wake up in a blender of Donald Trump's gaslighting spin. I look forward to the day I wake up to a normality.
I agree with you,  but I also think Trump is more damaging to himself than any Dem ever could.  Delaying the election is an absolute no-no, dictator move.  It's been telegraphed for months that he'd try that as well
So much confusion right now. Pray for the Spirit of Truth to sweep across America and spread throughout the world. #Trump2020 #GodWins #GodBlessAmerica #COVID19 #quoteoftheday #AmericasFrontlineDoctors #love #JesusSaves #Rosary #Peace #MusicIsLife #Trump #USA
You think the GOP care?   and their gaggle of Trump shills are so corrupt to where they will absolutely not care about the president wanting to move an election their party is allegedly losing. The stench of corruption travels a long way from DC to MI.
His distractions skirt the line of authoritarian far too often and we‚Äôve yet to see any significant pushback from Republicans.  How many impeachable distractions has Trump had?
I actually think he's got a point abt hidden voters:  lots of Trump cultists might want to answer Biden in polls to skew data, others know that they're racist and are ashamed to admit it with acknowledging their admiration of DT
Trump wants all the kids in school but he is trying to find a way to cancel the election because ‚Äòsafety‚Äô. #Hypocrite #TrumpIsATraitor
Trump racism continues. Do you support trump? You must be OK with racism. #TrumpIsARacist #AreYouARacist #Shame
Instead of working overtime to help ensure that all eligible citizens can vote, trump is already trying to void the November election results. Such a scared, pathetic person. #TrumpIsATraitor #VoteHimOut2020
Look at this sissy ass bitch Donald Trump.Crying about a Barbie  a nice little sissy bitch daddy,can will send a secret agent to buy you one.
Passing bills in the House, many of which will never clear the Senate so long as it's Republican controlled and impeaching Trump.  What was Trump doing?  Oh yeah ignoring his PDBs
I want Trump‚Äôs secret police to forcibly remove these people when we‚Äôre all allowed to attend games again.
Donald Trump just tweeted that he wants to delay the election. Lord help.
GDP shrank by 32.9% last quarter.  doesn‚Äôt want to lead, leaving the Coronavirus response to the governors. I‚Äôd argue that if the response had been federalized and uniform, we‚Äôd be in a much better position. However, this way Trump has his scapegoats!
Has anything Trump has done been legal?!?!?
Yes. Just reported another of Trump's false &amp; misleading mail-in election Tweets. It's beyond rhetoric. It's completely FALSE info!! It's my RIGHT to mail-in vote &amp; I won't stand for anything else! Hes also trying to slow/shut down USPS deliveries. Criminal Twitter acctüôÑüëçüèº.
Is it fair to assume you're talking about Donald Trump and not former President Obama.
America, do NOT let #Trump take away your #MailInBallot right as a Citizen of this Country.
Dr. Fauci simply has to get up in the morning and brush his teeth to look more competent than Trump.  That girl is a ditz!

Oh gosh, if you‚Äôre poor and voting for someone who wants to keep you out of certain neighborhoods, you are a special kind of stupid. Trump is not trying to help you.  Lol

How many times do you think he voted for Trump? 100?

I have but 1 protest vote for trump i can make.  Won‚Äôt be volunteering to drive shut ins to the polls this year.
He's scared. Trump is afraid of Putin.
Terrific and disturbing interview. A must-watch. ‚ÄúThe 'Axios on HBO' Trump interview picks up where Chris Wallace's ends‚Äù #BountiesForKillingUSTroops
Absolutely! We need a nationwide simultaneous response rather than a sporadic one. This is why the Trump's feckless leadership is an issue.
Not New Tone Trump!
An exhaustiveoral Trump justmade
All of it. It's called a dog whistle but trump uses a blow horn. He just assumes all white people are racist like him.
LOL. It is too complicated to discuss by tweet. So that means discussion over, right donald? Trump is pathetic. Just resign already. Maybe  can salvage a minuscule shred of dignity in the short time remaining.
#HeelsUpHarris would be a good choice for a certain Trump LANDSLIDE. Actually, it doesn't make much difference, the top of the ticket has mental disabilities
Instead of helping, trump is doing everything he can to suppress voting. What kind of president doesn‚Äôt want all Americans to vote? I guess the kind of president who doesn‚Äôt want to see the actual number by which he loses. #TrumpTraitor
I know. I couldn't believe it when I heard that Trump was sending them here to Detroit. Especially when all the protests we had weren't violent. I heard its because of all the shootings. So now we'll have double of the shootings with these guys.

George Soros spends millions of dollars to take down America.  Without Trump you take away Freedom and the people will become sheep, devoured by wolves.    Vote:  2020 - 2022 REPUBLICAN
That's a dangerous assumption. Good and decent people cannot conceive the diabolical methods in which someone like Trump, a man with no morals and no conscience, can come up with to game the system to his advantage. When it comes to how low he can and will go, there is no bottom.
All Trump supporters know is poop their pants, make bad choices, and eat mac n cheese with pistol.

It is to Trump.
Just because Trump hates Barack Obama. And I'm right about this. Trump does hate Obama just by what he's doing with all the things Obama did when he was in office. Trump is repealing everything. That's so he can have all the White people hate all the Black people like he does.
Putin put a bounty on our troops and trump did nothing. Trump allowed Putin to kill our troops. No action taken. #TrumpIsATraitor

Too bad trump doesn‚Äôt want people who need low income housing to live in the suburbs. Trump is a racist. All who remain silent &amp; support him must also be racist. #Shame
Hey Tim, what do you say about trump‚Äôs openly racist tweet saying he is saving the suburbanites with their suburban lifestyle dream from the scourge of low income housing? How can you continue to support this racist president? #HowDoYouSleepAtNight #Shame
Exactly how I‚Äôm looking at it. Either way we all lose. May as well be trump in response to this shitty nomination.
Trump does not like to suffer,inconvenience.

Trump is Making Russia Great Again.
I like how he went to the office to give em all a hug and words of inspiration. I wonder which one of his staff got the job of taking care of Trump's ball sack while screwy Louis Goober is in quarentine.
Progressives are not slaves to the DNC.  All the web pages and comments in the world will make a difference. I lived through four years of trump four more will pass in aprox 1461 days. No big deal to me.
People like this make me üòÇ.   Trump has nothing to do with these vaccines except he happens to be President at this time.   And it‚Äôs thoroughly disrespectful to scientists like  Fauci, etc. who put their everything into these vaccines to ‚Äî literally ‚Äî save them world
No it was President Trump‚Äôs fault, he failed to act when he was told on January 8 that it was coming by the CDC he did nothing until March 2 months worth of that do nothing trump

How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.
Love the side view. Reminds me of the failed #Trump Steak company that went bankrupt.   You know these steaks.
As a matter of fact these greedy rich people crawl through tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of income tax and cry broke. How can Trump who says he doesn't pay income tax handle tax revenues from the middle class and funnel it to the rich through fake businesses.
I promise you, We will boycott paying federal taxes. I sware...If they continue to misappropriate our tax dollars to subsidize rich people aka phony small businesses, we the middle class tax payers that pay the most taxes will stop paying fed taxes. Heck Trump doesn't.
So just curious, exactly how much is the government paying Erik Prince and his Blackwater thugs that are now part of the Trump Secret Police.
When questioned about Dr Immanuel.Donald Trump ducked and ran.
They've litterally been warning about the next pandemic for like 20 years or so but nobody could've predicted it. I've been saying for decades that trump is a "nobody".
WTF is honorable about Trump?? The man has no morals. Every nasty thing he had said and done it's a sin, per your Bible.
Yes Captain, your correct, sorry. The mean. Trump.... we are so sorry, the Crown was right, we were wrong, please take us back, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
CNN ‚Äúthe right arm for slo Joe‚Äù has 80% of its programming devoted to the virus. They think it hurts Trump. It makes them look like an inept news organization. So what else is new!

Creepy Donald Trump,is just a Trojan horse,for foreign governments who place bounties upon the lives of US soldiers.
The problem wasn't him closing the border. The problem was him selectively closing the border. Most of us feel the border should have been shut down completely. You can try to spend Trump's failed response back to the liberal-left. It just won't work. He failed to respond.
By ‚Äúbureaucratic barriers‚Äù she means adepquerte testing and trial period. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if the vaccine he sells you is gonna work, he just wants to make sure that it sells before the election so he can say he saved COVID smh.
If you truly feel that Donald Trump cares about any citizen in this country, other than himself, select family members, or those that kiss his ass on a daily basis, then you need to reevaluate your thought process.  If they truly cared, he would have never let this pandemic grow.

Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.

Since there can't possibly be any truth there.  It must be what Putin and tRump discussed on that last phone call.  I guess Russia is either invading Germany or just threatening and extorting Germany.  What Putin wants tRump gives.
A few less tRump voters by November.
Most likely result is far right extremists starting riots on November 3.  Which is tRump's insurrection.
This is f-ed up Just because he was a Black Man that supported President Trump This is disgusting its sad and we need to continue the fight to put Trump back into office I think the Democrats continue to support EVERYTHING and EVERYBODY, they should NEVER regain power. Horrible!
Yes tRump's new post master general is trying to make it impossible for the Post Office to do its job.  Imagine having a boss that hates you and all that you do.  That is all of tRump's cabinet, every appointment.  tRump wants to destroy democracy in the US.

Putin asked tRump to move troops, so he can invade Germany when we are having riots due to tRump saying that the election was bogus and he is president for life. Because Putin making his own gambit for president for life. They pretty much already gave it to him. Putin needs cash?
Trump is a desperate fool who knows he will lose November 3rd.
RIP: But if Trump wore a mask Cain would've wore a mask... JS.
He doesn't think a delay will help anything BUT his argument that the result was not legitimate.  IF the election were changed to November 4, He will say his voters al went November 3.  It would cost a lot of money, take more time, and tRump will still lose.  Imagine the riots.
Shows that they do not believe in law and order.  Not only do they not care about crime. (Their jobs.)  They had have, legal binding contracts, which they are breaking.  But their hero tRump does the same.  The right is wrong, they always resort to violence to get their way.
And for all in the media who are asking is President Trump feeding his base red meat?  No genius‚Äô, he‚Äôs trolling the left.
Can you imagine being one of tRump's GOP co-conspirators? Whenever tRump utters or tweets one of these ignorant and irresponsible quotes you have about eight hours to craft a response that: A) suggests that once again he is being taken out of context and B) confirms your loyalty.

Because we f'n hate him.  There are a few out there with big mouths, but they are way short of the majority.  Trump loses Michigan.
tRump is not going to be happy with James Deir.  Me, I'm delighted. Thank you for seeing the limits of your job!
If tRump actually had real money I would suggest he is paying Putin to pay the bounties.  But we know tRump is poor.  We also know that is a one way relationship. Putin is master and tRump is lap dog.  When tRump says we are not innocent he means that he is making us worse.
EXCELLENT TO HAVE THEM ON TRUMP'S SIDE!
Why won't tRump pay respects to John Lewis?  Perhaps he was one of the people beating him with clubs.
While it is tempting, I will keep my soul.  Just curious. Do only mean political campaigns? Or do you want to start assassinations? That has always been a far right tactic. Jim Crow was far right tactic. Slavery was far right.  Look at how far outside the law tRump steps.
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar

Trump ‚Äòowes us an apology.‚Äô Chinese scientist at the center of COVID-19 origin theories speaks out
Yes because trump is so dam smart right. He doesn‚Äôt even know what an elephant looks like!
The right does that too.  Why would Trump be against mail-in ballots in the first place? The army does just fine with it and mail-in ballots greatly improves voter turnout. Even the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù will be able to vote.
First couple years of tRump, market ignored him.  Last year he started scaring investors. Yes the Fed intervened. Yes the overall market is up, but this is the most erratic market ever, for quite some time now. Big drops punctuate it.  2 of the biggest drops ever were this year.
Yes, because he‚Äôs smart and won‚Äôt cause a side show. We are actually lucky that Trump is incompetent
tRump is turning the US into a shithole country!
That was an admission that tRump asked Putin to do it.
In Michigan there are no bashful Trump supporters like the Republicans like to think. They're a bunch of Trump flag waving morons! But it's nowhere near the support he had last year. This is a hard working union state that made a big mistake it will correct this year. BIDEN 2020!
Trump threatened to not accept the results. If he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs just as bad as the Dems who didn‚Äôt. Also, there‚Äôs a difference between not liking something and not believing it.
That might happen. But Trump appears to already be doing the same.

To be fair, some democrats have done the same, which has really marred the reputation of Dems everywhere. You‚Äôre right though. Trump would be disrespecting the constituitional federal republic and the very idea of the USA as a whole if he attempted that.
It‚Äôs the electoral college that did that. I don‚Äôt think Trump is even the first President to pull that off. (I‚Äôm not interested in debates over the efficacy of the electoral college. I‚Äôm not educated enough in the matter and it‚Äôs very confusing.)
If Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and tries to stay in office, he‚Äôd be acting like a dictator. Be very afraid of anyone who does not respect election results. (And yes, I know that goes both ways. If Trump is voted in, I‚Äôll respect that, and I‚Äôd hope Biden

turn off the tv, read a book. climate change is real. the 33% drop in GDP is real and is partly due to not taking covid seriously. the earth is not flat. mail fraud is nowhere near trump makes out to try and cheat the next election. jeffrey epstein didn't kill himself.
Um, No! We vote on Nov 3   McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election

Why a former Michigan GOP leader joined disillusioned Republicans against Trump
It adds up perfectly if you remember that Democrats fix elections.   Can you imagine Trump doing any live video and not having anybody except the media tuning in?  Because that's what this audience is. Right wing people trying to catch the senility goof of the day.
I can't imagine what will happen if another seat was to become vacant before the next term begins.    I have to wonder if Trump could get enough votes in the Senate.  ROmney, Murkowsky...lots of squishes.

Did President Trump hurt himself when he Tweeted the election should be delayed?
Speaking of falsifying stories,  was there an outbreak connected to the Trump rally?  I can't seem to find the documentation supporting that allegation.
Some Republicans and Democrats are saying that President Trump made a big mistake this morning when he tweeted a suggestion the November election be delayed. What's your take?
Admittedly, the left is not and has never been fair with Trump.   But what I think Im saying is that other leaders (in other countries) have done it differently than Trump and there haven't been so many cases in those places.  Which to me says what they did was better.

Stop shaming people for considering third party candidates.  That's not how freedom works.  It's not a vote for Biden. It's not a vote for Trump.  That's not how voting works.  Do your research. Select the best candidate. Leave other people alone. And then vote.
when did trump rape anybody? when did he make a racist remark? a sexist remark? im not saying i support the guy but ive never heard him make any remark to backup anything you just said.
Let's say we actually had the institutional power to do this. 2 people in politics implicated in epsteins case are Donald Trump and Bill Clinton... Not exactly people we'd give a shit about protecting.

I've been wondering about this too. My thinking for quite a while has been that, so long as Trump didn't have command of an armed force with personal loyalty to him he would be obliged to exit at election time peacefully. This ad hoc mixed unit looks like he's trying to build one
She moved to more progressive policy, but ran on not being Trump. It happened. Think about why you don't remember that. Biden is winning now because of the state of things. He has to seal the deal by running on policy. Policy that is popular around the country.
That's not the point. If you want people to show up, you have to give them a reason. "returning to normal" isn't enough, because for a lot of people, normal under Obama was still really bad because there was no recovery for them after 2008. This problem is bigger than Trump.

Only the democrats could reject a progressive pharmaceutical bill and have Trump announce it as an executive order months later. Losers.

Trump RESIGNED! ü§£ü§£
Yeah but trump was boys with epstein too, so why arent you demonizing trump as well? Do you not care if it doesnt help push your politcal agenda?
Question: When I vote for Green Party in November, if Biden wins the election, will my vote be considered a vote for Biden or will it still be a vote for Trump?  Curious at how this vote-shaming thing works in case I need to use it in the future.
Trump is now so powerful....he control the weather !!!
Amazing how the left can pivot from "Trump's gonna kill your son in a useless war!"  to "Trump abandoned the Kurds when he pulled the troops out!" without even pausing.  They are practically a different species.
I‚Äôm all for shitting on Trump but I am not down for shitting on a dead person
Not a fan of trump or Biden but I bet harambe will have gotten more votes in 2016 than Kanye will in November

- Hillary started a war in Libya, and wanted to send US troops to that theater as well as Syria.  What wars has Trump started?  Are you lobbying the Democrats to help bring troops home from Afghanistan?  Why not?
LIke Hillary wouldn't have sent him to Libya or Syria or Russia?    I am not a Trump fan, but you're delusional if you think that Trump is a bigger war monger than any Democrat of your lifetime.

Can you explain your reasoning? Biden's not in charge of anything, so I don't understand why school closure would be a negative for him.  Trump is in charge of the pandemic response. This is his baby.
Deblasio was telling everyone to fill the subways and streets near the end of March. üòÇ Trump shut down travel from EU before that.
Trump was not pushing viruses in blue states.  They did that all by themselves.
Actually, war is one of the main reasons I even bother voting any more.  Trump is far less hawkish than Hillary was.    What she and Obama did in Libya is horrific.  That's what ya'll should have been protesting.

Obama also gave us many Mc Jobs and federal employees. Lost so much manufacturing. Also, Trump ended NAFTA and that will only help. Obama gave our jobs away.

She used to work for the Feds according to her profile. I think trump is campaigning on Law and Order and that‚Äôs the only reason we see Border patrol policing the streets. I guess folks illegally crossing the border aren‚Äôt as dangerous as he has been saying all this time...

New Hall of Presidents with Donald Trump - FULL SHOW  via  Great watch ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The election will be delayed because of the attacks on the federal buildings.  I almost wonder if Trump owns BLM and Antifa.  If he does, I support it.  It's brilliant.
To expand on this. One of their main talking points now is if trump loses they swear we are going to become a nation of socialists. Every one of these mother fuckers likely plans on social security for retirement, used PPP, cashed the stimulus check and will cash any that follow.
And then my old youth pastor makes a post calling for revival with a Trump speech accompanying it...and I wonder how we can move forward with thinking like that...
What are you saying?  Dems have the answers but are not going to present them until January?  To make Trump look bad?
No matter what happens, Trump will not leave the White House. Americans will support that.
Trump is horrible at the economy. Just awful.
Morons or traitors. There is no room left for his base other than those two categories.  Have lost my relationship with my father over this situation. Most of my extended family as well. Lots of trump supporters in WY unfortunately. Fuck em all at this point.
If Trump moves election day, we should all agree with the president.  This is an emergency.
I will support Trump in whatever decision he makes.

Tom Norton talks about his 'Pro Life, Pro Trump' stance
Obama and Biden handed trump the record high stock market and record low unemployment!   Check the facts!   Obama felt with viruses too but he listened to the experts and did the right thing.   trump created the problems here and still refuses to try to fix it.   He‚Äôs incompetent
TRUMP 2020

Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy talking with Chris Como. What a trump cult ignorant a$$hole.
Strong words from a informed Trump supporter about delaying the election.
trump skated along on the work Obama and Biden did.  What has he done to react and correct the problem? Tell Americans to buckle down and fight this virus together to help the economy?  Nope! He had time to prepare prepare but called it a hoax.   He‚Äôs incompetent and ignorant!
Trump campaign on target for when voters head to the polls on November 3, 2021
Yes. Because he refused to wear a mask at Trump's rally in Tulsa, or anywhere else. But I mean, he did sign the rally waiver stating Trump wouldn't get blamed if he caught COVID, so I suppose he only has himself to blame eh
I like Amoebas and can‚Äôt idly stand by whilst you besmirch their intelligence.    is just a Trump drone.
If things get worse, I think it's likely that he resigns citing some "health concerns" then turns OANN into Trump TV and spend every day between now and the day he dies claiming he would have won if he'd stayed in office.

She‚Äôs gonna be oranger than Trump
I supported Trump in 2016. I voted for him, but I‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt be making the same mistake in 2020. This man does not act presidential at all. He‚Äôs running our country like a reality TV show. But the problem I have is him not acting presidential, and our poor economy.
Or, we should just have Trump and Biden stop campaigning and spend the rest of the time hearing what 3rd Party and Independent candidates have to say.
Look Kamala is trying to be funnyü§£ü§£ Trump is üíØ% going to be re-elected.
I blame Donald Trump's Presidency on those "annoying orange" videos that circulated for years.  It desensitized us.

You need to educate yourself China knew of it in November and continued let people to fly to America without telling anyone until TRUMP stopped travel....TO SAVE LIVES. Another ignorant person spouting off without knowing anything.
He was a nasty trump supporter.  He didn‚Äôt care about his employees and paid them low wages, he didn‚Äôt care about the American people and he was stupid enough to think he didn‚Äôt need to wear a mask.... so i couldn‚Äôt care less that he died.....GOOD RIDDANCE.
DemoRat leaders are the main ones responsible for deaths mainly Cuomo Trump sent a ship to help them but no had to send them to a nursing home to kill everyone.. can't have anything positive toward TRUMP..rather have deaths.
TRUMP has nothing to do with Coronavirus deaths but hes responsible for the hate in your heart.
Oh bullshit. You lost control of Trump Virus as soon as it hit our shores.
They have to certify results by a certain deadline. I remember from 2000. Trump won‚Äôt be wish washy.
You know how I know that Putin is finished with Trump?   Because Charles Koch and the Federalist Society want him impeached   CC :
Imagine literally dying because you flew to Oklahoma to watch Donald Trump brag for an hour about being able to walk down a ramp and drink water with one hand
Let‚Äôs NEVER forget what trump has cost us. EVER!
100% fits the predictions of the worst possible outcomes under Trump. The signs were there before he was ever elected. A lot of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people said it was hyperbole &amp; those people need to be outright dismissed when they say stupid shit like Trump shouldn‚Äôt be taken literally.
So the king of litigation has threatened to litigate the election for years. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when conservatives hated constant litigation. I guess Nunes is too young to remember and trump really isn‚Äôt a conservative so...

I didn't either, and that's why I wished people would have taken me seriously when I said Trump. Is. A. Fascist.
All internal polls, and I work on them, show a massive Trump landslide.  The media is lying to you.  They know he will win that is why they are pulling out all the stops.
Perhaps once he leaves office in January, prosecutors in #Tulsa should consider charging  with involuntary manslaughter, since  probably contracted #COVID19 at Trump's ludicrous campaign event.

It's 2016 all over again. That's why Trump can't win.  I'm so glad Hillary has been president these four years.
Trump basically tells U. S. Americans your 1st Amendment is no longer. Calls protesters pro-anarchists, ppl that hate our country, beehive of terrorists, to be "cleared out" or he's sending in the National Guard (and others) to do it.  aka : Trump declares war on 1st Amendment.
In this instance, Immurement for Trump seems appropriate.

Here‚Äôs what I predict:  The Maxwell documents will tie Trump to Epstein/Maxwell and Mogilevich.  Deutsche Bank.   The money.   His calls to Putin, the bounties, and Volume 5 will show he‚Äôs working for Russia.    He will be forced to resign.
Shit for brains doesn‚Äôt even want to be re-elected. He just wants to lay the grounds to say he really didn‚Äôt lose. He won‚Äôt fight to stay. He‚Äôs too lazy. This is just another distraction. He wants to build trump tower Moscow and golf.
‚ÄúThe interpersonal traits include glibness, superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying and manipulation of others. The affective traits include a lack of remorse and/or guilt, shallow affect, lack of empathy and failure to accept responsibility.‚Äù  Trump is a psychopath.

Well. I had considered voting for him, but he just ran a new ad and he‚Äôs firmly aligning with Trump (which I‚Äôm sure is so he can get $$$, so he‚Äôs not getting my vote.
So weeks after the house passed a bill to fund schools, pay citizens another stimulus, trump is saying his administration wants it but dems dont
Just a heads up, sir....I've heard that the expected mail in date should be changed to Oct 14th due to increased amount of mail and the expected forced slow down by trump's new postmaster general.
Then why are running? You stand with trump 2000%, you have zero plans and a disgraceful person for standing with white supremacist and Russians paying for dead soliders.  Do the right thing and drop out now. Michigan doesn't want you or trump.

I don‚Äôt think she has sex dirt on Trump.   I think she has evidence that he‚Äôs been working for Semion Mogilevich.
Trump's doesn't support any of that. He could not care less about you or me. He wants to lower taxes on businesses to help himself, host official events at his properties to make money, and ignore rulings by numerous federal judges because he thinks he's above the law.
As usual you guys will twist any story to make it anti-Trump. Liz can take care of herself. So can those other men. You‚Äôre grasping.

Of course he supports the protests!  Everyone should!  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you agree with the protest or not, we have the right per the 1st!   We‚Äôre done with the racism or trump and his MAGAts.   Even republicans are against trump!   #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica

They can‚Äôt.    The trump campaign made them all sign a waiver saying they couldn‚Äôt be held responsible if they got covid.    Cain is just as responsible for his death as trump is.
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?
Stop lying.   He beat cancer back in 2006.   He died from covid and got it because of trump and the rally he had to have with no safety protocols enforced.   150,000 + people have died from #trumpvirus and this one is the only one he has shown any sorrow over.   Trump owns it all
His death was preventable.   The other 150,000+ deaths were too. trump called it a hoax, he didn‚Äôt act to protect us, he made wearing a mask political, he chose to hold a rally even after being warned it was dangerous.   #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K trump still won‚Äôt help us!

THROUGHOUT His WHOLE LIFE when facing certain defeat #Trump‚Äôs knee-jerk response has been to find a way to CHEAT, why is anyone surprised that #Trump wants to find a way to cheat, EVEN IF IT MEANS THROWING AWAY THE  CONSTITUTION! Americans need to turn the bumb out. #VoteBlue
That‚Äôs a lie spread by trump!   Look at Europe‚Äôs death rate vs the US.    Europe has a bigger population but has beaten the virus and is almost totally open.   Meanwhile, cases in the US are still beating records of new cases and deaths every single day with no end in sight.
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Yeah, he was super good at weaponizing the intelligence community and letting them spy on Trump and try to set up him and his campaign people for crimes they didn‚Äôt commit. Super good, I tell ya.
But see, if the Trump-appointed Postmaster General weren't slowing down the mail (for example, I love 12 miles from my city clerk but it took my ballot 2 weeks to get to me), there wouldn't BE boxes of uncounted ballots, and we wouldn't need to push back the election. Js
DISTRACTION ALERT üö®   Trump can‚Äôt delay the election.  Congress has that power.   I heard Mitch on the radio today saying the election WILL happen.    He didn‚Äôt say a word about mail in votes or voter fraud.   I‚Äôm telling you,  Mitch is finished with Trump.
Has trump even once shown any sympathy for the other 150,000 people he killed with the #trumpvirus?   Nope?    We all feel sympathy but all of these people dying didn‚Äôt have to happen.    He still could do something to stop people from dying but he won‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt care!
I don't wish death on anyone who has/had COVID-19, including Republicans. With that being said, Donald Trump can go to hell for his role in their death.
‚ÄúTrumpers don‚Äôt follow logic. They follow Trump.‚Äù Truer words have never been spoken, my friend.
Why is it I understand what Trump is doing with his tweets and you don‚Äôt, Bill?
In the beginning they didn‚Äôt  know everything about the virus and PPE was in short supply. Shortly after that all medical experts said to wear masks to stop the spread.   It had been well reported and trump knew it! He called it a hoax, he ignored the warnings #trumpvirus
It‚Äôs not Biden or Obama‚Äôs responsibility to do wither of those things.   They had been out of office for over 3 years.    trump is the one responsible!  All of this happened in his presidency.   He called it a hoax and made a virus political, not them! #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
I don‚Äôt need to even watch. Trump can pass cognitive tests. Biden cannot. No debate. And for you to vote despite knowing that shows you do not have the ability to put your personal opinion of trump aside
He did not!   Why are you lying?  He had beaten cancer but was admitted to the hospital with covid shortly after attending trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally with no mask.
1 BILLION votes cast and there have been 37 cases of election fraud. I don't think its a problem.   This is interesting. What do you make of it?
Now do Trump!!

also 'especially me'  The Trump Holy Trinity - Me, Myself and I
Regardless of where he got it, he infected others because he didn‚Äôt believe it was real.    trump and his mishandling of the virus and ignoring safety measures led to his death.   150,000+ American lives lost thanks to #trumpvirus
Same debacle w/  - What is happening to #JulianAssange is disgusting &amp; makes me ?? if #Trump is a swamp monster. A man guilty of nothing but revealing truth of #Corruption to #ThePeople has spent 450+ days in prison (most in solitary). Are we ruled by criminals?

That was the fault of CV19 and the lockdowns, not Trump. Nice try.
It's a social contact issue, especially indoors. The fact you even lump the 2 together is disturbing. Whitmer has at least acted in good faith. Trump only cares about re-election. He could give a damn about the public's well being, clearly.

Trump has drawn a line in the sand. It's his "us against them" mentality. John Lewis, an icon, a true leader and a role model for millions of Americans was not part of trump's "us". He wants American against American. Division makes us weaker. Putin must be proud.
Damn right I support Trump ! Who else ? Joe? Nobody has seen joe for weeks! He doesn‚Äôt do live interviews, no live appearances where he will answer questions. The guys a mess and the left is trying to elect a ‚Äúweekend at Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äú candidate that‚Äôs shit nuts!

What I find most frightening is that whether or not this scenario is likely, few doubt Trump would be willing try such a prank. And his enablers would be all in.

As a society we need to have the will to solve this voting problem (if there is a problem to be solved).   We don't delay an election because of a national crisis. Delaying the election WOULD BE a national crisis for our democracy.
How about you actually stand by these principales and stand against Trump?  150k dead, 32% drop in GDP, constant lies and a blatant refusal to do what needs to be done.
Who cares.  Stop giving them showtime.  Today is not their day to distract from Rep. John Lewis.  I'm ready to fight even harder.  I will not let him down.  Trump and his minions are going down!
I'm voting him out of there.  I'm not taking any bs from people attacking mail in voting or any misinformation. Especially today. Rep. John Lewis didn't fight his whole life (as well as numerous Americans) for an imbecile like Trump and his goons to destroy our democracy.
Your beloved trump would probably try to deport her
Trump is the joke?? Biden can‚Äôt even speak a real sentence. You‚Äôre dismissed, child
Why a former Michigan GOP leader joined disillusioned Republicans against Trump
If you think Trump can‚Äôt cancel the election because he doesn‚Äôt have the legal authority to do so, you may also be surprised to learn that cops are not actually legally allowed to murder people

REMEMBER THIS from 2017?: Donald Trump Will Resign and It Will Happen 'Suddenly,' Predicts Keith Olbermann  By Jason Le Miere On 8/23/17 at 1:37 PM EDT
The list of "things Trump is doing that would've outraged Republicans if Obama did it" is very long at this point. This goes near the top of the list if only because Obama actually did it with the auto bailout and Republicans are on record being outraged over it.
So trump killed 140,000 people. Really? üòÇ. He doesn‚Äôt listen to advisors y‚Äôall blast him. He listens to them, shit goes sideways, y‚Äôall blast him

I wonder what it‚Äôs gonna take for Trump supporters to realize he‚Äôs racist ü•¥
Things not to delay: the election, Trump's removal from office, and Trump's entry into a facility where he can take as many cognitive tests, get as many disinfectant injections, and tweet into the ether as much as he needs every day.
What hate? Look at Biden‚Äôs racist quotes that never gain traction from the media ...  trump done way more for black communities thru employment than Biden has ever done
Trump is un-American. He has done nothing but bad for our nation. It is patriotic to not support him.
He‚Äôs trying to distract from a great man‚Äôs funeral. F off trump.
Trump‚Äôs call to delay election is the opening act of a coup
Cain was hospitalized in Atlanta with the coronavirus on July 1, 10 days after he attended President Trump's indoor rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
If Trump wins, there will be no questioning of the integrity of mail-in ballots. That we can be sure.
. senators: "The election is not going to be delayed."
Trump 2020! Let‚Äôs clean out the swamp and KAG!
Trump can go to hell.  Challenging our democracy is non-negotiable!   We will run our as scheduled or you will see anarchy in the streets!
There will be so much whining, sniveling, and gnashing of teeth when all these powerful Republicans are sent packing because people decided TO VOTE! They will point their fingers at Trump when he loses, too, blaming him for not "helping" them enough.   Oh, he helped, alright.
But open the economy! At this point Trump isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs his enablers  and his far right evangelical base that does not believe in democracy.
Wyoming....Trump country!
How I see trump cult followers "Hi, I'm a Trump cultist, my favorite color is clear."
I thought all these people were leaving to Canada if Trump won the election 2016?
Seeing Trump shaking hands with incoming President Biden? Priceless. #WeWillVote
Trump ur concern about ur safety, but not ur base safety, why?  Herman Cain ran for president, a while back, in case some people do not know who he is. The 999 guy!!!
Nah. But there's the small matter of a pandemic that we're dealing with right now. You may have read about it. Prior to it, we had record low unemployment. To lay today's unemployment solely at the feet of Trump is being willfully ignorant.
Trump, do u feel any guilt??? By telling him not to wear a mask? U made sure u kepted far away from ur base, why?
#BernellTrammelsLifeMatters          What's going on that there aren't h ou ge segments of time dedicated to this man! Is he not black enough? Is it simply that he was a Pres Trump supporter? Hypocritical that's what you are

174 days until Inauguration day.  How much damage could Donald Trump do in 174 days?  [laughs nervously]  #TrumpIsNotWell
Superb conversation between Eleanor Wachtel and Masha Gessen. Trump, Putin, Russia, history, politics, power.
Now do Trump and this voter fraud business
trump killed him and 150,000+ more American citizens.   Dismissing and calling a virus a hoax while demonizing people for wearing masks.   Holding in person rallies without proper safety in an area where covid was raging.    Preventable deaths pushed by trump and republicans.
Trump starts promoting Dr Demon Sperm, then he decides to 'pull out" of Germany.  Coincidence? #DemonSperm #DemonSemen #pullout
The senate should remove him, if they cared one bit for this country they would do it!    trump will never resign but they have the power to stop him, they are all as bad as he is!
I disliked Trump as a person long before he ran for President. Even if we politically aligned I wouldn't have been able to vote for him because of the person he is.
Who could have predicted this?!?!1!2  Trump hires a huge donor ($1.2 mil) to run the USPS. First in decades with 0 USPS experience. Now service is being slowed severely, talk of shutting down post offices, all to help the president's reelection.
Trump is a Trojan horse for Putin.   He does everything Putin wants.   #traitortrump #TR45TOR
He doesn't really like that Trump tweets. I don't understand why. But I think that is part of it. He's just too literal.
He died because of trump.
Trump is simply doing this to force the hand of the Libs on working with him to end the pandemic. Heady play by trump.  Left is trying to drag this out as long as possible and inflate numbers to sway the American people away from voting for trump.
If trump delays voting I along with millions will protest in front of the White House like there was no tomorrow.  Voting delay will not be tolerated‚Äîwe need him outta there yesterday.
Trump has indicated he will not vacate the White House if he loses the election...maybe him and  can share bunk beds?! #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpMeltdown
Trump got 62% in Ottawa County, and by and large that's where we keep the Dutch.
Well trump is in quite a tizzy today. Calling for a delay in our election. Your silence hurts me.
Leave it to Trump to have everyone sign a waiver for that rally Cain attended.  Thanks so much, Pontius Pilate
Trump doesn‚Äôt give a single shit about Covid or the people it‚Äôs killing. But as soon as he sees it as an excuse to wrongfully extend his presidency he‚Äôs taking full advantage of it. I don‚Äôt get how his followers can be so ignorant, and how the GOP can be so corrupt to follow him.
Especially with trump supporters
Trump is just doing what he always does, and that's exposing the lefts hypocrisy. He just started a debate and a dialogue that I didn't see coming and I don't think they did either. We are ok brother.
It makes me sad to know the democrats will go to these lengths to destroy trump!! Those children need school to live.
Whitmer: Trump should focus on saving lives, not threatening to delay 2020 election
Today, Herman Cain dies from COVID contracted 2 weeks after attending Trump rally.  Today Trump unconstitutionally suggests delaying November election.  GOP everywhere in denial re COVID and Trump, all drinking the Trump KoolAid.  All #GOPBetrayedAmerica #RememberInNovember
Maybe you should focus on your state not on president Trump. Let him focus on national stuff! You need to be concerned about the millions of people struggling with anxiety and depression due to what you have done to our state!
Wait all the people from my hometown that still live with their parents are trump supporters
Trump said this to continue his goal of making people believe elections are rigged. This will deteriorate to: we don‚Äôt need elections, we just need me. I‚Äôm the only one you can trust. It‚Äôs an obvious dictatorship move.
He is simply saying he ‚Äúloves‚Äù all the people in the USA!  Obama was the WORST President in history!  That will be proven to you and your sheeple shortly! Trump is DRAINING THE SWAMPS... WORLDWIDE!  Wait and see.  But, you think what you want!
Why didn‚Äôt Trump give Herman Cain the #hydroxycholoroquine ? What a dick ü§£
NOPE NOPE AND NOPE!  The election will be November 3rd!      #Biden2020Landslide
Trump's body count gives him ownership of this virus. He caused this to become the crisis we are enduring and it will rage on while he is still in the white house.
This is a set up question. This is exactly what Trump wants them to say. They have learned NOTHING.
We all knew Trump would do everything he could to keep himself in office. Well, here it goes. He‚Äôs going to fight at every turn. #RemoveTrump #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Hm, had not thought of him wanting mail-in voting. I was going w/idea since Dems want no in person voting &amp; we are 'all gonna die' that Trump was trolling them. If so deadly, we must delay! So that Dems say, "Oh, no, we must have all polls open! People must be allowed to vote!"
Dictator? Trump is occupying oregon and new york with federal agents kidnapping peaceful protesters because what their protesting doesn't fit his agenda and she's the dictator? Yeah ok
Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies at 74 (from   He Literally Followed Trump To His Death.
The united police states of America. Trump's fascist dream coming true. Nov 3rd can't get here soon enough.  Hopefully we will still have an election.
Lol Trump wants to delay the presidential election in November but he‚Äôs also sending kids back to school now? Pure fucking evil
Comrade trump making Russia great again.
You have a good point. Trump and his enablers do know the science is right. They discredit science for their greedy cause. They are using fear to manipulate the cult. They are willing to sacrifice everyone to retain power.
The face I make when I realize a client is s Trump supporter.
I've been debating with people about mail in voting all day today.  Have I told you how much I hate Trump for all this misinformation and chaos he is creating in OUR country?  Time to speak up and let the truth be heard. I want to honor Rep. John Lewis by continuing to be heard!
The gop and trump do not care if the children die or become super spreaders. They are willing to sacrifice the children to win an election.
if trump doesnt leave the white house after he loses i will be in washington d.c.
Listen, #Trump, instead of complaining and whining for a #delay, how about you allocate some additional funding for the #USPS to pay for overtime? This is just a ploy. You don't care about democracy or our voting system. You're afraid of losing.
Trump is brilliant
Herman Cain died from the Trump Hoax Virus today. Condolences to all.üôè
Trump baited you idiots and you fell for it hook, line, and sinker.  HAHAHA
Trump can not delay the election by himself. Keep calm and repeat that to yourself, over and over. #VoteTrumpOut2020
Well there it is- going to a Trump rally can kill you.
Trump‚Äôs call to ‚Äòdelay‚Äô election more about politics than safety, Whitmer says
Trump calling for the election to be moved back! Absolutely love to see it!
Let's get one thing clear, I'm not voting FOR Biden in November, I'm voting AGAINST Trump, because he says shit like this that scares the hell out of me. He
On the morning that Herman Cain dies from COVID-19 and President Trump suggests delaying the election, the  criticizes  for shutting down bars to try and slow the spread.
"Who sat in the audience without a mask at Trump's Tulsa rally?" Really? That's how you're going to frame this? How about "self-made CEO and cancer survivor?" Kinda forgot that part, didn't you?
If Trump tweets that he got the shits from McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburgers , McDonald‚Äôs stock would plummet. Stop already.....
She‚Äôs not a moron. She‚Äôs would kill hundreds of thousands of people if that means keeping Trump in power. And she claims to be a Christian!
Alright twitter. You see Trump just walking down the street. Just him. What do you do?
Herman Cain survived colon cancer and liver cancer only to be killed by a Trump Rally.
#BREAKING: Herman Cain the former Presidential candidate, restaurateur and supporter of President Trump died this morning a month after being hospitalized in Atlanta with COVID-19.
Whitmer Puts Trump On Blast Over Election Comments
Imagine sacrificing your life to attend a Trump rally. Smh.
Just rhetoric here, since he can't do anything, but dangerous rhetoric.   Also, I worry a little we're in a boiling pot scenario here, where we've just became acclimated and Trump has turned up the heat.
Like I even give a damn what a Trump Loyalist has to say.  Anyone that RTs Charlie Kirk or Trumps medical advice shouldn't be talking about ignorance.
As if the past 3 years haven't been a giant indicator, but Trump calling for a delay in the 2020 election and not realizing his term expires in January regardless shows he has no idea how the government of the country he leads works...
I wish. They were federal employees, but teachers are locally employed. There should be something Trump can do to impact them.
I wondered why why we would antagonize our biggest creditor and one of our biggest customers. It seemed bonkers, because it is, but then...Trump. I no longer expect things to make sense.
Curious, not knowing "details" about elections, can a vote be denied if there is no "legal" address to be accounted for ? Maybe this is another tactic Trump and his R's are trying to use as voter suppression and letting rental relief funding expire. (????) ü§îü§îü§îü§î
Trump is anti-mask and acts like COVID-19 is just make-believe. Has a bunch of idiots believing their rights are infringed upon by wearing a mask. Liberals are terrified to go into public. Pretty obvious why he doesn't want mail-in ballots.
Can President Trump delay the election? No.
Today I received instructions from the Trump Campaign on how to request my "absentee" ballot in MI.  "Absentee ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege." DJT - process is IDENTICAL to getting a mail in ballot
NEW:  responds to President Trump's idea of delaying the election. "It‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans."
No, President Trump Cannot Delay The Election On His Own : NPR  No!
was gonna say something about how even conservatives should be pissed that Trump wants to delay the election but who am I kidding, none of the conservatives who would see my tweet are gonna be mad about it anyway
President Trump tweeted this morning that the November election should be delayed:
Democrats will let your grandmother die if it lets them score points off of Trump.
I started doing mail-in vote since 2016, when it was very apparent that that election was interferes with &amp; that‚Äôs how trump go in. No More!
Should the 2020 election be delayed? President Trump thinks so:
President Trump has called for the delay of the 2020 Presidential election.
Trump has been actively attacking democracy all along.  Let‚Äôs not all sound surprised when the consequences rake us in spite of all our long-tweeted frustrations.
Maybe if you actually handled the pandemic with professionalism and decency you wouldn't have to worry about voter fraud come this November Mr. Trump, but you botched it and here we are. #byefelicia
Yes, and he also sent it out on the day of Rep. John Lewis‚Äôs funeral; a solemn event that will be attended by three former presidents (but not der F√ºhrer). Trump‚Äôs insensitivity and senselessness knows no bottom.
The Trump admin is conducting a full on assault of the constitution wake the hell up. I feel like you're gonna be very whiny come November.
My Sis in law was called by a pollster, as soon as she said she's going to be voting for Trump, they hung up.
HEY MSNBC let's talk about the GDP, shall we?  You know, that 32.9% DROP.  That's why trump is trying to take everyone's attention elsewhere.
what a crap headline - "Trump, will no authority to do so, suggests..."
Are you aware that all power transfers to the new President the minute he/she is sworn in? The military WILL follow the Constitution as they will now have a new, LEGAL, CinC.  It might not be pretty but Trump WILL be removed from the WH.
Naturally, he floats the idea on the day of Rep. John Lewis‚Äôs funeral. Trump‚Äôs insensitivity and senselessness knows no bottom.
Trump has a call with Putin (who has extended his own rule how many times now?) and today posts this. #NotCoincidence #KnowHisIdols
Who would have guessed?
Maybe not but he WILL be escorted out when Biden is sworn in.  All power transfers and there are measures in place to assure that.  Trump will then be trespassing if he refuses to leave the WH. He'll be forcibly removed at that point.
President Trump floats idea of delaying the November election
Well it's official, Trump is actively trying to steal the election. Not even trying to hide his fascism anymore.
Just treating Trump Loyalists the way their leader does.  I'm a dick towards Trumpers.  Thoughts and Prayers
Great Lakes state. Michigan! Trump 2020!
Today is the day Donald Trump became president for longer.
President Trump, right now republicans aren‚Äôt doing their job! We‚Äôre waiting to hear about the agreement of the stimulus relief legislation . All we hear is infighting, and Americans are sick of this crap! Americans are suffering and the parties are fighting, what the hell?
To clarify - I‚Äôm not suggesting that we delay the election, just sharing how appalled I am at Trump‚Äôs suggestion
Dems are telling us it‚Äôs unsafe to vote, so that means we gotta delay. Trump will just have to stay in office longer until it‚Äôs ‚Äòsafe.‚Äô
-stop Donald Trump.
Of all the anti-Trump things to hang your hat on, unemployment is certainly not one.
Twitter should ban Trump. I'm sick of him spitballing racist dogwhistles and fascist lies about elections
Like hell we do, tRUMP is the biggest liar and conman around !
And that was before the #Trump tweet about potentially delaying the election!
So THIS is Trump's reason for no face mask.  He WANTS a pandemic so he can put the election off and stay in office!!!   IMPEACH THE MF NOW...AGAIN!
China is in control of Covid 19. Trump Virus on the other hand is totally out of control. You are worthless.
The tweet from President #Trump about potentially delaying the election is leading to a big risk-off move across the board - stocks at fresh lows, 10yr yields on track for a ALL-TIME record low close, #USD selling off, etc.  Ew.
Michigander here....Trump 2020. üá∫üá∏
Trump supporters be like, ‚ÄúLolol, Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt know what room he‚Äôs in!‚Äù Gonna really bum you out then that Trump is so incredibly incompetent, he‚Äôs gonna lose to a guy who doesn‚Äôt know what room he‚Äôs in.
Your talking about trump being the terrorist leader right? He‚Äôs the mother fucker that‚Äôs killing us! Open your eyes!
Oh please. Trump said it himself...lots of world leaders call to ask for his help fighting the Corona virus. Obviously, Putin is a slow learner and needs extra help. /s
Although I wish no harm on anybody, I'm not going to give my sympathies to people that ignore the experts and science during a pandemic. He had all the tools and knowledge to protect himself and others, but he chose not to do that. He chose Trump over country. He made his choice.
shock horror more GOP hypocrisy and it's from the 2000% behind Trump guy
Bro the shit Trump tweets is INSANE. Like nigga WTF üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump‚Äôs heel nearly coming out of his shoe due to how high the heel lifts are.
I can‚Äôt wait to see your face when Biden wins the election. Trump can‚Äôt even fill a small broke down arena, he certainly won‚Äôt secure enough votes to win the election. Perhaps he has a chance, but not with how he‚Äôs handled COVID. Sad day for the republicans.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Trump is anti-American; ergo, his supporters are anti-American.

She's just a Trump hack.  Not surprising at all.  He says jump, they ask, "How high?"
Lmao bunch of mouth breathers. There really is no hope for these people, huh? They were despicable before Trump, he just enabled them.
Do Not let trump destroy the United States Postal Service. Rural America depends on it. I depend on it.
Dude, I live in an extremely conservative area, I am surrounded by conservative Trump supporters who want me arrested or dead for my political leanings and tell me so regularly if they know who I am.  I'm the farthest from a bubble as I can get.

Someone on Facebook:  ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020! I won‚Äôt put a pedophile in the White House‚Äù.  Me:
He has plenty times  its easy to google. And trump only disavowed it after facing pressure to from Republicans lol. Trump has done nothing for minorities. Save that bs unemployment number for someone else. He continued what obama set in place and didn't fuck it up is all he did
Trump openly promotes racism and classism and never admits he's wrong ever on anything. Way worse? Yeah ok lol
He just got done talking to Putin not that long ago. This must be his new orders.  This is getting ridiculous.  Now we are putting our allies in danger?  Hell no.  It's time for our allies to help us stop this madness.  We must take Trump to the Hague for crimes against humanity.
He apologized for his comment,  you have him confused with trump who openly got endorsed by the kkk in 2016 and took weeks to disavow it playing stupid like he didn't know David Duke. And the bill passed in the 90s that he and other admit was a mistake?
I personally believe the anti-Trump thing is all about the single state solution.  We are dealing with some crazy-ass Catholic agents.
I bought a bottle of Ivanka‚Äôs perfume in 2016 when some dumb department store stopped carrying it b/c Trump. Bought one for my mom too.
It was wrong, disgusting, and doesn't excuse any of the shit trump does. The fact that you pivot to Clinton when confronted with the hypocrisy in your statement proves you know there's no defense for trump. And that you're weak. Mentally. Prob physically too.
The battleground is your city hall, it‚Äôs the courts, it‚Äôs your ballot, it‚Äôs your workplace, it‚Äôs your neighborhood.  You have an ignorant racist Aunt on FB posting Trump memes? Sure, call her out. But don‚Äôt mistake Facebook fights or IG posts with activism. Bc it‚Äôs not. End
It‚Äôs almost as bad as a Lynn Afendoulis in Michigan getting ‚Äúwhitmered‚Äù She‚Äôs going to help Donald Trump make Michigan Great Er wait, nope. He‚Äôs written us off.

To wear it while shopping would be nothing to me since id wear ot at work for hours on end.   And your chart has no meaning when China has it under better control than the us.   Also trump said masks work lol
Bounce out of it!! No if because Trump will get it done!  Get out and fight for him with him and for America!! No time for ifs!
Trump says they do
You know, your obsession and adoration of a television reality star is quite sad. To be so easily duped. Worse than any Fandom over Obama or Clinton. You literally worship Trump as the Last Great White Hope to #MAWA.  And you're the one calling people sheep.  ROFL.

The problem is the left doesn‚Äôt know what they are fighting. Its not just about Trump. The far right has been at this for decades. They are waging a culture war, and the left doesn‚Äôt even know it.
I have two issues when I hear "This will be the most important election in American history." 1: The DNC gave us a piece of shit that is just a bit shinier than Trump &amp; calls him watermelon sugar &amp; 2: Biden is going to do one iota better than Trump. Maybe two iotas, we will see.

Christmas in July for Vlad - Trump's decision to move troops from Germany slammed as 'a gift to Putin'
My impression is much more cynical, and by extension somewhat darker. Like Trump, I see them all as profiteering situational opportunists. They sew chaos and carnage because that‚Äôs what sells. The irony is that they rail against the ‚Äúelites‚Äù, totally ignoring their own membership
What kind of question is this? Trump is sending out unmarked brownshirts to arrest people with no respect to 4th Amendment rights. It's an unprecedented expansion of fascism at the highest levels
I'll give Trump credit. Crammed an entire term's worth of foreign policy incompetence into a single day. People say he's the only President who could do that.
Lots of American &amp; Trump flags all over Michigan
Trump is getting lessons on how to steal an election and stay in power even if he loses.
Trump and I FINALLY agree on something.  Nobody likes him! Including me.
Since when does anyone vote based on the VP?  If one truly believes having Harris or any other Biden pick as a VP is WORSE than having trump as president then they aren't a dem and they sure as heck ain't progressive.
Trump was so disrespectful of Mr Swan when he said let me tell you about Russia.  I‚Äôd bet Jonathan Swan could tell him a lot about Russia and the Taliban and the history of the region.  So could my 13 year old granddaughter
I'm trans and queer, and my partner is an immigrant who is also trans and queer.  Our rights are literally being actively attacked by this administration and Trump has literally tried to define us out of existence.  They don't even want us to be able to legally adopt children

Trump wants $377 million for re-model of West wing. McConnell wants  Billion for re-model of FBI bldng. and $7 Billion towards military spending.  Unemployment relief funding gets cut down to $200 from $600.  And you wonder why they're being called : #Putinistas ?????
The fact this guy uses the phrase "contributes 2% to NATO" is proof that no matter what 100% wrong thing Trump says, if he says it enough times some people will believe it.
Not being shallow. Being honest. There is no way trump weighs 239 lbs. I and 240 and not nearly that big around the stomach. Trump wont eat any fresh made food only premade because he is paranoid that someone will poison him. Hes a fat
That's exactly what it is, with the understanding that the alliance is between Trump personally and Russia.

My two boys and myself will be voting for President Trump
I want one. It will help counteract my neighbor‚Äôs trump flag that‚Äôs advocating, somehow, for ‚Äúno more bullshit.‚Äù
Let me guess...  YouTube video? Fringe blogger site? Trump?  Wow, they know so much.  It's all a conspiracy to keep the truth from us.    Alex Jones was framed.
It sucks, but deportation is better than concentration camps, Trump will take us into WWIII, he's tanking the economy himself, he's already planted the seeds for disarming only the left (see: "Antifa is terrorists"), and he's literally egging on far-right terrorism every day.
I agree that Biden could end up being worse... but we KNOW what Trump is doing, and how far he wants to go. I'd rather take a risk on someone who MIGHT care enough about his image to at least not be as bad as Trump would definitely be.
Add in the false negative
Thank You Dr Proctor.
No, voting won't bring real change, at least not in the current system... but it can be a way to keep people as safe as possible while we ALSO work to make real changes. Biden won't bring any real systemic change, but he will at least do less harm than Trump. That's not nothing.
Biden is shit, but Trump is far worse, and while I'd much rather send a message to the Democrats that they need to move left or keep losing, the damage caused by another four years of Trump is a greater harm than that caused by giving in to the Democrats' manipulation.
Hey!    You know who WON‚ÄôT get arrested in Detroit or Cleveland?  PEOPLE WHO STAY THE FUCK HOME!   Listen. Trump wants a conflict.    He WANTS a fight.   Beat him at his own game   STAY. THE FUCK. HOME.
Was listening to this piece on Michigan Radio this afternoon, sounds like there might be some legal grounds to prevent them from working the area.
Comrade trump. Making Russia great again.
What is wrong with the Democratic Platform committee? They are sucking up to the same corporate assholes that control Trump. We are going to get screwed no matter who we vote for.
üö®üö®üö®  DISTRACTION ALERT!   Trump is an asshole. We know this. Move on.Trump stooges cause more violence. Period.
Really? What makes you think we're worrying about Trump tweets. We have more important issues here in the real world! We Vote Biblically not politically.
But with Trump tweeting this he could depress turnout on his own base. We need to look at that as a good thing as it may tilt a state
And I don‚Äôt want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn‚Äôt question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. üôÑNo wonder
Everybody talks about well we got to take out Trump so what really is the plan what comes next?
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn‚Äôt for progressive policies
Remember guys if you can vote early do it don‚Äôt wait till last minute. Find your LOCAL POLING stations. Check hours. Please retweet. Trump is going too try to mess with post office‚Äôs.
It light of The Rolling Stones and Neil Young complaints the Trump re-election team is switching to ‚ÄúMy Friend The Witch Doctor‚Äù
You sound like a trump supporter!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
New polls wednesday by a democratic pollsters shows Presieent Trump closing gaps in all battleground states
The Corona Virus numbers are down, unless Trump schedules a rally.
Nice talk. I‚Äôm not talking about research. I‚Äôm not medical. I‚Äôm talking about the dishonesty of the whole Democratic Party and their propaganda, especially when it comes to anything Trump. Common sense will tell you that Trump saw those ideas somewhere and repeated it. That‚Äôs it
Donald Trump supports cancel culture.
AdmittingüôÑ... That‚Äôs the whole reason he mentioned it.   Do yourself a favor, instead of stop watching CNN/MSNBC clips w/Trump coverage or anything related. Watch the whole interview/press conference and then right after, watch CNN. Pretend Trump is your uncle &amp; see if it‚Äôs fair
I was waiting for some piece of crap to tie the 2 together. You libs don't miss a chance to jab one of the best Presidents of our time, just like one of the worst presidents of our time (Obamy mammy) doing a EULOGY and bashes Trump NO CLASS
You wanted to take a cheap shot with no real basis because you‚Äôve been watching a bunch of other people do it and I jumped in your way and messed it up. It is political. Trump was right. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
That‚Äôs never been the point!!! It‚Äôs TRUMP... he‚Äôs rambling on and mentioning things he‚Äôs seen. He‚Äôs not recommending medical advice! NOBODY in their right mind would take it like that without super stretching. You might be like HUH? But, to act like it‚Äôs anything else is silly
She‚Äôs a Spartan. Not a Wolverine. I‚Äôm very proud of her. She cares about her constituents in spite of some of their stupidity.    trump is so afraid of strong women in positions of power
So tired of the VoteBiblical morons who also have Trump Pence signs in their yards. Stupid idiots and hypocrites
Question? Does anyone know if Donald Trump or any off his family owns stock in company pushing hidroxycloriken? Sorry about spelling guys.
And to see people tweeting President Pelosi shows you how people really just don‚Äôt get it. You need strong leaders that will actually do something that will fight and call shit out Pelosi has done the bare minimum to take Trump out.
Didn‚Äôt that lawyer guy that went to jail say that Trump was going to be really difficult to take him out of the White House so here is my thing why didn‚Äôt Pelosi and Schumer do everything they could to take his ass out. I mean seriously people should be outraged and angry at
I find it no coincidence that Trump sowed seeds of voter suppression on Twitter, on the day of John Lewis' funeral. And also on a day that Herman Cain (who contracted COVID-19 at Trump's Tulsa rally) died.  He's not a Commander In Chief, he's a Deflector of Grief.
Trump‚Äôs selfish policies,are helping Texans to die.
This Idiot   has gone and is going further with stupidity, than any person in World History...with the exception of Nero. Just as Nero destroyed the Great Roman Empire, Trump is in the process of destroying our America. Prepare Folks for HE WILL ignite the Fire.
Let us pray for Trump he‚Äôs in need of some medical assistance.
You of course,are referring to the Trump virus.
Republican Jesus,has granted Trump and friends,special powers,to override,the constitution.
The emoluments clause,doesn‚Äôt apply to Trump.
Trump is winning over the ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù vote.
Hey dummy
Have you actually watched that full press conference where Trump ‚Äúrecommends injecting bleach to cure covid‚Äù?üôÑ U know there‚Äôs actually at least 2 new innovations that show what he was saying wasn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounded? UV light injections and a wild new ionization treatment
Herman Cain‚Äôs last words are rumored to be ‚ÄúDo something really dumb for Trump! What do you have to lose?‚Äù
100% agree w/  Trump has permanently dismantled any old ballasts in the GOP.  If he loses, the Post-Trump GOP will largely push the same ideology and just look to repackage it more palatably.  ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs politics win, it‚Äôs just Trump that was the problem‚Äù they‚Äôll say
Hes entirely capable of suspending the election.Trump doesn't really do law.
Pffftttt...Though Trump has now lost 50% of his black vote.
Trump just lost 50% of his black vote.
W. T. F. !! Trump has no constitutional authority, nor does Barr, to move, delay or cancel an election. The same goes for extending term of office.
Without Trump, I don‚Äôt think there would have been this rebranding. After enduring Trump, I see Bush as a horrible president but a man able to show empathy and compassion.
Gtfoh if your tweeting PresidentPelosi. Pelosi has done nothing to stop Trump she has only enabled him and the Republicant party.
Trump has the media on his side.He would never have won the nomination in 2016 without it.
No'legal' mechanism...And we all know what a stickler Trump is for the law...
Every1 show up to the protest set for Friday&amp;Saturday. We need a MASSIVE amount of people to show up. The Feds are coming to OUR CITY apparently. If you aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs going on in Portland well buckle the fuck up, bc ur precious President Trump is starting a god damn war.
Wrong.  The term is constitutionally fixed, not the election date.  His term ends in January whether we vote or not.
Yes. Just reported another of Trump's false &amp; misleading mail-in election Tweets. It's beyond rhetoric. It's completely FALSE info!! It's my RIGHT to mail-in vote &amp; I won't stand for anything else! Hes also trying to slow/shut down USPS deliveries. Criminal Twitter acctüôÑüëçüèº.
America, do NOT let #Trump take away your #MailInBallot right as a Citizen of this Country.
We‚Äôre all with Trump FOR equal rights. We‚Äôre not racists like Democrats
I‚Äôm so sick of seeing trump merch everywhere I go I literally can‚Äôt escape it
The best part off Donald Trump ran down his mother‚Äôs ass.
Do you agree that Trump never once said anything about injecting bleach? And since that never happened, its unethical for a congressman to say ‚Äúhe used those exact words‚Äù at a congressional hearing while using that inaccurate statement as proof of Trumps carelessness?
You really should apologize and admit what a terrible thing that was to infer and promise to vote for trump to show you‚Äôre not a racist
Are you trying to argue there‚Äôs no way to argue something objectively if you have an opinion? Like, if I were to agree with something Trump says or does it must mean I‚Äôm bias towards him?
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
Follow along..... If hydroxichloroquin treats corona there‚Äôs no panic. If there‚Äôs no panic Americans go back to normal life. If Americans go back to normal life no mail in ballots. If there‚Äôs no mail in ballots Dems can‚Äôt cheat. If Dems can‚Äôt cheat Trump will crush Biden.  Simple

Trump,Putin,and Xi,are reshaping the world,to suit their interests.They are the new world order.
It is to Trump.
Mail-In Voting abolishes the decades long work done by the GOP to gerrymander districts to their favor.  Trump is now trying to destroy the Post Office.  This isn't just about votes.  This also about people getting medications, goods.  He's putting an embargo on his own people.
Exactly how I‚Äôm looking at it. Either way we all lose. May as well be trump in response to this shitty nomination.
Trump does not like to suffer,inconvenience.
Thought it was a Trump 2020 ad
But yesterday a congressman stated ‚Äúthe exact words Trump used were to inject bleach‚Äù this is my point! They outright lie so people will believe it because most think if it‚Äôs said in a congressional hearing it must be true. They operate with pure propaganda!
Progressives are not slaves to the DNC.  All the web pages and comments in the world will make a difference. I lived through four years of trump four more will pass in aprox 1461 days. No big deal to me.
President Trump comes up with these nicknames for his opponents. Sleepy Joe Biden, Crooked Hillary Clinton ,lying Ted Cruz. What does he call himself?Dandy Don?
This is Trump‚Äôs trade out with military contractors and industry who are upset at our lack of bombing other parts of the world.
I'm heading back home tomorrow! Thankfully I'm not in Detroit. I'm about 20 miles away.
There have been MULTIPLE pro Hydroxychloroquine studies too... the Medical Field has different opinions. The Only reason there is a strong aversion to it by many is that Trump is pushing it. Even a broken clock is right twice a day
When questioned about Dr Immanuel.Donald Trump ducked and ran.
WTF is honorable about Trump?? The man has no morals. Every nasty thing he had said and done it's a sin, per your Bible.
CNN ‚Äúthe right arm for slo Joe‚Äù has 80% of its programming devoted to the virus. They think it hurts Trump. It makes them look like an inept news organization. So what else is new!
That's not Bill Barr's main focus. Nor is it Trump's.
But you made it sound like the DPD is thrilled to have the feds here. They are NOT. And if you believe that Homeland Security and Trump have no hidden agenda, you are being naive.
Because The Trump administration is refusing accept new #DACA application against the #SupremeCourt's order to accept them, Congress needs to stand up to this mess.
You're bitching about repetitive?  All little man child trump says is how tremendous or fantastic everything is. The man only has a 4th grade vocabulary so he's the repetitive one.
140,000 dead Americans,are who is accusing,Trump.
anyone else concerned that Trump and Putin were discussing nuclear weapons?
Which is Trump‚Äôs favorite,bible verse?
Trump is anarchy personified.He is a Leninist,like Steve Bannon.
Donald Trump spent millions on hydroxychloroquine.
Creepy Donald Trump,is just a Trojan horse,for foreign governments who place bounties upon the lives of US soldiers.
Trump call them Pills, not doses
Trump enjoys handing out,other people‚Äôs money.
What's the first thing that comes to my mind when someone tells me they're a Trump supporter?You stupid motherfucker.
Those "assaults" happen to be Federal officers protecting Federal property. Since the local leaders refuse to do it. Nor is this anything new. They were calling Trump a fascist before he even took office.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
No reasonable person who watched that press conference would‚Äôve took Trump as saying to‚Äúinject with bleach‚Äù or anything close to that effect. Media created it treating it like he said &amp; meant something he neith said or meant. In today‚Äôs hearing it was said he did ‚Äúspecifically‚Äù
Healing love to all hurt emotionally &amp; physically by Trump.
President Trump is moaning that nobody likes him. Oh poor baby don't cry, you worthless piece of shit.!!
That‚Äôs because they would have to admit Trump was right.
If she meant what she says she would do a lot more to stop Trump and the Republicant party.
The country has been and continues to be divided by the left wing media. They started out illegally spying on his campaign, bought a fake dossier and have been knowingly spreading misinformation like ‚ÄúTrump said to inject bleach‚Äù He‚Äôs wanted to work with Dems/they won‚Äôt allow it
They will lose Trump 2020 KAG
You are as bad as trump.
Donald Trump has never been wrong about anything,in his life.His instincts are superhuman.Ask him.
You were always gonna vote for Trump...we know.
Just proving that you were for Trump all along.
Nadler is a complete baffoon. Law and order, Dems don't want it and are willing to let law abiding citizens suffer just to get rid of Trump, enjoy your shitty utopia if Biden gets in, you'll regret it about 2 years in...
Trump said he‚Äôs encouraged by the Coronavirus asses in sun belt states god he‚Äôs a morons.
üíõüíõ I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ivana and hope all is well with you üíõüíõ
If you look  Trumps wives, &amp; you think he likes kids you're an idiot. He probably settled because he owns the Trump name and doesn't want it tarnished. I dont even need to know the case. If he knew anyone who did something bad he'd pay a settlement to get a confidentiality doc.
üòÇ   The lowest rated Trump got more talking points I see.   Do you ever have an original thought?
Trump is the reason we have this pandrmic. He mishandling caused our crisis and his stupidity is making it worse. Open your eyes.
Not gonna happen because it‚Äôs all Trump has left
Have you seen how far gone they‚Äôve become with their Trump derangement syndrome? Democrats have become Trump 2020‚Äôs best campaign ads. Zero editing is necessary. Problem is, Dems don‚Äôt watch what really happens, they only see an edited filtered version.
Had my eyes done in December and January...truly an amazing thing. Trump won't look better, but everything else will!
Barr is Trump‚Äôs hired gun.

No actually I cant see that only in my cropped retweet. My mother falls for commie propaganda like you do. She is pro life, pro Trump, and a nurse. She even agrees the mask thing is useless unless your fitted for an N95. She wont wear a mask in a store either.
Trump had a stroke,which affected his right side.
That is what truly matters,to Trump.
The Plandemic was concocted  by Trump,and his Chinese partners,in the CCP.. Q Anon is  department of Chinese intelligence  is anti American .

UNBELIEVABLE isn't it. Besides Repunlican questions did Barr ever anwser a dem ? They cut him short. This was about Trump, almost like a campaign rally for Biden
Seriously, just like anything to do with Trump, it‚Äôs so obvious they‚Äôre taking things she said out of context. The whole ‚Äúsex w/demons and witches‚Äù line was when she repeated what people told her they dreamt about because Hydroxy causes crazy dreams.
Sometimes I wish hell was real, just so we can send Trump there.
Cheaters Never Win!!!!!! Screw the Democrats!!! Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏
Because I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump may actually be helpful in destroying the Corporate constructed sham of a Banking and Stock Market.  Imagine if he burned that crap to the ground?  No republicans would be elected for a decade.  Biden is worthless.
I‚Äôm not a democrat. I am an independent.  I vote for who I like better.  Honestly I hate both of these worthless fools. But we had a chance for change but we nominated a Republican.  Trump 2020 sucks but so does Biden 2020.
I am disgusted by your grandstanding because of your hatred toward President Trump. That was a full of lies speech you gave. Your a piece of dudu and don't even deserve to be a United States Representative you disgust me
Trump is a moron.  I‚Äôm voting for him because democrats nominated a Republican.  I don‚Äôt care what he says or does.  I hope he collapses the entire countries stock market and banking system so we can start over.
I guess if Biden started calling Covid a hoax I might just let the chips fall where they may, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt vote, I don‚Äôt think I could vote for Trump.
Trump does not support Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all.  I hate both of them. Coin flip. Brb..... tails.  Trump 2020. And they spend 100s of millions on tv commercials?
True Mr. Trump all connected to pharma are gonna be pissed at you  surprise keep on keeping on we love you
Because they would have to admit Trump was right
Do you understand now why Trump has talked about declaring ANTIFA a domestic Terrorist organization but never does?
Homework is done. I knew I was voting trump and for every Republican on my ballot once Bernie was eliminated.  Lots of free time since I registered to vote by mail I don‚Äôt even waste gas voting this year.
While America battles a deadly,pandemic.Donald Trump battles with his inner demons.

Like Donald Trump?

Trump‚Äôs a Boogaloo Boy.He enjoys watching things burn,and blood flowing.He is no different than his idols,Putin,President  Xi, and Kim Jung Un.

If trump loses and libs take senate..... jails will be full of trump and his appointees.   But I‚Äôm voting trump. I hate Joe. He is a Republican in drag
Trump virus so far is not killing off old cars. Just people.
My concern: they‚Äôre all f‚Äôing anonymous. Trump may be a narcissistic idiot, but those around him are anti-American cowards.
You really are clueless about Joe. I would put his 40 year voting record against any Republican living or dead. Joe has been selling out democrats for 5 decades voting with Republicans.  But that is Socialism to you.  I wish Joe was farther left then maybe I wouldn‚Äôt vote trump
Donald Trump and his heavily armed,Boogaloo Boys,are trying desperately,to start a new,Civil War.
Lol...I got 7 days for hateful conduct...the only thing I was hateful toward was Trump...
Americans continue to die mercilessly,in Republican controlled,America.Trump is the master of mayhem.
Don‚Äôt worry.Trump and the CCP,are still business partners.
It‚Äôs pretty clear that part of the reason why Trump and the feds are focused on Portland is, somewhat ironically, because the crowds are going to be largely white. It allows Trump supporters to claim this crackdown isn‚Äôt about fomenting anti-POC backlash.  #DetroitToday
Trump does not want to receive one of Putin‚Äôs‚Äù special pills.‚Äù
Wow she has videos talking shit about Blm with some lady that works forCandaceOwens and she has a video talking to Trump supporters where they are like we love weed we don‚Äôt hate gays what the shit is this garbage?
Trump is not a real conservative. Moron!!
Tucker Carlson is the biggest joke I‚Äôve ever seen. He  still doesn‚Äôt get it. He wants to start a war with China, so Trump doesn‚Äôt look bad over Trump s handling off COVID-19. Someone slap him please.
I knew they‚Äôd circle the band wagon back around to ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù before election time . Now we‚Äôll see the ‚Äúarticles‚Äù coming that this is all Trump‚Äôs fault and how it‚Äôs irresponsible and somehow ‚Äúracist‚Äù to vote for him coz climate changes is gonna kill us all
Look what trump and the Republican Party has dune to our country. While he plays golf
Because it would prove Trump was right
I get a kick out you Aholes saying what a bad job Trump has done with the china virus, yet none of you (includin bidass) come up with anything you would have done different LMMFAO
Nope she loves Trump. Voted for him in 2016 :D

Agreed. Vote Trump out of office this November and make America great again. Well, I mean, America was never really great (let's be honest, this nation is EXTREMELY fucked up with it's history), but ya'all know what I mean. #VoteBlue #FuckTrump #SaveAmerica #PeopleFirst
Trump stooges turned protesters into rioters.
Trump stooges causing big problems everywhere they go.
That‚Äôs probably how he wears Trump‚Äôs balls too
I hope so. I‚Äôm voting trump in Michigan
Voting for trump because we nominated a Republican
His visit wouldn't be sincere it would be painful to watch someone who lacks empathy stand there being awkward and unpresidential John Lewis was authentic believed people could be better by opening their hearts having love for others Trump can't honor that
Also...were old enough to remember Steve's utter and complete contempt fir Trump all along...so easy on the libel.
Genius.... President Trump is allowing democratic governors to take care of their own State and the governors are failing. Violence is running rogue and the economy is dying in those leftist States. The president will swoop in and clean it up soon causing people to vote Red. üá∫üá∏

I‚Äôm voting trump. It‚Äôs a more effective üñïüèªto the DNC it‚Äôs Centrists.  Biden is worst nomination since Hillary. Yet another worthless Corporate owned puppet.
I‚Äôm voting for trump. Once Corporate Joe was nominated I was done until 2023 1/2.  Centrists are worthless.
The good news is this. Trump will probably collapse the entire corrupt corporate owned financial system. Stock market too. I believe trump could screw up everything the GOP with Biden spent 40-50 years creating.  Biden wins..... who cares the misery will continue. Trump is a F up
We have been on the, ‚Äú Well it just didn‚Äôt work out ‚Äúend of this far to manny times.  My answer is f your candidate.  I‚Äôm voting trump. Nothing personal.  I don‚Äôt know you. But I really am voting for every Republican on my ballot. No democrat deserves my vote any longer.
If trump is re-elected I hope the first change we see is no more centrist nominations.  If you nominate a Corporate owned puppet aka Republican in drag like Biden you can‚Äôt expect a rational person to vote for him.
I‚Äôm voting for trump.  The DNC dislikes progressives nobody I could vote for gives them a bigger fuck off than trump
It‚Äôs gonna ramp up again coz it‚Äôs an election year . They‚Äôll try to sell the ‚Äúif you vote Trump then the climate is doomed and we‚Äôre all gonna die again‚Äù narrative

It's because of your conspiracy to support the traitor Trump in addition to your sheer incompetence
Trump won‚Äôt get Covid. Cockroaches are immune
George this guy in pic is someone you could follow to understand what you and others who want progressives to vote Biden are up against.  Ryan is plainly stating where I and many others are coming from.  Between Biden and Trump is see two idiots I don‚Äôt want as prez
Feds. Not stormtroopers. You liberals voted for the idiot democrats running your cities and states. Now you cry when those cities are destroyed and want to blame Trump. Pretty hilarious. Grow up and take responsibility for the mess you VOTED for
A Trump investment,no doubt.
I don‚Äôt hate the man. I find the news hilarious to watch with all the scandals, failures, court cases.  Our government is a flaming pile of corporate owned shit. I don‚Äôt care who the president is. I truly would like to see trump succeed or burn this fucker down.
I truly believe trump could burn down Wall Street and the banking industry if he has another 4 years.  Biden does as Corporate interests tell him. Trump does whatever he feels like that moment.  Kind of like giving a todddler a loaded gun. Continued
Trump is not taking this job seriously. He is just coasting through this like High School.  Biden has been blowing the 1 percent or corporate interests for 4-5 decades.  Biden couldn‚Äôt raise 1 million dollars from grass routes. Nobody likes him except fossils.  Continued.
Donald J Trump is Satan‚Äôs spawn.He has taken Reagan‚Äôs ‚Äúshining city on the hill‚Äù and turned it into a toxic dumpster fire,in some  back alley
This is true.  Earlier in this thread I mentioned I‚Äôm voting for our funtioning moron of a President instead of Biden.  Biden is a filthy Republican who I can‚Äôt vote for.  Many Republicans are voting for Biden. Why do you think many Republicans are not happy with trump?
Lemme guess , this is all Trump‚Äôs fault and if we re-elect him then the planet is doomed and we‚Äôre all going to die ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èInternal polls show huge Trump landslide.  That is why liberals are going bonkers.  I know.  I run the data.
The election will be delayed because of the attacks on the federal buildings.  I almost wonder if Trump owns BLM and Antifa.  If he does, I support it.  It's brilliant.
To expand on this. One of their main talking points now is if trump loses they swear we are going to become a nation of socialists. Every one of these mother fuckers likely plans on social security for retirement, used PPP, cashed the stimulus check and will cash any that follow.
And then my old youth pastor makes a post calling for revival with a Trump speech accompanying it...and I wonder how we can move forward with thinking like that...
What are you saying?  Dems have the answers but are not going to present them until January?  To make Trump look bad?
No matter what happens, Trump will not leave the White House. Americans will support that.
Morons or traitors. There is no room left for his base other than those two categories.  Have lost my relationship with my father over this situation. Most of my extended family as well. Lots of trump supporters in WY unfortunately. Fuck em all at this point.
If Trump moves election day, we should all agree with the president.  This is an emergency.
I will support Trump in whatever decision he makes.

I supported Trump in 2016. I voted for him, but I‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt be making the same mistake in 2020. This man does not act presidential at all. He‚Äôs running our country like a reality TV show. But the problem I have is him not acting presidential, and our poor economy.
Look Kamala is trying to be funnyü§£ü§£ Trump is üíØ% going to be re-elected.
just because trump can‚Äôt ‚Äútechnically‚Äù or ‚Äúlegally‚Äù delay the election doesn‚Äôt mean anything. we have seen what he is capable of in the last four years, and especially this year. he. does. not. follow. the. rules.  we must keep fighting.
Trump just might be the anti-Christ.  ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs Strauss.‚Äù
You need to educate yourself China knew of it in November and continued let people to fly to America without telling anyone until TRUMP stopped travel....TO SAVE LIVES. Another ignorant person spouting off without knowing anything.
DemoRat leaders are the main ones responsible for deaths mainly Cuomo Trump sent a ship to help them but no had to send them to a nursing home to kill everyone.. can't have anything positive toward TRUMP..rather have deaths.
TRUMP has nothing to do with Coronavirus deaths but hes responsible for the hate in your heart.
They have to certify results by a certain deadline. I remember from 2000. Trump won‚Äôt be wish washy.
Let‚Äôs NEVER forget what trump has cost us. EVER!
So the king of litigation has threatened to litigate the election for years. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when conservatives hated constant litigation. I guess Nunes is too young to remember and trump really isn‚Äôt a conservative so...
"Trump just doesn‚Äôt know how to be subtle about this stuff."  I guess Emily, whoever the hell she is, thinks Nixon was subtle.  Emily, go home and play with your crayons.

All internal polls, and I work on them, show a massive Trump landslide.  The media is lying to you.  They know he will win that is why they are pulling out all the stops.
Perhaps once he leaves office in January, prosecutors in #Tulsa should consider charging  with involuntary manslaughter, since  probably contracted #COVID19 at Trump's ludicrous campaign event.

My guess is, they are the ones getting treatment options that we don‚Äôt know about. When you‚Äôre in the military they ‚Äòown‚Äô you to a certain degree. Could it be this is why Trump believes in HCQ protocol? Hm.
It's 2016 all over again. That's why Trump can't win.  I'm so glad Hillary has been president these four years.
Trump basically tells U. S. Americans your 1st Amendment is no longer. Calls protesters pro-anarchists, ppl that hate our country, beehive of terrorists, to be "cleared out" or he's sending in the National Guard (and others) to do it.  aka : Trump declares war on 1st Amendment.
In this instance, Immurement for Trump seems appropriate.
I didn‚Äôt know there was a press conference today I was watching Obama‚Äôs speech at John Lewis‚Äôs eulogy. After listening to this press conference it‚Äôs clear Trump just wanted a little attention. Babbaling nonsense. ü•±#ThanksObama #JohnLewisMemorial #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Shit for brains doesn‚Äôt even want to be re-elected. He just wants to lay the grounds to say he really didn‚Äôt lose. He won‚Äôt fight to stay. He‚Äôs too lazy. This is just another distraction. He wants to build trump tower Moscow and golf.
Trump just showed that he's bound and determined to object to, litigate and denounce anything other than his victory in Nov. election. And remain in office til his victory is confirmed. WAKE TH FK UP AMERICA, A DICK-TATOR IS ATTEMPTING TO OVERTHROW THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA !!
Please support vote by mail in all states as we have in Wyoming! Please support our post office‚Äîyou know how bad it will be in rural states if you allow Trump to ruin it.
So weeks after the house passed a bill to fund schools, pay citizens another stimulus, trump is saying his administration wants it but dems dont
Then why are running? You stand with trump 2000%, you have zero plans and a disgraceful person for standing with white supremacist and Russians paying for dead soliders.  Do the right thing and drop out now. Michigan doesn't want you or trump.
What Trump is saying is that computerized ballot-counting is going to be rigged in his favour in as many states as he can manage it.  Believe it.
Change Now Before It's Too Late VOTE REPUBLICAN, TRUMP 2020
Hey  have you wondered why you only have 57 followers? Must be your tweets that say nothing but rubbish from illiterate thoughts! Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏

Obozo had 8 years to help and did nothing but destroy more and more , the racial divide in America NOW is Directly a result of his bias rhetoric throughout his 2 terms. sad and pathetic compared to the uplifting Positive accomplishments in 3 years by TRUMP . VOTE Trump 2020
Obama had no right calling down Trump in a solemn eulogy? Save it for the campaign you stupid idiot!You suck Barack! Literally you have!
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?

#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Yeah, he was super good at weaponizing the intelligence community and letting them spy on Trump and try to set up him and his campaign people for crimes they didn‚Äôt commit. Super good, I tell ya.
I don't wish death on anyone who has/had COVID-19, including Republicans. With that being said, Donald Trump can go to hell for his role in their death.
‚ÄúTrumpers don‚Äôt follow logic. They follow Trump.‚Äù Truer words have never been spoken, my friend.
Why is it I understand what Trump is doing with his tweets and you don‚Äôt, Bill?
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
They had no masks and inches from the state troopers face shouting screaming in their face they actually had a naked dark haired barbie doll hanging from a noose representing the govenor of michigan at this point if you support tRump you are definitely RACIST!!!!!!
Then TALK TO TRUMP!!!
Like you cared about Hermin b4 he died,  troll!
Simple way to fix this "Nadler Myth " is to bring out some swat armored vehicles with 30mm watercannons and clean up the smelly rioters, wash out some mouths, and clean the streets.Bam done.MACA =MAKE AMERICA CLEAN AGAIN  Come on president TRUMP gitrdone!
There are no words to describe your tweet other than IGNORANT OF THE FACTS even Bush jr (republican president) spoke out against tRump and his actions this cain guy died supporting tRump and his divisive YOU DONT HAVE TO WEAR MASKS AND IT IS A HOAX BY DEMS
Will Trump give the Eulogy at Herman Caine's funeral?ü§î
Obama has not been president for over 3yrs..... and secondly the COVID-19 VIRUS came just  THE BEGINING OF THIS YEAR so WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT mr. Cain got INFECTED AT THE RALLY IN TULSA AFTER TRUMP WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT SPOT JESUS YOU #45 SUPPORTERS R NUT JOBS...
It's a social contact issue, especially indoors. The fact you even lump the 2 together is disturbing. Whitmer has at least acted in good faith. Trump only cares about re-election. He could give a damn about the public's well being, clearly.
Trump has drawn a line in the sand. It's his "us against them" mentality. John Lewis, an icon, a true leader and a role model for millions of Americans was not part of trump's "us". He wants American against American. Division makes us weaker. Putin must be proud.

Trump‚Äôs version of Reefer Madness.
President Trump knows he has no authority to delay the election, and that any attempt would be in violation of the Constitution.  His remarks are designed to distract us from the news our economy has shrunk a record 33% under his leadership. But we won‚Äôt forget. #WeWillVote
For Trump speak about it, it will be true, they laughed when he said his campaign was spies on, they laugh when he called the media fake news etc.   it all comes to be truth! Hell yea they will cheat
How about you actually stand by these principales and stand against Trump?  150k dead, 32% drop in GDP, constant lies and a blatant refusal to do what needs to be done.
Who cares.  Stop giving them showtime.  Today is not their day to distract from Rep. John Lewis.  I'm ready to fight even harder.  I will not let him down.  Trump and his minions are going down!
I'm voting him out of there.  I'm not taking any bs from people attacking mail in voting or any misinformation. Especially today. Rep. John Lewis didn't fight his whole life (as well as numerous Americans) for an imbecile like Trump and his goons to destroy our democracy.

There will be so much whining, sniveling, and gnashing of teeth when all these powerful Republicans are sent packing because people decided TO VOTE! They will point their fingers at Trump when he loses, too, blaming him for not "helping" them enough.   Oh, he helped, alright.
Wyoming....Trump country!
I thought all these people were leaving to Canada if Trump won the election 2016?
Seeing Trump shaking hands with incoming President Biden? Priceless. #WeWillVote
Trump ur concern about ur safety, but not ur base safety, why?  Herman Cain ran for president, a while back, in case some people do not know who he is. The 999 guy!!!
Trump, do u feel any guilt??? By telling him not to wear a mask? U made sure u kepted far away from ur base, why?

174 days until Inauguration day.  How much damage could Donald Trump do in 174 days?  [laughs nervously]  #TrumpIsNotWell
He doesn't really like that Trump tweets. I don't understand why. But I think that is part of it. He's just too literal.
He died because of trump.
Well trump is in quite a tizzy today. Calling for a delay in our election. Your silence hurts me.
Trump is just doing what he always does, and that's exposing the lefts hypocrisy. He just started a debate and a dialogue that I didn't see coming and I don't think they did either. We are ok brother.
It makes me sad to know the democrats will go to these lengths to destroy trump!! Those children need school to live.
Trump said this to continue his goal of making people believe elections are rigged. This will deteriorate to: we don‚Äôt need elections, we just need me. I‚Äôm the only one you can trust. It‚Äôs an obvious dictatorship move.
He is simply saying he ‚Äúloves‚Äù all the people in the USA!  Obama was the WORST President in history!  That will be proven to you and your sheeple shortly! Trump is DRAINING THE SWAMPS... WORLDWIDE!  Wait and see.  But, you think what you want!
NOPE NOPE AND NOPE!  The election will be November 3rd!      #Biden2020Landslide
Trump's body count gives him ownership of this virus. He caused this to become the crisis we are enduring and it will rage on while he is still in the white house.
This is a set up question. This is exactly what Trump wants them to say. They have learned NOTHING.
We all knew Trump would do everything he could to keep himself in office. Well, here it goes. He‚Äôs going to fight at every turn. #RemoveTrump #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Hm, had not thought of him wanting mail-in voting. I was going w/idea since Dems want no in person voting &amp; we are 'all gonna die' that Trump was trolling them. If so deadly, we must delay! So that Dems say, "Oh, no, we must have all polls open! People must be allowed to vote!"
The united police states of America. Trump's fascist dream coming true. Nov 3rd can't get here soon enough.  Hopefully we will still have an election.
Comrade trump making Russia great again.
You have a good point. Trump and his enablers do know the science is right. They discredit science for their greedy cause. They are using fear to manipulate the cult. They are willing to sacrifice everyone to retain power.
I've been debating with people about mail in voting all day today.  Have I told you how much I hate Trump for all this misinformation and chaos he is creating in OUR country?  Time to speak up and let the truth be heard. I want to honor Rep. John Lewis by continuing to be heard!
The gop and trump do not care if the children die or become super spreaders. They are willing to sacrifice the children to win an election.
Trump is brilliant
Herman Cain died from the Trump Hoax Virus today. Condolences to all.üôè
Let's get one thing clear, I'm not voting FOR Biden in November, I'm voting AGAINST Trump, because he says shit like this that scares the hell out of me. He
As if the past 3 years haven't been a giant indicator, but Trump calling for a delay in the 2020 election and not realizing his term expires in January regardless shows he has no idea how the government of the country he leads works...
I wish. They were federal employees, but teachers are locally employed. There should be something Trump can do to impact them.
I wondered why why we would antagonize our biggest creditor and one of our biggest customers. It seemed bonkers, because it is, but then...Trump. I no longer expect things to make sense.
Curious, not knowing "details" about elections, can a vote be denied if there is no "legal" address to be accounted for ? Maybe this is another tactic Trump and his R's are trying to use as voter suppression and letting rental relief funding expire. (????) ü§îü§îü§îü§î
I started doing mail-in vote since 2016, when it was very apparent that that election was interferes with &amp; that‚Äôs how trump go in. No More!
My Sis in law was called by a pollster, as soon as she said she's going to be voting for Trump, they hung up.
HEY MSNBC let's talk about the GDP, shall we?  You know, that 32.9% DROP.  That's why trump is trying to take everyone's attention elsewhere.
Are you aware that all power transfers to the new President the minute he/she is sworn in? The military WILL follow the Constitution as they will now have a new, LEGAL, CinC.  It might not be pretty but Trump WILL be removed from the WH.
Maybe not but he WILL be escorted out when Biden is sworn in.  All power transfers and there are measures in place to assure that.  Trump will then be trespassing if he refuses to leave the WH. He'll be forcibly removed at that point.
Dems are telling us it‚Äôs unsafe to vote, so that means we gotta delay. Trump will just have to stay in office longer until it‚Äôs ‚Äòsafe.‚Äô
Like hell we do, tRUMP is the biggest liar and conman around !
So THIS is Trump's reason for no face mask.  He WANTS a pandemic so he can put the election off and stay in office!!!   IMPEACH THE MF NOW...AGAIN!
Your talking about trump being the terrorist leader right? He‚Äôs the mother fucker that‚Äôs killing us! Open your eyes!
Although I wish no harm on anybody, I'm not going to give my sympathies to people that ignore the experts and science during a pandemic. He had all the tools and knowledge to protect himself and others, but he chose not to do that. He chose Trump over country. He made his choice.
Trump is anti-American; ergo, his supporters are anti-American.

It was wrong, disgusting, and doesn't excuse any of the shit trump does. The fact that you pivot to Clinton when confronted with the hypocrisy in your statement proves you know there's no defense for trump. And that you're weak. Mentally. Prob physically too.
If Trump needs help on this... I think it's time to just go fishing. üëå

Thank You Dr Proctor.
Comrade trump. Making Russia great again.
Um...he gets sick?  The VP runs the country till Trump recovers.  Same as any other time the president is incapacitated.
I'm truly glad that some Republicans are seeing that our democracy needs saving and choosing the mantra "Country over Party". But, I'm also curious how many will continue this path after Trump is gone, or will they revert back to their old Republican ways ???
Trump is not blaming, our President is fixing your screwups.
A good time for them to stand together and denounce trump!
tRUMP loves ‚Äúall‚Äù Americans...just as long as they stay in their neighborhoods !

The trump's are the biggest welfare recipients in the country. We pay their housing, food and even their vacations. Any building with a trump name stamped on it should become public housing. Especially for immigrants.

It‚Äôs a dang shame ccstar668 that you are so guillable!  Brainwashing comes easy to the powerful Dem elites!  So would you rather have a free world or a communistic dictatorship?  Better vote Trump! Just saying
Agreed. He is not a better human. He is just a better politician. Those who want Trump to resign must not think Pence is that bad.   He is. And with him a president, the Republicans could actually win; all his supporters would write in his name.
Yep, so much so that they want to kill people.  Then if course they'd blame that on President Trump because he didn't talk about using it more.
We used to build big things. We invented big things. We thought and performed big. We used to be the envy of the world.   Then 50 years ago, the racist right was reborn and here we are in 2020 with Donald "White Supremacist-in-Chief" Trump and his band of incompetent oligarchs.
Yes, trump is not very smooth but he is a asset  of putin's.
The election is going to be crazy I believe. Biden will be announced POTUS fraudulently and the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse than Hillary was and TRUMP has more supporters.
When Trump's defeated in Nov., I'm praying that we'll finally find out what daddy Putin has on him that made it so easy for him to be turned into the biggest traitor since Benedict Arnold! And when we find out, I also pray that he be held accountable for EVERY treacherous act !!!
No Kidding , I can't wait to vote for trump in Nov , and I hope at least 100 million other people join us, TRUMP 2020
And tRump is worse!
tRUMP equating low income housing to raise in crime rates, and what a "bother" it is to have low income housing in the area. Guess he want's them out of sight, out of mind..maybe Mar A Lago would make good low income housing location.

Trump burner
And yet he chose to commit suicide and go maskless at a trump rally in Tulsa where he knew the virus was present. I‚Äôm sad to hear that he passed but I can‚Äôt praise stupidity.
Since there can't possibly be any truth there.  It must be what Putin and tRump discussed on that last phone call.  I guess Russia is either invading Germany or just threatening and extorting Germany.  What Putin wants tRump gives.
Most likely result is far right extremists starting riots on November 3.  Which is tRump's insurrection.
This is f-ed up Just because he was a Black Man that supported President Trump This is disgusting its sad and we need to continue the fight to put Trump back into office I think the Democrats continue to support EVERYTHING and EVERYBODY, they should NEVER regain power. Horrible!
Yes tRump's new post master general is trying to make it impossible for the Post Office to do its job.  Imagine having a boss that hates you and all that you do.  That is all of tRump's cabinet, every appointment.  tRump wants to destroy democracy in the US.
It was a tweet young lady. And it obviously garnished the reaction which President Trump intended. For yours and other leftist heads to explode.
In 20 years, people will look at the United States and think WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON OVER THERE?  But, If you vote Trump, we will miss out on depth of life. China and India is huge and culture groups are making sense.  Work Facism is the old America. Time to make America Great!
Man, this is so sad. The leaders of China need to pay for this. They put this virus out intentionally! Think about it, they don't want Trump re-elected. He's their nightmare. They are killing people around the world with this virus, they need to pay for it in some way.
Just imagine üßê  üá∫üá∏The United States üëê manufacturing capital of the worldüëê  The best products. American made üá∫üá∏  You think Trump ever called any businesses and convinced them to move operations over to the United States?   WHEN ü§¨?!?!
Putin asked tRump to move troops, so he can invade Germany when we are having riots due to tRump saying that the election was bogus and he is president for life. Because Putin making his own gambit for president for life. They pretty much already gave it to him. Putin needs cash?
He doesn't think a delay will help anything BUT his argument that the result was not legitimate.  IF the election were changed to November 4, He will say his voters al went November 3.  It would cost a lot of money, take more time, and tRump will still lose.  Imagine the riots.
Shows that they do not believe in law and order.  Not only do they not care about crime. (Their jobs.)  They had have, legal binding contracts, which they are breaking.  But their hero tRump does the same.  The right is wrong, they always resort to violence to get their way.
Y‚Äôall are literally dying on this hill for Trump. Stupidity.

If tRump was my uncle, we would have taken away his car keys long ago. Before Trump University.  We would have had him committed during the birther thing. That was an obvious disconnect with reality. It needed to be done for his own good. We did not want him to harm innocents.
Because we f'n hate him.  There are a few out there with big mouths, but they are way short of the majority.  Trump loses Michigan.
tRump is not going to be happy with James Deir.  Me, I'm delighted. Thank you for seeing the limits of your job!
If tRump actually had real money I would suggest he is paying Putin to pay the bounties.  But we know tRump is poor.  We also know that is a one way relationship. Putin is master and tRump is lap dog.  When tRump says we are not innocent he means that he is making us worse.
EXCELLENT TO HAVE THEM ON TRUMP'S SIDE!
Why won't tRump pay respects to John Lewis?  Perhaps he was one of the people beating him with clubs.
While it is tempting, I will keep my soul.  Just curious. Do only mean political campaigns? Or do you want to start assassinations? That has always been a far right tactic. Jim Crow was far right tactic. Slavery was far right.  Look at how far outside the law tRump steps.
Why the hell do you keep having #PeterNavarro on the air when you know he is a nut job! He comes on and lies as easy as trump! Stop it already!
I am reading MaryTrump's book. It proves everything we already know about Trump. He is a broken, empty vessel. He was a liar &amp; a bully as a child, and he still is a liar. &amp; a bully  in a grown up body.
Yes vote trump out and fast!!! He is crazy!!!
Can‚Äôt wait until November then January when you have your AG put tRump in prison.
Too bad tRump didn‚Äôt listen to you from the beginning. We might not have over 150,000 deaths. November can‚Äôt get here soon enough.
Trump is a cry baby
Well let‚Äôs face it Trump probably knows about snake oil. The woman is close to how he works.
Are you watching channel 7 American Catastrophe about COVID 19 .  This should really get Trump sputtering.
I hope trump is successful in getting all his supporters to take hydroxychloroquine. The miracle cure for covid 19.

Get this knuckleheads out of the office. Collins is a joke and trump puppy
Hurray for Rep.Jayapal she tore him a new asshole besides the old one Trump wears out.
So you are saying it will have giant gold letters spelling out TRUMP?  because that is as tacky as
Lets see, I look at a national institution, a truly beautiful space and I leave it alone and try to make it more accessible to more people.  But Melanoma tRump sees the same and wants to tear it up.  I swear to God, and everything holy, if it ends up with giant gold letters..NSFW
I would say after this hearing and Trump administration William Barr career is over.   Will he look back on  this and say  it was alll worth it.
Reagan said focus on the future do not dwell on the past...Trump could have learned something from him.
I was watching the debate of Reagan vs Mondale in 1984 it was a time when Republicans and Democrats could have a good laugh with each other. I miss that. This is why as a Republican I despise Trump y'all are supposed to work together not blame them for everything.
I swear as bad as Trump has been DeSantis has actually been worse
Yeah, and Trump was going to defend gay people.
Bill Barr is Trump's creature.
The only thing Trump understands or cares about is that he probably won't win in November. Sad, old man!!
Trump's holds the record for lies as a President! 10,000 and still counting!  #TrumpleThinSkin
No Trump was ask not to speak regarding Congressman passing. They knew that his few words would have turned into a Political Rally.  Congressperson and Senators ask Trump not to speak regarding the death of Lewis. Even Jornalist, reporters  and others ask him not to speak.
Bill Barr is Trump's creature!!
Trump ‚Äòowes us an apology.‚Äô Chinese scientist at the center of COVID-19 origin theories speaks out
Yes because trump is so dam smart right. He doesn‚Äôt even know what an elephant looks like!
First couple years of tRump, market ignored him.  Last year he started scaring investors. Yes the Fed intervened. Yes the overall market is up, but this is the most erratic market ever, for quite some time now. Big drops punctuate it.  2 of the biggest drops ever were this year.
Yes, because he‚Äôs smart and won‚Äôt cause a side show. We are actually lucky that Trump is incompetent
tRump is turning the US into a shithole country!
That was an admission that tRump asked Putin to do it.
In Michigan there are no bashful Trump supporters like the Republicans like to think. They're a bunch of Trump flag waving morons! But it's nowhere near the support he had last year. This is a hard working union state that made a big mistake it will correct this year. BIDEN 2020!
Women who are housewives are very lucky. During the Obama Biden era, I was too broke to be home with my babies. A luxury I would have treasured. Under President Trump, I was able to be home with my 1st grandbaby tho. Thank God for that.‚ù§Ô∏è

Hey Sean I want to know why president Trump has not called martial law. Bring in military and have them run these states that are out of control. It's to the point I carry all the time and everyone I know carry now,people are very tired of this criminal crap....
The future looks good even though today's brought Trump in to begin with
Showing thier support for Trump of different races Colt Ford is a amazing artist mix of Country and rap but worth the listen ^^
Isnt it nice to see Arizona &amp; N.Carolina now have Biden leading in the new polls? At the rate Trump is losing states he could be left with only Urah &amp; Wyoming lmfao.
Fuck Donald Trump. Fuck Blue Lives Matter. And Fuck The Feds.

And you're still sucking Trump &amp; Hannitys dicks! Lucky for you their cocks are small enough you can fit them both in at one time.

Trump's vision of America is carnage!!
I saw Trump shares briefly trade for a dime election evening.
Death in the US from Covid is now 150,000. Trump is Golfing with Brett Fabre.   My question does he see anything wrong with the Death Numbers? Does he care? Has he called any of these families. I cry üò≠. All he does is call it the China Virus and lies
Trump knows his reelection chances are in trouble, so now he's trying to confuse Americans and erode trust in our elections  via
Disappointing someone felt so compelled about his ideology that they would invest so much time in this monstrosity, while Trump won't display actual portraits of his predecessors at the White House out of sheer pettiness.
Trump's America is tantamount to carnage and violence!!
Is it safe to come out of the bunker yet? Lmao Big Bob just made fun of Trump
We certainly can't let tRump place another fascist on the court.
Now I just need Alec Baldwin to read that in his tRump voice.
Read the news to see what new crimes tRump is committing now that he no longer has to worry about election.
imagine herself a Political Analyst, she responds to all questions with Data, Polls and ‚ÄúMegan‚Äôs Analyzations‚Äù. On  Meghan ask Ms Trump questions attacking her, her book and credibility. You did not read the Book. You should have abstained  from Questioning.

Trump to sign an executive order allowing every American to be as full of shit as he is and have fatass Bill Barr back everyone in their lies.
You people are dumber then I thought if you believe a word this lying piece of shit (Trump) says.
This. Is Trump's America, and his white Christian supporters are responsible for this shit!
Trump should spy on Biden. Black lives matter. Biden put all blacks in jail band wanted segregation.  Blm
You‚Äôre wasting your breath with this one. He‚Äôs part of the tRump cult.
DO NOT VOTE FOR KANYE. ANY VOTE NOT FOR BIDEN IS FOR TRUMP.
Not with tRump.  It is the brand.
Trump is currently promoting, hate, violence, unrest in order to help himself.  You just can't ignore the racism.  Is your priest in the local Knights of Columbus? Ask him to look at this months magazine. He should reconsider.
except most small businesses did not get anything, it was all taken by big businesses, most with connections to Trump  oh yeah, loans have to be paid back  what happens when the loan runs out and they end up closing that business  so many small businesses around me have failed
As long as trump keeps killing Americans job openings will be plentiful.
Its Saturday July 25th and Dan Bongino is still slurping Trump &amp; Hannitys jisim off his face.

So because people demanded he apologize it means he's not wrong?  So what? He shouldn't apologize of he doesn't mean it. Way too many two faced politicians. At least Trump has the balls to show he's a moron, and when he lies it's so obvious no one needs to call him out.
Yes, Trump can try to buy my vote for 1200.
Ah, but could you still do it if like Trump you were high on adderall?
this isn't about law and order. this is Trump punishing liberal cities because he's petty.
you can't actually be Catholic and tRump supporter.  You gotta give one up. They are incompatible.  Ask your priest if it wrong to hate people because of skin color. Or to vote for tRump.
When Trump accidentally envokes  hegelianism
He will write the best book yet  Michael Cohen: Judge orders former Trump lawyer's release from prison
I'm a little bit confused. tRump is not going to get reelected with his pandemic actions so he thinks that sending shock troops to into cities to incite riots is going to help him? Even though the mayors are democrat isn't that going to piss off the republicans in the cities too?
Hey President Trump your doing a fine job for us true Americans that like protection and Freedom.. Democrats don't like freedom,there a bunch of idiot butt heads that DO NOT CARE FOR USA AND FREEDOM. Keep sending help to the cities that have children dieing.
Here's the actual cognitive test that Trump keeps bragging about acing.  I could have "aced" this at 6 years old.  The score isn't the issue. the fact that they even administered it is.
Trump, O'Bannon, Miller, Hannity Carlson, Dobbs, the deceased fatass Ailes &amp; The Australian Billionaire Murdoch all have one agenda to rip our country in half while enriching their lives. #ImVoting4BidenBecause
These federal agents that Trump is sending, how do we know  Its them.  What if oh the,  KKK got uniforms that look like the  Fed‚Äôs are wearing and do their own agenda of pain.  Who is To know who is who ?
Everything Trump says and does rips are country right at the seams, little by little he's tearing us apart, we have to stop this lying bastard by voting on November 3rd. There's never been a more important election in our country's history. Stop the madness! #GetRidOfTrump
Trump: The Chicago Five are all guilty and I know that for sure because they're not white! Obama is not from America he's from Kenya and I know that for sure because he's not white. Do you see a trend here?
In regard to watching Trump explain the results of his Cognitive Test is both mentally exhausting and sad üòû because he really thinks he is a genius. Illustrating delusions of grandeur.
We handle the virus filled garbage bags/cans. Explain to me, if it's so bad and dangerous, how come no one has caught it? It's not exactly the cleanest job and we're all good? It's the Dems pushing it,cause they're trying to bring Trump down. We stand strong. WWG1WGA!
Because he is Trump's creature.
How about save the children that are being trafficked! You obviously do not know much. You need to open your eyes! Trump has my vote. He's taking down Cabal and deep state. Do some research first, then we'll talk. There's so much more, but you're too ignorant to understand.
Two orders of magnitude off, about average for the Trump administration.
He's a Trump supporter so he was wrong from the get go
How much does any of that matter when he spews garbage hateful rhetoric? All he does is praise Trump, talk about how we need this &amp;that to protect Christians, regurgitates racist dog whistles, slams protesters for wanting equality,  bootlicks police ETC. and always always votes.
I agree. Remember after the Impeachment which she didn't vote for, she "thought Trump had learned his lesson" she has exceeded her expiration date
Ahem.  This *is* Trump‚Äôs America.   are they paying you for this?
tRump loves the Blacks.I worry about you're tweets now. Obviously you'd use someone to represent you so you can filter everything you think were as I know Trump is genuine no matter how retarded he sounds.
"Trump hate's science" is trending... Yeah he only had a REAL doctor tell everyone how hydrochloriquine is a safe and effective drug still used for other issues TO THIS FUCKING DAY which completely scientifically legitimate but somehow he's magically "anti-science"....

Oh so typical Trump's stumbling over words/ not knowing the difference.
Says Trump said Trump wants to postpone the election in November. I can't find evidence of this but it's something forced on my feed. Already makes me suspicious that it's out of contexts but now because they filter the shit I KNOW they are hiding something from me. Issue is...
Because he attended a trump rally
Meanwhile, 10,000 former tRUMP supporters are voting for Biden.
You're completely brainwashed, or just stupid, about right/wrong, good/bad, and winning/losing. tRUMP lost the 2020 election months ago. He just hasn't accepted it.
I wish we could control how much propaganda is thrown at as. The "myths of... wealth  gap" is propaganda response to what they say Trump said. The whole idea is racist on itself because it makes assumptions of what Trump said and made a racist response then shoved it down...

That is accurate as I learned in schooling. Source: certified social studies teacher. I‚Äôm led to believe that should it become relevant that Trump would fight it.

The way they word their survey make it sounds like they think people want this but really all this is is a way to make this a private platform that segregates the rich from the poor. Aka twitter becomes Marx's version of the "Bourgeoisie" so they can criticize and censor Trump...
Trump relies on young, uneducated people to vote for him. So, in a sense, he needs young and dumb to win, because those with intelligence can see right through his lies!

Trump is the exact opposite of the late great John Lewis
Because Trump said something good about it so Democrats logic is to attack it regardless of the studies and actual applications of it now.
Wow, the trump corruption is pervasive rampant and not patriotic
They have documented more lies from Donald Trump than any other person on the planet and you love him for it. I would never mention lies or truth again with your or his track record.
I don't know though I'd say it's borderline inciting violence if not inciting violence itself. (Not really protected by free speech.) They attack Trump with even less than that with the same claim.

You do know that antifa is not a group or even a movement don't you?  Just something tRump made up in his mind to feed the fear of his low intelligence base.
Good grief.
Both the announcement and cancellation came as a surprise to the team. None of this is surprising to anyone, is it?
they want to "look good" to a small handful of the aggressive and negative rich fucks that has them by the balls they too scared to show anything positive about Trump.
People are complaining about Trump complaining about negative posts to them calling them "illegal". No they just are low quality and bias. If twitter had the backbone (which they don't) they wouldn't allow low quality to move around their trends like that but because ...
Trump is completely befuddled by the job of president. He does not know nor has ever known what needs to be done.
"What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?" The left hasn't let go of the 2016 election results and made the same accusation back in 2016 to the right wings. How about letting that go first before making more assumptions of things that have yet to come?
Get serious. Trump could no more stop tweeting than actually act more like he even knows what to do in office.
He just reiterates what has been happening for three 1/2 years. Trump surrounded himself with people more mentally challenged than himself.

Best quote. Trump, whose statements for months were a fusillade of nonsense that reflected only his own pouty anger that Mother Nature had the sheer brass to mess up his presidential grift.‚Äù
At this point I kind of wish we could just claim these as "low quality" en mass (because that's exactly what it is) just make a statement to the idiots who push this bullshit on Trump that real people don't care about.
Yet, military members outside the country, disabled, elderly, and many others vote by mail every election, some of them even voting for tRUMP! It would only keep the Russians from voting, again, for tRUMP!
Trump is in bed with Putin!
You need to get your facts right. Trump closed the borders and Bunker Joe called him a racist and Xenophobic! He later apologized to Trump right on Fox News! If you watch CNN, ABC, CBS, or MSNBC, they WON‚ÄôT AIR IT! Too late! It was on!
You: ‚Äúhe is simply holding the Bible‚Äù  Trump: ‚Äútime to walk to the Church to do PR with this book I pretend to care about:

"2. Most Trump supporters don't participate in polling." I've legit heard that they don't even want to write down if someone claims to be a Trump supporter they ignore it and don't think how it effects their data.
Every second counts from now on to get #Trump out!
Great move!! Trump needs to go!!
Ok, then help trump win! Biden will do what is right during this pandemic. He is an exemplary role model. Your divisiveness gives you away
Didn't vote for Reagan, but your right tRump is no Ron Reagan!
And when we wake up tomorrow I hope we will all sing this song together üé∂ 99 Bottles of trump on his wall 99 bottles of trump  Take one down  Smash to the ground  for 98 bottles of trump on his wallüé∂  Kids! All together now. Donnie won‚Äôt like it cuz he can‚Äôt count backward
Counted 7 Trump signs on M-32, between East Jordan and Gaylord. That‚Äôs just a 30 mile stretch.   0 Biden signs.   I am aware that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a sparsely populated, rural area ... but still.
Disgusting human beings! Must be tRump supporters
Gonna say it again ...  don‚Äôt make the same mistake as Hillary did in 2016. Take Michigan seriously! Just drove up on US-31 from Muskegon to Petoskey and (once again) was dismayed at the number of Trump signs &amp; flags.
I SO agree!!  Apathy is a major issue.  Trump‚Äôs base is strong, determined, faithful &amp; determined‚Äîwe can‚Äôt become complacent!
Great job you guys! Support our President? November 3rd will be a BIG WIN for PRESIDENT TRUMP!
Omg...what did you think of the WEEKS of vacation that OBAMA TOOK? This President takes a day or 2, to clear his head, in the last month and you think he‚Äôs committed a mortal sin? Our COUNTRY went to HELL while Obama was President, that‚Äôs why TRUMP WON!
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Honey, I am sorythat you have been so brainwashed and when I saw your banner (Save the children) I knew there is good in you. But trump will not blink when our kids are sent back to school too soon. Joe is a kind and good man. If he wins he‚Äôll be good to you too
Trump should be asked why his son's school is not going to open ....
Mother Nature is SO pissed. Heat wave, pandemic, 3 hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. And the Trump Exacerbates every problem
How can you be literally anything and support trump
Holy crap. Trump is going to go ballistic.
Horrible! Trump is the bad guy in this!
Why? He will be voted out in November.  Name will always be connected to tRump.  His political career is over.
#SaveUSPS as long as your ballot is in the mail before Nov 3 it should still count...rigged election caused by Trump Administration is causing the delay
Yes, interesting, maybe partly true! But, trump did not get more votes, HRC WON POPULAR VOTE. It‚Äôs the whacked up ELECTORAL COLLEGE PROCESS that allowed this travesty of justice. Al Gore was cheated too! Stop using delegates, #onepersonOneVote
Barron Trump questions his father
At this time, it would be REAL news when Trump tells the truth.
Did you watch it? It was a fluff interview. Trump skirted the questions but didn't get snappy. So success? It's all about the optics. It looked like a good interview.
I think some are misinterpreting my question. Since the Trump administration is known to use footage from else where to "support" their claims I wondered if it was all legit. I know it's bad in Portland. #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
I bet your a trump supporter. Or worse a Biden one!!
the virus is getting worse the death toll rising Putin still has a bounty on American Troops the Trump Administration is putting taxpayers money into the stock market to keep on making it look good and where is the leader of the USA well he is golfing at his club w/taxpayers $$

One of the more ridiculous gaslights I have ever heard.  I do understand the the Catholic Church supports Donald Trump
Trump‚Äôs is dangerous for me and my family right now
It‚Äôs that little thing about packing in anti abortion judges-the evangelicals answer to prayers. They believe god works through trump, the filthy but chosen ONE. Church women are taught submissive subservient behavior, gotta keep the sheep in line
Dan is on the Trump crack pipe.
Trump administration in a nutshell
This man wants to instigate more violence for Trump to take more extreme measures vs demonstrators. Putting police vs citizens. Demonizing regular law abiding police and putting them in harm's way to call in Federally appointed private police. Watch Eric Prince step up soon...
Facebook‚Äôs ads use OUR user data to let Trump spread lies and suppress voting. We need oversight bodies to investigate #Facebook and act.
Any president you are as a speaker is gonna be like you said plus it's not trump virus it's Chinese virus I know you love China special Chinatown
Didn‚Äôt you love how Mary Trump gave you the smack down today?
Nope. Definitely the tRump virus
Is Mr Trump proud of you for taking a tough stand? Are you going to get a raise?
News flash no soldier has fought for those freedoms. They were never under threat. You know who has been putting them under threat. Trump and his secret police force. But that's a conversation you aren't ready for. So good day. Good bye
Shameful, and after all the talk on Trump and whistleblowers. Hypocrites
We're getting it done!!!    Trump's campaign team claims 4 million Michigan voter contacts TRUMP VICTORY 2020 #LeadRight   via
You have to fight the enemy wherever the enemy is found. And if you're Donald Trump, your biggest enemy is any American who disagrees with you. This seems to run counter to the narrative that the president of the US is president of all Americans.
Trump Will Eventually Disappear ‚Äì
THEY did DO TERRIBLE JOB! They did NOTHING. Put us in this OBAMA CARE INS. The INS is HIGHER and prescriptions were raised! WHO IS making the money on that? It‚Äôs called ‚Äúkickbacks‚Äù!! I hope AMERICANS can see prescriptions HAVE ALREADY DECREASED because of PRES TRUMP!
Only Democrats do this. Al Gore did it in 2000, nearly every Democrat did this in 2016, and Stacey Abrams did it in 2018. No reason for them to throw their hands up again for the #2020Election
The NRA will follows trump until he takes away their right to sell arms to Americans to protect ‚ÄúHIS‚Äù federal government. He will declare himself dictator before to much longer. If he doesn‚Äôt like a law he just ignores, it makes up a lie, and the Trumpicans worship his every lie!
They pull that sh*t in Michigan and our militia will fight back. We have the biggest militia in The United States. Texas said after Waco if the feds violate state law and invade it will be a declaration of war. Hitler Used his Gestapo to start a civil war just like Trump! Evil!!
#ImVoting4BidenBecause he‚Äôs not Trump

Sorry to come back to this again but it‚Äôs THE MOST IMPORTANT AND REVEALING PEICE I have ever read describing trump. It‚Äôs scary as hell and we haven‚Äôt even seen the worst yet
Apparently, #Biden2020 forgot about the great Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who RE-SEGREGATED the federal gov. Or how about the great Democrat LBJ? This guy's a joke. #Trump2020 #WalkAway #DemocratsAreThePartyOfSlavery
The only thing trump is good at is being awful. Period
Barr May have something up his sleeve  I don‚Äôt expect trump to leave gracefully
Wait are they suggesting Trump crowd will do the same as Black Panther did during Obama's election?
"Not Trump style" That's what I mean though.
Something annoying... How media is portraying feds coming to unruly areas acting like they are doing shit illegal against citizens when in reality it was citizens begging Trump to help because their state ignored them when they asked for protection and security. They are...Wow. The official transcript of the call between Trump and Herman Cain‚Äôs widow is moving!!
Update on the self dubbed ‚Äútrump corner‚Äù
The news only reports what Trump wants them to report.   Think about it.   No, he‚Äôs not a dictator.   However, he plays them so bad.   He‚Äôs the only thing you hear about day in and day out.   He owns the media by pulling their strings.   It‚Äôs like a cat with a laser pointer.
Id give up ever having an orgasm again if i could see trump go through that.
No they won't  its not up to them &amp; even they know  it-Just Distractions  for the audience  of  one " Trump "
Well how much worse could it be than Under Trump -Right now America  is being destroyed by Trump  from  all  directions  st the  same time  #VoteTrumpOut2020  then  #LockTrumpUp #VoteEveryRunningRepublicanOut2020   #LockUpAllComplicit
obviously your Health 'Life'Family-Friends-Jobs-Homes- Food-Your very Constitutional  rights &amp; FREEDOM  of  SPEECH  &amp; much more under  Trump  and  his  Complicit  GOP  #VoteEveryRunningRepublicanOut2020  #VoteTrumpOut2020  then  #LockTrumpUp  #LockUpComplicitGopLeaders
Hilarious to see a Trump fuck boy think he knows what that kneeling represents. ‚ÄúDone watching the NBA.‚Äù üò≠üò≠
Hey Trump  be careful  what  you  rant or Tweet for-The Constitution  is the  Law of the land"Not You: Fact check it I want you  to
I have my own opinions on Biden and Trump, but the amount of people sharing information that‚Äôs not even close to true, and others believing it is mind blowing. Both parties are absolute jokes. THIS is America.
Rep.Kevin MaCarthy never use the word God  aftet backing Trump the very opposite  of God -You Trust  power &amp; the almighty  BUCK  not God  #VoteEveryRunningRepublicanOut2020  then  #LockUpAllComplicitGopLeaders
Trump is going to call a national emergency over the pandemic before the election and delay it. During a national emergency, his presidential powers are expanded and that‚Äôs when he will attempt to form a dictatorship.
Trump "Strong "? MAN? SURELY YOU JEST-
Well Trump  has heard alot about  it since  &amp; still nada-zilch-nothing to  Putin-Aiding and abetting  with  RUSSIA  against  America  and  our  Troops  is Treasonous
I said it right  after  the GOP  let Trump  go  after their  rigged so called  Senate  Trial to Remove  Trump
and hes trying to encourage the idea of absentee voting as fraudulent so any mail-in ballots will be accused of being fake even if we have the election and everyone who decides to vote in person is gonna be the trump supporters who dont fear the pandemic so
Notice that these condolences come from   and not Trump himself? He‚Äôs incapable of kindness.
Amazed that you managed to climb out of Trump's ass long enough to tweet this.
I've never stood up for Moscow Mitch, but at least he said Trump's tweet this morning won't come to pass.
As i have  said  many times "Trump &amp; his people  don't  know  the  Constitution  from  a  Comic  book  but no problem  we do &amp; fuck you Trump  #VoteTrumpOut2020  then  #LockTrumpUp  he  belongs  in  an  Asylum  or  Prison
Trump could  actually  have  listened  to the real  Health  PROFESSIONALS  not people  like  the VOODOO  Yahoo  Witch  &amp; his own fat flabby gut that he always  brag about  #VoteTrumpOut2020  then  #LockTrumpUp
Plaaaazzzoma: hooked on phonics didn‚Äôt work for Trump
I just like to know why is Trump so afraid of mail in votes?
I can‚Äôt help but think of how hard he probably fought to overcome cancer just to jeopardize his health by going to a Trump rally.
Because Trump's balls won't lick themselves.
Yes he did I watched that video several times of those Trump staffers pulling off those stickers.
Herman Cain and 150,000 Americans did not die from the "China Virus."  It's the COVID-19 virus.  If you wish to give it a name, call it the Trump Virus, since you've done more to promote it than anybody else in the world.
Friendly reminder that Trump is avoiding a mail-in election b/c anyone disabled that can't physically get to the polls, low income people with no transportation, younger people that work strange hours, and folks with enough sense to stay home during a deadly pandemic won't vote.
You do love you some Trump.
Pulling  12,000 American  Troops  out of GERMANY  is another  gift to Putin  from  Trump  with  love-What does  Putin  have  on  the  Trumps? REMEMBER "All roads  lead  to  Putin  for Trump  &amp; some of the  GOP" #VoteEveryRunningRepublicanOut2020 Then #LockUpAllComplicitGopLeaders
You don‚Äôt have a valid argument for this, so you‚Äôre calling me out on punctuation?!  His own party isn‚Äôt even backing him on this!  SMH ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So long as the GOP feel Trump advances their platform, they aren't going care if the platform is resting on a constitutional republic with democratic traditions, or an autocratic regime. They want what they want, apparently enough, so to hell with the Constitution it would seem.
Sounds like you're watching a Trump rally.
I saw one the other day that made me laugh: "Republican Voter for Trump."  If you feel the need to create signs for people to say they are supporting their party's candidate, it means you know you're losing your own party.
Literally signed his death warrant at the Tulsa Trump Rally in the form of a COVID19 waiver.
The word is ‚Äúadvice‚Äù not ‚Äúadvise‚Äù. Know wonder you people vote four somebody like trump.  Your to stupid two no any better.
I don‚Äôt believe that you don‚Äôt know the law regarding elections. I believe you know full well that Trump cannot change the date of the election.  You just don‚Äôt want Trump to mean tweet you.
The safety of we, the people, depends upon this election ridding us of Donald Trump, William Barr, and Mitch McConnell.
I believe that but I also believe Birx needs to stick a sock in it as she‚Äôs made her self not credible by sucking up to trump and she‚Äôs not who I listen to.
Why a former Michigan GOP leader joined disillusioned Republicans against Trump
Y‚Äôall remember the Bush hate back in the day? Like I never thought I‚Äôd ever see a president get so much hate again...  Then TRUMP happened.
Don‚Äôt waste time on this Trump ploy to distract from terrible economy+COVID numbers  It‚Äôs silly. Constitution(Art 2)gives this power to Congress. Cong exercised it,3 USC 1. He can‚Äôt delay election w/out Cong&amp;he lost House in 2018  He‚Äôd lose in Court faster than he can say ‚ÄúPutin‚Äù
Feds clash anew with Portland rioters despite withdrawal agreement, as Trump ups pressure on governor
Well, he‚Äôs calling for a delay in the election! üôÑ He knows he can‚Äôt win without cheating, so he‚Äôs throwing a fit like a toddler.  He‚Äôs a coward and fraud, and he knows it, and so does the GOP.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpMeltdown
We're not "celebrating" Herman Cain dying. We are pointing out that his death was preventable and that Trump is to blame.
Interesting request coming from someone who wasn't willing to work with her own legislature when they said enough to the state of emergency. Maybe if you weren't single-handedly destroying our economy and our livelihoods, you wouldn't need President Trump to bail you out.
Trump gets a two-dollar kick-back for each pie?
Trump said he didn't talk to Putin about the bounties on our soldiers.  He said they discussed "other things".  With his delay the vote tweet this morning it's pretty obvious what those "other things" were.  Putin was giving him tips on how to stay in office indefinitely!
Trump saying that he wants to delay the election is the closest we will get to Trump accepting defeat in November.  #WeWillVote
"I never even thought of changing the date of the election.  Why would I do that?  November 3rd.  It‚Äôs a good number.  No, I look forward to that election. And that was just made-up propaganda...I‚Äôm not thinking about it at all." - Trump on April 27th.   He lies &amp; lies &amp; lies.
Trump  must still  think  people  should  give  up  their  lives  for  him
Your continued support of Trump is what enables him to do this. The  better wake up and grow up fast.
had a George Wallace-loving uncle who lived in Jamaica, Queens, so I've never been surprised by the similarities between Trump's us-vs-them rhetoric and that of the hardscrabble Alabama-born Wallace.  ‚Ä¶
What if I told you there was a 99% chance of opening schools on time if all Michiganders followed the "Safe Start Order", would you do it? what about 80%? 75%? 60%? 50%? 40%? What will it take for people to give it a chance? As Trump likes to say "What do U have to lose"?
You mean kind of like how trump gave millions of dollars to dead people in the stimulus package?ü§î
Never. He couldn‚Äôt have cared less about what happened to him. I‚Äôm sure Trump won‚Äôt go to his funeral, either.
Full on fascism.  I don't think Trump gives a crap about democracy.
RIP Herman Cain (Major Trump supporter)??? "Herman Cain, a former presidential candidate and ex-CEO of Godfather's Pizza, has died from coronavirus. He was 74."
Herman Cain was a casualty of Donald Trump's ignorance &amp; ineptitude. #TrumpVirus   #RIPHermanCain
Ohhhhh nooooo Herman Cain died after contracting a disease he said was a hoax while he was busy hanging out at a Trump Rally that had people sign a waiver saying they wouldn't hold the campaign accountable if they or a loved one died from COVID contracted at said Campaign Rally.
Hahahaha trump can‚Äôt walk either
Herman Cain, a former presidential hopeful who was once considered by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve, has died after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. He was 74.
Trump‚Äôs call to ‚Äòdelay‚Äô election more about politics than safety, Whitmer says
So....Herman Cain died of covid-19 after attending the 20 June Trump rally.  Why am I not entirely surprised?
Do you think he‚Äôs been gone for a while and it‚Äôs all been covered up? I mean, it‚Äôs all Trump‚Äôs fault. ü§î
YESSSS! I‚Äôve been working on my accent (being from MI has its advantages) and purchasing several hockey sweaters on EBay. I should be able to relocate just before Trump enacts a coup. üèí üá®üá¶
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Governor's have destroyed local businesses in their States. #2020Lockdown It was a HUGE mistake for President Trump to allow Governors' control during time of crisis. President Trump should immediately take total control and #ReOpenAmerica #ReOpenSchools and #StopTesting.
Her fliers generally skate past her Trump past, which isn't a bad idea. Lots of new subdivisions here full of white professionals who'd be OK to split their tickets to get a competent centrist in the White House, but keep their taxes low.
You mean that Trump's "new tone" lasted less than a week?  Weird...
Michigan question: I'm in MI-61 for the state house. I see practically zero Trump campaign paraphernalia, but I'm blanketed in Bronwyn Haltom mailers, signs everywhere, and had a door-knocker come by last week. Is this party strategy? The semi-competitive primary? Personal money?
Sounds like the walls are closing in on ya - this is Trump panic
If Trump delays the election, then all those "Trump/Pence 2020" signs/bumper stickers/t-shirts/onesies are as worthless as Trump and Pence are.  Except Trump will be accommodating the first woman president, President Pelosi.
#NEWS: Now that the damage is done, Bill Gates says schools should reopen despite COVID-19   Gates says 'benefits outweigh the costs' despite coronavirus  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID #ReOpenAmerica THIS WHOLE TIME.
Yeah, those "embers" Trump talked about have turned into raging fires all around us.
Isn't  everyday  since  Trump?
What do you call the front row at a Trump rally? A full set of teeth!
Scroll further. Original video is there. This is a fake and not helpful. Trump is dispicable and does not need our help to show his true colors.
I hate this motherfucker, but this is fake, and its wrong. Makes democrats look desperate and it makes fun of people that are suffering even if they are republican Trump fanatics. Stop. Convince all your friends to vote instead
You scare me... This you get mad at someone for doing but hundreds of people are killed and Trump goes "eh ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not shit we can do" and you are trying to use this nigga as what?? An example?? Trump wouldn't have even turned around for this old man
If you could reason with stupid people, there wouldn't be any Trump supporters. üòÇ
Hey what do you think about this? Trump caught tearing his supporters apart
Well we know  Trump  &amp; his gang has taken  advantage  of  America  &amp; they have  no  intention  of  paying  America  back so what  should  we  do  with  them-Huh?
How weird is it that I 100% agree with Trumps depiction of Trump supporters?
‚ÄòA lot of people said it‚Äôs a fake issue‚Äô: Trump confirms he didn‚Äôt raise Russian bounties with Putin  via    Trump - the Peter Principle personified
Feel good. We're good people over here. And the vast majority of us don't even wanna eff with your gunz. All I ask of people is to vote in your best interest, and try not to be a one-issue voter. Unless that issue is dumping Trump on his trapezoidal head.
What does Trump want to move them back into rat infested slums, landlords are deadbeats, and buildings are toppling down. Decease is rapid, and crime is at its worse.  Turning the clock back to an era where people of color lived like the poorest people in the world.
It is a crisis for them.  They are desperate to milk the US for anything they can before Trump is thrown out on his ass in January.
Gone for trump
Trump isn‚Äôt running against Biden.  He‚Äôs running against voter fraud and all of Silicon Valley   Don‚Äôt worry in the end Trump wins because God wins.   This election is good vs evil  Vote like your life depends on it Because it does
Remember when republicans wanted to lynch Hillary for the Benghazi controversy? Where the fuck is that crowd or even just that energy now that Trump has allowed Russia to pay the taliban to kill US Troops. It‚Äôs exactly the same. AND trump wussed out on asking Putin about it TODAY
Trump  got America  banned  around  the  World  &amp; held captive  by the virus he  just gave up on"Punked Out" &amp; said "You will just  have  to learn  to  live  with  it " This weasel is clueless  &amp; a clear  danger  to  all  of The American  People
Trump is  the  gift  that  keeps  on  giving  to  Putin  but-Why? WHY do  all  roads  still  lead  to  RUSSIA?Trump  and  his  Complicit  GOP  eill be held  Accountable  for  this  BETRAYAL  of America-Trust that

Gary Peters is not a progressive at all. He says he doesn't support medicare for all, etc. Anymore. If he wasn't running against a pro trump republican, he'd be destroyed. There isn't a down ballot progressive running against him, either.
I literally thought this was a fake trump account tweeting this
it pains me to think about how so many Americans aren‚Äôt aware of 75% of the things happening in America. it terrifies me because this is an election year, and if we have to deal with 4 more years of the Trump administration, I don‚Äôt think that we will make it
I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with the republicans except for trump. I‚Äôve not liked the man since the eighties.
Trump tweets that he sees low income housing as damaging to the "Suburban Lifestyle Dream" and harmful to housing prices. He sees no benefit to that housing. He has one audience. And he has no problem communicating his disdain for people not in that audience.
Just got done talking with an elected republican official for state of MI.   - Trump will win Michigan. Michigan will reject the nightmare that is Democratic Socialism
Some guys are engulfed with fear that expresses as negative energy and has no place else to go. It blocks out reason, shades of meaning, kindness, duty. It's just blind RAGE. That's what Trump appeals to, that anger. It's potent &amp; dangerous. The coronavirus doesn't care.
Thankyou for typing that. I made me smile
And here I‚Äôm a person who thinks you people are stupid for backing trump. And Biden.  But then again, I‚Äôve disliked trump since the 1980s. But y‚Äôall don‚Äôt get that part.
By your own reasoning, you can't disagree with the tweet.   If Stalin was authoritarian, therefore it is an authoritarian system then Trump is authoritarian and the US is an authoritarian system. Thus, US actions in pre-USSR can't be defended b/c US is an authoritarian regime.
Um, I don‚Äôt think he was in the lab, doing the work. My guess is that the drug companies would have moved forward with research even if President Trump kept his head in the sand instead of looking-up and commenting periodically.
Quite positive trump is more central than anyone in a while but I could be wrong
Don‚Äôt tell Trump he‚Äôs a good president! Historians will probably look at Trump as the worst president in American history!
‚ÄúThe Trump virus‚Äù I like it!!! That‚Äôs really what it is now.
It‚Äôs too bad Trump isn‚Äôt campaigning as the LAW &amp; ORDER: SVU president. I‚Äôve heard reports of an orange-tinted serial molester who brags about grabbing women by the genitalia without their consent.

He‚Äôs just another mouthpiece for Trump, and when he speaks he sounds like he‚Äôs on speed or cocaine!  He needs to go!  And like the rest of Trumps cronies, he‚Äôs like a turd that won‚Äôt flush. üôÑ #JimJordan

Your next ad has to be about the batshit stuff the Trump family has given a microphone to. Most Americans will balk at that particular collection.
#Breaking: . rep in Israel tells the  that Trump‚Äôs tweets violate Twitter‚Äôs rules, but Iran‚Äôs Khamenei calling for the destruction of Israel &amp; genocide of the Jewish people, DOES NOT.
If Hilary was in it would have been Russia. Biden and Ukraine will escalate. The wars aren't over... Trump is unilateral in taking the country back through trade.
I love how Axios kept asking the biggest making Trump sound more like a 4 year old trying to explain why the sky is blue.

Since this is a dance party and when it comes to Putin, Trump is the biggest chicken there is!
Pandemic, hurricanes, and the Trump Administration...oh my!
Wait. What makes today different than yesterday?   I mean...other than the Barr being significantly lowered, ‚ÄúDr‚Äù Immanuel being batshit fucking insane, and Trump figuring out that no one likes him?   Holy shit!! I can‚Äôt wait till tomorrow!

No room for traitors in exchange of releasing terrorists!!! You know, some Libs I‚Äôve debated on here have even acknowledged that this wasn‚Äôt the best move in the Biden/Obama era, kind of like Trump bombing Syria or John McCain POW comments. Not the best move (Cont)
I really do not see a difference between biden and trump, and therefore will vote for    If she doesn't win, i really don't care who does.

So I can #VoteByMail if it's for Trump? Well, at least now we know he knows he's spreading disinformation. Not that there are consequences for his actions, but hey, now we know.
The column lives up to the headline: "America is suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons."
No, but it does cure covid. Trump's been soaking in it for years and he's healthy as a horse.
It was a joke. Vote trump
Really  Trump? Wtf is really  wrong  with  Trump,? He isn't  crazy enough  he wants this voodoo Yahoo's  ADVICE?Oh hell No!
No I think Putin and MBS and couple other countries are and Trump owes them Bigly and between that and his malignant narcissism and his insatiable greed making sure America stays the greatest country on earth isn‚Äôt his ever the first thing on his mind.
Trump‚Äôs New COVID Doctor Says Sex With Demons Makes You Sick  via
"I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her," President Trump says of the video he retweeted where a woman claims masks don't work &amp; there's a cure for Covid-19. Instead of explaining the contradiction given he's endorsed masks, Trump left the room.
And Republicans  think Trump  is  Sane!!!! Wow-Yikes! No wonder  America  is  ass deep  in  trouble
Trump  runs from strong PROFESSIONAL  Women Reporters like the natural  born coward he is
Trump runs away AGAIN-What a disgusting  DISGRACE  &amp; Coward  Trump  is
You most likely read it on one of Trump‚Äôs tweets!
"Trump would cease to be president on noon of Jan. 20 if Congress does not certify him as the winner, passing his authority as commander in chief of the military to the acting president, the speaker of the House of Representatives."
Can they not just shut the f*** up with this stupid logic, for fck‚Äôs sake. Let‚Äôs say Biden loses, Oompa Loompa stays on. If the supposed blue wave happens, Dems controlling the senate AND the house will effectively castrate trump and vice versa. That‚Äôs only 4 years of gridlock.
Another of Trump's Con Jobs perpetrated on the American Public. It's all because he want's us to believe his narrative, which is ALWAYS laughable.
Really  America  hel0 our people  not the Feds or Trump  and his Gop
In MICHIGAN  armed Trumpers  militants show up for a VIRUS  protest-Pushed inside  the state Capitol but Trump  calls  them  warriors-patriots but unarmed  moms &amp; vets are terrorists-treasonist? America  Trumps  Gotta  Go  #VoteTrumpOut2020  then  #LockTrumpUp
Absolutely! Barr showed  his political  Advocate  for Trump  colors
Quit crying like your buddy...no one like you are Trump
But will bend over for anything Trump whips out.

I'm more confused to who the heck all those leftist are that are voting for Trump. Also who are the super authoritarian peeps voting LP ?
Going by the location of your tweet in reference to mine, you‚Äôre asking for a citation on me sayingg it is t trump sending out the yadda yadda ballot.  Fucking hell.  Snarky snide comment. Dude, read.
What facts?  That elections are run on the state level when i said ‚Äútrump‚Äù or made a blanket remark regarding the democrats?   Oh, how about the part where I get to say my entire household already got their absentee ballots?  Hmmm ... any republican governored states issue them?
I am dressing up as Trump. Scary fucking clown. Gives me the shivers
He bashes it over and over.Yet Saturday I got a flyer addressed to the previous resident that stated ‚Äúmail in voting is safe and go to this website ..to secure your right to vote by mail‚ÄùDonald Trump.Paid for by the RNC. He panders to whomever is stupid enough to believe him
Wow, like agent orange himself is stuffing those envelopes.  Dude, I said trump as in the republican party.  It isn‚Äôt the republican party sending out absentee ballots that can get ‚Äòlost in the mail‚Äô.  Is that better for you now?
Like tRump...
It isnt trump sending out absentee ballots that can get ‚Äòlost in the mail‚Äô if they aren‚Äôt voted on ‚Äòcorrectly‚Äô.
I'm surprised that it didn't end with "I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message."
Oh, believe me, he did this all by himself. You know damn well he don‚Äôt listen to no one and not to say to give someone credit when he knows damn well that person(s) can be right. Trump wants all the credit so this is his credit (fail).
Remember when the U.S.A. was the world standard for individual freedoms, family values and social morality?  Remember when Americans liked each other? "Make America American Again" DUMP TRUMP!!!
Well all our INTELLIGENCE  agencies  &amp; even Trump's  judiciary  says different "Putin inyetfered on behalf  of  Trump  " read it &amp; weep #DisbarBarr  #LockBarrUp
Bill Barr  is a bogus  fake excuse  for  an  Attorney  General-He was rigged in by Trump  and  for  Trump  not America-He chose  to  be  Trump's  personal  lawyer &amp; protector-political Advocate "None of these are an Attorney  Generals  Job" #DisbarBarr  #LockBarrUp
KARMA: it will be Trump's downfall. He's had hits from it all his life, failed marriages, businesses, relationships. Now he's taking it to a whole new level, world wide. I can't imagine him escaping life without getting destroyed by bad Karma, and it's beginning to take shape.
This is your big strong brave president? Trump  is a Weak-Whiney-Wimp that hides in bunkers  and bulids another  wall to PROTECT "Him" against "Us" while he hided in "The People's  House" &amp; attacks  us on our own  soil  #TrumpDictatorship  He belongs  in  a  Prison for life
Trumpity Trump and the Bootlickers
I don't understand how people think Trump and Biden are even slightly different
Careful with the blood pressure. He is in deep shit, probably from being in Trump's ass for so long.
Trump  is a  #DrugDealer with a fake product  that  doesn't  work  but he has a stockpile  he  can't  give away

Glad to hear that turned out ok, but there are psychos out there, please be careful...you won't want trump showing to your door
I work in an area that is unbelievably FULL of Trump's base. I see at least one MAGA hat per night at work. I can't even comprehend the mental gymnastics needed for these people to conclude that this guy is intelligent OR competent. I wouldn't trust him to run a McDonald's!!
Yes, political desk jockeys.  Any NCOs who have boots on ground, where the bullet meets the meat?  I‚Äôm sure that Seal Team 6 guy who killed Osama Bin Laden is a Trump Supporter ü§î
Same. Also, for all the fear-mongering getting spewed nonstop, let‚Äôs review a few things. Down ballet it‚Äôs looking more and more likely that Dems will gain control of the senate and the house, essentially castrating any Trump ‚Äúaction‚Äù even if he were to win. But sure, ignore it.

Louis DeJoy might have been an odd pick to run the Postal Service. His big calling card is the millions he's spent to elect Trump (and get his wife an ambassadorship in the process). No wonder people are worried about how his actions threaten vote by mail.

Don‚Äôt worry you have the silent majority as well as those who have the balls to stand up for you Mr President! We know the left is SCUM along with the faithless and wicked satanic democrat party. TRUMP 2020!Donald Trump.
Someone should create an advent calendar for the election.  It could count down the days toward the second coming of democracy. #RIPJohnLewis #Trump #Resist #COVID19 #TrumpMeltdown #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
these shutdowns and the economic fallout were INEVITABLE. The numbers were a surprise to no one &amp; to suggest that this is all Trump's fault pretty much shows a partisan mindset that is impervious to rational analysis and is only concerned with touting one's "team"
a lot can be ascribed to Trump, but COVID lockdowns, the entire reason for the (expected) downturn, cannot be blamed on him, particularly when he is also accused of pushing to end lockdowns prematurely by those who seem to want to shut country down for the next 2 years.

as long as you support Trump in any way, I will never vote for you. #DumpTrump2020
relationships with Fox should concern his supporters . anything that isn‚Äôt a praise to him is fake news and yet supporters are oblivious.Trump claims all media is fake at this point could it be he‚Äôs just a con artist stealing taxpayers money for his own profit .
You know, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you do for the American people, some will never be happy with your performance.  Consider the source on that.  TRUMP 2020. More in four than Obamagate in eight.
Guess the Dem Governors should NOT send positive patients to NURSING homes around their state spreading the virus. Stop blaming Trump.
you realize that this man is NOT a scientist, has no degree or credentials in medicine, public health, epidemiology or chemistry. Why the hell are you relying on this? He is a TV personality, you twit. He's no better than Trump touting a miracle cure.

And Farrington just was on  and is solidly for Dump Trump, so that is for whom I must vote.
Looking them over, I'm pretty sure Joe Farrington is the only reasonable choice. (Saying that, I'm waiting for the Emily Rafi ad that says she's as much a Trump suck-up as Afendoulis and Meijer.)
You know it was for the money just like the rest of the gold diggers, but thats her business what they stand for and steal from us lie to us is our business! I don't care if she f Bigfoot himself what makes her trump trash is what they all are in my opinion traitors!
I think I know who I'm *not* voting for in the MI-3 primary. Afendoulis and Meijer sniping at each other about who "doesn't really like Trump" is so Trumpian in its Trumpidity.

Don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt make it easy and label themselves Trump Republicans. If they truly support the madman, then own it.
you had a big mouth about Trump's handling of the situation. you had MONTHS of lead time, saw the unfolding disaster in NYC and you STILL screwed the pooch. You may be America's most incompetent governor. ALL these deaths are on YOUR hands, Newsom.
Judging by conversations with cousins, because they are a bit deranged. The mental gymnastics that are required to keep supporting Trump is a strain on them.
You must spend a lot of time thinking about trump and Melania... weird but you do you

Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I don't get it. Trump was attempting to explain the cognitive test he took. He sounds like a blowhard, but he accurately described it and his account is coherent. compare to this:
Your boy Trump is a Democrat? Who knew....ü§°ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Same here.  Every time I pass a Trump yard sign an "ugh, really?" comes out of my mouth.
So, what you‚Äôre saying is, this is trump‚Äôs America?
We are in full agreement, then. I define any "real" Christian as those who are truly loving and compassionate, without hypocrisy. Anyone for trump is not practising those values, IMHO.
So now that trump is wearing a mask did his cult members trip over themselves to buy them or are they just saying they wore them the whole time? How do they keep their stories straight? #cultoftrump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Everyone realizes man person woman tv were not on the test. trump simply named what he saw at the interview .also this test is for dementia screening nothing to do with a person IQ . Trump is not congnitively sound . #AcedTheCognitiveTestBy
I successfully ate my dinner without needing a bib.....I was totally trolling Trump
I agree with what you guys are saying, but I don't see it being any worse than 2016 in any dimension, except for the fact that the Trump will probably retain his following and voice a bit longer than Hillary did...unless Trump loses. Then it may escalate from 2016 a bit.
More importantly, this nonsense about Trump refusing or meaningfully resisting leaving office has all the evidenceless drama that it seems to have every 4 years when people make this claim. Trump has bad character, but he's neither stupid, smart, nor tyrannical enough for that.
dont know if you have seen this but it scary what the democrats have planned if win. How there going to set out to purge anyone that supported trump
Ok, since you seem to need a breakdown.  You claim that folks are afraid of expressing their political views because of ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs special forces‚Äù.  Meaning, in your tiny warped little brain, that these 62% are liberals and not conservatives. I‚Äôm curious to know (Cont)

Where on earth is ZEE getting information? CNN= Central Network of Nuts? He obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. Trump is not perfect but Biden is literally losing his mind!!
However, lawmakers on Monday added limits to the Insurrection Act after Trump threatened to invoke it to deploy active-duty troops against recent civil unrest over racial injustice. The largely party-line vote was 215-190.

Trump stooges cause more violence. Period.
Mark my words: if Trump loses, the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day will be the most dangerous 78 days in American history. Especially if he loses so decisively that he can‚Äôt make a case to contest it.
Trump was bad from the start even at his rally‚Äôs he was a rascist made fun of reporters and spread lies and fake news we can‚Äôt afford to allow trump to continue his presidency he‚Äôs a terrible person and is allowing his own people suffer the lower class are homeless oron the brink
We had an election during the civil war, ww1 and ww2. Also the great depression but we can't have one now because Trump's gonna lose. It doesn't matter if if it's vote by mail or in person. Doesn't matter if it's by carrier pigeon or mental telepathy. Trump will lose.
Really? What makes you think we're worrying about Trump tweets. We have more important issues here in the real world! We Vote Biblically not politically.
If America isn‚Äôt safe, it‚Äôs happened under trump
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
But with Trump tweeting this he could depress turnout on his own base. We need to look at that as a good thing as it may tilt a state
And I don‚Äôt want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn‚Äôt question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. üôÑNo wonder
Everybody talks about well we got to take out Trump so what really is the plan what comes next?
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn‚Äôt for progressive policies
Let‚Äôs hope so!!! Keep dicking it up trump...
I can‚Äôt tell you how many voters, even strong trump voters, hate the twitter sprees.
Remember guys if you can vote early do it don‚Äôt wait till last minute. Find your LOCAL POLING stations. Check hours. Please retweet. Trump is going too try to mess with post office‚Äôs.

He meant the Trump virus
You should check the live feeds out. Streamers are giving tours across the street from the Federal building to show everyone that there is no mass destruction to any businesses. It's very eye opening. If you just use half your brain you'll see that Trump is lying to your faces.2/
Remember the good old days like 3 years ago when Trump talked about his dick during a presidential debate?  Good times back then.  Good Times.
Trump just tweeted about his Republican friend who died of the Corona Virus today. Did you happen to catch that tweet?

The Corona Virus numbers are down, unless Trump schedules a rally.
Why not? I thought Trump was funding these small businesses. Oh I forgot he only funds billionaires like kanye and elons businesses
Nice talk. I‚Äôm not talking about research. I‚Äôm not medical. I‚Äôm talking about the dishonesty of the whole Democratic Party and their propaganda, especially when it comes to anything Trump. Common sense will tell you that Trump saw those ideas somewhere and repeated it. That‚Äôs it
Donald Trump supports cancel culture.
AdmittingüôÑ... That‚Äôs the whole reason he mentioned it.   Do yourself a favor, instead of stop watching CNN/MSNBC clips w/Trump coverage or anything related. Watch the whole interview/press conference and then right after, watch CNN. Pretend Trump is your uncle &amp; see if it‚Äôs fair
I know exactly what you mean Cher. We do need him more then ever right now. He made Trump cringe. And we need someone who can do that. Make Trump cringe and scared all at once. I loved watching Trump cringe with fear when John Lewis got after him.
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
Yup unfortunately I learned that lesson this year I was never much into presidency until I realized with trump how much power a president really has thru executive power and how he can skip congress and do what he wants on multiple occasions
I think the turtle has drinking some of that alien sperm. He's been drinking it right outta the alien's (Trump) sperm sack.
Our problems started with George w bush who bankrupted America and we were looking at a depression and Obama took over with his help of quantum easing ethics he managed to put us in a recession and put the economy in the positive then trump took over and undid everything obama
I'll patiently wait. This sh*t show is only going to get worse. Trump has absolutely no idea what to do at this point.
The most dangerous president in history of presidents Bernie vowed to take down trump no matter what for his supporters to turn their back on him for making a tough decision he had to make is completely unethical and shameful everyone needs to do their part to save this country
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
I was waiting for some piece of crap to tie the 2 together. You libs don't miss a chance to jab one of the best Presidents of our time, just like one of the worst presidents of our time (Obamy mammy) doing a EULOGY and bashes Trump NO CLASS
You wanted to take a cheap shot with no real basis because you‚Äôve been watching a bunch of other people do it and I jumped in your way and messed it up. It is political. Trump was right. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
trump also didn‚Äôt listen to medical professionals when they told him what to to to handle Covid.
That‚Äôs never been the point!!! It‚Äôs TRUMP... he‚Äôs rambling on and mentioning things he‚Äôs seen. He‚Äôs not recommending medical advice! NOBODY in their right mind would take it like that without super stretching. You might be like HUH? But, to act like it‚Äôs anything else is silly
Trump has no sense of humor.
No kidding.  Trump is a genius on triggering the left. ü§£
I agree. I was talking about individuals that are dumb enough to believe what Trump says, i.e masks don‚Äôt work, we don‚Äôt need to social distance. Not that anyone deserves to die, that‚Äôs horrible.
Question? Does anyone know if Donald Trump or any off his family owns stock in company pushing hidroxycloriken? Sorry about spelling guys.
And to see people tweeting President Pelosi shows you how people really just don‚Äôt get it. You need strong leaders that will actually do something that will fight and call shit out Pelosi has done the bare minimum to take Trump out.
Didn‚Äôt that lawyer guy that went to jail say that Trump was going to be really difficult to take him out of the White House so here is my thing why didn‚Äôt Pelosi and Schumer do everything they could to take his ass out. I mean seriously people should be outraged and angry at
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden‚Äù
I find it no coincidence that Trump sowed seeds of voter suppression on Twitter, on the day of John Lewis' funeral. And also on a day that Herman Cain (who contracted COVID-19 at Trump's Tulsa rally) died.  He's not a Commander In Chief, he's a Deflector of Grief.
You‚Äôre not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you‚Äôre not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Trying to imagine the ‚Äútizzy‚Äù Republicans would be in if Obama had suggested half the shit Trump ‚Äújokes‚Äù about.  Left or right, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing funny about a sitting president acting like an autocrat.
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn‚Äôt a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I was pissed when I found out Obama asked Bernie to step down I was pissed at Bernie for agreeing and Obama for even getting involved but we can‚Äôt allow trump to win again think of the kids under the age of 18 suffering with their parents on corners They are everywhere inMichigan
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally‚Äôs when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it‚Äôs time to put others before myself we can‚Äôt allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don‚Äôt vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren‚Äôt gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn‚Äôt my first pick either
Interesting how Trump has turned the left into war hawks...
We can drop it off at City Hall. They have a drop box inside and out with a lock on it. Oh and did you watch any of John Lewis's funeral. Former President Barack Obama did a Eulogy for him. It was great. At one point he didn't mention any names. But he said a lot about TRUMP.
Hey Cher you want hear some great news. Michigan has several Thousand people who are mailing in there votes. We're going to PISS OFF TRUMP ROYAL LOL. I can't wait to see what he now with him. And best thing is it's called mail in voting. But we don't really have to mail it in.

I love when Big Gretch posts, she brings out the Trump supportersü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Republican Jesus,has granted Trump and friends,special powers,to override,the constitution.
The emoluments clause,doesn‚Äôt apply to Trump.
Trump's folly
Trump is winning over the ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù vote.
Hey dummy
Have you actually watched that full press conference where Trump ‚Äúrecommends injecting bleach to cure covid‚Äù?üôÑ U know there‚Äôs actually at least 2 new innovations that show what he was saying wasn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounded? UV light injections and a wild new ionization treatment
Herman Cain‚Äôs last words are rumored to be ‚ÄúDo something really dumb for Trump! What do you have to lose?‚Äù
Thank you, you expressed it perfectly. Much respect for Republicans who speak up against Trump.
Hes entirely capable of suspending the election.Trump doesn't really do law.
Pffftttt...Though Trump has now lost 50% of his black vote.
Ahh yes, more reason for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdelay distraction,‚Äù looks like a cavalcade of bad news is hitting today.   Cain‚Äôs passing, the GDP report and now Flynn‚Äôs case being heard by the full panel, not a good news day for big Donny.
Trump just lost 50% of his black vote.
W. T. F. !! Trump has no constitutional authority, nor does Barr, to move, delay or cancel an election. The same goes for extending term of office.
Without Trump, I don‚Äôt think there would have been this rebranding. After enduring Trump, I see Bush as a horrible president but a man able to show empathy and compassion.
Really getting tired of Trump distracting us from his horror show of an administration with even more impeachable offenses.
If at this point you still support trump, there's no hope for your smooth brain.
Gtfoh if your tweeting PresidentPelosi. Pelosi has done nothing to stop Trump she has only enabled him and the Republicant party.
Wish I could be reassured about the things Trump ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù but somehow always gets away with after doing them.
I don't say the H word lightly, but I fucking hate Trump.
He looks scared because he knows they should be wearing masks. He's scared of getting sick, but he's more scared of Donald Trump.
This is clearly a power play by Trump. We could hold an election, but he refuses to even try
you take offense and claim that you were asked that question on TV because you are black when the name of the group you belong to is literally called ‚Äúblack voices for trump‚Äù.. fake outrage or jus completely oblivious?
Out and out cowards of the highest degree. Tell Trump to fuck off or resign.
Trump‚Äôs been calling them fake news so long they started believing it themselves. It‚Äôs battered wife syndrome.
Trump has the media on his side.He would never have won the nomination in 2016 without it.
No'legal' mechanism...And we all know what a stickler Trump is for the law...
One thing I DO respect about Trump is on the same day he opens up a constitutional crisis, he follows it up with this. Just an incomprehensible amount of range and hustle.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Wow it‚Äôs like everyone who says Trump can‚Äôt go any lower is certainly always wrong
He will receive a much more heartfelt tweet from Trump than John Lewis did.
There's a middle ground between dismissive and panic, which is just the recognition that this is another addition to the mile-long list of Why Donald Trump Shouldn't Be President.
Donald Trump in the next week or so: "Since everybody hates me and doesn't want to postpone the election I'm going to deploy my Federal goon squad to *insert majority black city here* to make sure elections go SUPER GOOD. FRAUD!"
Trump may be a mere proto-fascist, but he's part of the unfortunate nationalist trend that's gaining mass appeal. I think it's safe to say Poland and Hungary have definitely descended all the way to fascism.
Every1 show up to the protest set for Friday&amp;Saturday. We need a MASSIVE amount of people to show up. The Feds are coming to OUR CITY apparently. If you aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs going on in Portland well buckle the fuck up, bc ur precious President Trump is starting a god damn war.
Wrong.  The term is constitutionally fixed, not the election date.  His term ends in January whether we vote or not.
Donald Trump doesn't have the power to delay the election. Congress does.  1.4 million people filed first-time unemployment claims last week.   United States GDP fell 32.9% between April and June.  John Lewis is an American Hero. #Facts
I agree with you,  but I also think Trump is more damaging to himself than any Dem ever could.  Delaying the election is an absolute no-no, dictator move.  It's been telegraphed for months that he'd try that as well
So much confusion right now. Pray for the Spirit of Truth to sweep across America and spread throughout the world. #Trump2020 #GodWins #GodBlessAmerica #COVID19 #quoteoftheday #AmericasFrontlineDoctors #love #JesusSaves #Rosary #Peace #MusicIsLife #Trump #USA
You think the GOP care?   and their gaggle of Trump shills are so corrupt to where they will absolutely not care about the president wanting to move an election their party is allegedly losing. The stench of corruption travels a long way from DC to MI.
His distractions skirt the line of authoritarian far too often and we‚Äôve yet to see any significant pushback from Republicans.  How many impeachable distractions has Trump had?
Trump's trying to distract everyone from the worst quarterly GDP contraction in the last 70 years. His failure to prepare the nation for COVID-19 has done unimaginable damage to the economy. This is his disaster, and he has to face the voters in November.
This is where the Republican Party really needs to take a stand. There's nothing wrong with mail-in voting, and now Trump is trying to prevent the election from happening.
Look at this sissy ass bitch Donald Trump.Crying about a Barbie  a nice little sissy bitch daddy,can will send a secret agent to buy you one.
I want Trump‚Äôs secret police to forcibly remove these people when we‚Äôre all allowed to attend games again.
Donald Trump just tweeted that he wants to delay the election. Lord help.
GDP shrank by 32.9% last quarter.  doesn‚Äôt want to lead, leaving the Coronavirus response to the governors. I‚Äôd argue that if the response had been federalized and uniform, we‚Äôd be in a much better position. However, this way Trump has his scapegoats!
Has anything Trump has done been legal?!?!?
Yes. Just reported another of Trump's false &amp; misleading mail-in election Tweets. It's beyond rhetoric. It's completely FALSE info!! It's my RIGHT to mail-in vote &amp; I won't stand for anything else! Hes also trying to slow/shut down USPS deliveries. Criminal Twitter acctüôÑüëçüèº.
America, do NOT let #Trump take away your #MailInBallot right as a Citizen of this Country.
Dr. Fauci simply has to get up in the morning and brush his teeth to look more competent than Trump.  That girl is a ditz!

Oh gosh, if you‚Äôre poor and voting for someone who wants to keep you out of certain neighborhoods, you are a special kind of stupid. Trump is not trying to help you.  Lol

The best part off Donald Trump ran down his mother‚Äôs ass.
Do you agree that Trump never once said anything about injecting bleach? And since that never happened, its unethical for a congressman to say ‚Äúhe used those exact words‚Äù at a congressional hearing while using that inaccurate statement as proof of Trumps carelessness?
It's all about money. All of these guys would have taken a position in the Trump administration. Trump neutering Jeb and crushing Rubio cost these guys a ton of money and this is how they're making some of it back (besides not paying people who worked for them).
You really should apologize and admit what a terrible thing that was to infer and promise to vote for trump to show you‚Äôre not a racist
I can think of 6,422 reasons Trump has lost 10 points among white Michigan voters, and I'm a white Michigan voter.
Are you trying to argue there‚Äôs no way to argue something objectively if you have an opinion? Like, if I were to agree with something Trump says or does it must mean I‚Äôm bias towards him?
I have but 1 protest vote for trump i can make.  Won‚Äôt be volunteering to drive shut ins to the polls this year.
He's scared. Trump is afraid of Putin.
I hand deliver mine to the city clerk‚Äôs office.  Seeing Trump‚Äôs fear of a fair election is so satisfying.
Not New Tone Trump!
All of it. It's called a dog whistle but trump uses a blow horn. He just assumes all white people are racist like him.
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
I know. I couldn't believe it when I heard that Trump was sending them here to Detroit. Especially when all the protests we had weren't violent. I heard its because of all the shootings. So now we'll have double of the shootings with these guys.

Trump's speeches have been nothing but one big run-on sentence that doesn't have a point.
This is racism. Trump will spin it as part of his sick and twisted bullshit ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù narrative and keeping suburbs safe, but at its core it‚Äôs racism. He‚Äôs a racist. His supporters...well...all I know is I typically vote for those who align with my views.
Trump is scared of Putin. Either Putin has something on him (likely) or trump really is just a giant chicken shit.  Or he really doesn‚Äôt give a shit about this country. Which is it?  None are good for America.

Trump,Putin,and Xi,are reshaping the world,to suit their interests.They are the new world order.
It is to Trump.
Mail-In Voting abolishes the decades long work done by the GOP to gerrymander districts to their favor.  Trump is now trying to destroy the Post Office.  This isn't just about votes.  This also about people getting medications, goods.  He's putting an embargo on his own people.
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
Just because Trump hates Barack Obama. And I'm right about this. Trump does hate Obama just by what he's doing with all the things Obama did when he was in office. Trump is repealing everything. That's so he can have all the White people hate all the Black people like he does.
Exactly how I‚Äôm looking at it. Either way we all lose. May as well be trump in response to this shitty nomination.
Trump does not like to suffer,inconvenience.
Thought it was a Trump 2020 ad
Want to make Covid-19 disappear?  Have Trump sign an executive order stating that for the safety of all Americans the presidential election will be postponed until the virus is eliminated.  All talk of Covid will end by Monday.  Dems will mask masks illegal.
But yesterday a congressman stated ‚Äúthe exact words Trump used were to inject bleach‚Äù this is my point! They outright lie so people will believe it because most think if it‚Äôs said in a congressional hearing it must be true. They operate with pure propaganda!

I *cant* remember the last Trump sign
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you‚Äôre going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.

As a matter of fact these greedy rich people crawl through tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of income tax and cry broke. How can Trump who says he doesn't pay income tax handle tax revenues from the middle class and funnel it to the rich through fake businesses.
I promise you, We will boycott paying federal taxes. I sware...If they continue to misappropriate our tax dollars to subsidize rich people aka phony small businesses, we the middle class tax payers that pay the most taxes will stop paying fed taxes. Heck Trump doesn't.
Trump is running the conservative version of the Obama 2012 campaign. Scorched-earth mixed with targeted regulatory action towards the base and a little side of over the top rhetoric.
There have been MULTIPLE pro Hydroxychloroquine studies too... the Medical Field has different opinions. The Only reason there is a strong aversion to it by many is that Trump is pushing it. Even a broken clock is right twice a day

WTF is honorable about Trump?? The man has no morals. Every nasty thing he had said and done it's a sin, per your Bible.
CNN ‚Äúthe right arm for slo Joe‚Äù has 80% of its programming devoted to the virus. They think it hurts Trump. It makes them look like an inept news organization. So what else is new!
That's not Bill Barr's main focus. Nor is it Trump's.
But you made it sound like the DPD is thrilled to have the feds here. They are NOT. And if you believe that Homeland Security and Trump have no hidden agenda, you are being naive.
You implied we would be better off with AG Barr ‚Äúgone‚Äù, which insinuates pos Nadler is good. in fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. I agree that there are too many people in politics that haven‚Äôt done shit in all their years. That‚Äôs precisely what so many hoped trump would change.

Trump had the govt. purchase millions of doses early on in case it worked...it doesn't.

Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
Btw. Donald Trump may have been a registered Democrat but you probably shouldn't use that as example seeing as he would probably sell his daughter to the highest bidder if he could make a few bucks.

No actually I cant see that only in my cropped retweet. My mother falls for commie propaganda like you do. She is pro life, pro Trump, and a nurse. She even agrees the mask thing is useless unless your fitted for an N95. She wont wear a mask in a store either.
Trump had a stroke,which affected his right side.
I dont listen to Tom Perez. Half the time he doesn't even know what he's talking about Cher.  That's probably because Trump is telling him what to say. And Trump doesn't know what he's talking about every time he opens his mouth. All I hear when Trump talks is BLAH BLAH BLAH.
That is what truly matters,to Trump.
The Plandemic was concocted  by Trump,and his Chinese partners,in the CCP.. Q Anon is  department of Chinese intelligence  is anti American .Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe recounts his experience briefing  after  White House defended Trump from accusations that he doesn't read his briefings.  Just like his claim he didn't know about Russia bounties on US soliders?
Trump presser is a horrorshow
I will go to the polls in a hazmat suit if I have to; just to vote for whomever is opposing trump.  No one will be able to say my vote doesn‚Äôt count.
It‚Äôs been a ‚Äúhoax‚Äú to tRump until now, when he can turn it to his advantage.
Lincoln &amp; FDR weren't fucked like Trump is...that is the difference.
Segregated seating? Wow...Trump really has brought back old times... wow...segregated seating? I guess money can make people do all kinds of things.
CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so.   via
The poor may not be important to our President; but make no mistake: they‚Äôre very important to God.   Trump‚Äôs demeaning of affordable housing and therefore the poor isn‚Äôt just despicable, it‚Äôs anti-gospel.
Trump Campaign wants to delay election the same day it's announced that our economy has had the worst contraction since WWII of 32.9%...comparatively it shrank 12.9% during the Great Depression in 1932.  OF COURSE HE WANTS TO DELAY THE ELECTION &amp; retain power as long as possible!
Compare our current downturn of 33% to 1932 during the Great Depression - the US economy contracted 12.9%.  IT'S ABOUT THE NUMBERS.  37% of USA is out of work.  USA coronavirus - 4.5 million infected &amp; over 150,000 dead.  Trump's plan: to keep &amp; use the power he has while he can.

They also believe believe that Trump is a racist,so...
And on top of all this, there are 10s of BLATANTLY racist Trump quotes and tweets. Denying these happened is wrong. There is no context in which the things he has said is acceptable and it has only invited and enabled hatred in the country.
And then again, of course minority unemployment is lowest, because unemployment overall is the lowest in 50 years. The last time unemployment was at 3.5% was 1969, just after the civil rights act. So of course it is the lowest ever now for minorities. No thanks to Trump though
If Trump was handed an economy in the middle of a recession, would you blame Trump for the recession? No. So why should you credit him for the good economy Obama handed him.
Unemployment rate decline has slowed significantly under Trump
The reason unemployment is so low is because of a trend Obama set during the Obama administration years. Trump is falling behind Obama‚Äôs 2nd term in unemployment rate decline by 37%. If you look at the statistics, The unemployment now is a direct result of the Obama presidency.
Your first point has the ‚ÄúMy friend is black, so I‚Äôm not racist energy‚Äù, and your second point is correlation and not causation. As someone who has done research on the Trump administration‚Äôs unemployment claims, it is untrue.
Trump says he didn't bring up Russian bounty scheme on Vladimir Putin call  via
Why?  Because Trump hates strong, capable women who are superior in intellect and character. Just like the Fauci debacle, he cannot stand not being seen as number one. It‚Äôs actually pathetic. We have lost our standing in the world because of his pettiness and ignorance.
I hope history repeats itself. It can start with   they'll get Barr and every other person - until everyone in the Trump corruption spiderweb is held accountable for their crimes...EVERYONE!
So what cities has Trump deployed his militia to? Well, ah - there's Portland. New York City? Seriously  - where's your NYC pride man?  What other cities in the United States have been invaded?
It's official Trump has never discussed bounties with Putin - even though he KNOWS ABOUT THEM. He does nothing to support our military...  He's going down in flames &amp; trying to take the country with him.  UNITED we STAND, divided we FALL.   VOTE BLUE.
Trump.
Exactly right. Trump is saying the country is so bad under his leadership we should reward him with another 4 years so he can burn down what is left of the neighborhood. Bonus on his time: the pandemic continues to rage and kill Americans because of no federal response plan. üò°
Yet here in Michigan a teacher &amp; coach was fired for one post! Simply saying trump is our president. Which is a fact. His students , past students &amp; their parents are trying to fight it!
Serious question. Do you think if you feel safe ,voting at the polls would be best because the vote is counted in real time and Biden can crush Trump early but if we have mail in voting, results take longer to come in and it may be contested. Any thoughts? Thank you

Yeah guess what, the polls don‚Äôt matter until the election they where that way in 2016 yet trump won, because the people that wanted to push it over spoke and voted when it was necessary

Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud

Trump taps into fear and anger of people that have lost things. Then finds a scapegoat-liberals, the Left etc.Enlists Fox, Breitbart as ‚Äúproof‚Äù. Creates true believers. Brainwashing of vulnerable people, who cannot critically think
Beats me, but this is the lens through which Trump/GOP view everything policywise.
As always, your list of "swing states" may vary from mine.  Obviously it's actually an AMERICAN problem, but Trump &amp; the GOP have decided to politicize EVERYTHING. You can't pretend it "doesn't matter" when *policies* are being decided based on this crap.

Absolutely!!!!! It‚Äôs has to change maybe president Trump can issue a executive order to the big teck companies to stop using their systems to systematically remove rubublicans, conservatives, or any information put out by an American citizen. This is racism as much as politics.

Trump stopped travel from China and Europe back in like January. China knew they could get their country to quarantine and China knew that Americans would not quarantine correctly to save themselves,,, because too many Americans have false Pride,, so the virus spreads.
I read that tweet earlier how Trump called out Twitter and I am not sure why they would not support him more. I would think that Trump created a ton of Revenue for Twitter the Democrats pockets are deep.
That's good, but really who else were they going to endorse? Trump is by far and away the Clear Choice to be the President for the next four years, I mean who are we kidding? Biden is a criminal and the 241,000 police officers should arrest Joe Biden. How does that sound?
I already mentioned earlier a couple times today,, but I really think that Trump is probably most likely going to win all 50 states this year. I just got that gut feeling that Biden is going to get decimated in the election beyond belief.

Even if every single Democrat in the House and Senate was poor, what 20 GOP senators are voting to remove Donald Trump? Your original point was it was Dem corruption that kept Trump in office. That is just plain wrong.
What charges do you think would have moved 20  to vote to remove Trump and Pence?
This is more than incrementalism on climate (and is far superior to Trump's put coal lobbyists in charge of the EPA):

Reminder: A top Republican and Trump donor now runs the USPS. He has no postal experience. He is there to destroy it.
It would only be hypocrisy if he at the same time advocated for those same opinions. Trump has been consistent in that his actions actually match what he says.  Of course, if you watch nothing but CNN, you'd never get to see that.
None of you ever had one reason to doubt the effectiveness of any medications until one was mentioned specifically by Trump. Then a Democrat gave fish tank cleaner to her husband and killed him and the media told you that was the medication. Now you hate that medication. Sheep.

Did Trump personally tell him it was a joke? No. Because it wasn't. Comrade Cornyn needs to shut the fuck up.
Of course it is, and there's nothing Trump can do to change that. But he can still persuade Republican governors to screw up the Electoral College and force the presidential election to the House, as is called for in the Constitution. Then what?

If Trump somehow delayed the election, his term is still up in January. So is Pence‚Äôs. The question is: could California do an end run, vote Pelosi back, get herself re-Speakered, &amp; become president by default? Probably not, but it would be funny in an ‚Äúeverything is on fire‚Äù way

Despite US law, Trump raises specter of delaying election  via
everytime experts are like ‚Äútrump can‚Äôt do that, that won‚Äôt happen‚Äù we might not wanna listen to them.
GDP drops 32 plus percent the highest in history.  Don‚Äôt worry Trump will get that up to a number much closer to 100% next quarter remember Trump can bungle anything all by himself as long as the GOP continues to cheer him on. I bet he can bankrupt America in no time
Lot of things happened today but of all of the news bad for trump this is the worse we are headed toward a democrat landslide because of the incompetence of a flawed man who destroyed our economy and killed thousands of Americans
Idea for a commercial- "Pretty soon scientists will develop a vaccine for Covid-19.  Our society will depend on our ability to get that vaccine to everyone, regardless of their place in society.  Do we really want Trump in charge of vaccine distribution"?
Why a former Michigan GOP leader joined disillusioned Republicans against Trump
trump will say myriad racist and classist things every day but then dems are like ‚Äú!! Guys !! he wants to delay the election ! He can‚Äôt do that ‚Äú
Although given how well they‚Äôre destroying the USPS, we really should be dropping the absentee ballots off at the clerk‚Äôs offices in person this year. A lot of those ballots are going to show up late or never get delivered. Sad, but Trump has won that part of the war this year.
A lot of shots at trump and I love it ‚úäüèΩ
The mf gymnastics y‚Äôall do to fended a goddamn traitorous criminal. Textbooks will be written about how Trump brought more corrruption and shame to the White House than Nixon and this is the man you want to be recorded supporting. I pray future generations aren‚Äôt stupid enough...
QAnon is an Old Testament religion that just pines for righteous destruction of an opposing tribe. Every question they want answered can usually be answered, eg "Epstein got away with it because the guy Trump hired as his labor secretary illegally gave Epstein a sweetheart deal."
Does anyone out there have a good relationship with a family member who is an unapologetic Trump supporter? If so, how?
No question that Trump is the most corrupt, cruel, inadequate, foolish, selfish president we‚Äôve ever been cursed with. He‚Äôs done a shit load of horrible things, and I hope to god future leaders can undo everything he‚Äôs done. All that being said HE CANNOT DELAY THE ELECTION!
What the current Dems are terrified of is people realizing that Donald Trump is clear evidence of their decades of ethical failure, and not as some freakish racist disaster that just arrived like a Nazi asteroid.
all the dead trump voters still voting for y'all's grifter?  Say, I just heard Herman Cain cast 10 votes already! Great job guys!
Trump hasn't even taken credit for killing Herman Cain yet.
Everyone who justified Trump inviting an attack our elections, everyone who helped Trump give comfort to Nazis, everyone who popularized calling anything Trump doesn't like a "hoax" is responsible for America leading the world in Covid-19 deaths. Congrats.
Seeing broad support from cops away from Biden and towards "Cops for Trump" deeply saddens and concerns me. There are serious issues with policing in this country, and yet we can't have a serious conversation.
The landslide is on trump will lose Ohio
Don't count on this. Fucking vote. There are way too many Trump signs and stickers around Michigan to think this. He was losing in the 2016 polls too!
Former presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after contracting COVID-19 "Cain, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa without wearing a mask, has died at the age of 74."
We should be able to sue your master, Donald Trump for the spread of COVID19 across the country.

Thread by  Fascism. Authoritarianism. The question has always been, could it happen here? Because the answer has been NO doeat it will always be so. It is happening here. It is happening right now. Trump crossed the rubicon this morning.‚Ä¶

Michiganders are mobilizing for collective survival. Tell  Reject Trump‚Äôs and McConnell‚Äôs dangerous cuts to jobless aid for 1.5 million Michiganders &amp; their families. Call 1-888-668-8919 and tell Sen. Peters to #ExtendUI and #SaveThe600 now! #MISen
Trump would never
History is going to spill a lot of words to figure out if Trump was this bad on accident or purpose. And the answer will be -- both.
How many of your viewers/readers are going to bother reading the comments that you reported the "annualized" number instead of the actual 9%. You did this only to make Trump look worse. Good thing your viewership has tanked.
RIP Herman Cain.  I do believe that if he had put his faith in God instead of Trump and stood by science, as he was a doctor...he might still be alive.  #MaskUp    Herman Cain has gone to be with the Lord
Double digits among blacks is a good sign, and I assume this would result in a Trump victory?
This is the Cain legacy, along with his death from Covid19 after attending the Tulsa Trump rally. #HermanCain #TrumpRally #Covid19 #Wages #LivingWage #restaurants #RestaurantsActNOW

BREAKING: President Trump warns American voters may try to interfere with November's election.
Trump wants people to quit talking about Axios interview.  Issues a ridiculous tweet and voilla.  Eye on the ball folks.
2/ Its States, not the President, who regulate the times and manner of holding elections.  Congress can make a law to change it (not happening).   If Trump tries it, States will challenge, and SCOTUS will rule it is not constitutional. (Marbury v. Madison).
Mr Sununu, aren't you just sick and tired of all trump's endless BS? I mean, really?
While you‚Äôre at it, can you cancel Trump, Barr, and Pompeo? Or maybe the Republican Party?
Trump's decision to make masks a political issue has a death count. And it's too high to keep track.
No one will blame Trump for this. Cain was a grown up who blatantly disregarded safety protocols. It cost him his life. What I would like to know is if his doctors gave him hydroxychloroquine since he had been in the hospital for weeks.
Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain and thousands of others
The next quarter's GDP numbers will be out just before the election (not that there will be one if Trump doesn't like them).
This is part of why Trump is try to get the news cycle to following is fascist attempt to postpone the election.
'Getting Q to do anything good on the basis of human morals and logic is a hard row to hoe. In that sense, he‚Äôs really not that different from our current president.'
Watching George W. Bush speak at John Lewis' funeral, it's pretty easy to see why all the living former presidents like each other and all hate Trump.
But OF COURSE it has links to Trump.
It's interesting to note that, Yes, only Congress can change the date of the election. But they can't change the end of the President's term. If, somehow, there is no election by January 20, 2021, then both Trump and Pence are removed from office.
So #HermanCain has died from #COVID19  anyone on the Right paying Fucking attention now? Its real not a #hoax you keep going down this path Biden is a Shoe in to win. You all be dead. Trump is killing his base but keep following the #OrangeMessiah
But Trump did hold that rally against expert medical advice. I pray for his family's healing. I hope no one else in his family has it. #RIP
he lies, steals, he's a gaffe machine, he stays in the basement.....and he's whipping Trump's ass.  Great argument
This is a good thread explaining Trump‚Äôs shitty tweet.

They love this. Trump takes all the flak and all the blame while they get power and they can push their own tangental agendas.  Ask McConnell's 200+ federal judges.  Ask Gohmert and Gym Jordan about the direction they've helped agencies go.
this is actually a toxic way to go about shit. Have you been too busy to respond to me because you are busy telling everyone that follows trump to unfollow? Because sometimes people follow as a means of staying up to date/ doesn‚Äôt equal support
The WH had more flattering things to say about an anti-mask campaign surrogate who died from a Trump rally than John Lewis
When I was younger I was excited to be able to vote in a presidential election, this election I think I‚Äôd rather die in a fire than have to pick between Donald Trump and Joe Biden
And the VERY real death of Herman Cain of Covid-19 after attending Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
If Trump Wins, Biden and the Democrats are going to claim that Trump cheated and start another investigation... if Biden wins, Trump is going to claim that the Democrats cheated. Then he‚Äôs probably going to reject the election results and find a way to stay president üò≠

Trump poses the question of delaying November election
Ford School Professors  and  argue that a payroll tax cut would only help those making the most and neglect those struggling in  piece.
Sweetie, your level of knowledge about mail-in voting would be hilarious if not so scary for America. Who came up with this idiotic bleep! Must have been a Trump!
I have to think there are some people who would have attended Trump's next rally who will now think again.
I keep seeing lawyers say this is a ridiculous idea because the President moving the election illegal. Although that may true, they're missing the whole point... Trump doesnt care about legality or constitutionally&amp; laws wont protect us from becoming authoritarian an regime.
Your argument is moving around. Do you think 1) Trump/Barr can change the date of the election, that 2) talk of changing the date of the election dangerously delegitimizes the results of an election held in early November, or 3) both? I'm on board with #2.
This insinuation might be the single largest threat to the Republic in decades. We MUST be allowed to hold our elections. Voter fraud is not A Thing as Trump an his cronies would have us believe. This is a craven attempt at voter suppression and the suspension of Democracy.
Mail-in/absentee (without reason) voting should be used when drop-off voting is not reasonable, up to the voter. Drop-off voting should be universally available. Then Trump can shut the fuck up. Don't trust mail-in voting? THEN DON'T DO IT.
Declining Religious Right could go down with Trump  via
Trump highlighted a test of mock mail-in ballots getting counted. There were problems. So, Trump's against fixing the problems, wants to prevent mail-in voting. Republicans cause problems with in person voting. Let's not fix that and cancel it, too?
But I do think even in states that have Trump-friendly governments, they won't want to be left out of a final election result. I don't see anyone advocating for a date change on an election -- aside from some passing "maybe we should!" to score points with base.
Witches, Tax Evaders, Traitors, and Liers, Oh My! There's no end to the Trump Shenanigans. Unbelievable! #politicalcartoon #notrump #voteblue #LincolnProject

Donald Trump should ban Fire Emblem from the US That will stop the waifu revolution 2
Here's an article that outlines what would actually need to happen to alter the election.
Yeah the lockdown sucked. What percentage of that is Trump‚Äôs fault? Some. But do you think any little bit of the economy would be functional under Hillary Clinton? We‚Äôd have never escaped lockdown.
Why isn't Trump tweeting about the GDP?
Do NOT let Trump distract you with nonsense about delaying the election! He has NO power to do so.  This is an attempt to draw focus from the terrible economy report coming out today - classic Trump pot stirring. We have to stop falling for this, letting him control the narrarive
ABSOLUTELY NOT! The great embarrassment to the USA is the Trump administration and its botched handling of COVID-19. If it's "safe" enough to open our schools and businesses, it's safe enough to vote. Mail-in voting is also a terrific option--you've done it yourself, jerk!
Trump is trying to delegitimize the election because he's losing and he's desperate.  (Same with his stuff about "low-income housing" in the "suburbs" over the past few days.)  But that doesn't mean it's not a threat.  It's a big threat.
How soon after Trump is out of office do we get the heel turn from The Lincoln Project?
My reaction when Trump says he wants to delay the election #votehimout
The ignorance of medical advice just proves trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpoorly educated ‚Äú comment!
And there it is. Trump floats the idea of delaying the election. Only Congres can change the date of the election. And even so, without an election, Trump‚Äôs term expires on Jan 20, 2021. Here is my piece on this topic in
Does trump EVER think beyond himself?
Awwww. Poor racist snowflake had his feelings hurt? Please note he went right to an ad hominem attack because he couldn‚Äôt dispute the facts in the ad that Twitter ‚Äúlet‚Äôs‚Äù go viral. Meanwhile, Trump spews a constant stream of lies to 83 million followers.
Donald Trump could tweet ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to steal the election‚Äù and half the country would be like tHat‚ÄôS NOt wHAt he mEanT.
Probably.  At the same time, I don't think the biggest threat is that the election will be "delayed."  When the count of mail-in ballots isn't finished on election night (a certainty), Trump will use rhetoric like this to incite new Brooks Brothers riots across the country.
Trump thinks the entire election is about him. Uh, there are other folks and issues on the ballot that must be voted on. Any delay is absurd.
Comparing Donald Trump to people who believe in the American experiment isn't really useful.   Think Putin, not Washington.
Would Republicans destroy our country to keep Donald Trump from suffering the first consequences of his life? Yeah, you're right.
US President Trump calls for delaying 2020 election, citing possible mail-in voting fraud despite little evidence
Come on  - it's just a distraction from the economy.  How about that angle: in a wild attempt to distract the media from the record breaking decline in GDP, Trump lied about the dangers of absentee voting.
Run just like a Trump business. Everybody loses their jobs and their homes and Trump uses your money to pay himself to golf.
No longer true - the Trump ad criticising Biden's education is airing in the Detroit market at least 5 times a day.
You‚Äôre an imbecile. Trump literally called Nazis ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù He refuses to say ‚Äúblack lives matter.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt attend the memorial for John Lewis. He started the Birther movement. The list goes on and on.
Lol. The ‚Äúinfo‚Äù comes from crackhead conspiracy theorists. You can easily see real numbers from Johns Hopkins, the New York Times, the CDC (until Trump gimped it). The rest of the world won‚Äôt even let Americans visit
Q: How can one tell if Trump is lying? A: When his mouth is moving.
Tells you everything you need to know about America's right that Trump thinks he can distract from destroying our economy by focusing on destroying our democracy.
Like clockwork.
Let me get this straight. Trump won‚Äôt enforce mask wearing or listen to health officials and doctors to help slow the spread of #covid but he wants to delay the election because we should all be able to safely go to the polls and vote? Dudes off his rocker.
This is what Trump doesn‚Äôt want us talking about this morning:
The only way this turns out well is if Trump makes the default presumption that rich kids are giant, lazy babies who should be taxed into irrelevance.
‚ÄúBiden chose to taint the President essentially with a charge of treason.‚Äù  TREASON  Oh, and the bit about how Trump can‚Äôt possibly be hindering the USPS.  This didn‚Äôt age well,   Not well at all. You are part of the problem.
via ‚Å¶ This is what totalitarianism and the crumbling of democracy looks like. America is not an exception. Wake the F up America
From someone who used other countries to help get elected, isn‚Äôt it a bit hypocritical to be worrying about a fraudulent election? Time‚Äôs up, the damage is done, and you are G O N E. #Trump
See if you can spot the Trump turnaround
It means very little in the scope of things it soon will be over with and we all can move on to beating trump
Election can‚Äôt be delayed. Trump is going to learn about constitutional law.
"Does President Donald Trump have the legal authority to postpone or cancel the 2020 presidential election?   "The answer is entirely clear: He does not."
Yup, it finally happened: Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election

Trump is concerned about Americans voting not dying. Because he's better at racking up deaths than votes.
Now we know what Trump and Putin "discussed" instead of the bounties.
Trump is right.  We should build a 12,000-mile-long pipeline under the ocean, across the European continent to deliver AMERICAN gas to Germany.    Problem solved.
My God, 27 arrests in 2 months! Trump was right üò±üò±üò®üò® the rioters are everywhere. üòê
If World War II was happening right now, Trump would be sucking up to the Axis because Mussolini said he had large hands, like a big strong boy.
I‚Äôm confused. The group is saying Trump is lawless, but also that problem is we have too many norms and not enough laws? Can both be true at the same time?
As Democrat voters gradually wake up to the notion that Trump was right about the media, they'll leave in droves. Thank you, sir.
Wow a rabbi who endorse a Nazi sympathizer and endorsed by the Kkk and is in bed  with Putin this guy is an embarrassment to all the Holocost victims that died we in America call Trump Hitler in disguise

Well, being a rational human being, you see it in a non-political way.  It's Biden or Trump and pretending it's otherwise is seeking to end America as we know it.  Politicians aren't known to be the smartest people unfortunately.
What kind of statement is this? Wake up and look around. The US is in a much worse place than most counties in the world because of the lack of a federal response. It‚Äôs 100% on trump - and people like you
and  are just now stating what we've known for years now.   doesn't care about America or her interests, including our armed forces.  Donald Trump cares about Donald Trump, and if Putin wants something and can make it benefit Donald Trump...
Talking about needing 2020 to hurry up and be done is like Trump saying COVID-19 would disappear by Easter. Corona won‚Äôt just go away because it‚Äôs a new year.
Donald Trump's inaction, dithering, and refusal to admit he was wrong has killed tens of thousands of Americans. Defeating him and taking the Senate away from McConnell is the only way to stop the killing.
Milwaukee police release photos of suspect in Trump supporter's shooting death  #FoxNews
I will agree that Trump is very simple.
Trump doesn't care about dead America *armed forces*, a direct betrayal of his duties as Commander-in-Chief and an insult to every person defending the United States.  We already knew he doesn't care about American *civilians*, especially non-white, non-upper-class ones.
The media did the same thing for trump in 2016 specifically CNN MSNBC and Fox News lol.
If we do it right (which after we‚Äôve seen how Trump has handled COVID I don‚Äôt think he can do anything right) I think all of the issues you listed could be improved or solved as part of another New Deal level economic investment. And I think Biden can do it right.
Will definitely be interesting to see how the Trump campaign proceeds now without  Michigan will once again be a battleground
Wut? Come on man, be real. Trump is a shit show. If we had any other leader wouldn't none of this shit be this bad.
Why isn‚Äôt every single Democratic Senator and Congress person screaming about the illegal use of stormtroopers to quell the #1stAmendment rights of our citizens? Time to stand up to Trump and Barr.
Agreed! Trump protects Russia time and time again. Trump does not protect our troops! Russia took oit bounties on our troops. Trump does nothing.
There‚Äôs a lot that can change in the next 100 days but Biden is leading by 8-12 points   Like Obama won Indiana very narrowly just like trump did by 10,000 votes and then Romney won it by like 10 in 2012
When are we going to acknowlege that Trump works for Putin, not the American people?
At some point, you do need to pick a side, because people's lives are at stake. You may not like Biden, but Trump is the antithesis of the message of Jesus. Voting for Trump is incompatible with Christianity.
So then you will definitely *not* be voting for Trump.
The difference between what Trump tweeted today and statements made by some of the current #a2council regarding  affordable housing is virtually nonexistent.   And intolerable.
Interesting that you feel this way having visited once! I don‚Äôt think you can comprehend how strongly Michiganders feel this way too üòÇ. Massive miscalculation by the Trump administration.
It‚Äôs an interesting point you make. The disrespect from Pence is truly the least material offense, but I too ‚Äúfelt‚Äù it most viscerally.   I think what makes it most damaging to the Trump administration is that this most visceral reaction is not just negative, but bipartisan-ish.
Call of duty - tRump version...
If Trump is arguing that we should pull troops from Germany because they don't pay enough, we should see his tax returns before he gets any more secret service protection.
Trump also wasn't president then, and media bias wasn't as blatant as it is today.  Try to justify it all you want, but when votes mysteriously go missing or are "found" that all happen to favor Dems (see 2018,) no amount of numbers games will convince me there's nothing shady.
Do the families that lost loved ones care that trump and the republicans didn‚Äôt care enough to get it together to even try and contain the virus.

Trump says mail-in voting will compromise security. This experiment is evidence thereto. You didn't like it, and you accused him of something unrelated.  Sorry about your echo chamber (not really.)
Trump/Barr &amp; cult MUST be tried at the Hague. If any Republicans are left in Congress after the election they will do everything possible to sabatoge any Prosecution here.
Your working for Putin as a veteran you disrespect us you are a draft dodger and impeached President you take care of Putin and Trump you will loose us vetrans and our votes letting Putin kill us veterans shame on you
I know I say this often on this platform but today is one of those days...our cruellest enemies could never have envisioned a better president to destroy the United States of America than Trump. Oh...and destroy liberal democracy and the legacy of the Enlightenment.
Trump not honoring John Lewis shouldn‚Äôt be a shock, just another turd on his shit pile  is as a human. Grateful to have another skid stain in the panties of his legacy, as if 150k and rising dead while he‚Äôs worried about his approval rating wasn‚Äôt enough.

Imagine if you will for a moment the person who hears Trump say "your Suburban Lifestyle Dream is safe" and feels reassured
affluent/educated areas like Ann Arbor, Grosse Pointes, Novi and the whole Berkley/Birmingham/Bloomfield area really hated Trump
Trumpocrat says Fox News 'totally forgot who got them where they are'
"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial document cases, CNN reports"
Team Very Stable Genius has made another terrible political miscalculation. Trump isn‚Äôt losing the suburbs because he hasn‚Äôt paid enough attention to them. He‚Äôs losing because the suburbs are more diverse and college-educated voters are less inclined to support overt bigotry.
This has echoes of  argument about Whites' increasing racial liberalism in reaction to Trump. Rhetoric about "property values" and "school quality" might generate NIMBY support in local politics, but Trump taking up the issue may make the racial subtext unmistakable.
Explain how the debt affects you right now. Tell your democrat voters to stop dancing in the streets and to practice social distancing.
I despise Trump but if you think you can use him to justify increased overseas intervention and ever-spiraling military budgets while the roads and bridges fall to pieces in Ohio and Michigan, then you have another thing coming. You can stuff your boogeymen.part of me feels like twitter is only starting to do the right thing bc they think Trump is gonna lose too
Donald Trump CALLS Americans STUPID if they don't agree with him that the Nov. election must be postponed indefinitely until we can have an election WITHOUT Mail-in-voting  Trump confronted on his call to delay the election, gives HORRIFIC response Jul 30,
so my friend and I started an IG called meatscoop where we review canned meats when society collapsed cause of trump . Its moved on to just being kind of a generic foodie gram but that was the genesis of it. the unflavored potted chicken was so gross
It‚Äôs cute you think Biden is a leftist. I pegged him more as a moderate Republican myself. Especially how he agrees with a majority of Trump‚Äôs policies.
The right does not own the word patriot just so we‚Äôre clear. Just curious if you‚Äôre such a patriot how do you feel about Trump literally suspending an election (which every pollster has him losing by a landslide)? Seems rather authoritarian to me. China would be proud.
I‚Äôve been critical of the Governor in some instances, but she‚Äôs totally right here. Trump and supporters cannot simultaneously pretend COVID isn‚Äôt real then say it‚Äôs too dangerous to have an election.
I will vote this November to end the trump regime!! God damn it!!
You spelled ‚ÄúTrump first‚Äù incorrectly
Damn I missed the poll but whatever Trump wins anyway
Trump needs zero help on looking bad.
My goal is to remove Trump's 1000 judges via constitutional amendment. And of course many other elements as you are aware.   will still continue under Biden. My worry is that momentum will slow. Not that there's any now. More people are becoming ready, though.
Our neighbor has a big ‚Äútrump no more bullshit 2020‚Äù flag hanging out flat, facing our house!  I want to rip it down, or at least cover up the ‚Äúno‚Äù! Plus he has five more trump signs in his yard.
If you think trump is bad now, just wait for the time between when he loses the election and when he is out of office Jan. 20!  He will seriously go off the rails - more than he is now even though that does not seem possible!
like Trump hate that the country LOVES President Obama! Absolutely LOVES him! The country can‚Äôt turn away when he speaks because he‚Äôs always miles ahead of this dog face, racist trash! Eat your heart out, Tucker!
I aint your son, you started the disrespect, i can give you 150k+ reasons why i dislike trump. You cant openly disrespect me then try to act morally superior when i clap back. You're a crybaby and i dont really care what doors i open or shut with you
[Part 2 of Trump tweet]: I am exhausted with Trump. I am tired of his Twitter account. I am tired of his xenophobia. I am tired of his racism. I am tired of his inarticulateness. I am tired of his stupidity. (Am I forgetting anything?). I just want him to go away.
Good luck getting libs to oppose the government once Trump is out of office.  People like me get called a "Russian asset" for saying that Obama fucked up with DAPL and stood silent as indigenous protesters and American citizens alike got chemical burns from security forces.

So, the DC court of appeals, with the recent Trump-appointee judge recusing becomes a 10-judge panel, 7 Dem appointees vs. 3 GOP appointees, two of whom were on the original 3-judge panel. Prediction: We have no idea what will happen next in this utterly bizarre case.
Trump and the GOP are America's greatest enemies of America's entire history.

The hand-picked reporters at Trump pressers are pathetic. It‚Äôs a waste the American people time to watch his rodeo show.
I expect a weekly outrageous diversion from Trump to throw  everyone into a dither.

We are starting to see who will be advising  due to his current status. Obama will be in the background trying to reinstall all his job killing policies. If Biden wins, I'm going to laugh at all of you who voted for him as you lose your jobs. Trump 2020!

Why would your heart go out to a willing participant of a crime,  ?? Pompeo willingly helped Trump bribe a foreign ally. He was on the phone as he bribed the Ukraine President.  is STILL aiding &amp; abetting Trump. His credentials are irrelevant!
Trump is a spy for fascist Russia, a well-placed mole.
Mythology.  Reality is Trump pushed a drug based on anecdotal evidence that turned out to be false, and DJT cannot stand to be wrong.  If he had admitted his error instead of doubling down, it would have ended there.  Here's a timeline of all Covid tx:
Trump and GOP approve Russian bounties to kill American troops.
On her Twitter page, Whitmer accused President Trump of being more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than protecting families from COVID-19.
No one is going to convict anyone of anything except for members of the Trump administration.  The "case" is bluster.  No serious investigator would have taken this long to build a case and indict.
I have a few friends who plan on driving to Detroit with me and acting as human barriers between the gestapo and the protesters if Trump‚Äôs stormtroopers show up.
The post office general trump installed is really doing a good job of messing up the place. This is surely correlated with Trump's desire to post pone the election.

Blood on your hands. Your campaign slogan: Trump Kills Americans
That is a real leader. Lets vote trump out and get us another one.
Don't you think if the GOP were interested in indicting the Obama administration they would have done so between 1/2017 and 1/2019 when they had the majority in the house &amp; senate? This is smoke to cover up Trump's failures.
Now trump and an enabling gop have taken advantage and are trying to use corruption to maintain a minority rule. We must show up this time and vote him out and then always remember elections have consequences .
Trump should be ashamed of himself.
I think most thought the country had turned the corner on the likes of trump and took Clinton's win for granted. 46% didn't vote and let 25% sneak him thru the electoral college.
Everytime I see one of the past presidents it reminds me that the presidency was once an honored position. trump has done nothing but shame it . He must be voted out.
150,000 unnecessary American deaths  because of Trump/GOP *governance*

"It‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans." - Gov. Gretchen Whitmer
No US President has stirred tension, hate, discord, discouragement and suffering as Trump has.  History will record his inept leadership and evil motives.  I have faith we will survive, having become yet stronger by gathering together to transcend the difficulties of these times.
Trump has pulled ALL AD out of Michigan. He is having multimillion dollar donation events so WHERE is that money going???
Trump has no legal authority to delay the election.  The end.  A side effect of the electoral college is that it is up to states to determine how they select electors for the president.  This is why some are proportional like Maine and others like Michigan are winner take all.

One of Michigan‚Äôs GOP congressmen pushes back against President Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the election.   ‚ÄúNo reason to mess with our election date,‚Äù  says.
Trump's words are meant to cause chaos and concern. March on toward August and November. We won't let a wannabe despot usurp our democracy.
The GOP would rather eliminate the constitutionally guaranteed public service of the USPS, than let there be a fair election. I guess at this point they have to do anything they can. When Trump goes, all those who propped him up, will go too. The GOP is terrified.
Cain, a colon cancer survivor, was diagnosed with coronavirus in early July after attending a Trump presidential rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June.
And republicans support the killing of children and innocent civilians in the Middle East. All Trump has suppressed voters rights as well as killing over a 100k due to negligence over COVID. Stfu and sit down.
rly tempted to go to a family gathering and openly scream at my trump supporting family at this point  normally i try to play the "weeeeelll i see where you're coming from buuuuut..."  nah youre getting yelled at now
And if somehow trump is able to shut down the USPS , those ballots can be dropped off at local government clerk offices.
"It‚Äôs clear the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans... mail-in absentee voting is safe, simple &amp; patriotic." ‚Äî  #ThatWomanFromMichigan
The more they talk the more I think that the overall vast majority of Trump supporters are retarded. I mean...I don't wanna think like that but it's just so hard not to.
Trump is only doing this so there will be a spotlight on the integrity of the election. You‚Äôre like silly putty in his hands.
Using single economic variables to predict presidential results is fraught. One model (used ~successfully before) based on this morning‚Äôs GDP plunge would suggest a Trump popular vote of 31%
If trump was ahead in the polls , there would be no talk of trying to delay the election , no attack on voting by mail. They can see defeat coming and they're desperate to find a way to steal the election.
Except for the wealthy , who want trump to keep their taxes cut , why would anyone vote for trump unless it was to keep POC suppressed?  All of his agendas do damage to this country. All of them.
I just hope the passing of #HermanCain due to the coronavirus is a WAKE-UP call to  supporters! There‚Äôs no snake-oil that will cure this deadly virus! Going to Trump insane rallies will only put you in more risk b/c he only cares about optics!
I think it‚Äôs vital for people to understand that Congress sets the election date and the Constitution sets the end of his term.  I think it‚Äôs also vital for people to understand that Trump and his admin are doing a LOT of things Congress and the Constitution say they can‚Äôt.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
#HermanCain a black man dies of COVID-19. He‚Äôs supposed to be Trump‚Äôs friend. If this doesn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs heart and mind, nothing will!  #TrumpFailure
The DEMs need to put out ads showing that trump , his family and many republicans have voted by mail. He's doing this only because he knows if everyone votes  , he will lose in a landslide. If he was ahead in the polls , he wouldn't be doing this.
If I were in #HermanCain family, I wouldn‚Äôt let Trump near his funeral! He‚Äôs not going to say anything helpful. Cain is dead because of  negligence! Period. End of story!
I just recently tweeted, why isn‚Äôt the WH reporters asking about #HermanCain??This is why you all need to do your job and stop chasing shiny Trump objects! #TrumpFailure
negligence! His friend attend the #TulsaRally and contracted the virus because he campaign insisted on putting people together to give the illusion of a packed stadium! This is YOUR fault, Trump! #HermanCain
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.
Tradition, respect, and decorum has absolutely worked so far so we should just keep counting on rules to save us from Trump and his GOP traitors.
I am completely exhausted with Trump. I am tired of his disregard for the Constitution. I am tired of his de facto declaration of war on American civilians. I am tired of his constant attempts to divide us. I am tired of his disregard for the norms of American governance.
Just pointing out that shortly before Trump tweeted about delaying the election, news dropped that the GDP shrank by 32%. Absolutely be enraged by the tweet, but also be positively livid about this.
"It‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans," ‚Å¶ said in an emailed statement.
Trump demands our kids go back to school yet thinks it is unsafe to vote... even though many states including Michigan can vote from home. #mileg #ridiculous
Agree with you, although I suspect all of this is part of the same strategy - if we can even call it that. And who knows if it‚Äôs truly Trump tweeting or Miller/others actively working to further erode trust in what‚Äôs left of this democracy.
After President Trump floats the idea of delaying #Election2020,  says he should focus on saving lives amid #COVID19.   ‚ÄúIf we could hold an election in the midst of a Civil War...we can hold one in 2020,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for [him] to get his priorities straight.‚Äù
The Trump campaign agrees with Michigan Secretary of State  vote by mail. It's safe and secure! #doublespeak
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
an amalgamation of attitudes about, racial groups, immigrants, &amp; political correctness outperforms partisanship &amp; ideology as predictors of Trump support &amp; is negatively related to support for mainstream Republican candidates #polisciresearch

Is he the one with the confederate flag mask? Or the one who Seige heiled at trump rallies?  What‚Äôs it like to not want POC living next to you?
Headline: "Trump Floats Delaying the Election After Worst GDP Report Ever."
Economy collapsed in 2Q. Trump distracts by suggesting election delay. Focus on his willfully negligent incompetence that‚Äôs cost more than 150,000 American lives and millions of jobs and small businesses.
Voting from home is safe.  Voting from home is secure.   We can ensure that all eligible voters can cast their ballot safely if politicians who don't like their poll numbers will stop getting in the way and pushing voter suppression.
Ever-prescient.
Just because my governor said one thing doesnt mean the idiot conservatives didnt don the very opposite because trump downplayed it and even supported them when they marched on our capital with confederate flags, swastikas and guns. Trump tweeted "liberate michigan"
Trump wants to push schools to open but how can parents send their children to school if they have nowhere to live?! This is another example of Trump &amp; the  never govern by looking at the big picture holistically. We need the #HEROESAct passed!
Trump fundamentally doesn‚Äôt understand who lives in many of these suburbs and how much they have significantly changed in the past two decades. Lizard Brain Reflex Politics.

Obviously, this won‚Äôt happen. But jfc we‚Äôre going to have like half of elected Republicans spouting this nonsense now because they either either genuine Trump acolytes or are for some reason still too terrified to disagree with him
Wow. Again, it takes a lot for me to have a reaction to Trump anymore, but this one made me say ‚Äúare you fucking kidding me?‚Äù
Because there is no evidence it's a problem.  You know who stops or delays elections.  Fascists.  Fascists do that.  Trump isn't protecting your vote he is trying to stay in power at any cost.q
well, here's just one example.
All of that is bullshit. The moldy orange menace to democracy knows it. Donald Trump votes by mail. And lies to you. He's doing his best to suppress your voting rights. Do. Not. Let. Him. Vote like America depended on it. Because it does.

Its my go to gif for anything trump related
What do you mean? Trump's closed lots of deals, really great deals, probably some of the most incredible deals you've ever heard of. It's beautiful. and great numbers too, just amazing...probably someone who is probably the greatest deal closer of all time. Lol just kidding
"Allies."  Cut the crap. Funny how you only focus on the ONE woman that seems to be in the lead.  Stop this. It isn't helpful.   Maybe you should focus on, ohhh, I don't know, Trump allowing Russia to pay bounties on our soldiers, or the soaring deaths from Trump ignoring C-19...
Oh look. Trump once again proves he's a racist. Go figure.  #SuburbanLifestyleDream
So the Bernie supporters aren‚Äôt responding to the ‚Äúfall in line, Trump bad, do what you‚Äôre told‚Äù tactics ü§î weird...
The mash potato story makes me think of the Mic Drop performance Obama gave at the Correspondents Dinner at Trump's expense. It was fabulous, but he still hasn't gotten over it.  What a whiny baby.
Everything trump tweets sounds like it should be an article from the onion. I hate this country
Hopefully, Trump style...
President Trump knows, just like 65% of the United States, that the coronavirus debacle you speak of IS BS, only here to keep you wearing a mask and in the house. And all the damage that will do to our fellow  humans afterwards, they don't care about. What R U getting out of this
Can he get impeached equivalent as a Supreme Court justice? Can the dems block trump from electing a new one since it‚Äôs election? What‚Äôs the protocol hereee
I had a whole response to this.. but Sur Trump is moving forward and it makes me sad. Not going to be good,  but I guess lessons need to be learned at the expense of other people
So you won't vote at all, vote third party, or whatever, and get Trump back in, who is LITERALLY genociding the Kurds (our allies) right now, or have you forgotten about that?  I'm sure you have, because you don't give a rat's ass.  Got it.  Stop pretending you care.
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
A better question.  Why do YOU want Donald Trump to be re-elected?
They can leak it to Joe, they can give him all of the notes in the world, Trump will destroy him.
This orange asshole Justin said low income housing will not be let in suburbs "they will not force their way into suburbs". WTF Segregation is back under Trump.
As a Trump supporter that is a brain on top of our shoulders something a dumbocrat can't identify with.
imagine being proud to fly a trump flag lol
Not this one.    Trump Is Dog-Whistling. Are ‚ÄòSuburban Housewives‚Äô Listening?
What makes Trump right for Maine?
if you don't think anyone is claiming that, then you arent paying attention.  the news is being spun to make it look like trump is an evil white man who is hurting black people.  the left claims the right uses dog whistles, but that's what this is news wise.
I said this earlier. There's no coincidence that Trump's authoritarianism ticks up after calls w Putin but not because he's a puppet. It's worse Putin plays him. He pretends to offer advice to Trump but is manipulating him into thinking attacking protesters makes him seem strong.
It's amazing what bothers Jordan&amp; what doesnt. He has no desire to investigate real controversies &amp; crimes he prefers invented ones. If someone tells him they were a victim of sexual assault he puts his fingers in his ears. Trump Jr gets a 12hr twitter ban Jordan's out for blood.
And Trump wishes Maxwell well. That‚Äôs nice.
It certainly does feel that way. Trump does nothing to make one feel otherwise.
Personally I‚Äôve been anti trump since he got elected, since this pandemic started it opened my eyes to the truth and what‚Äôs really happening around us üò§
remember when trump said covid would disappear with hot weather? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
The list of good things done by Donald Trump as president grows from about three to about four...  Why should we be wasting billions of taxpayer dollars to keep thousands of troops stationed in *friendly* nations? Let allied countries pay for their own national security!
Trump‚Äôs law and order gestapo stormtrooper gambit was defeated by ordinary citizens, who stood up and said no.
150,000+ American deaths, on Trump‚Äôs watch. It did have to be this bad. The scale of coronavirus deaths
What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump
Sorry, some people have higher standards than Donald Trump ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Trump Says He ‚ÄòNever‚Äô Discussed Russian Bounty Plot With Putin  via
Every photo of Trump has him looking unwell, like seeing Elvis in his final years. You can clearly see he was in declining health.
The saddest part of McEnany's hypocrisy is she actually believes in science as an indicator of future events. She underwent a proactive double mastectomy as a result of genetic predisposition to cancer so she could've a future. Yet she was going to risk it for Trump's stupidity.
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
Did I say that Trump and the GOP helped the poor? Hey, you need to explain to me why both the Republicans and Democrats came together to bailout out the airlines and the federal reserve gave money to their cronies while we got $1200.
I am not defending Trump at all, I think he is a war criminal because of what is happening in Yemen. But the same kind of thing happens with the celebrities and entertainment industry. "Remember to vote" etc. They don't say Democrat, but you know that is who they mean.
Mr Putin says thank you. Trump who has sought to cultivate warmer relations with Moscow, has said he was not briefed on the matter before it emerged in news media in late June. He has called the reports a hoax and casts doubt on them.
No... That is YOUR game!
She called it!  You are a racist and Bill Barr is your puppet
I guess Trump doesn‚Äôt care about the deaths of American soldiers.  #TrumpKillsAmericans
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything but Donald Trump.
Wonder what the backlash would be if somebody called  a "blob". You ma'am are killing the lives or real Americans. Your hatred for Trump has become more important than anything else. YOU are a failure and a disgrace. Enjoy your ice cream.
The Lincoln Project is a bunch of war-mongering neo-cons who are angry that Trump doesn't go along with their narrative. Not that Trump is much better. The Yemeni war being done by the Saudi's right now is horrifying and the U.S. is backing the Saudis.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG!  People didn't have to die!
Do the MAGA minions love pence? Do they love anybody other than f√ºhrer trump?
could some good investigative reporter please look into why Trump push the  Hydroxychloroquine knowing it does more harm than good, i'll be he's going to recurve a huge profit from the

Our tax money pays for those all those FEDERAL things. #Trump better have someone there protecting our hard earned tax money. Especially since you refuse to do so. #Trump 2020
Last I saw you were a trump supporter?? I‚Äôm always skeptical of wishy washy people
Trump on Twitter about why nobody likes him.  Trying to "act" presidential today is much too late. Do you know how silly you look with a mask on after all the deaths in this country? Your rally comedy routines need to be retired. You have too much useless information upstairs.
Trump questions how Fauci has a high approval rating 'but nobody likes me'  That is because everyone is tired of your "poor me" and constant attacks on anyone and everyone. You have so much useless information upstairs no wonder you can't sleep Mr FAKE President.
trump HAS PROVED THE NECESSITY OF UPDATING THE CONSTITUTION! FLOOD THE GOVERNMENT WITH BLUE!
Donald Trump let you down?  What's new?  Must not have been in Russia. I hear that's where he comes alive.
Trump walks like he has potatoe chips up his butt, and doesn‚Äôt want to break any....
The #WhiteCoatSummit summit looks more like a clowncar.
"Trump knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him.  It would have eased my situation considerably but I didn't. The prosecutors wanted me to play Judas. I refused." Are you aware of that Stone statement? "Actually I'm not." You are now. What will you do? #BarrHearing

Ummm google Trump throws first pitch and watch the rocket he throws he was a great high school baseball player
And neither of them will know how to play games, let alone power it up.  Also figured Trump would be more of an XBOX guy, since grabbing box is his thing
Trump is a cry baby
Well let‚Äôs face it Trump probably knows about snake oil. The woman is close to how he works.
Are you watching channel 7 American Catastrophe about COVID 19 .  This should really get Trump sputtering.
Reports state Barron's school will not open completely..Hybrid Classes)..Are you cutting off your son's school funding? And Why don't you hug your kids or show them love...Where is Tiffany? Daddy Trump~
It seems like public opinion is on the side of the protests right now but if that changes and trump gets re-elected, any gains will be lost. I say quit (protestors) while you‚Äôre ahead!!
Not likely. If anything, Trump winning will trigger a deepening of their mass psychosis.  Even if The Swamp is drained, the Blue Tribe cheerleaders will continue their obsessive, deranged, loud hissy-fit.
Because Trump endorsed it.
Peacekeepers target protesters wyes was absolutely horrifying when it happened in Hong Kong. It's soul destroying to have it happen in America. We've fallen so far under the Trump administration.
Blackwater is an old name for Erik Prince's band of mercenaries. See   These are the folks who opened massacred civilians in the Middle East.   These are mercenaries on our streets. Trump's idea of security is for profit soldiers.
Tweeter is Lying, they want Trump to lose the election
It was one of the first therapies to be investigated and Trump tried attaching his name to it in as a desperate Hail Mary.   The right is just pathetically  committed to helping him save face.
I hope trump is successful in getting all his supporters to take hydroxychloroquine. The miracle cure for covid 19.
Trump just wants to see how far he can push people and still have them vote for him‚Äî‚Äî-
toward explaining why trump keeps pushing a drug the CDC has said is dangerous if no taken for the reason it was priscribed
remember a yr or 2 back it was announced Trump owns part of the French company that makes Hydroxychloroquine, if the admin ordered 300 million of these pills and trump owns only 1 .5 % of the company
I mean I‚Äôm witnessing Trump do it, so I‚Äôm extrapolating data.
I'm good, I don't vote for war mongers.  So I couldn't for for her.  I didn't vote for Trump either.  I don't have a problem with kavanaugh.  I do have a problem with warmongers though.
Trump never admits he is wrong about anything
Trump on tv today be like
3 days for writing retard on a reply to Trump tweet I was using hurtful language to people with certain medical conditions
Heavily armed insurgents held our governor hostage in the state capital building. The state police were called in to protect her. Trump tweeted she should make a deal with them. Peaceful unarmed protesters get tear gas shot with rubber bullets &amp; flash bang gernades. Barr‚Äôs an ass
Get this knuckleheads out of the office. Collins is a joke and trump puppy
VP for 8 year left the country in a mess then Trump cleaned up their mess SUV driving America,  now  Biden wants to come back and rebuild the middle class...ROFLMAO what back to the left with 3 flat tired YUGO

you are super drinking the kool-aid, I'm not trump fan, but if you think Biden is your savior... oh shit man.  I feel really sorry for you.
‚ÄúI really do believe a lot of the Governors should be opening up states that they‚Äôre not opening and we‚Äôll see what happens with them‚Äù Trump in NC yesterday. See what happens?
100% agree. Trump has been bad on most things but the simple thing that we cant get both parties to agree on basic needs of the country is terrible. They almost refuse to work together on anything.People probably wont see next stimulus money until Sept or Oct
Keep fantasizing in your tiny bubble. Get an appointment with a psychiatrist for November 4th. Sounds like you‚Äôll need it after Trump destroys Bumbling Biden in the election
Deliver to your clerk office yourself if possible. Trump is slowing down the mail. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at theft.
I am afraid that vote by mail may not be safe with Trump's henchman in charge of the Post Office.  He has already deliberately slowed mail delivery and I have no problem believing he will do even worse with mail in ballots.
History will not look kindly on Trump, Barr and the entire GOP of this period.
Obama has been gone for 3 years. The problem is what did Trump do when he found out. Trump said about Obama the President is always responsible. Well. No excuses.
Really? I lost great-aunts and uncles in Nazi Germany, so you can go fuck yourself.  My grandmother's stories of what happened then ..sound like history repeating with Trump and Miller being White Supremacists, and by their silence, the GOP is too.    I'm asexual. Your point?
This is a trait shown by all associated with Trump. Mnuchin pulled it on Maxine Waters and Kavanaugh did it during his confirmation hearing, among others. A racist and sexist administration is a racist and sexist administration always.
They are are lemmings &amp; Trump is at the edge of the cliff, so very soon their relevance will end. Thanks to Trump's failed leadership on #covid19 he has accelerated the boomers end of demographic influence related to voting &amp; platform priorities.
Portland wasn't even on the damn radar until Trump sent in his fucking troops to gas protesters for zero reason.  Also the protest zone is tiny. And it's not the National Guard in there, it's DHS troops which are not supposed to be used in that fashion.
The Trump Administration owns this pandemic...every horrible bit of it, including the lack of stockpiles of PPE, testing and tracing, etc., etc.  Donald Trump and the GOP will go down in history as the ones who quite literally killed more Americans than the 9/11 terrorists
Was there ever any doubt that Trump and Barr would consider any and all options that might allow them both to hold onto power?
Hoax was actually uttered by FOX News and Trump WAY the fuck back in March, dude.  Keep up.  And deaths are declining because people know how to deal with it a bit better and more younger people are getting it. And we HAD cut it back - but then people got stupid and went out.
I hope Trump.
With the exception of my aunt on my late dad's side, and my late uncle (who passed in December), I am the only liberal in the family. Everyone else (including my very intelligent sister) is Trump.  I don't get it. Well, my mom's family is all from rural PA and racist. But..yah.
"He was known to be with Epstein all the time."  My response, "So was Trump; and what of all his sexual assault cases that were out there with witnesses?"  Mother: "Prove it."  So I showed her the pictures of T&amp;E and Ghislaine. She said they were fake. Trump's SA claims? Fake.
Lawsuit alleges Trump campaign, fundraising committee shielded millions in payments
My mother. Last night. I could NOT convince her - I said, no matter who was in Epstein's black book, be it dem or republican, Trump, Clinton, whoever, they need to go to jail. She said, "OH, Clinton, he's horrible, had sexual assault cases..proven.."  (1/2)
Hakeem Jeffries just eviscerated Trumps handling of this pandemic and made Barr look like the complete sycophant that he is in relation to Trump. That was perfect.
At night, most of the aggression is from white dudes coming in (one or two at the most) and then the Trump Gestapo starting shit and people fighting back. People that live in downtown can't even tell half the time if something is going on. Graffiti is mostly nice art on boards.
My own sister who "doesn't like Trump at all" is calling Kamala Harris, of all people, a Marxist.  It's a pandemic of belligerent stupidity.
Lmao, ‚ÄúRico‚Äù to be used against Antifa? They have no Headquarters,no Leadership, no Address, no Organization whatsoever. Fucking laughable. But it sounds great in a trump campaign ad. Which is why Barr and his lackeys use that terminology.
It absolutely shows that they don‚Äôt care about anything but covering for Barr and Trump‚Äôs actions. These same toads will act like they don‚Äôt know either one of them come September.
Stolen justice too Trump's the poster boy for reprehensible but if it wasnt for enablers &amp; Barr's playing fixer maybe 150k wouldnt be dead. If Barr wouldve let the Mueller report land absent a false narrative 45 may have been convicted in impeachment, instead of emboldened by it.
Let's face anyone who admires  or thinks "owning the libs" is why he is in Congress you will never convince them of anything dont waste your time on them. They arent intellectual thinkers they are the racists, bigots &amp; sycophants who are fed by Trump's the red meat.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but if he loses this election, watch what happens to the COVID numbers.
- my reply wasn't meant for you, it was meant for the Trump twerp who questioned you - sorry about that!
...RIGHT.  Bill Barr is acting as Trump's Lawyer and the GOP is acting as Trump's defense team. IT is ALL POLITICS right now, and DC IS THE SWAMP.  Trump has secret police in Portland attacking protesters for no reason other than he's upset they don't like him.
We got Trump finally watch were we get 'em!!!
Keep up the good work.  What would you expect Trump to do at your hospital that would be more useful than staying away and playing golf?
I wonder how much blackmail Trump and co. have on Jordan.
He's protecting more than trump. His dad was a good friend of jeff epstein so maybe he was also into children, like trump, and maybe bill was in on it too.
What is it about his mouth that just makes me cringe? Twitter temporarily restricts Donald Trump Jr.'s account after he posts video claiming masks are unnecessary
Sorry I don‚Äôt play republican ping pong, I asked a simple question and you won‚Äôt answer it because you can‚Äôt refute it. But I will say this, in 40yrs of Joe Biden‚Äôs career he hasn‚Äôt caused the kind of Damage that trump has pulled off in 4 short yrs.
Attorney General  is taking on Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump. She‚Äôs endorsing our campaign for Wayne County Commission because I‚Äôll fight for Michigan families - just like her. #TeamKnezek
To keep these numbers pumped up until Election Day. What I really want to see happen is, trump to lose and see what these numbers do immediately after
Ing to directly affect the November elections. I‚Äôm not even a trump fan, I actually severely dislike the guy. But I don‚Äôt shy away from reality, just because it‚Äôs not the one I want.
When trump loses ***
Trump loves to brag about how many more followers he has than joe Biden. Without realizing that people only follow him to see what insane things he may say next. It is easy to track though without following as she said.
#unfollowdonaldtrump he loves having more followers than  Unfollow trump and start to follow Biden!! #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsACrybaby #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus
Because trump historically has obeyed the constitution. And Congress has historically held him responsible for not obeying the constitution.
Thanks so much for posting...shows exactly where Trump stands....I'm so sick of this fool.
We need to hold Trump and every Republican that supported him accountable for pretending it didn't exist and letting over 150,000 Americans die so they could keep making money in the stock market.
Desperation for Trump to be right about anything.  He saw one headline about it, probably on FOX, and tried to own it as ‚Äúhis‚Äù achievement, and he wasn‚Äôt aware of the complexities of proving medical therapies work.  The right just wants him to have a win.
You know they are all on it. Trump admitted it! Pure evil!
Disgusting remarks. Trump's little puppeteer's doing what they do. He's doesn't have a prayer winning. Oh ya he'll have China or Russia try and help him. He already lost the popular vote
So is beating and teargasing non violent women and veterans all peacefully protesting unjust for black Americans. This is much worse. Yes there are criminals doing damage. That's the help we need finding and arresting those who make violence,  because Trump has done more damage
They‚Äôre both total idiots: Trump thinks he‚Äôs a memory genius (people, woman, man, camera, TV) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If they are helping to get Trump out, I am all in.  After Jan 20, not so much.
Wow, that guy has really lost his way. Probably far right wing conspiracy sight theories, to justify Trump's crimes against American citizens.
When it comes to going out and voting though, I don't think your getting 69% for it. At this point I think expanding ACA is probably your best bet...though, Trump being such a disaster may hand them full control...if you wanted to shoot for the full thing, now would be your time.
I received a message from Eric TRUMP, he says BIDEN is being finance with DARK MONEY.
It really seems Obama letting Wall Street and the previous administration off the hook drove a lot of Midwestern working class people to Trump or Bernie.
Easy enough to prove or disprove. Hope the medical and media community does not ignore. I smell Trump.
But... That's all Trump's fault, right?  *hurriedly consults list of reasons why EVERYTHING "wrong" is Trump's fault*

So why do you respect Trump? He is a criminal.
informed Trump of the payments and bounties. He went on TV and said he believed Putin didn‚Äôt do that. What President takes the word of a enemy over actual proof the Pentagon gave him? He put no sanctions on Russia. Also, North Korea killed Otto Warmbier. Trump believes Kim Jong.
Kid u really have a lot to learn. Russia put bounties on our soilders. The Taliban (Which Trump had a meeting with) has been killing our soilders and getting paid by Russia. The Pentagon tracked payments received by Taliban fighters from Russian backed bank accounts. The pentagon

Oh I write the schedule. I've already told me Trump supporting employee she's working a double on election day
I am sick of McConnell .   He‚Äôs the reason Trump is what he is.

RIP Herman Cain. However, on a side note, is it just me that finds it strange that Billie Jean plays at Trump Rallys? That song is about denying kids from Groupies. Wtf
Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Dana Nessel, and Jocelyn Benson - The three women who lead Michigan and told Trump to get the fuck out and not come back when he toured a Ford plant without a mask.
Whoooo?  I can't, stuck with Trump loving mother who is in control of the remote.
Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans
Sorry to hear that. This was a preventable death. Listening to you and trump will get you killed now you want children to be the next experiment...disgusting.
NO NO NO TRUMP HAS DESTROYED THE CONSTITUTION ENOUGH. IF WE DONT VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3 we will take back the Whitehouse one way or another
Tell Congress: Defund and dismantle the DHS agencies taking part in Trump's "surge" of unaccountable federal forces terrorizing communities and being sent to largely Black and brown urban centers across the country! &gt;&gt;  via
Also Trump: Voted by mail from Mar-a-lago when he claims residency in the White House (Fraud)
A few less tRump voters by November.
I couldn't imagine giving my life to help Trump gain political points with dipshits. Everything is broken.
You ever, like, respect someone, and then you find out they‚Äôre a Trump supporter
Trump has allowed Russia and the Taliban to kill our soilders and has done nothing to protect them. He‚Äôs the weakest President we have ever had. He has destroyed our relationships with our allies and he‚Äôs best friends with 2 of the biggest mass murderers on the planet. Putin, Kim
Where are you getting information, Trumpü§£?Our military was still number one in defense spending during Obama‚Äôs Presidency. Secondly, North Korea has a joke of a military. We would destroy them if a 5 year old was President. Third, Trump is best friends Kim Jong-Un now.
Trump is a desperate fool who knows he will lose November 3rd.
RIP: But if Trump wore a mask Cain would've wore a mask... JS.
Donald Trump was that kid you played guns with when you were little and every time you shot him, he would yell "forcefield".
Spoken like a true trump supporter
You think Trump can change the date of the election via executive order??
here's another one
We have invaded 3rd world nations in the name of democracy for this. Trump sounds like every dictator that ever tried to hold onto power. Vote in November, vote in person, and lets vote this fucker out.
Obviously, this won‚Äôt happen. But jfc we‚Äôre going to have like half of elected Republicans spouting this nonsense now because they either either genuine Trump acolytes or are for some reason still too terrified to disagree with him
Wow. Again, it takes a lot for me to have a reaction to Trump anymore, but this one made me say ‚Äúare you fucking kidding me?‚Äù
Because there is no evidence it's a problem.  You know who stops or delays elections.  Fascists.  Fascists do that.  Trump isn't protecting your vote he is trying to stay in power at any cost.q
Knew it was only a matter of time before he started calling for delaying or flat out canceling the election. Scary shit. Thanks again, Trump dipshits.
well, here's just one example.
On this we agree!  Trump‚Äôs America has made us less safe.
That‚Äôs funny I thought Biden was the moderate choice and people are voting for him because he won‚Äôt do to us what Trump has done
In a new interview, Trump again shows that he‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs puppet - #45 = #PutinPuppet
"Allies."  Cut the crap. Funny how you only focus on the ONE woman that seems to be in the lead.  Stop this. It isn't helpful.   Maybe you should focus on, ohhh, I don't know, Trump allowing Russia to pay bounties on our soldiers, or the soaring deaths from Trump ignoring C-19...
Oh look. Trump once again proves he's a racist. Go figure.  #SuburbanLifestyleDream
Thank you President TRUMP! #ArabsForTrump2020
The mash potato story makes me think of the Mic Drop performance Obama gave at the Correspondents Dinner at Trump's expense. It was fabulous, but he still hasn't gotten over it.  What a whiny baby.
Today is the day that Donald Trump officially became Orville Hubbard
They looked into that after 2016. It doesn't really hold water. The supposed "shy voter" effect is more pronounced in heavily red counties than in blue or purple ones. You'd expect it to be the opposite if Trump supporters are afraid of reprisal.
I hear you, my friend.. genuinely. I‚Äôm not sure. I just know that it‚Äôs clear she wants Trump defeated and is excited to oust him in favor of Joe.
President Trump knows, just like 65% of the United States, that the coronavirus debacle you speak of IS BS, only here to keep you wearing a mask and in the house. And all the damage that will do to our fellow  humans afterwards, they don't care about. What R U getting out of this
There are studies that show it to be somewhat beneficial but there are more that show it to be less than useless. The balance of evidence is against it for now. Don‚Äôt you think if it worked Trump would order the FDA to approve it?
So you won't vote at all, vote third party, or whatever, and get Trump back in, who is LITERALLY genociding the Kurds (our allies) right now, or have you forgotten about that?  I'm sure you have, because you don't give a rat's ass.  Got it.  Stop pretending you care.
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
They can leak it to Joe, they can give him all of the notes in the world, Trump will destroy him.
This orange asshole Justin said low income housing will not be let in suburbs "they will not force their way into suburbs". WTF Segregation is back under Trump.
As a Trump supporter that is a brain on top of our shoulders something a dumbocrat can't identify with.
imagine being proud to fly a trump flag lol
What makes Trump right for Maine?
if you don't think anyone is claiming that, then you arent paying attention.  the news is being spun to make it look like trump is an evil white man who is hurting black people.  the left claims the right uses dog whistles, but that's what this is news wise.
He should have flown with trump anyway. Who needs masks?!
Personally I‚Äôve been anti trump since he got elected, since this pandemic started it opened my eyes to the truth and what‚Äôs really happening around us üò§
remember when trump said covid would disappear with hot weather? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
The list of good things done by Donald Trump as president grows from about three to about four...  Why should we be wasting billions of taxpayer dollars to keep thousands of troops stationed in *friendly* nations? Let allied countries pay for their own national security!
What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
Every photo of Trump has him looking unwell, like seeing Elvis in his final years. You can clearly see he was in declining health.
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
Did I say that Trump and the GOP helped the poor? Hey, you need to explain to me why both the Republicans and Democrats came together to bailout out the airlines and the federal reserve gave money to their cronies while we got $1200.
I am not defending Trump at all, I think he is a war criminal because of what is happening in Yemen. But the same kind of thing happens with the celebrities and entertainment industry. "Remember to vote" etc. They don't say Democrat, but you know that is who they mean.
No... That is YOUR game!
She called it!  You are a racist and Bill Barr is your puppet
I guess Trump doesn‚Äôt care about the deaths of American soldiers.  #TrumpKillsAmericans
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything but Donald Trump.
Wonder what the backlash would be if somebody called  a "blob". You ma'am are killing the lives or real Americans. Your hatred for Trump has become more important than anything else. YOU are a failure and a disgrace. Enjoy your ice cream.
The Lincoln Project is a bunch of war-mongering neo-cons who are angry that Trump doesn't go along with their narrative. Not that Trump is much better. The Yemeni war being done by the Saudi's right now is horrifying and the U.S. is backing the Saudis.
Has the demon sex lady been given a job in Trump's administration yet?

Ummm google Trump throws first pitch and watch the rocket he throws he was a great high school baseball player
And neither of them will know how to play games, let alone power it up.  Also figured Trump would be more of an XBOX guy, since grabbing box is his thing
Trump is a cry baby
Well let‚Äôs face it Trump probably knows about snake oil. The woman is close to how he works.
Are you watching channel 7 American Catastrophe about COVID 19 .  This should really get Trump sputtering.
Reports state Barron's school will not open completely..Hybrid Classes)..Are you cutting off your son's school funding? And Why don't you hug your kids or show them love...Where is Tiffany? Daddy Trump~
Not likely. If anything, Trump winning will trigger a deepening of their mass psychosis.  Even if The Swamp is drained, the Blue Tribe cheerleaders will continue their obsessive, deranged, loud hissy-fit.
Because Trump endorsed it.
Tweeter is Lying, they want Trump to lose the election
Just so we're clear, you're alleging a massive conspiracy spanning continents and including the FDA, an organization run by a Trump political appointee. And you find that more believable than the idea that they know more about medicine than you?
It was one of the first therapies to be investigated and Trump tried attaching his name to it in as a desperate Hail Mary.   The right is just pathetically  committed to helping him save face.
I hope trump is successful in getting all his supporters to take hydroxychloroquine. The miracle cure for covid 19.
Trump just wants to see how far he can push people and still have them vote for him‚Äî‚Äî-
You mean the video by the lady who says vaginal cysts are caused by dream sex with demons? Or the lady who says doctors use alien DNA on subject? Or the lady who can pray away homosexuality? Oh, wait, that's all the same lady that Trump promoted...
I'm good, I don't vote for war mongers.  So I couldn't for for her.  I didn't vote for Trump either.  I don't have a problem with kavanaugh.  I do have a problem with warmongers though.

Get this knuckleheads out of the office. Collins is a joke and trump puppy
VP for 8 year left the country in a mess then Trump cleaned up their mess SUV driving America,  now  Biden wants to come back and rebuild the middle class...ROFLMAO what back to the left with 3 flat tired YUGO
Impeachment of the fascist Dems. They are sick sick scum. Pure evil. ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ. Americans deserve better.  And they‚Äôll get it when the Fascist Left lose the House, lose again in the Senate and of course the re-election of President Trump. The Dems are making it easyüëçüèª
you are super drinking the kool-aid, I'm not trump fan, but if you think Biden is your savior... oh shit man.  I feel really sorry for you.
100% agree. Trump has been bad on most things but the simple thing that we cant get both parties to agree on basic needs of the country is terrible. They almost refuse to work together on anything.People probably wont see next stimulus money until Sept or Oct
Keep fantasizing in your tiny bubble. Get an appointment with a psychiatrist for November 4th. Sounds like you‚Äôll need it after Trump destroys Bumbling Biden in the election
Really? I lost great-aunts and uncles in Nazi Germany, so you can go fuck yourself.  My grandmother's stories of what happened then ..sound like history repeating with Trump and Miller being White Supremacists, and by their silence, the GOP is too.    I'm asexual. Your point?
Portland wasn't even on the damn radar until Trump sent in his fucking troops to gas protesters for zero reason.  Also the protest zone is tiny. And it's not the National Guard in there, it's DHS troops which are not supposed to be used in that fashion.
Hoax was actually uttered by FOX News and Trump WAY the fuck back in March, dude.  Keep up.  And deaths are declining because people know how to deal with it a bit better and more younger people are getting it. And we HAD cut it back - but then people got stupid and went out.
I hope Trump.
With the exception of my aunt on my late dad's side, and my late uncle (who passed in December), I am the only liberal in the family. Everyone else (including my very intelligent sister) is Trump.  I don't get it. Well, my mom's family is all from rural PA and racist. But..yah.
"He was known to be with Epstein all the time."  My response, "So was Trump; and what of all his sexual assault cases that were out there with witnesses?"  Mother: "Prove it."  So I showed her the pictures of T&amp;E and Ghislaine. She said they were fake. Trump's SA claims? Fake.
My mother. Last night. I could NOT convince her - I said, no matter who was in Epstein's black book, be it dem or republican, Trump, Clinton, whoever, they need to go to jail. She said, "OH, Clinton, he's horrible, had sexual assault cases..proven.."  (1/2)
At night, most of the aggression is from white dudes coming in (one or two at the most) and then the Trump Gestapo starting shit and people fighting back. People that live in downtown can't even tell half the time if something is going on. Graffiti is mostly nice art on boards.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but if he loses this election, watch what happens to the COVID numbers.
- my reply wasn't meant for you, it was meant for the Trump twerp who questioned you - sorry about that!
...RIGHT.  Bill Barr is acting as Trump's Lawyer and the GOP is acting as Trump's defense team. IT is ALL POLITICS right now, and DC IS THE SWAMP.  Trump has secret police in Portland attacking protesters for no reason other than he's upset they don't like him.
I only qualified for like $300 Trump bucks. Just a tad shy of getting that Lamborghini. Maybe with the next round...
I wonder how much blackmail Trump and co. have on Jordan.
Attorney General  is taking on Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump. She‚Äôs endorsing our campaign for Wayne County Commission because I‚Äôll fight for Michigan families - just like her. #TeamKnezek
To keep these numbers pumped up until Election Day. What I really want to see happen is, trump to lose and see what these numbers do immediately after
Yeah ok. You are just making things up now. When did I say that I didn‚Äôt believe Trump was involved with Epstein.
Because there is no reason for you to even bring up Trump.
We aren‚Äôt talking about Trump. You just want to change the topic.
Ing to directly affect the November elections. I‚Äôm not even a trump fan, I actually severely dislike the guy. But I don‚Äôt shy away from reality, just because it‚Äôs not the one I want.
That is actually not true. Administration focused on protesters. Mention Trump Virus only when forced.
Well, if Fauci was going to throw out a first pitch, tRump had to counter that. It's all too logical.
Because trump historically has obeyed the constitution. And Congress has historically held him responsible for not obeying the constitution.
Trump's holds the record for lies as a President! 10,000 and still counting!  #TrumpleThinSkin
We need to hold Trump and every Republican that supported him accountable for pretending it didn't exist and letting over 150,000 Americans die so they could keep making money in the stock market.
Desperation for Trump to be right about anything.  He saw one headline about it, probably on FOX, and tried to own it as ‚Äúhis‚Äù achievement, and he wasn‚Äôt aware of the complexities of proving medical therapies work.  The right just wants him to have a win.
You know they are all on it. Trump admitted it! Pure evil!
Disgusting remarks. Trump's little puppeteer's doing what they do. He's doesn't have a prayer winning. Oh ya he'll have China or Russia try and help him. He already lost the popular vote
So is beating and teargasing non violent women and veterans all peacefully protesting unjust for black Americans. This is much worse. Yes there are criminals doing damage. That's the help we need finding and arresting those who make violence,  because Trump has done more damage
If they are helping to get Trump out, I am all in.  After Jan 20, not so much.
Wow, that guy has really lost his way. Probably far right wing conspiracy sight theories, to justify Trump's crimes against American citizens.
When it comes to going out and voting though, I don't think your getting 69% for it. At this point I think expanding ACA is probably your best bet...though, Trump being such a disaster may hand them full control...if you wanted to shoot for the full thing, now would be your time.
I received a message from Eric TRUMP, he says BIDEN is being finance with DARK MONEY.
We Know The Truth Mr. President TRUMP! GOD Has Blessed America With You! #ArabsForTrump2020

It's illegal to talk about the President?  Mother fuckers, this ain't North Korea, or Russia as much as Trump wishes it was.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
riots and violence are happening under trump, under GOP we tend to have recessions not prosperity.
The right does that too.  Why would Trump be against mail-in ballots in the first place? The army does just fine with it and mail-in ballots greatly improves voter turnout. Even the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù will be able to vote.
Trump threatened to not accept the results. If he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs just as bad as the Dems who didn‚Äôt. Also, there‚Äôs a difference between not liking something and not believing it.
That might happen. But Trump appears to already be doing the same.
Brie Larson has said she and another female cast members have spoken to Kevin Feige about this, so maybe it will happen.  When movies come back.  Provided Trump is one day out of office.  Dammit.  Enjoy the picture.

Women who are housewives are very lucky. During the Obama Biden era, I was too broke to be home with my babies. A luxury I would have treasured. Under President Trump, I was able to be home with my 1st grandbaby tho. Thank God for that.‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs like a LEGO set... anything that can be put together can be taken apart. Trump is too full of himself.  Trump fans be like‚¨áÔ∏è
To be fair, some democrats have done the same, which has really marred the reputation of Dems everywhere. You‚Äôre right though. Trump would be disrespecting the constituitional federal republic and the very idea of the USA as a whole if he attempted that.
It‚Äôs the electoral college that did that. I don‚Äôt think Trump is even the first President to pull that off. (I‚Äôm not interested in debates over the efficacy of the electoral college. I‚Äôm not educated enough in the matter and it‚Äôs very confusing.)
If Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and tries to stay in office, he‚Äôd be acting like a dictator. Be very afraid of anyone who does not respect election results. (And yes, I know that goes both ways. If Trump is voted in, I‚Äôll respect that, and I‚Äôd hope Biden
It‚Äôs so easy to say what someone would have done. I‚Äôm not a trump supporter, but this video irks me. We can always go back and say what we would have done better because it‚Äôs hindsight. I will say, if we kept our team of health officials who deal with pandemics, we‚Äôd be bettr off

They've been told by both the mayor of Detroit and the Gov. of Michigan to stay the fuck out or be taken to court. I don't think Trump is going to mess with the women leading Michigan right now. He got curbstomped last time he tried. Which is why we are not on the list I think.
You know trump will do anything to change the narrative. He don't see ANYONE as peaceful protesters only the enemy. The man's heart is full of hate.

Zero surprise here. Trump can't pay his respects because he literally is devoid of respect for others. Also he is a racist and a sympathizer/defender of racists. John Lewis represented both personally and ideologically the antithesis of Trump's selfish and hate based beliefs.

Protesters throw fire crackers and write graffiti on the buildings and Trump claims that they are burning them down and destroying  property. Trump has manufactured another crisis. Same old same old!

This would be a an example of a well informed Trump supporter, they reflect their leadership.

Important to be cautious and to continue to work hard. The two races are fundamentally different. Trump is an incumbent with a record. This is not a choice between two candidates. Rather, the question is whether you want to continue on the same course for the next four years.
Brit - even you have to admit that the Trump administration‚Äôs communication with Russia in the lead up to the election was highly suspect.  And, the coddling of Putin in the face of very serious allegations regarding our troops is even more worrisome.
Ronald Reagan was a good man, a great president, a true patriot, and he actually cared about this job.  Trump is none of those things. That he thinks he can compare himself among anything but the 5 worst presidents in our nation‚Äôs history is laughable.

Val Demings is the perfect choice. Strong personality, good orator/story teller &amp; a former Chief of Police. Trump is running a ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù campaign, trying to make you out as anti police, a former Chief of Police as your VP is going to make that a tough needle to thread.

People wouldn‚Äôt care if it wasn‚Äôt for the left media which is 100% negative of trump. There‚Äôs no balance there to even allow an organization on the other side to be impartial
Conservative Legal Expert: Trump Election Tweets Are Grounds For Impeachment  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
The stupidity being displayed by Donald Trump and his MAGA base towards #COVID has been seen before. During the 1918 pandemic there was resistance to wearing masks. Just plain dumb. #WearADamnMask #COVIDIOTS #Maddow
IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID! Trump is DEFLECTING attention away from the ATOM BOMB BLAST that is the U.S. ECONOMY--which fell 2 a depth not seen in a HUNDRED YEARS! If Trump's response 2 Covid was taken SERIOUSLY by THIS POTUS--by Trump--the summer economy could have prevented this.
To any trump supporter if you still support this President after all of his failures and incompetence,it‚Äôs only because you like his white supremacy messageÔøºÔøº.Ôøº
Is everyone under the impression that average Americans get their news from Trump‚Äôs pressers? I‚Äôm quite confident the GDP numbers were a huge aspect of the news today. Plus, Herman Cain, John Lewis, Obama, et al.
Well, Herman (The Hermanator) has kicked the bucket, he proved his undying love for Trump.
....CHUMP?! ALL Democrats? Pretty SURE of the voting electorate, eh SPORT?! I'm guessing that u haven't VOTED too often. Ever hear of EXPERIENCE? It's ONE of a thousand things WRONG with Trump--who had none. Biden has MORE than anyone. ELECTABILITY. Biden HAS it! Not Bernie.
Trump doesn‚Äôt protect our soldiers from our enemies nor does he protect their right to vote by mail. Trump has betrayed his oath of office. Impeach and remove this threat to democracy! Does he get to steal another election?
Cmon, ‚Å¶‚Å¶ Make them put their names on this crap or hit delete. Journalism 101  ‚ÄúWe'll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing," a senior campaign official told CNN.‚Äù
If trump wrong with his calculations to make himself look good.  It‚Äôs the same thing Biden said trump should stop flights from China and overreacting. Now Biden said he didn‚Äôt say that. I remember loud and clear. Trump wall vs Joe Biden telling trump not to put band on travel.
y‚Äôall Latinos defending Trump for offering to pay for Vanessa Guillens funeral knowing damn well he‚Äôs only doing it for press..
This commerical is the best. their son is in a coma for 3 years wakes up to find everybody wearing masks you remember Trump is still pres he said yes they say children in cages, #BLM the mother says I guess they should have them bc they keep killing them
IDGAF that this pairing is totally out of context.
Sure hope so. If Trump loses, America collapses and the whole world goes with it.
Trump is in election trouble, so he's confusing Americans, eroding trust - Business Insider
Hard to FUCKING believe! Believe me: after Trump's done FUCKING UP AMERICA with this HIGHWAY ROBBERY SHIT, Biden--should HE lose--WILL ABSOLUTELY appeal the results. And WIN! Bcuz Trump will HAVE 2 CHEAT 2 come out ahead on Election Day.
I am totally in the "vote out Trump" mode.  The electoral college, the way campaigns are financed, the whole thing is stacked against people who think like me.  Certainly not a cure!
Trump when he found out he doesn‚Äôt have the authority to move the election date:
Lighten up Twitter and get on the right side of America. Your censorship of free speech is pathetic. You are an American company. Act like it. 1st amendment applies to all. Not just your politically biased side.  Donald Trump Jr. sounds off on 'Fox
Not everyone‚Äôs as informed and educated about the deep complexities of foreign policy and its generational effect on Americans as you. You‚Äôre right, but no one even cares right now. No intelligent dialogue about policy will truly take place until Trump is out of office.
trump installed a stooge to be the last postmaster general
Knee jerk, feeble mind etc.  Trump is incapable of planning, strategizing and so on.
TRUMP666 SUGGESTION on a delay for the 2020 Presidential Election is so you AMERICA..
via  if nothing else, he (trump) ignored the murder for cash of American soldiers
And somehow Donald Trump is tagged in all this.
ü§£ Thank you  for shouting "WHHAAT?!?!" on  just now in response to the news that Trump is suing to disallow #ballot drop-off in Pennsylvania. A much-needed laugh, and perfect channeling of my mood watching the news tonight.  #MailInVoting #Absentee
Wait so the Lancet is in it for money, but a group named "America's Frontline Doctors," who have no evidence of having worked any COVID patients, funded by Tea Party Patriots, are totally legit? I mean... if Trump is your Messiah, you can't be saved. I'll follow the science.
Big Pharma cancelled it on him
My thing is if Trump farts the wrong way, everyone gets the talking shit.
I don't know why you are giving 'Admiral' Giroir any airtime. That guy has appeared all year to be as honest as the wolf dressed up as Grandma...and y'all know this! Him, Birx, Redfield, and all of their BS. They've been lying to the country for Trump all year! #CNNTownHall
Also consider: GOP secretaries of state and GOP local election officials. Will they be faithful to the Constitution or Trump?  This is not an empty threat  It‚Äôs an existential threat

They got all the drugs away so everybody can catch the Trump virus that will go away when it gets hot after 200000 Americans are dead they give me a break Trump is for Trump
Can I come back and dunk on you in 3 months after Trump wins?
trump and biden are literal bums im SICK
The Trump virus will go away when he goes away make America great
Donald Trump hates vote by mail because Putin can't hack those results just my theory.
Trump has multiple sexual assault cases pending...he is a pig. Maybe the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt throw stones if you live in a glass house‚Äù thing applies here.
You don‚Äôt need to understand civics to know when a term is over.  Trust me. Screenshot this and if Trump loses we can wager whether he‚Äôll leave at the proper time or. I guarantee he will. Either in Jan 2021 or January 2025 depending on the election outcome.
I think you mean the Trump virus
Ya quick to criticize Trump about everything, but ya real quite now that he offered to pay out of his pocket for the Vanessas funeral &amp; help her family out on getting her remains as quick as possible.
America was save itself Donald Trump well f*** everybody once he gets back in trust me and if you ain't learned nothing in the last 3 years and then something wrong with you
Tea Party Patriots organized and distributed.  McCarthy. Stone. Limbaugh. Hannity. Trump. Age of Darkness snuffs centuries of progress following the Age of Enlightenment.
.....than his ability 2 LEARN anything past the age of 14. And Trump will FAIL more times in delaying a POTUS Election than Trump University in awarding earned college degrees.  Bottom Line: Trump can NOT get Election Day delayed. He said a LAWSUIT could delay decision 4......
I personally don‚Äôt support Re-impeachment. It‚Äôs a distraction that will only help Trump. That said, holy shit! Glad to see conservatives finally put some respect on the constitution!
trump is no orator, he reads like a first grader, word by word, using his finger to follow the sentences. #TrumpVirus
Yeah, he definitely could‚Äôve flown his little ass down there to pick it up instead of whining. Damn, u think Trump was like that?
Wohoooo we are doing it people. Keep up the great work. Power to the People ‚úä‚úä‚úä‚úäüëä
Joe is on point.  I am still angry that he and Mika gave Trump a giant megaphone leading up to 2016...but he is right on this one.
All Trump's doing is EXTENDING the PAIN &amp; MISERY of losing 2 Biden. He will try something--&amp; it will FAIL. He will try ANOTHER--FAIL. Another--FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. His attempts at staying in power will fail more than his Business ventures. FAILURE'S even more certain...
Last Friday he signed a meaningless EO on prescription drug pricing. And he scheduled a meeting of big pharma execs for Tuesday of this week.   Then this happened and his ‚Äúplan‚Äù was DOA. Just like all his ‚Äúplans‚Äù.
After Trump is gone, the official White House Twitter account will need a deep cleaning to rid it of the Trump virus.
Trump would speak only of himself during his type of eulogy.
...and we are bitching and whining about Donald Trump. üò•
YOU are just as responsible as Trump
Sneak peek of 4 more years of Trump:
‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs housing tweets, explained‚Äù by
He‚Äôs lost his mind
I‚Äôm assuming you won‚Äôt have time to tweet. You‚Äôll have to work overtime to clean up the mess made by Trump and his evil minions.
Trump is the best president we‚Äôve ever had and ever will have. The Biden followers are just too stupid to know it.
From the co-founder of the Federalist Society: I had taken as political hyperbole the assertion that Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and grounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again by the House and removal by the Senate.
Trump s going to lose and Republicans now fear that the GOP will be destroyed in the process.  Now Republicans want to impeach Trump.  Just #EndRacism
They had every opportunity to remove him for President Pence and didn't take it. World's smallest violin (they actually like Trump)
Oh, so like I said, there is no difference huh?  In fact, I‚Äôd say that Biden is far worse and much more dangerous than Trump.  Might as well keep the Zionists, racist, rapist conservative we have.
We have stopped going to a bar near us because a house and a business next to it have Trump signs.  Pretty sure said bar owner also supports him.  Until we know for sure, a liberal brewery by us will be getting our business.
I think I heard that the recent biography on Melania suggests that she and Trump did not first meet, as they claim, at some party but earlier... And for money - prostitution
Great column by ‚Å¶ directed at the sheep following Trump   ‚ÄúNone dare call it treason, but perhaps one day they will.‚Äù
Here we go. Trump is gonna do his best to meddle with the election enough to throw things in his favor... he‚Äôll cheat if he can
And the narrative continues!! The Cabal wants Prez Trump out so bad that they have this weasel say statement. If you believe this idiocy,  then put a mask and GOGGLES on you idiot and vote leftist, I mean biden or who ever the running mate is, because biden is failing quickly!
That standard is a lot higher than actually being trump though, lmao
The smart play for Trump would be to demand that all answers must be given like this.  But as we all know Trump isn‚Äôt in the same universe as smart.
At this point, anyone who is still a Trump supporter holds a vindictive attitude towards their perceived enemies and relishes the fact that Trump upsets them and harms them. Hence all the "anti tyranny" gun nuts who have no issue with what's going down in Portland
We're still going with the "economic anxiety" bit in 2020 huh? The vast majority of Trump's base is the same brand of wealthier middle class whites lashing out against a changing American demographic and embrace of policies that threatens their power and material wealth
One can hope, anyway. Let's make that margin as big as possible. Trump seems to be all in on the effort.
1. Hasn't been scientifically determined to be safe. 2. Hasn't been scientifically determined to treat COVID-19. 3. Is needed to treat other ailments.  Trump happening to say it works is the reason his fanatics are wanting it. He was never qualified to make those claims.
I sure miss Obama: ‚ÄúIf we want our children to grow up in a democracy ‚Äî not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a bighearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America ‚Äî then we‚Äôre going to have to be more like John [Lewis].‚Äù
Detroit is one of several cities tapped by the Trump administration for an increased federal law enforcement presence to stem a surge in violent¬†crime. Officials say shootings have risen by 51%¬†over this time in 2019.
That's... that's the opposite of what's happening. The entire medical community is in agreement that there hasnt been enough testing to determine a substantial benefit to risk ratio, and because Trump and now the Tea Party Patriots have touted it, you guys want a mouthful.
It‚Äôs gonna be something like ‚Äúthe rules are so unfair to me‚Äù.  The smart play for Joe would be to agree to any rule with the exception of ‚Äúonly Trump can attend and answer questions‚Äù.  If Biden does that Trump will keep moving the goalposts in his effort to validate backing out.
Why hasn‚Äôt Trump committed to the debates?  Joe did awhile ago.
The only thing crooked about the election is Trump.
then by your definition it should be called the trumpvirus because of trump's denial and late response has led to the deaths of 149,000 Americans

But if China could have stopped it, why didn't Trump do the thing that China should have done?
DEMS r the ones with ALL the RISK. TRUMP'S the CERTIFIABLE CHEATER in POTUS Elections--the THIRD stolen POTUS Election in U.S. History. If ANYONE'S gonna CHEAT, it's the Cheater-In-Chief: CHEATS on his TAXES; CHEATS in Fed Judicial Confirmations; CHEATS in Pardoning criminals....
Gonna get my anti trump sign.
"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again."
I think the debates will seal things. I just don't think Biden can keep up with Trump on stage. Gonna cast a pretty strong contrast

THANK YOU! As soon as John Roberts swears in Biden, Trump is done. Let him chain himself to his desk and get dragged out kicking and screaming. Who exactly does he think he‚Äôs hurting?
Mail all your bills in with a stamp and envelope until Trump is gone. When big business feel the slow down, things will be fixed. Consider it a duty
I‚Äôll believe it when I see the #GOPCowards do something about it!!! Like impeach Trump NOW!! Let‚Äôs see what #MoscowMitch thinks about this!
It's good to be on guard for his shenanigans but isn't there also a huge theme in Trump's career of shrinking from the moment, not seizing the day and general passivity? I am deeply concerned about his potential moves but heartened by his long history of incompetence and failure.
1.91 look at Trump trying to get my vote Good try
But that GDP though!       #Trump #NewYork #California #Texas #Florida #Michigan #Pennsylvania #Kentucky
Trump &amp; republicans are presiding over the worst economy since the Great depression, created in part due to their ineptitude doing a pandemic. Why is the press allowing these idiots to act as if they're presiding over a healthy economy, while drawing their feet on workers help.
The majority of Americans didn‚Äôt read or believe the Mueller Rpt as interpreted by #BillBarr! #Trump &amp; the #GOPComplicitTraitors made sure they twisted Russian meddling as a hoax by Dems &amp; they succeeded! Trump dishes out NEW atrocities the MSM goes after, they‚Äôre manipulated!
Do you think Herman Cain would still be alive if he had been a Democrat that followed science , wore a mask, &amp; had not went to Trump's Tulsa rally?
Trump will get you killed! Whether it‚Äôs by his gestapo or the coronavirus!  He needs to be removed now!  #trumppresser #TrumpPressConference

That's the same reason my sister didn't like her, she still voted for her, because the way Trump acted towards women made her skin crawl. That's also why my dad, who was a cop before he died of covid, didn't vote for him.
I live in Michigan, &amp; there ARE true Trump (Republican) believers here too!! No Democrat or Independent-Dem leaning voter had better just not vote &amp; sit at home! We need every vote this time!!

When you hear Trump question moving the vote back for "the safety of the American People" I want you to remember he didn't care about this a month ago or even three months ago.
This is very true--which is y Trump WON'T b able 2 find a judge that he can BRIBE(Money, Hookers, Promotions, all of the above) 2 get the Election "postponed" into 4ever?! What judge would choose 2 b the FIRST in U.S. HISTORY 2 delay a POTUS Election. This would b bad enough.....
Dude has 636K followers....üòÇü§£ and Trump is winning at 52.4%
Trump can't even read a speech right.
The fact that Trump would even suggest delaying the election is horrifying and should worry everyone who loves the Constitution. Luckily, he doesn't have the power.   Register to vote, request your absentee ballot if you want, and vote on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020.
Trump keeps saying China "could have stopped" COVID-19. If that's true, why didn't he stop it here?
Future history classes are going to try and pretend that all of these protests were about Trump, and we were all longing for the leadership of a calm and sensible Joe Biden.
Covid-19 is the killer and Donald tRump is responsible for most of the 150,000 + real people that are DEAD.
So kind President Trump.

Trump is very mistaken. Trump must get permission to get on local ballots, not the other way around. Thus he can't stop his election because there is no National Elections! This really isn't that difficult to understand. Trump has no power to stop what he doesn't even control!

My favorite part of Trump saying he wants to delay the election is the libs freaking out all over social media about it, as if Mussolini has any power to change the election date. Y'all are being just as reactionary as any conservative.   Stop it.   Do better, be better.

Where the tRump family came from!
You can be someone who won't vote for either Trum or Biden, and still be very concerned about Trump's threats to cancel the election. It is still important to vote, especially in the downballot local elections.
He died a hero. He gave his life to show his undying love and commitment to President Donald Trump and America.
3. He was supporting Trump, a man he thought was his friend and believed the pandemic was a hoax. Because that's what HIS president told him.   This is facts, that happen to include Trump and his supporters Herman Cain.
I don't think Trump gets to choose that, especially not by January.
Like the at least TWO statements you made already?   Lets address:  1. Herman Cain was 74.  -He was in the elderly category and were he not a friend of Trump, he wouldn't have been in Tulsa.  2. He was a cancer survivor, he had compromised immune system during a pandemic.

Yeah, this is so disingenuous. Impeachment over one of Trump's tweets? How about impeaching for putting children in cages, for ignoring a pandemic that has killed 150,000 Americans, for refusing to submit to Congress's oversight... I could mention more but I ran out of characters

Trump will pardon every member of the crime family, including himself, on 1/19: Blanket pardons, for any act contrary to federal law that may have been committed, previously alleged or not. There are variations on that theme, including his resigning and having Pence pardon him.

Bt I kep hearing that this is Trump's fault
And I don't know if you haven't figured it out yet but your God Obama turned a funeral into a Biden rally. And yet you still blame everything on Trump. You're a joke.
Trump is thinking I must create a distraction, how can I make myself the center of attention! When you're so small that you have to ask why I'm not popular? It's a simple answer, you lack empathy and are a souless human being with no dignity, honor or respect.
All the more reason to have worn a mask, socially distance, or stay home.   Your overly emotional response to criticism of Trump is a mental illness and you should seek help. You are not well.
Can a brave reporter PLEASE ask Trump If he feels ANY responsibility for Herman Cain‚Äôs death?
wouldn't have been signed this week anyway. Trump has to get some golf in.
i want you all to know that a few weeks ago, i turned on the news to hear trump trying to discredit mail-in ballots, which reminded me that i needed to apply for mine! so anyways my vote will be mailed in specifically because trump reminded me to sign up for my ballot (-:
why the hell not!  i don't feel the mail-in-voting will be fair for President Trump.  dems  will basically stop and nothing to get biden in office like terrorizing are cities, killing policemen etc.   i think people need to think of the alt. of Trump, biden and the soc. dems.

Brutal stuff from former  executive director  ‚ÄúThe failure of Trump as a leader is at the core of what we‚Äôre seeing happening to the nation right now.‚Äù
Trump is losing.
I figured out why Trump can never remember Governor Whitmer‚Äôs name: The Governor of New Jersey is Governor Christine Todd Whitman.   ‚ÄúAll women are the same. Can‚Äôt expect to parse between Whitmer and Whitman. I can barely remember which states are which.‚Äù #TrumpIsNotWell
Do it, maybe none of the Trump voters will show up, he can announce it on Fox News and hopefully every real news source will fact check it or just ignore it entirely.We call that a Trump‚Äôs America.  An America that is sick and broke.  We can fix that 11-3-2020.
Send Barron to public school riding on a public school bus.  Ditto for other (shudder) Trump spawn.  Come back and tell us how that worked out after a full semester.  Until then, let Trump donors continue you to pay you to be Jr.s old lady and zip it. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Wow. After what happened to you there is still that suck up to Trump.  You are in deep
Here it comes everyone... We can see it, the challenge is to call out the motives and disempower his strategies EARLY
Mark my words: if Trump loses, the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day will be the most dangerous 78 days in American history. Especially if he loses so decisively that he can‚Äôt make a case to contest it.
Trump was bad from the start even at his rally‚Äôs he was a rascist made fun of reporters and spread lies and fake news we can‚Äôt afford to allow trump to continue his presidency he‚Äôs a terrible person and is allowing his own people suffer the lower class are homeless oron the brink
You mean, the guy Trump hired? Funny how when they are working for Trump and kiss his ass they‚Äôre great, but when he inevitably fires them, they‚Äôre unreputable. Lol.
Let‚Äôs hope so!!! Keep dicking it up trump...
Republicans against Trump
Who Are 'America's Frontline Doctors', the Pro-Trump, Pro-Hydroxychloroquine Weirdos Banned From Social Media?  via
Herman Cain would still be alive if it weren't for Trump.
Really good people do not support Trump...not any Trump.
Shut up! He died promoting flawed Republican ideologies. He didn't wear a mask because Trump and the Republicans said it violated their rights. The virus was a hoax. His blood is on Trump's hands.
The 5 pm shit show about the virus w/Trump
He meant the Trump virus
It makes me fiercely protective of the USPS because I love my mail carrier. We really need them to be supported, not cut like Trump is trying to. Everything is political.
They are not broadly educated. Allow fake news. Hoax. Don‚Äôt push back on lies. Weak in history and finance. Just going to a great school doesn‚Äôt make you brilliant. Trump‚Äôs crew teaches us that. The press needs to study and read much more. Trump makes them look weak.
I call it the trump virus.
I don‚Äôt think Trump can stop the elections.
Every time trump tweets you know that the truth is the opposite of what he says.  Every time he tweets something we should all simply reply ‚Äú That is a lie.‚Äù  Maybe we can push him over the edge.
And not one tweet from Donald j Trump.
The unfortunate truth is to Trump and the GOP Mr Cain was just a token who forgot who he was because of his success and got caught up in Trump's political madness and paid the ultimate price for which the Republicans can care less. Just another black man caught up in the mix.
Part of the reason that Trump Tweeted out his wacky "delay the election" today was to create a shiny object to distract from coverage of the John Lewis funeral coverage today.
Why not? I thought Trump was funding these small businesses. Oh I forgot he only funds billionaires like kanye and elons businesses
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
Trump bad  police bad Trump will steal election
Yup unfortunately I learned that lesson this year I was never much into presidency until I realized with trump how much power a president really has thru executive power and how he can skip congress and do what he wants on multiple occasions
McConnell says election will occur on time
Our problems started with George w bush who bankrupted America and we were looking at a depression and Obama took over with his help of quantum easing ethics he managed to put us in a recession and put the economy in the positive then trump took over and undid everything obama
Obama delivers call to action in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in 1960s By John Wagner and Paul Kane
The most dangerous president in history of presidents Bernie vowed to take down trump no matter what for his supporters to turn their back on him for making a tough decision he had to make is completely unethical and shameful everyone needs to do their part to save this country
trump also didn‚Äôt listen to medical professionals when they told him what to to to handle Covid.
TRUMP 2020!!!! üá∫üá∏
No kidding.  Trump is a genius on triggering the left. ü§£
LOL, We wanted to reach out because we just got off a call with President Trump to review the most recent list of Patriots who contributed to our critical $25,000,000 July End-of-Month Goal, and he noticed your name was MISSING.
Viruses are not alive and do not care if you do not believe in them. Herman Cain, former Republican presidential hopeful, has died of coronavirus. He was against wearing masks and attended Trump's Tulsa rally, then was ill in two weeks.
In the wake of peaceful demonstrations on the streets of Portland, President  sent in "federal" law enforcement to protect the federal courthouse, and made it clear that the Governor &amp; Citizens his Blackwater Trump Troops would use violence.  #PortlandProtests
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden‚Äù
Now try walking through Arlington.  Try asking yourself why a bounty on our military in Afghanistan is overlooked by Trump.  Ask yourself why Trump does not support NATO.
You‚Äôre not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you‚Äôre not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn‚Äôt a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I was pissed when I found out Obama asked Bernie to step down I was pissed at Bernie for agreeing and Obama for even getting involved but we can‚Äôt allow trump to win again think of the kids under the age of 18 suffering with their parents on corners They are everywhere inMichigan
Trump is a big fucking baby!!
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally‚Äôs when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it‚Äôs time to put others before myself we can‚Äôt allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don‚Äôt vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren‚Äôt gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn‚Äôt my first pick either
Because Donald Trump is an insecure, ethically vacant, unintelligent, racist man who lives with perpetual envy and hatred towards an highly intelligent, principled, effective African American predecessor
Well, the blood is on trump‚Äôs hands here. Way to have a super spreader event, refuse masks &amp; social distancing, then offer thoughts &amp; prayers when your friend dies. Just sick. #TrumpPandemicFailure
It is not worth your life for Trump rallies.
Please give this diease to that child molester trump
To the citizens who think big corporations love trump you might want to look at debbies donars list
Yeah, You Donald Trump, are a joke.
Mr. Cruz agreed. ‚ÄúI think election fraud is a serious problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, no, we should not delay the election.‚Äù  Election fraud ... ACTUAL material fraud you say?  BASED ON WHAT EXACTLY?  You're as bad as Trump when it comes to baseless conspiracy theories. SAD
Trump economy failure. Sad. Trump pandemic failure. 150,000 Americans have died. Heartbreaking. Trump continues divisive &amp; racial rhetoric, meant to keep us divided. Pathetic. #TrumpFamilyGrifters #PackYourBags #YouHaveToGoNow
It would be interesting to see his medical records and treatment from the hospital. Maybe he was given Trump's wonder drug.

Deadline Detroit | Trump flag-flying man gets Molotov Cocktail thrown at home in Wyandotte
Democrat governors killed half those people in nursing homes and trump was called a racist when he blocked China travel,  but yeah,  it's all his fault. The entire government is at fault,  both sides are despicable
If only he had worn a mask and not parroted Trump's conspiracy theories.  IF ONLY.
Vote for democracy in November.
Checking all the boxes for fascism.
I‚Äôm not pro Trump. My concern: we give too much power to one person through executive orders the next leader pushes the envelope and we lose the balance that was intended. What the governor did saved lives and was needed; finding solutions with Congress means more voices heard
If you really care about reacting to COVID, you wouldn‚Äôt provoke trump in to being defensive about the economy
Don‚Äôt disparage Walter Mondale by mentioning his name in conjunction with Trump. Trump could never become as decent a person
Why? I always wonder about those who continue to support trump. #TrumpLetPutinKillOurTroops #TrumpIsARacist #AreYouARacist
If at this point you still support trump, there's no hope for your smooth brain.
Bush, Clinton, Obama. Trump just doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative, history, or decorum of the office of President.
Oh look, Trump is doing something illegal again today
Hope he thought attending Trump's rally was worth it!
He contracted the virus after attending Trump‚Äôs death rally in Tulsa.  You know, the one where his staff removed the social distancing signs and the one that no masks were required to attend.
Whitmer Puts Trump On Blast Over Election Comments
I'm awaiting the day I wake up and not find myself in Trump's gaslighting blender.
Makes you wonder if Trump could be charged with manslaughter.
Irony: I don't want to believe the Covid-19 is here and a problem; I won't wear a mask because it acknowledges that Covid-19 is here; Covid-19 won't go away because I won't wear a mask. This is what Trump has done.
Gov. Whitmer blasts President Trump over suggestion to delay election  via
That's why President Donald Trump has been such a breath of fresh air, in my opinion. He has been going on the offensive since he was a Presidential candidate &amp; has not stopped. He is now benchmark by which I judge any Republican politician. Do they fight? No? Then forget them.
I'm awaiting the day I wake up and don't find myself in Trump's gaslighting blender.
Each day I wake up in a blender of Donald Trump's gaslighting spin. I look forward to the day I wake up to a normality.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden‚Äôs presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
(How totalitarian governments emerge. ) Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail By John Wagner
I agree with you,  but I also think Trump is more damaging to himself than any Dem ever could.  Delaying the election is an absolute no-no, dictator move.  It's been telegraphed for months that he'd try that as well

You think the GOP care?   and their gaggle of Trump shills are so corrupt to where they will absolutely not care about the president wanting to move an election their party is allegedly losing. The stench of corruption travels a long way from DC to MI.
Trump is now suddenly very concerned with voter safety now that it‚Äôs becoming apparently that he‚Äôs likely going to lose
Trump wants all the kids in school but he is trying to find a way to cancel the election because ‚Äòsafety‚Äô. #Hypocrite #TrumpIsATraitor
Trump says the election will be a ‚Äúgreat embarrassment‚Äù to the country. There can be no greater embarrasment to the country than Trump and his enablers. Our great misfortune is to have Trump as POTUS at this critical time.
Trump racism continues. Do you support trump? You must be OK with racism. #TrumpIsARacist #AreYouARacist #Shame
Instead of working overtime to help ensure that all eligible citizens can vote, trump is already trying to void the November election results. Such a scared, pathetic person. #TrumpIsATraitor #VoteHimOut2020
Look at this sissy ass bitch Donald Trump.Crying about a Barbie  a nice little sissy bitch daddy,can will send a secret agent to buy you one.
Trump is living in the Fifties. He missed the Sixties.
Trump taps into fear and anger of people that have lost things. Then finds a scapegoat-liberals, the Left etc.Enlists Fox, Breitbart as ‚Äúproof‚Äù. Creates true believers. Brainwashing of vulnerable people, who cannot critically think
Beats me, but this is the lens through which Trump/GOP view everything policywise.
Is it fair to assume you're talking about Donald Trump and not former President Obama.
As always, your list of "swing states" may vary from mine.  Obviously it's actually an AMERICAN problem, but Trump &amp; the GOP have decided to politicize EVERYTHING. You can't pretend it "doesn't matter" when *policies* are being decided based on this crap.
‚ÄúEgler was emailing state lawmakers making demands for an emergency session...to change the dates of the elections because of an intimate relationship he claimed to have with Ivanka Trump and his assertion that he may be chosen as the GOP vice presidential nominee.‚Äù
Barr approved using a chemical spray that causes the max impact on citizens not rioters. The protest was peaceful. Trump wanted an artificial photo opp.
You can‚Äôt be serious. There is NO chance that Jorgensen will win. A vote for Jorgensen is exactly the same as a vote for Trump. To suggest otherwise is plain stupid.
Trump got something right.  Too bad for him he is clueless about why he is detested.
Yes justice forBernell Trammell! My God this is horrible! Will this damm Country wake up!Cant no one see if you  like Donald Trump you get killed! This is crazy! Wake up America! Don‚Äôt Blame our President! It‚Äôs the evil people out their doing evil!This man didn‚Äôt have to die!
Of course he‚Äôs buddies with that evil witch! Like I feel don‚Äôt trust him at all! And President Trump he shouldn‚Äôt trust him ever!
Because Trump thinks it works! They hate him that much to let other people from getting better! I know it works also! And no one can tell me anything different! I‚Äôm not going to trust anything other pill that they may put out their! Now what‚Äôs next take all our rights away!

So...you‚Äôre comparing then to now. Ok, let‚Äôs play that game. Now: Russia has interfered with our elections (according to literally every intelligence source in our country and abroad), has been gifted numerous favors by Trump enabling them to gain a stronghold on W.E. Then: no.
Exactly! Just another bone to the tabid trump cult followers.  These trump cultists don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre supporting a potential Fascist.
How many times do you think he voted for Trump? 100?

Question of the day,President Trump has a nickname for his opponents Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe and Lying Ted Cruz. We need a nickname for President Trump. What's an appropriate nickname for President Trump?
If you're still supporting Trump at this point in the race you're either a racist or a moron. Either one, you're not worth my time.
It doesn't take one man to change the world, it takes a team.  These are all statewide candidates looking to make a true impact on society.  If we all work together, we can help take Donald Trump out of the White House.  Help me get Nominated on August 29th, let me do my part.

Why would you support him? He has been completely behind trump since day one. This does not demonstrate integrity.
Absolutely! We need a nationwide simultaneous response rather than a sporadic one. This is why the Trump's feckless leadership is an issue.
An exhaustiveoral Trump justmade
Isn‚Äôt it odd that white supremist Trump seems not to like his very white face.  He thinks he looks better darker.
LOL. It is too complicated to discuss by tweet. So that means discussion over, right donald? Trump is pathetic. Just resign already. Maybe  can salvage a minuscule shred of dignity in the short time remaining.
#HeelsUpHarris would be a good choice for a certain Trump LANDSLIDE. Actually, it doesn't make much difference, the top of the ticket has mental disabilities
Instead of helping, trump is doing everything he can to suppress voting. What kind of president doesn‚Äôt want all Americans to vote? I guess the kind of president who doesn‚Äôt want to see the actual number by which he loses. #TrumpTraitor
Vote in November like your own personal freedom is on the line.  Vote Donald Trump out of the White House.
George Soros pays millions of dollars to bring down America to overthrow it with Socialism .  Without Trump you will loose your freedom to Socialisms for sure but you wouldn't know that by Fake Media paid by Soros too.                     Vote:   REPUBLIAN  2020 - 2022
George Soros spends millions of dollars to take down America.  Without Trump you take away Freedom and the people will become sheep, devoured by wolves.    Vote:  2020 - 2022 REPUBLICAN
you mean corrupt as in the Russian Collusion Hoax?  Seems everything the Demonrats try against Trump turns out to be hoaxes.  Good thing the Demonrats and MSM are fighting this fight together because without the MSM spoon feeding the masses so much bullshit Trump would win 80%+.
I really don't have an ego.  I just want to help beat Donald Trump in November, and send the GOP packing.
That's a dangerous assumption. Good and decent people cannot conceive the diabolical methods in which someone like Trump, a man with no morals and no conscience, can come up with to game the system to his advantage. When it comes to how low he can and will go, there is no bottom.
The way you are handling the virus trump demonstrates that you cannot help any city, state, or country.  Why don‚Äôt you work on learning basic 7th grade science.
All Trump supporters know is poop their pants, make bad choices, and eat mac n cheese with pistol.

#PortlandProtests The announcement by Trump that he is sending Federal Troops to Detroit IS A TACTIC. Detroit has not had violent riots at all. But it's a majority black city (rapidly changing though). He wants TV video of black people revolting against the Federal invasion.
Any of you trump bootlickers wanna justify him not being locked up? but having a 15 year old girl locked up is ok to yall? Hes free cause hes white. Foh with any orher bullshit

Hey Tim, what do you say about trump‚Äôs openly racist tweet saying he is saving the suburbanites with their suburban lifestyle dream from the scourge of low income housing? How can you continue to support this racist president? #HowDoYouSleepAtNight #Shame

How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.
Love the side view. Reminds me of the failed #Trump Steak company that went bankrupt.   You know these steaks.
As a matter of fact these greedy rich people crawl through tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of income tax and cry broke. How can Trump who says he doesn't pay income tax handle tax revenues from the middle class and funnel it to the rich through fake businesses.
I promise you, We will boycott paying federal taxes. I sware...If they continue to misappropriate our tax dollars to subsidize rich people aka phony small businesses, we the middle class tax payers that pay the most taxes will stop paying fed taxes. Heck Trump doesn't.
So just curious, exactly how much is the government paying Erik Prince and his Blackwater thugs that are now part of the Trump Secret Police.
#wednesdaymorning  Trump was ordered to resume DACA applications by the Supreme Court of the United States. His response. üñïThat makes him a "rogue, impeached" person running a police state. Check your voter registration (he probably asked Russia to help).

Since Mr. Finley doesn't appear to have any better a grasp on the concept of "per capita" than Trump, here's a simple explainer in visual form for him. Note the death trendlines.
‚ÄúWait and see‚Äù is a reasonable position depending on who the source of the ‚Äúsafe/effective‚Äù claim is. Donald Trump claimed drinking bleach, injecting disinfectant and shoving lightbulbs up your ass are good treatments, so you‚Äôll forgive me if I don‚Äôt take him at his word.
Amen thanks president trump
Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases which recently surfaced internal memos have showed.  Brett needs to resign effective immediately since he has shown deep bias amid growing tensions in the fight against abortion rights
The problem wasn't him closing the border. The problem was him selectively closing the border. Most of us feel the border should have been shut down completely. You can try to spend Trump's failed response back to the liberal-left. It just won't work. He failed to respond.
By ‚Äúbureaucratic barriers‚Äù she means adepquerte testing and trial period. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if the vaccine he sells you is gonna work, he just wants to make sure that it sells before the election so he can say he saved COVID smh.
First, he incited division, and resulting fears, as Trump‚Äôs henchman. Now, he reverses blame. If viewers accept this as reality, Brainwashing is complete
If you truly feel that Donald Trump cares about any citizen in this country, other than himself, select family members, or those that kiss his ass on a daily basis, then you need to reevaluate your thought process.  If they truly cared, he would have never let this pandemic grow.
Ex-CIA director Brennan writes in upcoming memoir that Trump blocked access to records and notes
Medications have an expiration date. The government dumped a shitload of money to buy out available stock. Betting on the fact, "they would look good because it was going to be the cure-all". Now they've wasted money and look bad. We all know Trump doesn't like looking bad.
It‚Äôs a joke same o same o deny deny deny. Spend the time trying to get news topics to take away the importance of the Attorney General, if not make him a puppet. So you can say Trump is bad, not that Biden is good. Also tie down the economy to hurt the outcome of the election. BP
Absolutely!!!!! It‚Äôs has to change maybe president Trump can issue a executive order to the big teck companies to stop using their systems to systematically remove rubublicans, conservatives, or any information put out by an American citizen. This is racism as much as politics.
The worst person he could pick would still be better than Trump (unless he picks one of Trump‚Äôs kids, which is pretty unlikely.)
Trading volume on Kodak was averaging less than 100,000 shares per day.  On Monday, the day BEFORE Trump announces deal with Kodak, trading volume jumped to 1.6 Million shares !!!  I‚Äôm sure Trump had nothing to do with it. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Nixon quit because he was told he would be impeached quickly by the Senate. In a matter of just a couple days the polling showed about 75 percent of Americans were angry at him and any senator supporting him. With 50% supporting Trump, yes non-Americans see it that way, sadly.
He can‚Äôt he‚Äôs too busy with his obsession with the Trump family that‚Äôs why he follows them LOL. I‚Äôm so happy President Trump is running this country and not a liberal who would sell us to Iran.
In addition to being a consummate liar, Trump is an idiot and a coward. No wonder Putin wants to keep him in office

You are obviously a Trump follower, be amidst of what you wrote is garbage.
Yes they all bought stock in it after their tRump god touted it.
shocker.......another Trump supporter!
Uh..yeah......sure. You're repeating a right wing talking point, but not partisan. Normally I would agree that blaming a president for everything is partisan. However, in the case of Trump we have a president who is so grossly incompetent, blaming him is completely appropriate.
Understand that I do not trust anything Trump Administration does.  That said, Kodak does have experience manufacturing chemical components for certain pharmaceutical companies.  They plan to expand that capability.  While I remain skeptical, I hope this plan works out.
They are supposed to be Corporate assholes on the right. The reason I‚Äôm voting for them is we nominated a corporate owned puppet too.  Trump may destroy Wall Street and Big Banking. He might end the ACA money grab.  Biden will do exactly what the puppeteers order him to.
What number is this ‚Äútell all‚Äù version?  Wolff?  Woodward?  Bolton?  Mary Trump?  Honest 2 mins of google I believe it‚Äôs 40ish.
Here‚Äôs the thing. If Trump wins in November I‚Äôll be bereft because I apparently don‚Äôt understand my fellow Americans. Again. But I‚Äôll accept it. If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave office, I‚Äôll probably lose my mind. And move to France. If they‚Äôll take me.
Gee, I wonder if Trump and Co. own a ton of Kodak stock at $2-$3/ share !?!?!
Pence will be flushed soon, in Trump‚Äôs desperation. Nikki Haley will be announced within two weeks.
Wow. I guess he can say thank you Trump. And all the rich people say together in unison thank you GOP. Rich people have no shame in taking taxpayer money.
I'm thinking: the Left hates Trump so much that they do/say everything opposite to him. Today he's announced a big reduction of drug costs he is working on. Would they say that they'll pay high price, not reduced one, because Trump did it?
Your criticism is driven by partisanship unless of course you're willing to criticize the Trump CDC since they issued the guidelines the state of Michigan followed.

If you break it out by D/R *Governors* (with DC having a Dem Mayor), it's more stark:  States w/GOP Govs: 14.33 cases per thousand States w/Dem Govs: 12.48 cases per thousand  If you go by *Counties* which voted for Trump vs. Clinton, it's still a "Dem problem" by a 1.4:1 ratio.

If Biden wants to gain a share of the senior vote held by Trump. Expand Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Expand social security benefits and reduce co-pays and deductibles and premiums. Lower drug costs. Add dental. Eyeglass. Hearing aids. Phase it in if necessary.
And now Bill Barr clearly states that he will do anything to protect Trump, and to get him re-elected. The self appointed dictator has his legal bodyguard. Corruption
Barr is an absolutist. There is no middle ground. Never two sides to a story. Only right or wrong. His way or no way. Like Trump.
In 176 days the Presidency of Donald the liar Trump will come to an end.
I am usually all for 3rd party voting. Both major parties are flawed. The problem is if we take stand and refuse to vote for "the lesser of 2 evils", Trump gets a second term. His base will out in full force on election day. One of those 2 men will be president. It's that simple.

You should check the live feeds out. Streamers are giving tours across the street from the Federal building to show everyone that there is no mass destruction to any businesses. It's very eye opening. If you just use half your brain you'll see that Trump is lying to your faces.2/

Trump just tweeted about his Republican friend who died of the Corona Virus today. Did you happen to catch that tweet?
Agreeing with Trump on what? Trump is telling people to wear a mask. Trump is also looking for a Corona Virus cure from a doctor that believes in Demon semen and Alien DNA. I never mentioned Fauci, I don't need Fauci. You see I was one of the fortunate born with a gene related 1/

Trump had 3 solid years of Republican control of both houses. That allowed this sociopath to run wild. Most of his shenanigans would not have been tolerated in normal circumstances. I agree we have to flip the senate as well as the presidency.
I know exactly what you mean Cher. We do need him more then ever right now. He made Trump cringe. And we need someone who can do that. Make Trump cringe and scared all at once. I loved watching Trump cringe with fear when John Lewis got after him.

Trump has no sense of humor.
I agree. I was talking about individuals that are dumb enough to believe what Trump says, i.e masks don‚Äôt work, we don‚Äôt need to social distance. Not that anyone deserves to die, that‚Äôs horrible.

Hey Cher you want hear some great news. Michigan has several Thousand people who are mailing in there votes. We're going to PISS OFF TRUMP ROYAL LOL. I can't wait to see what he now with him. And best thing is it's called mail in voting. But we don't really have to mail it in.

The Lewis family doesn't want trump their but I'm sure they would have welcomed him if he did show up. The current White House occupant, doesn't have character or moral fiber!
Really getting tired of Trump distracting us from his horror show of an administration with even more impeachable offenses.
Wish I could be reassured about the things Trump ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù but somehow always gets away with after doing them.
I don't say the H word lightly, but I fucking hate Trump.
He looks scared because he knows they should be wearing masks. He's scared of getting sick, but he's more scared of Donald Trump.
This is clearly a power play by Trump. We could hold an election, but he refuses to even try
you take offense and claim that you were asked that question on TV because you are black when the name of the group you belong to is literally called ‚Äúblack voices for trump‚Äù.. fake outrage or jus completely oblivious?
Out and out cowards of the highest degree. Tell Trump to fuck off or resign.
Trump‚Äôs been calling them fake news so long they started believing it themselves. It‚Äôs battered wife syndrome.
Trump's only chance is if the virus does actually dissappear before election day.
did you just say this considering you cheerlead for a president who is paid to govern but instead watches fox news if he isn‚Äôt golfing or watching oan? at least the media matters people do it as part of their jobs. trump does it just because.
hard for me to feel bad for herman cain dying of covid when he intentionally threw himself at it to coon for trump. i am more concerned about the people who aren‚Äôt financially comfortable being affected by covid. only a matter of time before trump unpersons him
Trump wanting to delay the election is the same as that dorky kid in third grade trying to change the rules to the game because he knows he‚Äôs about to lose.
One thing I DO respect about Trump is on the same day he opens up a constitutional crisis, he follows it up with this. Just an incomprehensible amount of range and hustle.
He contracted the virus after attending Trump‚Äôs death rally in Tulsa.  You know, the one where his staff removed the social distancing signs and the one that no masks were required to attend.
How's that China trade deal? How's that wall coming? How's the unemployment rate? How's crime control? How's the GDP? How's race relations? How's affordable health care? How's the infrastructure? How's the US debt? How's COVID-19 recovery? #MrMakeMattersWorse #Trump #KAG #Resist

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
"stop panicking he wants you to panic" while appreciated and interesting and cool-to-learn via logic chains, I've never actually seen Trump obey any of that shit so yeah I'm gonna be worried, TF
Wow it‚Äôs like everyone who says Trump can‚Äôt go any lower is certainly always wrong
He will receive a much more heartfelt tweet from Trump than John Lewis did.
There's a middle ground between dismissive and panic, which is just the recognition that this is another addition to the mile-long list of Why Donald Trump Shouldn't Be President.
Irony: I don't want to believe the Covid-19 is here and a problem; I won't wear a mask because it acknowledges that Covid-19 is here; Covid-19 won't go away because I won't wear a mask. This is what Trump has done.
Donald Trump in the next week or so: "Since everybody hates me and doesn't want to postpone the election I'm going to deploy my Federal goon squad to *insert majority black city here* to make sure elections go SUPER GOOD. FRAUD!"
Trump may be a mere proto-fascist, but he's part of the unfortunate nationalist trend that's gaining mass appeal. I think it's safe to say Poland and Hungary have definitely descended all the way to fascism.
will do anything he can to extend his reign. We're going to start seeing him "float" ideas about 3rd terms, unlimited terms, or the like in order to "protect" America and his disciples will go along with it #authoritarianism  via
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden‚Äôs presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
Donald Trump doesn't have the power to delay the election. Congress does.  1.4 million people filed first-time unemployment claims last week.   United States GDP fell 32.9% between April and June.  John Lewis is an American Hero. #Facts
I agree with you,  but I also think Trump is more damaging to himself than any Dem ever could.  Delaying the election is an absolute no-no, dictator move.  It's been telegraphed for months that he'd try that as well
another day..another distraction..its all Pumpkin Head is good at..150,000 dead..no health care initiative..no agreement for aid to states or unemployment extension..just rhetoric..its all the Trump has left..
His distractions skirt the line of authoritarian far too often and we‚Äôve yet to see any significant pushback from Republicans.  How many impeachable distractions has Trump had?
Trump's trying to distract everyone from the worst quarterly GDP contraction in the last 70 years. His failure to prepare the nation for COVID-19 has done unimaginable damage to the economy. This is his disaster, and he has to face the voters in November.
This is where the Republican Party really needs to take a stand. There's nothing wrong with mail-in voting, and now Trump is trying to prevent the election from happening.
I want Trump‚Äôs secret police to forcibly remove these people when we‚Äôre all allowed to attend games again.
Donald Trump just tweeted that he wants to delay the election. Lord help.
GDP shrank by 32.9% last quarter.  doesn‚Äôt want to lead, leaving the Coronavirus response to the governors. I‚Äôd argue that if the response had been federalized and uniform, we‚Äôd be in a much better position. However, this way Trump has his scapegoats!
Has anything Trump has done been legal?!?!?

I don't know enough about China, but the WHO hasn't lied about the pandemic. In a somehow even more fucked-up Inception plot, Trump lied about them lying. I can't find any evidence to back up his accusations of the WHO.
I used to spend all of my time at an improvisational comedy club. I'm basically family there. It's pretty much the only reason I even have a social life. Opened in '08. Started going 1/2 year in. I feel empty inside without it. Trump took that from me and I DESPISE him for it.
Boo hoo hoo Trump will not resign Bill Barr will not resign. This is their only recourse now to attack Barr for doing his job. You got caught breaking the law now it's time to pay the price. The Dems and the Deep State abused their power with the entire Russia collusion fraud.

I didn't mean to be rude, sorry. Everyone's lives have changed under Trump. One of the big changes is having dozens of countries, including Canada, ban us from visiting. It's not like I live in the middle of the U.S. I live in Detroit. Canada is a stone's throw away.
In what way has my life changed under Trump? The fact that you felt the need to ask that question is astonishing to me.
I'm truly sorry about the loss of life, but no, I didn't criticize Obama. I never really followed politics 'til a madman took over in 2016. Now I can't escape it. I can't take four more years of Trump. America can't. When Obama was president, I'd never feared for my life. Now...
We don't just like #Trump, #EverybodyLovesTrump! #GodBlessTrump #Trump2020
I don't care what anybody else said. They're not the president. Trump is responsible because he did nothing to take precautions when he first learned about the virus last year. Instead, he played, and continues to play, golf. Which he said he wouldn't do.
It's all about money. All of these guys would have taken a position in the Trump administration. Trump neutering Jeb and crushing Rubio cost these guys a ton of money and this is how they're making some of it back (besides not paying people who worked for them).
Its seems like rich/broke/Trump supporters white folks ain't scared to die of this virus, if they not then let them give up and die. Ima wear my mask been wearing since March, been working since May I work at a retail store
I can think of 6,422 reasons Trump has lost 10 points among white Michigan voters, and I'm a white Michigan voter.
As much as I miss him, Obama isn't president anymore. Stop comparing Trump to Obama. Trump should be able to stand on his own merits, but he can't/won't/doesn't.
Trump said four congresswomen of color should go back to the "broken and crime infested" countries they came from, ignoring the fact that all of the women are American citizens and three were born in the U.S. Take your pick:

All of it. It's called a dog whistle but trump uses a blow horn. He just assumes all white people are racist like him.
I know. I couldn't believe it when I heard that Trump was sending them here to Detroit. Especially when all the protests we had weren't violent. I heard its because of all the shootings. So now we'll have double of the shootings with these guys.

TRUMP ALTERNATIVE MOTIVE  M.‚àÖ.
Trump's speeches have been nothing but one big run-on sentence that doesn't have a point.
Trump says he is sending his toy soldier mercenaries to Detroit.  Why? I thought they needed to be invited in. I'm sure Governor Gretchen Whitmer did not invite him, nor would Mayor Mike Duggan. So, where's the invite. They didn't come to Lansing...for Nazis.
This is racism. Trump will spin it as part of his sick and twisted bullshit ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù narrative and keeping suburbs safe, but at its core it‚Äôs racism. He‚Äôs a racist. His supporters...well...all I know is I typically vote for those who align with my views.
Trump is scared of Putin. Either Putin has something on him (likely) or trump really is just a giant chicken shit.  Or he really doesn‚Äôt give a shit about this country. Which is it?  None are good for America.
Unfortunately watching the Trump Admin‚Äôs serious missteps in Feb, it was sadly obvious we‚Äôd be here today. In #Michigan we have a Gov who is working hard to follow public health &amp; science guidelines but to succeed this must be a national response!   Predict fall will be bad. üòî

It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
Just because Trump hates Barack Obama. And I'm right about this. Trump does hate Obama just by what he's doing with all the things Obama did when he was in office. Trump is repealing everything. That's so he can have all the White people hate all the Black people like he does.
#PortlandProtests The announcement by Trump that he is sending Federal Troops to Detroit IS A TACTIC. Detroit has not had violent riots at all. But it's a majority black city (rapidly changing though). He wants TV video of black people revolting against the Federal invasion.
Terrible interviewer, he let Trump ramble and didn‚Äôt seek clarification or push back. There is no dispute on the bounties. Trump is an idiot no doubt but this mumbling from Axios interviewer is inexcusable.
Yep keep the inner city communities (predominantly black) further away from better circumstances. You vote for Trump, unfollow me.
Want to make Covid-19 disappear?  Have Trump sign an executive order stating that for the safety of all Americans the presidential election will be postponed until the virus is eliminated.  All talk of Covid will end by Monday.  Dems will mask masks illegal.
I am absolutely voting for Donald J Trump!
Potentially? IT IS. More insider trading for Trump and his lemmings.
I like how he went to the office to give em all a hug and words of inspiration. I wonder which one of his staff got the job of taking care of Trump's ball sack while screwy Louis Goober is in quarentine.

As soon as I read that Trump tweet I knew we'd hear from Racism Watchdog.
I didn't have "People who live by the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ support racist, dictatorial, prideful, idolater, greed-filled, American President" or I would have shouted BINGO on the day Trump got elected.

How much of that did Trump and his crooked, goon squad pocket of that money for their personal bank accounts?
Trump‚Äôs 4 point plan to beat Covid- 1. Tell my follower‚Äôs not to wear masks. Liberals are just wearing masks to make me look bad. 2. Discredit and attack experts who are looking out for the best interest of  health &amp; society.    3.  DENY REALITY, SCIENCE &amp; Facts. 4.  Blame Obama.

Seriously. I wouldn't let trump anywhere near my female dog much less my daughter. Trump just loves the uneducated.I love all the COVID enthusiasts who are like well we're just gonna have a giant Trump rally and spit in each other's mouths! Great, get each other sick, sounds like an amazing time

The GOP has a limited number of heartfelt goals: 1) winning by any means, 2) rewarding rich donors, 3) curtailing cultural progress, and 4) defeating everything that Democrats try to do for the country.  Love of country and democracy do not enter into it. So, Trump is their man.

I think it could be best thing in the world but if President Trump says its good &amp; supports it, they will be against it  They are like immature little children and when angry they are against everything else but what they think they want. They are definitely not capable party.
Obviously, this won‚Äôt happen. But jfc we‚Äôre going to have like half of elected Republicans spouting this nonsense now because they either either genuine Trump acolytes or are for some reason still too terrified to disagree with him
Wow. Again, it takes a lot for me to have a reaction to Trump anymore, but this one made me say ‚Äúare you fucking kidding me?‚Äù
Because there is no evidence it's a problem.  You know who stops or delays elections.  Fascists.  Fascists do that.  Trump isn't protecting your vote he is trying to stay in power at any cost.q
well, here's just one example.
All of that is bullshit. The moldy orange menace to democracy knows it. Donald Trump votes by mail. And lies to you. He's doing his best to suppress your voting rights. Do. Not. Let. Him. Vote like America depended on it. Because it does.

Im tired of the anti-Trump fanaticism. Might sound obvious but I'm tired of hearing people repeat things from the news that are easily proven false without a multimillion $ "news" agency.  Not enough people do thier own research. Our msm is propoganda for China and ppl believe it
President Trump knows, just like 65% of the United States, that the coronavirus debacle you speak of IS BS, only here to keep you wearing a mask and in the house. And all the damage that will do to our fellow  humans afterwards, they don't care about. What R U getting out of this
Can he get impeached equivalent as a Supreme Court justice? Can the dems block trump from electing a new one since it‚Äôs election? What‚Äôs the protocol hereee
I had a whole response to this.. but Sur Trump is moving forward and it makes me sad. Not going to be good,  but I guess lessons need to be learned at the expense of other people
So you won't vote at all, vote third party, or whatever, and get Trump back in, who is LITERALLY genociding the Kurds (our allies) right now, or have you forgotten about that?  I'm sure you have, because you don't give a rat's ass.  Got it.  Stop pretending you care.
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
They can leak it to Joe, they can give him all of the notes in the world, Trump will destroy him.
This orange asshole Justin said low income housing will not be let in suburbs "they will not force their way into suburbs". WTF Segregation is back under Trump.

if you don't think anyone is claiming that, then you arent paying attention.  the news is being spun to make it look like trump is an evil white man who is hurting black people.  the left claims the right uses dog whistles, but that's what this is news wise.
Huh? I'm not pushing deep state. I'm pushing that neither Biden nor Trump is the answer to our countries problems and voting for one just because you hate the other is a bad choice
I said this earlier. There's no coincidence that Trump's authoritarianism ticks up after calls w Putin but not because he's a puppet. It's worse Putin plays him. He pretends to offer advice to Trump but is manipulating him into thinking attacking protesters makes him seem strong.
It's amazing what bothers Jordan&amp; what doesnt. He has no desire to investigate real controversies &amp; crimes he prefers invented ones. If someone tells him they were a victim of sexual assault he puts his fingers in his ears. Trump Jr gets a 12hr twitter ban Jordan's out for blood.

Every photo of Trump has him looking unwell, like seeing Elvis in his final years. You can clearly see he was in declining health.
The saddest part of McEnany's hypocrisy is she actually believes in science as an indicator of future events. She underwent a proactive double mastectomy as a result of genetic predisposition to cancer so she could've a future. Yet she was going to risk it for Trump's stupidity.
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
Did I say that Trump and the GOP helped the poor? Hey, you need to explain to me why both the Republicans and Democrats came together to bailout out the airlines and the federal reserve gave money to their cronies while we got $1200.
I am not defending Trump at all, I think he is a war criminal because of what is happening in Yemen. But the same kind of thing happens with the celebrities and entertainment industry. "Remember to vote" etc. They don't say Democrat, but you know that is who they mean.
Mr Putin says thank you. Trump who has sought to cultivate warmer relations with Moscow, has said he was not briefed on the matter before it emerged in news media in late June. He has called the reports a hoax and casts doubt on them.
You‚Äôre right no one likes you. You're unintelligent,   uneducated and unqualified for any job that I can see. Yet you ended up being POTUS. Which only goes to show that anybody really can become president. Sad but true for "we the people"
No... That is YOUR game!

I guess Trump doesn‚Äôt care about the deaths of American soldiers.  #TrumpKillsAmericans
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything but Donald Trump.
Wonder what the backlash would be if somebody called  a "blob". You ma'am are killing the lives or real Americans. Your hatred for Trump has become more important than anything else. YOU are a failure and a disgrace. Enjoy your ice cream.
The Lincoln Project is a bunch of war-mongering neo-cons who are angry that Trump doesn't go along with their narrative. Not that Trump is much better. The Yemeni war being done by the Saudi's right now is horrifying and the U.S. is backing the Saudis.
....like your boss. So I guess your views &amp; beliefs really do line up  with Trump's! You both want to pardon the same people, you both trust Russia more than our own gov't. So why don't either 1 of you live in Russia? Trump probably couldn't it on a map, he'd be looking for USSR.

Trump on Twitter about why nobody likes him.  Trying to "act" presidential today is much too late. Do you know how silly you look with a mask on after all the deaths in this country? Your rally comedy routines need to be retired. You have too much useless information upstairs.
Trump questions how Fauci has a high approval rating 'but nobody likes me'  That is because everyone is tired of your "poor me" and constant attacks on anyone and everyone. You have so much useless information upstairs no wonder you can't sleep Mr FAKE President.

Ummm google Trump throws first pitch and watch the rocket he throws he was a great high school baseball player
And neither of them will know how to play games, let alone power it up.  Also figured Trump would be more of an XBOX guy, since grabbing box is his thing
It seems like public opinion is on the side of the protests right now but if that changes and trump gets re-elected, any gains will be lost. I say quit (protestors) while you‚Äôre ahead!!
Not likely. If anything, Trump winning will trigger a deepening of their mass psychosis.  Even if The Swamp is drained, the Blue Tribe cheerleaders will continue their obsessive, deranged, loud hissy-fit.
Because Trump endorsed it.
Peacekeepers target protesters wyes was absolutely horrifying when it happened in Hong Kong. It's soul destroying to have it happen in America. We've fallen so far under the Trump administration.
Blackwater is an old name for Erik Prince's band of mercenaries. See   These are the folks who opened massacred civilians in the Middle East.   These are mercenaries on our streets. Trump's idea of security is for profit soldiers.
Tweeter is Lying, they want Trump to lose the election
It was one of the first therapies to be investigated and Trump tried attaching his name to it in as a desperate Hail Mary.   The right is just pathetically  committed to helping him save face.

Deliver to your clerk office yourself if possible. Trump is slowing down the mail. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at theft.
I am afraid that vote by mail may not be safe with Trump's henchman in charge of the Post Office.  He has already deliberately slowed mail delivery and I have no problem believing he will do even worse with mail in ballots.
History will not look kindly on Trump, Barr and the entire GOP of this period.
Obama has been gone for 3 years. The problem is what did Trump do when he found out. Trump said about Obama the President is always responsible. Well. No excuses.
Really? I lost great-aunts and uncles in Nazi Germany, so you can go fuck yourself.  My grandmother's stories of what happened then ..sound like history repeating with Trump and Miller being White Supremacists, and by their silence, the GOP is too.    I'm asexual. Your point?
This is a trait shown by all associated with Trump. Mnuchin pulled it on Maxine Waters and Kavanaugh did it during his confirmation hearing, among others. A racist and sexist administration is a racist and sexist administration always.
They are are lemmings &amp; Trump is at the edge of the cliff, so very soon their relevance will end. Thanks to Trump's failed leadership on #covid19 he has accelerated the boomers end of demographic influence related to voting &amp; platform priorities.
Portland wasn't even on the damn radar until Trump sent in his fucking troops to gas protesters for zero reason.  Also the protest zone is tiny. And it's not the National Guard in there, it's DHS troops which are not supposed to be used in that fashion.
The Trump Administration owns this pandemic...every horrible bit of it, including the lack of stockpiles of PPE, testing and tracing, etc., etc.  Donald Trump and the GOP will go down in history as the ones who quite literally killed more Americans than the 9/11 terrorists
Was there ever any doubt that Trump and Barr would consider any and all options that might allow them both to hold onto power?
Hoax was actually uttered by FOX News and Trump WAY the fuck back in March, dude.  Keep up.  And deaths are declining because people know how to deal with it a bit better and more younger people are getting it. And we HAD cut it back - but then people got stupid and went out.
I hope Trump.
With the exception of my aunt on my late dad's side, and my late uncle (who passed in December), I am the only liberal in the family. Everyone else (including my very intelligent sister) is Trump.  I don't get it. Well, my mom's family is all from rural PA and racist. But..yah.

My mother. Last night. I could NOT convince her - I said, no matter who was in Epstein's black book, be it dem or republican, Trump, Clinton, whoever, they need to go to jail. She said, "OH, Clinton, he's horrible, had sexual assault cases..proven.."  (1/2)
Hakeem Jeffries just eviscerated Trumps handling of this pandemic and made Barr look like the complete sycophant that he is in relation to Trump. That was perfect.
At night, most of the aggression is from white dudes coming in (one or two at the most) and then the Trump Gestapo starting shit and people fighting back. People that live in downtown can't even tell half the time if something is going on. Graffiti is mostly nice art on boards.
My own sister who "doesn't like Trump at all" is calling Kamala Harris, of all people, a Marxist.  It's a pandemic of belligerent stupidity.
Lmao, ‚ÄúRico‚Äù to be used against Antifa? They have no Headquarters,no Leadership, no Address, no Organization whatsoever. Fucking laughable. But it sounds great in a trump campaign ad. Which is why Barr and his lackeys use that terminology.
It absolutely shows that they don‚Äôt care about anything but covering for Barr and Trump‚Äôs actions. These same toads will act like they don‚Äôt know either one of them come September.
Stolen justice too Trump's the poster boy for reprehensible but if it wasnt for enablers &amp; Barr's playing fixer maybe 150k wouldnt be dead. If Barr wouldve let the Mueller report land absent a false narrative 45 may have been convicted in impeachment, instead of emboldened by it.
Let's face anyone who admires  or thinks "owning the libs" is why he is in Congress you will never convince them of anything dont waste your time on them. They arent intellectual thinkers they are the racists, bigots &amp; sycophants who are fed by Trump's the red meat.
I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, but if he loses this election, watch what happens to the COVID numbers.

...RIGHT.  Bill Barr is acting as Trump's Lawyer and the GOP is acting as Trump's defense team. IT is ALL POLITICS right now, and DC IS THE SWAMP.  Trump has secret police in Portland attacking protesters for no reason other than he's upset they don't like him.

Trump loves to brag about how many more followers he has than joe Biden. Without realizing that people only follow him to see what insane things he may say next. It is easy to track though without following as she said.
#unfollowdonaldtrump he loves having more followers than  Unfollow trump and start to follow Biden!! #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsACrybaby #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus
Because trump historically has obeyed the constitution. And Congress has historically held him responsible for not obeying the constitution.
Thanks so much for posting...shows exactly where Trump stands....I'm so sick of this fool.
We need to hold Trump and every Republican that supported him accountable for pretending it didn't exist and letting over 150,000 Americans die so they could keep making money in the stock market.
Desperation for Trump to be right about anything.  He saw one headline about it, probably on FOX, and tried to own it as ‚Äúhis‚Äù achievement, and he wasn‚Äôt aware of the complexities of proving medical therapies work.  The right just wants him to have a win.
You know they are all on it. Trump admitted it! Pure evil!
Disgusting remarks. Trump's little puppeteer's doing what they do. He's doesn't have a prayer winning. Oh ya he'll have China or Russia try and help him. He already lost the popular vote
So is beating and teargasing non violent women and veterans all peacefully protesting unjust for black Americans. This is much worse. Yes there are criminals doing damage. That's the help we need finding and arresting those who make violence,  because Trump has done more damage
They‚Äôre both total idiots: Trump thinks he‚Äôs a memory genius (people, woman, man, camera, TV) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If they are helping to get Trump out, I am all in.  After Jan 20, not so much.
Wow, that guy has really lost his way. Probably far right wing conspiracy sight theories, to justify Trump's crimes against American citizens.
When it comes to going out and voting though, I don't think your getting 69% for it. At this point I think expanding ACA is probably your best bet...though, Trump being such a disaster may hand them full control...if you wanted to shoot for the full thing, now would be your time.
I received a message from Eric TRUMP, he says BIDEN is being finance with DARK MONEY.
It really seems Obama letting Wall Street and the previous administration off the hook drove a lot of Midwestern working class people to Trump or Bernie.
Trump‚Äôs America. VOTE.
Easy enough to prove or disprove. Hope the medical and media community does not ignore. I smell Trump.
We love you, President Trump!
It's illegal to talk about the President?  Mother fuckers, this ain't North Korea, or Russia as much as Trump wishes it was.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
You think the Democrats will stop the looting and burning buildings they support this violence it‚Äôs happing in blue state‚Äôs trump says he will send in help the Mayors who are Democrats say they don‚Äôt want help
He said he will you call the officers storm troopers the Mayor of Chicago said we don‚Äôt want military people coming to the city to Harass the citizens then u guys complain about Trump not doing anything

Donald Trump is now encouraging masks, but Whitmer did it first...who is the leader, and who is the sheep?üôÑ
Soooooo. You gonna look at the thread that has the Trump team‚Äôs counterpart answering the same question or no?
Brie Larson has said she and another female cast members have spoken to Kevin Feige about this, so maybe it will happen.  When movies come back.  Provided Trump is one day out of office.  Dammit.  Enjoy the picture.
Unless McConnell ushers a bill like that to a veto proof passage in the Senate, any legislation that Trump does not want will die on his desk.
What conclusions do you see with another 4 years of Trump?
It‚Äôs like a LEGO set... anything that can be put together can be taken apart. Trump is too full of himself.  Trump fans be like‚¨áÔ∏è
It‚Äôs so easy to say what someone would have done. I‚Äôm not a trump supporter, but this video irks me. We can always go back and say what we would have done better because it‚Äôs hindsight. I will say, if we kept our team of health officials who deal with pandemics, we‚Äôd be bettr off
Eweeee  you my dear IS the #factchecker of #theview. She be managing topics quite well.  Yeah Trump would sit with anyone who is for division.
Since I found out they fund Trump‚Äôs campaign I haven‚Äôt eaten it since.
Bernie, get your bros under control.  This election is too important to waste on infighting.  Trump must go.  Take back the White House, then duke it out.    Bernie Sanders delegates mount convention rebellion over Medicare for All  via

Exactly. We can‚Äôt quit after Trump is gone. BLM has been stressing that point.
More Rahm Emanuel on  ‚ÄúI think (Trump) has this backwards. He should be nationalizing our response to public health and localizing our response to public safety. He‚Äôs nationalized our response to public safety and localized our response to public health‚Äù = virus problem
I cant stand Trump but I agree please stop with the dumb nickname battle. She sounds ridiculous
All this is happening because THE Democrats want to defund the Police telling to police to stand down trump isn‚Äôt sending In Storm troopers he‚Äôs sending   in the military to stop all this violence that the Democrats createdpart of me feels like twitter is only starting to do the right thing bc they think Trump is gonna lose too
Donald Trump CALLS Americans STUPID if they don't agree with him that the Nov. election must be postponed indefinitely until we can have an election WITHOUT Mail-in-voting  Trump confronted on his call to delay the election, gives HORRIFIC response Jul 30,
so my friend and I started an IG called meatscoop where we review canned meats when society collapsed cause of trump . Its moved on to just being kind of a generic foodie gram but that was the genesis of it. the unflavored potted chicken was so gross
It‚Äôs cute you think Biden is a leftist. I pegged him more as a moderate Republican myself. Especially how he agrees with a majority of Trump‚Äôs policies.
The right does not own the word patriot just so we‚Äôre clear. Just curious if you‚Äôre such a patriot how do you feel about Trump literally suspending an election (which every pollster has him losing by a landslide)? Seems rather authoritarian to me. China would be proud.
I‚Äôve been critical of the Governor in some instances, but she‚Äôs totally right here. Trump and supporters cannot simultaneously pretend COVID isn‚Äôt real then say it‚Äôs too dangerous to have an election.
I will vote this November to end the trump regime!! God damn it!!
You spelled ‚ÄúTrump first‚Äù incorrectly
Damn I missed the poll but whatever Trump wins anyway
Trump needs zero help on looking bad.
My goal is to remove Trump's 1000 judges via constitutional amendment. And of course many other elements as you are aware.   will still continue under Biden. My worry is that momentum will slow. Not that there's any now. More people are becoming ready, though.
Our neighbor has a big ‚Äútrump no more bullshit 2020‚Äù flag hanging out flat, facing our house!  I want to rip it down, or at least cover up the ‚Äúno‚Äù! Plus he has five more trump signs in his yard.
If you think trump is bad now, just wait for the time between when he loses the election and when he is out of office Jan. 20!  He will seriously go off the rails - more than he is now even though that does not seem possible!
like Trump hate that the country LOVES President Obama! Absolutely LOVES him! The country can‚Äôt turn away when he speaks because he‚Äôs always miles ahead of this dog face, racist trash! Eat your heart out, Tucker!
I aint your son, you started the disrespect, i can give you 150k+ reasons why i dislike trump. You cant openly disrespect me then try to act morally superior when i clap back. You're a crybaby and i dont really care what doors i open or shut with you
[Part 2 of Trump tweet]: I am exhausted with Trump. I am tired of his Twitter account. I am tired of his xenophobia. I am tired of his racism. I am tired of his inarticulateness. I am tired of his stupidity. (Am I forgetting anything?). I just want him to go away.
Good luck getting libs to oppose the government once Trump is out of office.  People like me get called a "Russian asset" for saying that Obama fucked up with DAPL and stood silent as indigenous protesters and American citizens alike got chemical burns from security forces.
Donald tRump should resign. Pass it on.

Thank you, No!  I know I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs my daddy but there is one thing FOR SURE, Trump ain‚Äôt it!!!
As Trump calls for delay of election  we should look at history. Idi Amin, "The Butcher of Uganda" &amp; Papa Doc &amp; Baby Doc of Haiti gave themselves titles like "President for Life". Trump proves he fills membership requirements for this deadly dictators group.
So, the DC court of appeals, with the recent Trump-appointee judge recusing becomes a 10-judge panel, 7 Dem appointees vs. 3 GOP appointees, two of whom were on the original 3-judge panel. Prediction: We have no idea what will happen next in this utterly bizarre case.
tRump is using diversionary tactics with his postpone the vote tweet. Please please bring the conversation, focus back to the dismal economy and to Herman Caine dying of Covid after Tulsa. Bring back the focus!

The hand-picked reporters at Trump pressers are pathetic. It‚Äôs a waste the American people time to watch his rodeo show.
I expect a weekly outrageous diversion from Trump to throw  everyone into a dither.
We are starting to see who will be advising  due to his current status. Obama will be in the background trying to reinstall all his job killing policies. If Biden wins, I'm going to laugh at all of you who voted for him as you lose your jobs. Trump 2020!
Capitalism is the only way for us that you are able and not only have you do the best you have ever seen.  This sounds like something Trump would say...

Why would your heart go out to a willing participant of a crime,  ?? Pompeo willingly helped Trump bribe a foreign ally. He was on the phone as he bribed the Ukraine President.  is STILL aiding &amp; abetting Trump. His credentials are irrelevant!
Mythology.  Reality is Trump pushed a drug based on anecdotal evidence that turned out to be false, and DJT cannot stand to be wrong.  If he had admitted his error instead of doubling down, it would have ended there.  Here's a timeline of all Covid tx:
On her Twitter page, Whitmer accused President Trump of being more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than protecting families from COVID-19.
No one is going to convict anyone of anything except for members of the Trump administration.  The "case" is bluster.  No serious investigator would have taken this long to build a case and indict.
I have a few friends who plan on driving to Detroit with me and acting as human barriers between the gestapo and the protesters if Trump‚Äôs stormtroopers show up.
The post office general trump installed is really doing a good job of messing up the place. This is surely correlated with Trump's desire to post pone the election.

Blood on your hands. Your campaign slogan: Trump Kills Americans
Don't you think if the GOP were interested in indicting the Obama administration they would have done so between 1/2017 and 1/2019 when they had the majority in the house &amp; senate? This is smoke to cover up Trump's failures.
Trump should be ashamed of himself.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans,"

No US President has stirred tension, hate, discord, discouragement and suffering as Trump has.  History will record his inept leadership and evil motives.  I have faith we will survive, having become yet stronger by gathering together to transcend the difficulties of these times.
Trump has pulled ALL AD out of Michigan. He is having multimillion dollar donation events so WHERE is that money going???
Trump has no legal authority to delay the election.  The end.  A side effect of the electoral college is that it is up to states to determine how they select electors for the president.  This is why some are proportional like Maine and others like Michigan are winner take all.

Trump's words are meant to cause chaos and concern. March on toward August and November. We won't let a wannabe despot usurp our democracy.
The GOP would rather eliminate the constitutionally guaranteed public service of the USPS, than let there be a fair election. I guess at this point they have to do anything they can. When Trump goes, all those who propped him up, will go too. The GOP is terrified.
Cain, a colon cancer survivor, was diagnosed with coronavirus in early July after attending a Trump presidential rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June.
And republicans support the killing of children and innocent civilians in the Middle East. All Trump has suppressed voters rights as well as killing over a 100k due to negligence over COVID. Stfu and sit down.

The more they talk the more I think that the overall vast majority of Trump supporters are retarded. I mean...I don't wanna think like that but it's just so hard not to.
Trump is only doing this so there will be a spotlight on the integrity of the election. You‚Äôre like silly putty in his hands.
Using single economic variables to predict presidential results is fraught. One model (used ~successfully before) based on this morning‚Äôs GDP plunge would suggest a Trump popular vote of 31%
I just hope the passing of #HermanCain due to the coronavirus is a WAKE-UP call to  supporters! There‚Äôs no snake-oil that will cure this deadly virus! Going to Trump insane rallies will only put you in more risk b/c he only cares about optics!
I think it‚Äôs vital for people to understand that Congress sets the election date and the Constitution sets the end of his term.  I think it‚Äôs also vital for people to understand that Trump and his admin are doing a LOT of things Congress and the Constitution say they can‚Äôt.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.
Tradition, respect, and decorum has absolutely worked so far so we should just keep counting on rules to save us from Trump and his GOP traitors.
I am completely exhausted with Trump. I am tired of his disregard for the Constitution. I am tired of his de facto declaration of war on American civilians. I am tired of his constant attempts to divide us. I am tired of his disregard for the norms of American governance.
Just pointing out that shortly before Trump tweeted about delaying the election, news dropped that the GDP shrank by 32%. Absolutely be enraged by the tweet, but also be positively livid about this.
"It‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans," ‚Å¶ said in an emailed statement.
Trump demands our kids go back to school yet thinks it is unsafe to vote... even though many states including Michigan can vote from home. #mileg #ridiculous
Agree with you, although I suspect all of this is part of the same strategy - if we can even call it that. And who knows if it‚Äôs truly Trump tweeting or Miller/others actively working to further erode trust in what‚Äôs left of this democracy.
After President Trump floats the idea of delaying #Election2020,  says he should focus on saving lives amid #COVID19.   ‚ÄúIf we could hold an election in the midst of a Civil War...we can hold one in 2020,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for [him] to get his priorities straight.‚Äù

Headline: "Trump Floats Delaying the Election After Worst GDP Report Ever."
Economy collapsed in 2Q. Trump distracts by suggesting election delay. Focus on his willfully negligent incompetence that‚Äôs cost more than 150,000 American lives and millions of jobs and small businesses.
Voting from home is safe.  Voting from home is secure.   We can ensure that all eligible voters can cast their ballot safely if politicians who don't like their poll numbers will stop getting in the way and pushing voter suppression.
Ever-prescient.
Just because my governor said one thing doesnt mean the idiot conservatives didnt don the very opposite because trump downplayed it and even supported them when they marched on our capital with confederate flags, swastikas and guns. Trump tweeted "liberate michigan"
Trump wants to push schools to open but how can parents send their children to school if they have nowhere to live?! This is another example of Trump &amp; the  never govern by looking at the big picture holistically. We need the #HEROESAct passed!
Trump fundamentally doesn‚Äôt understand who lives in many of these suburbs and how much they have significantly changed in the past two decades. Lizard Brain Reflex Politics.

Nothing's even happening in Detroit, any trouble that gets started there will be the direct result of Trump doing this.
Great point Beth. There are workarounds to all of Trump's treasonous schemes. For example, You don't have to wait for the absentee ballot application to be mailed to you, you can go to your Clerk's office when absentee ballots are ready to mail &amp; request yours that day.

This is absolutely amazing...SHOULD be more damaging than the pussy-grabbing tape because Trump has at least pretended to like and respect the "hills have eyes people."   while he never pretended to respect people with pussies.
Here‚Äôs the ‚Äòshocking exchange‚Äô Axios just had with President Trump
Talk about stupidity....  Trump is a complete and total failure.  He retweeted an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù who believes some diseases are caused by demon sex and alien DNA.  That‚Äôs your president.  If Trump had required testing of all international travelers earlier, we wouldn‚Äôt be here.
That‚Äôs such a great point  Trump has gotten everything w/no effort. His father gave him millions. He squandered it &amp; cheated to get more. He cheated to get the presidency. He lies. He commits crimes &amp; GOP/media wink at it! That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here!
I swear if Himmler came back to life and wrote an editorial against Trump for the NYT democrats would be like "OMG #Resistance #NeverTrump"
Yes but have you considered that they apparently don't like Trump so that means they are the good guys and they always were the good guys
I don't care how you want to rationalize her stupidity, she needs to answer for the decision that killed thousands of elderly. Her decision. No one else's. Not Trump, not whitey or evil Republicans. Her.
Trump said he dont care what yall have to say about gentrification! He is THROUGH
This pretty much is how I view Trump.
President  is painting a dystopian portrait of what  ‚Äôs America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would swallow communities should the former vice president win the White House in November.
No. Apparently there‚Äôs no end to the corruption of this administration, but today‚Äôs last straw was finding out that Trump was trying to have the FBI building improved so that property wouldn‚Äôt be sold to a commercial enterprise and be competition for his hotel! #EthicalWasteland
She‚Äôs black and pushing hydroxychloroquine. That‚Äôs all trump needed to know.
Facebook literally sent me a push notification to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss this post about Trump‚Äôs cure for COVID
A black woman who was pushing hydroxychloroquine was as all trump needed to see and hear.
Dangerous when so much hangs on an election many factors are able to compromise: 1. Trump supporters still support him strongly 2. Pandemic shutting down &amp; making fear of polling places 3. Lack of USPS funding to let them go bankrupt 4. Heavy campaigning &amp; spin on 'law and order'
This is trump‚Äôs new immigration policy.
You‚Äôre just talking about the president and I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to pick that all apart. Anyway, there are republicans on the ballot not named Trump.

If the trump gestapo didn‚Äôt go to Portland, there would have been MUCH LESS protesting and MUCH LESS violence. The protest/riots had been winding down and trump (purposely) sent troops to inflame more violence. All for his political purposes.  He doesn‚Äôt care about Portland.
They expect the poor and POC will be the ones more likely to send their kids to school due to need to work and lack of resources for home schooling. So they really just don‚Äôt care. The wealthy (like trump) will keep their kids home, and be able to provide resources, tutors, etc.

To understand what is happening in the US, you only need to analyze how many people are offended (if they are Republicans), or say it is fake-news (if they are Democrats) by telling them that if Trump does not win then Arabic numbers  will be imposed by law in schools.

You could make a bingo card of all the stories Trump was trying to distract us from. I‚Äôm gonna zero in on... losing a third of our GDP.
Trump stooges cause more violence. Period.
We had an election during the civil war, ww1 and ww2. Also the great depression but we can't have one now because Trump's gonna lose. It doesn't matter if if it's vote by mail or in person. Doesn't matter if it's by carrier pigeon or mental telepathy. Trump will lose.
Really? What makes you think we're worrying about Trump tweets. We have more important issues here in the real world! We Vote Biblically not politically.
But with Trump tweeting this he could depress turnout on his own base. We need to look at that as a good thing as it may tilt a state

I find it no coincidence that Trump sowed seeds of voter suppression on Twitter, on the day of John Lewis' funeral. And also on a day that Herman Cain (who contracted COVID-19 at Trump's Tulsa rally) died.  He's not a Commander In Chief, he's a Deflector of Grief.

Wrong.  The term is constitutionally fixed, not the election date.  His term ends in January whether we vote or not.
His distractions skirt the line of authoritarian far too often and we‚Äôve yet to see any significant pushback from Republicans.  How many impeachable distractions has Trump had?
GDP shrank by 32.9% last quarter.  doesn‚Äôt want to lead, leaving the Coronavirus response to the governors. I‚Äôd argue that if the response had been federalized and uniform, we‚Äôd be in a much better position. However, this way Trump has his scapegoats!

Do you agree that Trump never once said anything about injecting bleach? And since that never happened, its unethical for a congressman to say ‚Äúhe used those exact words‚Äù at a congressional hearing while using that inaccurate statement as proof of Trumps carelessness?
You really should apologize and admit what a terrible thing that was to infer and promise to vote for trump to show you‚Äôre not a racist
Are you trying to argue there‚Äôs no way to argue something objectively if you have an opinion? Like, if I were to agree with something Trump says or does it must mean I‚Äôm bias towards him?
All of it. It's called a dog whistle but trump uses a blow horn. He just assumes all white people are racist like him.

Rep. Jayapal: 'Bill Barr is the personal henchman for Donald Trump'
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
Btw. Donald Trump may have been a registered Democrat but you probably shouldn't use that as example seeing as he would probably sell his daughter to the highest bidder if he could make a few bucks.
Too late. If Trump's Covid test shows positive, he has the virus, right? A test is not the cure.
These two messages alone are harmless...however...what they've come to represent via the BLM movement is offensive to half the country.  Just like the slogan "Make America Great Again" is inoffensive, but it is tied to Trump and Trump is hated by the left.

So, the Biden campaign should not be complacent.  Still, Trump will not have the economy or a Reagan to lean on.  A ‚Äúno new tax‚Äù pledge in the face of soaring deficits (and following a huge tax cut for the wealthy) may not appeal.  Smearing VP Biden will be all he has.
Notably absent from his ad: - Any reference to party affiliation (he's a Republican) - Any reference to Trump (who Trump previously endorsed)  It's almost as if he knows that those two points hurt his prospects of getting elected (he won't).
‚ÄúIn the past week... [Trump] has accused Obama of treason, called his own niece a criminal, &amp; asserted that Biden wants to abolish ‚Äî deep breath ‚Äî the police, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, bail system, the 2nd amendment, &amp; intriguingly, the suburbs.‚Äù

Agreed. No president has been as stupid as Trump. Still, Reagan was  a Republican puppet for stupid republican policies. Trickle down economics, AKA piss on the poor, and massive deficit growth to name a couple. Nancy's "Just say no" is akin to Melania's "be best". Ridiculous.
Ronald Reagan was a good man, a great president, a true patriot, and he actually cared about this job.  Trump is none of those things. That he thinks he can compare himself among anything but the 5 worst presidents in our nation‚Äôs history is laughable.
Bush-Dukakis was more analogous ti the last election 2016 with Clinton-Trump, Clinton being the washington  insider.

If you try to build a tent around ‚Äúall cops are bad‚Äù you‚Äôre helping Trump.
Anyone they chose will have flaws, the only argument Trump has is that Biden is anti police and he‚Äôs law and order which is why Trumps goons are instigating shit across the country.  If your running mate is a former Chief of Police that cuts the legs out from Trumps main attack.
Val Demings is the perfect choice. Strong personality, good orator/story teller &amp; a former Chief of Police. Trump is running a ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù campaign, trying to make you out as anti police, a former Chief of Police as your VP is going to make that a tough needle to thread.
Nor was the Attorney General supposed to be trump's personal attorney.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
There's nothing selfless about trump, he's just figured out a way to keep a big pile of that money.
We need oversight, transparency on all that cash. Guaranteed the trump grift machine is hauling in a bundle.We call that a Trump‚Äôs America.  An America that is sick and broke.  We can fix that 11-3-2020.
Send Barron to public school riding on a public school bus.  Ditto for other (shudder) Trump spawn.  Come back and tell us how that worked out after a full semester.  Until then, let Trump donors continue you to pay you to be Jr.s old lady and zip it. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Wow. After what happened to you there is still that suck up to Trump.  You are in deep
Mark my words: if Trump loses, the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day will be the most dangerous 78 days in American history. Especially if he loses so decisively that he can‚Äôt make a case to contest it.
That‚Äôs rich coming from a Trump supporter. You ever hear the so called potus talk or read any of his tweets?
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), on the other hand, has publicly feuded with the White House, so much so that Trump issued an empty threat to block Vice President Pence from speaking with her. Whitmer's handling of the virus stands at 67 percent approval, a 5-point increase
You mean, the guy Trump hired? Funny how when they are working for Trump and kiss his ass they‚Äôre great, but when he inevitably fires them, they‚Äôre unreputable. Lol.
Herman Cain would still be alive if it weren't for Trump.
Really good people do not support Trump...not any Trump.

It makes me fiercely protective of the USPS because I love my mail carrier. We really need them to be supported, not cut like Trump is trying to. Everything is political.
I call it the trump virus.
Every time trump tweets you know that the truth is the opposite of what he says.  Every time he tweets something we should all simply reply ‚Äú That is a lie.‚Äù  Maybe we can push him over the edge.
Part of the reason that Trump Tweeted out his wacky "delay the election" today was to create a shiny object to distract from coverage of the John Lewis funeral coverage today.

Viruses are not alive and do not care if you do not believe in them. Herman Cain, former Republican presidential hopeful, has died of coronavirus. He was against wearing masks and attended Trump's Tulsa rally, then was ill in two weeks.
In the wake of peaceful demonstrations on the streets of Portland, President  sent in "federal" law enforcement to protect the federal courthouse, and made it clear that the Governor &amp; Citizens his Blackwater Trump Troops would use violence.  #PortlandProtests
Now try walking through Arlington.  Try asking yourself why a bounty on our military in Afghanistan is overlooked by Trump.  Ask yourself why Trump does not support NATO.
Well, the blood is on trump‚Äôs hands here. Way to have a super spreader event, refuse masks &amp; social distancing, then offer thoughts &amp; prayers when your friend dies. Just sick. #TrumpPandemicFailure
To the citizens who think big corporations love trump you might want to look at debbies donars list

Oh look, Trump is doing something illegal again today
Hope he thought attending Trump's rally was worth it!

That's a dangerous assumption. Good and decent people cannot conceive the diabolical methods in which someone like Trump, a man with no morals and no conscience, can come up with to game the system to his advantage. When it comes to how low he can and will go, there is no bottom.

How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.

The problem wasn't him closing the border. The problem was him selectively closing the border. Most of us feel the border should have been shut down completely. You can try to spend Trump's failed response back to the liberal-left. It just won't work. He failed to respond.
By ‚Äúbureaucratic barriers‚Äù she means adepquerte testing and trial period. Trump doesn‚Äôt care if the vaccine he sells you is gonna work, he just wants to make sure that it sells before the election so he can say he saved COVID smh.
If you truly feel that Donald Trump cares about any citizen in this country, other than himself, select family members, or those that kiss his ass on a daily basis, then you need to reevaluate your thought process.  If they truly cared, he would have never let this pandemic grow.

Trump set the wrong tone from the beginning by minimizing the virus. I think if he had listened to and deferred to Drs Fauci &amp; Birks we would be in better condition right now. In epidemiology a simultaneous response is always better than a sequential response.
I think if President Trump had gone on prime time television and said we're fucked unless we do what the experts say: shutdown, social distance, and wear masks, it would have gone a long way. Unfortunately that particular ability isn't in his bag of tricks.
Masks work. Unfortunately, President Trump was not willing to do what was necessary to stop the spread: what's known as a simultaneous response, a nationwide shutdown and stay at home order and mandated mask use. Had this been done, we would have been over this by early April.

New Hall of Presidents with Donald Trump - FULL SHOW  via  Great watch ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The election will be delayed because of the attacks on the federal buildings.  I almost wonder if Trump owns BLM and Antifa.  If he does, I support it.  It's brilliant.
To expand on this. One of their main talking points now is if trump loses they swear we are going to become a nation of socialists. Every one of these mother fuckers likely plans on social security for retirement, used PPP, cashed the stimulus check and will cash any that follow.
And then my old youth pastor makes a post calling for revival with a Trump speech accompanying it...and I wonder how we can move forward with thinking like that...
What are you saying?  Dems have the answers but are not going to present them until January?  To make Trump look bad?
No matter what happens, Trump will not leave the White House. Americans will support that.
Trump is horrible at the economy. Just awful.
Morons or traitors. There is no room left for his base other than those two categories.  Have lost my relationship with my father over this situation. Most of my extended family as well. Lots of trump supporters in WY unfortunately. Fuck em all at this point.
If Trump moves election day, we should all agree with the president.  This is an emergency.
I will support Trump in whatever decision he makes.
Why Trump Might Quit
Trump hates Democrats.
Tom Norton talks about his 'Pro Life, Pro Trump' stance
Obama and Biden handed trump the record high stock market and record low unemployment!   Check the facts!   Obama felt with viruses too but he listened to the experts and did the right thing.   trump created the problems here and still refuses to try to fix it.   He‚Äôs incompetent
TRUMP 2020
If you vote for Biden America will look like Trump‚Äôs America not the best message
Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy talking with Chris Como. What a trump cult ignorant a$$hole.
Strong words from a informed Trump supporter about delaying the election.
trump skated along on the work Obama and Biden did.  What has he done to react and correct the problem? Tell Americans to buckle down and fight this virus together to help the economy?  Nope! He had time to prepare prepare but called it a hoax.   He‚Äôs incompetent and ignorant!
Trump campaign on target for when voters head to the polls on November 3, 2021
Yes. Because he refused to wear a mask at Trump's rally in Tulsa, or anywhere else. But I mean, he did sign the rally waiver stating Trump wouldn't get blamed if he caught COVID, so I suppose he only has himself to blame eh
I like Amoebas and can‚Äôt idly stand by whilst you besmirch their intelligence.    is just a Trump drone.
If things get worse, I think it's likely that he resigns citing some "health concerns" then turns OANN into Trump TV and spend every day between now and the day he dies claiming he would have won if he'd stayed in office.

I don‚Äôt know one mom that is going to vote for Trump. They are all voting for Biden. And here in Grand Rapids Michigan, I don‚Äôt know one teacher that wants to teach in three weeks or one parent that wants to send her children to school in three weeks.
She‚Äôs gonna be oranger than Trump
I supported Trump in 2016. I voted for him, but I‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt be making the same mistake in 2020. This man does not act presidential at all. He‚Äôs running our country like a reality TV show. But the problem I have is him not acting presidential, and our poor economy.
Or, we should just have Trump and Biden stop campaigning and spend the rest of the time hearing what 3rd Party and Independent candidates have to say.
Look Kamala is trying to be funnyü§£ü§£ Trump is üíØ% going to be re-elected.
I blame Donald Trump's Presidency on those "annoying orange" videos that circulated for years.  It desensitized us.
just because trump can‚Äôt ‚Äútechnically‚Äù or ‚Äúlegally‚Äù delay the election doesn‚Äôt mean anything. we have seen what he is capable of in the last four years, and especially this year. he. does. not. follow. the. rules.  we must keep fighting.

if you are voting for trump unfollow me, block me, never talk to me again, i literally don‚Äôt care

VERIFY: Video purports to show Trump on hot mic criticizing supporters over masks
You need to educate yourself China knew of it in November and continued let people to fly to America without telling anyone until TRUMP stopped travel....TO SAVE LIVES. Another ignorant person spouting off without knowing anything.
He was a nasty trump supporter.  He didn‚Äôt care about his employees and paid them low wages, he didn‚Äôt care about the American people and he was stupid enough to think he didn‚Äôt need to wear a mask.... so i couldn‚Äôt care less that he died.....GOOD RIDDANCE.
DemoRat leaders are the main ones responsible for deaths mainly Cuomo Trump sent a ship to help them but no had to send them to a nursing home to kill everyone.. can't have anything positive toward TRUMP..rather have deaths.
TRUMP has nothing to do with Coronavirus deaths but hes responsible for the hate in your heart.
Oh bullshit. You lost control of Trump Virus as soon as it hit our shores.
They have to certify results by a certain deadline. I remember from 2000. Trump won‚Äôt be wish washy.
You know how I know that Putin is finished with Trump?   Because Charles Koch and the Federalist Society want him impeached   CC :
Imagine literally dying because you flew to Oklahoma to watch Donald Trump brag for an hour about being able to walk down a ramp and drink water with one hand
Let‚Äôs NEVER forget what trump has cost us. EVER!
100% fits the predictions of the worst possible outcomes under Trump. The signs were there before he was ever elected. A lot of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people said it was hyperbole &amp; those people need to be outright dismissed when they say stupid shit like Trump shouldn‚Äôt be taken literally.
So the king of litigation has threatened to litigate the election for years. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when conservatives hated constant litigation. I guess Nunes is too young to remember and trump really isn‚Äôt a conservative so...
"Trump just doesn‚Äôt know how to be subtle about this stuff."  I guess Emily, whoever the hell she is, thinks Nixon was subtle.  Emily, go home and play with your crayons.
Went on a couple of dates during law school with a woman who had an "ironic" Herman Cain bumper sticker on her car. I hope she still has it because the irony has never been better given that he died from COVID after refusing to wear a mask at Trump's Tulsa rally
COVID the curse of Trump....
trump said can‚Äôt get voted out if we never vote ü¶†ü¶†
We are supposed to take someones opinion seriously that is just now having a problem with Trump?
trump wants to CANCEL the election and become president for life! Can you imagine if President Obama had tried that? But President Obama has read &amp; understands the US Constitution. Unlike trump who can't even read! WE cannot allow trump to become Dictator!
I didn't either, and that's why I wished people would have taken me seriously when I said Trump. Is. A. Fascist.
All internal polls, and I work on them, show a massive Trump landslide.  The media is lying to you.  They know he will win that is why they are pulling out all the stops.
Perhaps once he leaves office in January, prosecutors in #Tulsa should consider charging  with involuntary manslaughter, since  probably contracted #COVID19 at Trump's ludicrous campaign event.

It's 2016 all over again. That's why Trump can't win.  I'm so glad Hillary has been president these four years.
Trump basically tells U. S. Americans your 1st Amendment is no longer. Calls protesters pro-anarchists, ppl that hate our country, beehive of terrorists, to be "cleared out" or he's sending in the National Guard (and others) to do it.  aka : Trump declares war on 1st Amendment.
In this instance, Immurement for Trump seems appropriate.
I didn‚Äôt know there was a press conference today I was watching Obama‚Äôs speech at John Lewis‚Äôs eulogy. After listening to this press conference it‚Äôs clear Trump just wanted a little attention. Babbaling nonsense. ü•±#ThanksObama #JohnLewisMemorial #TrumpIsAnIdiot
üéØüéØüéØ  The Federalist Society just sent a message to the GOP:  Lose Trump, or lose the Koch brothers money.    - this is why.
Keep talking Trump!!
Here‚Äôs what I predict:  The Maxwell documents will tie Trump to Epstein/Maxwell and Mogilevich.  Deutsche Bank.   The money.   His calls to Putin, the bounties, and Volume 5 will show he‚Äôs working for Russia.    He will be forced to resign.
Shit for brains doesn‚Äôt even want to be re-elected. He just wants to lay the grounds to say he really didn‚Äôt lose. He won‚Äôt fight to stay. He‚Äôs too lazy. This is just another distraction. He wants to build trump tower Moscow and golf.
‚ÄúThe interpersonal traits include glibness, superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying and manipulation of others. The affective traits include a lack of remorse and/or guilt, shallow affect, lack of empathy and failure to accept responsibility.‚Äù  Trump is a psychopath.
Trump just showed that he's bound and determined to object to, litigate and denounce anything other than his victory in Nov. election. And remain in office til his victory is confirmed. WAKE TH FK UP AMERICA, A DICK-TATOR IS ATTEMPTING TO OVERTHROW THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA !!
Please support vote by mail in all states as we have in Wyoming! Please support our post office‚Äîyou know how bad it will be in rural states if you allow Trump to ruin it.
Well. I had considered voting for him, but he just ran a new ad and he‚Äôs firmly aligning with Trump (which I‚Äôm sure is so he can get $$$, so he‚Äôs not getting my vote.
So weeks after the house passed a bill to fund schools, pay citizens another stimulus, trump is saying his administration wants it but dems dont
Just a heads up, sir....I've heard that the expected mail in date should be changed to Oct 14th due to increased amount of mail and the expected forced slow down by trump's new postmaster general.
Then why are running? You stand with trump 2000%, you have zero plans and a disgraceful person for standing with white supremacist and Russians paying for dead soliders.  Do the right thing and drop out now. Michigan doesn't want you or trump.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
üéØüéØ  It‚Äôs the MONEY.   Epstein/Trump/Mogilevich
What Trump is saying is that computerized ballot-counting is going to be rigged in his favour in as many states as he can manage it.  Believe it.
3 of 3, This is the reason why Trump evoked this law. Argue, complain and morally disagree, it doesn‚Äôt change the laws of the universe. I didn‚Äôt make them God did. Someone needed to revoke this and Trump did. I support it because it makes sense.

I don‚Äôt think she has sex dirt on Trump.   I think she has evidence that he‚Äôs been working for Semion Mogilevich.
Trump's doesn't support any of that. He could not care less about you or me. He wants to lower taxes on businesses to help himself, host official events at his properties to make money, and ignore rulings by numerous federal judges because he thinks he's above the law.
As usual you guys will twist any story to make it anti-Trump. Liz can take care of herself. So can those other men. You‚Äôre grasping.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yes, all of that concrete evidence, including Trump ADMITTING WHAT HE DID didn't prove anything. How dense can people be?
Obozo had 8 years to help and did nothing but destroy more and more , the racial divide in America NOW is Directly a result of his bias rhetoric throughout his 2 terms. sad and pathetic compared to the uplifting Positive accomplishments in 3 years by TRUMP . VOTE Trump 2020
President Trump to hold news conference Thursday afternoon
Mitch McConnell IS trying to save himself and the party.   That is my point.    He will force Trump to resign to save the party.   Impeachment or resignation.
Obama had no right calling down Trump in a solemn eulogy? Save it for the campaign you stupid idiot!You suck Barack! Literally you have!
Of course he supports the protests!  Everyone should!  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you agree with the protest or not, we have the right per the 1st!   We‚Äôre done with the racism or trump and his MAGAts.   Even republicans are against trump!   #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica

Q&amp;A: Tom Norton talks about his 'Pro Life, Pro Trump' stance
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna win big but also I‚Äôm scared of losing which is why I floated the (unconstitutional) idea of delaying the election!‚Äù -Donald Trump, wannabe dictator
Biden is better than trump in every  way!  trump has destroyed the economy, has millions unemployed, has killed 150,000+ and still hasn‚Äôt acted to correct any of it.  He‚Äôs a disgrace and a total and complete moron!! Also, 20,000 lies in less than 4 years and is Putin‚Äôs puppet!
WHY HAVEN'T YOU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP FULLY MOVED TO PARLER? ARE YOU JUST GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT, OR ARE YOU SEEKING ANOTHER PARADIGM, MEANT TO CONDITION THE AMERICAN PPL?  STOP If Twitter is censoring US, it's time to go! Why give their stock a boost?
They can‚Äôt.    The trump campaign made them all sign a waiver saying they couldn‚Äôt be held responsible if they got covid.    Cain is just as responsible for his death as trump is.
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?
Stop lying.   He beat cancer back in 2006.   He died from covid and got it because of trump and the rally he had to have with no safety protocols enforced.   150,000 + people have died from #trumpvirus and this one is the only one he has shown any sorrow over.   Trump owns it all
His death was preventable.   The other 150,000+ deaths were too. trump called it a hoax, he didn‚Äôt act to protect us, he made wearing a mask political, he chose to hold a rally even after being warned it was dangerous.   #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K trump still won‚Äôt help us!
Fauci is bought and paid for by the ELITES who are trying to destroy our world!  Trump cannot dismiss his advice at this point, but SOON!  #GreatAwakening #FauciTheFraud #ChinaLiedPeopleDied #ObamaPaidChina #MyPresident #GodWins #GoodvsEvil #DarkToLight #WWG1WG“âA üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

What about Quid pro Joe Biden being under investigation by Ukrainian officials. That's going to bite him for sure.Trumps going to est Bidens lunch if Biden ever debates TRUMP. Biden will wiggle his way out of it so how..mark my words..it will happen.
Trump is forcing us to see color. üòÇüëáüèΩ
It's funny how when you tRump's are desperate you try to put the attention on someone else. Nobody cares where Hunter is. We care your daddy is a  criminal and failure. The same way you're a criminal.
THROUGHOUT His WHOLE LIFE when facing certain defeat #Trump‚Äôs knee-jerk response has been to find a way to CHEAT, why is anyone surprised that #Trump wants to find a way to cheat, EVEN IF IT MEANS THROWING AWAY THE  CONSTITUTION! Americans need to turn the bumb out. #VoteBlue
That‚Äôs a lie spread by trump!   Look at Europe‚Äôs death rate vs the US.    Europe has a bigger population but has beaten the virus and is almost totally open.   Meanwhile, cases in the US are still beating records of new cases and deaths every single day with no end in sight.
#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Yeah, he was super good at weaponizing the intelligence community and letting them spy on Trump and try to set up him and his campaign people for crimes they didn‚Äôt commit. Super good, I tell ya.
But see, if the Trump-appointed Postmaster General weren't slowing down the mail (for example, I love 12 miles from my city clerk but it took my ballot 2 weeks to get to me), there wouldn't BE boxes of uncounted ballots, and we wouldn't need to push back the election. Js
DISTRACTION ALERT üö®   Trump can‚Äôt delay the election.  Congress has that power.   I heard Mitch on the radio today saying the election WILL happen.    He didn‚Äôt say a word about mail in votes or voter fraud.   I‚Äôm telling you,  Mitch is finished with Trump.
Has trump even once shown any sympathy for the other 150,000 people he killed with the #trumpvirus?   Nope?    We all feel sympathy but all of these people dying didn‚Äôt have to happen.    He still could do something to stop people from dying but he won‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt care!
I don't wish death on anyone who has/had COVID-19, including Republicans. With that being said, Donald Trump can go to hell for his role in their death.
‚ÄúTrumpers don‚Äôt follow logic. They follow Trump.‚Äù Truer words have never been spoken, my friend.
Why is it I understand what Trump is doing with his tweets and you don‚Äôt, Bill?
In the beginning they didn‚Äôt  know everything about the virus and PPE was in short supply. Shortly after that all medical experts said to wear masks to stop the spread.   It had been well reported and trump knew it! He called it a hoax, he ignored the warnings #trumpvirus
It‚Äôs not Biden or Obama‚Äôs responsibility to do wither of those things.   They had been out of office for over 3 years.    trump is the one responsible!  All of this happened in his presidency.   He called it a hoax and made a virus political, not them! #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
I don‚Äôt need to even watch. Trump can pass cognitive tests. Biden cannot. No debate. And for you to vote despite knowing that shows you do not have the ability to put your personal opinion of trump aside
He did not!   Why are you lying?  He had beaten cancer but was admitted to the hospital with covid shortly after attending trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally with no mask.
1 BILLION votes cast and there have been 37 cases of election fraud. I don't think its a problem.   This is interesting. What do you make of it?
Now do Trump!!
Trump train 2020
also 'especially me'  The Trump Holy Trinity - Me, Myself and I
Regardless of where he got it, he infected others because he didn‚Äôt believe it was real.    trump and his mishandling of the virus and ignoring safety measures led to his death.   150,000+ American lives lost thanks to #trumpvirus
Same debacle w/  - What is happening to #JulianAssange is disgusting &amp; makes me ?? if #Trump is a swamp monster. A man guilty of nothing but revealing truth of #Corruption to #ThePeople has spent 450+ days in prison (most in solitary). Are we ruled by criminals?
They had no masks and inches from the state troopers face shouting screaming in their face they actually had a naked dark haired barbie doll hanging from a noose representing the govenor of michigan at this point if you support tRump you are definitely RACIST!!!!!!
Then TALK TO TRUMP!!!

Simple way to fix this "Nadler Myth " is to bring out some swat armored vehicles with 30mm watercannons and clean up the smelly rioters, wash out some mouths, and clean the streets.Bam done.MACA =MAKE AMERICA CLEAN AGAIN  Come on president TRUMP gitrdone!

Will Trump give the Eulogy at Herman Caine's funeral?ü§î
Obama has not been president for over 3yrs..... and secondly the COVID-19 VIRUS came just  THE BEGINING OF THIS YEAR so WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT mr. Cain got INFECTED AT THE RALLY IN TULSA AFTER TRUMP WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT SPOT JESUS YOU #45 SUPPORTERS R NUT JOBS...
That was the fault of CV19 and the lockdowns, not Trump. Nice try.
It's a social contact issue, especially indoors. The fact you even lump the 2 together is disturbing. Whitmer has at least acted in good faith. Trump only cares about re-election. He could give a damn about the public's well being, clearly.
If the orange Jim Jones can delay an election, America is over. #WeWillVote #Trump #COVID19 #COVID
Seriously Joe? If President Trump used a funeral for a political platform, you‚Äôd be losing what‚Äôs left of your mind!
Only difference is absentee requires a reason,  mail in does not. Also why is it only controversial now but not when trump votes this way always anyways
The trump presidency
Trump supporters are as dumb as they look.
I‚Äôm not black. But I know ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black if you vote for trump‚Äù
Trump has drawn a line in the sand. It's his "us against them" mentality. John Lewis, an icon, a true leader and a role model for millions of Americans was not part of trump's "us". He wants American against American. Division makes us weaker. Putin must be proud.
Damn right I support Trump ! Who else ? Joe? Nobody has seen joe for weeks! He doesn‚Äôt do live interviews, no live appearances where he will answer questions. The guys a mess and the left is trying to elect a ‚Äúweekend at Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äú candidate that‚Äôs shit nuts!
#HydroxychloroquinWorks - No one should be denied treatment for any ailment by a politically driven bureaucracy lost in the hate for one man President Donald J. Trump!
To blame trump for a global pandemic is ignorant. As if he has the control of over 300 million ppl. And nobody even knows the numbers? False positive tests, fake numbers. I‚Äôd say nazi Germ, I mean China, has handled it the worst. After all they started it.
What I find most frightening is that whether or not this scenario is likely, few doubt Trump would be willing try such a prank. And his enablers would be all in.

I was the greatest adorer of Herman Cain, me, Donald J Trump, me - "Herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him, especially me"
Did he die because he attended Trump rally without a mask??
President Trump knows he has no authority to delay the election, and that any attempt would be in violation of the Constitution.  His remarks are designed to distract us from the news our economy has shrunk a record 33% under his leadership. But we won‚Äôt forget. #WeWillVote
For Trump speak about it, it will be true, they laughed when he said his campaign was spies on, they laugh when he called the media fake news etc.   it all comes to be truth! Hell yea they will cheat
As a society we need to have the will to solve this voting problem (if there is a problem to be solved).   We don't delay an election because of a national crisis. Delaying the election WOULD BE a national crisis for our democracy.
How about you actually stand by these principales and stand against Trump?  150k dead, 32% drop in GDP, constant lies and a blatant refusal to do what needs to be done.
Who cares.  Stop giving them showtime.  Today is not their day to distract from Rep. John Lewis.  I'm ready to fight even harder.  I will not let him down.  Trump and his minions are going down!
I'm voting him out of there.  I'm not taking any bs from people attacking mail in voting or any misinformation. Especially today. Rep. John Lewis didn't fight his whole life (as well as numerous Americans) for an imbecile like Trump and his goons to destroy our democracy.

The list of "things Trump is doing that would've outraged Republicans if Obama did it" is very long at this point. This goes near the top of the list if only because Obama actually did it with the auto bailout and Republicans are on record being outraged over it.

Things not to delay: the election, Trump's removal from office, and Trump's entry into a facility where he can take as many cognitive tests, get as many disinfectant injections, and tweet into the ether as much as he needs every day.
What hate? Look at Biden‚Äôs racist quotes that never gain traction from the media ...  trump done way more for black communities thru employment than Biden has ever done
Trump is un-American. He has done nothing but bad for our nation. It is patriotic to not support him.
He‚Äôs trying to distract from a great man‚Äôs funeral. F off trump.
Trump‚Äôs call to delay election is the opening act of a coup

Trump 2020! Let‚Äôs clean out the swamp and KAG!
Trump can go to hell.  Challenging our democracy is non-negotiable!   We will run our as scheduled or you will see anarchy in the streets!
But open the economy! At this point Trump isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs his enablers  and his far right evangelical base that does not believe in democracy.
Wyoming....Trump country!
How I see trump cult followers "Hi, I'm a Trump cultist, my favorite color is clear."
I thought all these people were leaving to Canada if Trump won the election 2016?
Trump ur concern about ur safety, but not ur base safety, why?  Herman Cain ran for president, a while back, in case some people do not know who he is. The 999 guy!!!
Nah. But there's the small matter of a pandemic that we're dealing with right now. You may have read about it. Prior to it, we had record low unemployment. To lay today's unemployment solely at the feet of Trump is being willfully ignorant.
Trump, do u feel any guilt??? By telling him not to wear a mask? U made sure u kepted far away from ur base, why?

Superb conversation between Eleanor Wachtel and Masha Gessen. Trump, Putin, Russia, history, politics, power.
Now do Trump and this voter fraud business
trump killed him and 150,000+ more American citizens.   Dismissing and calling a virus a hoax while demonizing people for wearing masks.   Holding in person rallies without proper safety in an area where covid was raging.    Preventable deaths pushed by trump and republicans.
Trump starts promoting Dr Demon Sperm, then he decides to 'pull out" of Germany.  Coincidence? #DemonSperm #DemonSemen #pullout
The senate should remove him, if they cared one bit for this country they would do it!    trump will never resign but they have the power to stop him, they are all as bad as he is!
I disliked Trump as a person long before he ran for President. Even if we politically aligned I wouldn't have been able to vote for him because of the person he is.
Who could have predicted this?!?!1!2  Trump hires a huge donor ($1.2 mil) to run the USPS. First in decades with 0 USPS experience. Now service is being slowed severely, talk of shutting down post offices, all to help the president's reelection.
Trump is a Trojan horse for Putin.   He does everything Putin wants.   #traitortrump #TR45TOR
He doesn't really like that Trump tweets. I don't understand why. But I think that is part of it. He's just too literal.
He died because of trump.
Trump is simply doing this to force the hand of the Libs on working with him to end the pandemic. Heady play by trump.  Left is trying to drag this out as long as possible and inflate numbers to sway the American people away from voting for trump.
If trump delays voting I along with millions will protest in front of the White House like there was no tomorrow.  Voting delay will not be tolerated‚Äîwe need him outta there yesterday.
Trump has indicated he will not vacate the White House if he loses the election...maybe him and  can share bunk beds?! #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpMeltdown
Trump got 62% in Ottawa County, and by and large that's where we keep the Dutch.
Well trump is in quite a tizzy today. Calling for a delay in our election. Your silence hurts me.
Trump doesn‚Äôt give a single shit about Covid or the people it‚Äôs killing. But as soon as he sees it as an excuse to wrongfully extend his presidency he‚Äôs taking full advantage of it. I don‚Äôt get how his followers can be so ignorant, and how the GOP can be so corrupt to follow him.
Especially with trump supporters
Trump is just doing what he always does, and that's exposing the lefts hypocrisy. He just started a debate and a dialogue that I didn't see coming and I don't think they did either. We are ok brother.
It makes me sad to know the democrats will go to these lengths to destroy trump!! Those children need school to live.
Whitmer: Trump should focus on saving lives, not threatening to delay 2020 electionIf the entire news cycle today had been about the fact that the economy dropped 32.9% while China‚Äôs economy grew last quarter, it would have done untold lasting damage to his polling numbers.   Trump knew that. He acted. He made today about the date of the election.
I‚Äôm concerned with the response in our country once we knew: Trump has failed. Stop deflecting!
No, it doesn't. But I am not a partisan who is completely blind to the world around me.  The second Trump wins, the likelihood of World War 3 starting with China is high.  They already own Biden.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You cannot prove that guccifer 2.0 even exist, much less that they are Russian intelligence.  How was Stone to know that guccifer was Russian intelligence?   And if you knew, how was Trump to know the stone knew?  You say I'm  in a fantasy, but you can't answer simple questionsüòÅ
We CAN make things better for working people in Michigan: Join me in defeating Donald Trump this November --&gt;
This relies on both guccifer 2.0 being a Russian agent, which they weren't.  It also relies on Trump knowing that stone talkedto someone who was not a Russian agent but knowing he was at the time.  On top of that, it's still not the conspiracy they lied to you about.

Ha ha ha  You're funny!  Trump will have some type of stream of thought where he abdicates any responsibility  Referring to Cain: "Wrong place at the wrong time" &amp; "No one knew that could happen" "Even the scientists didn't know - They've never seen anything like that before"
China too had a lockdown but it did it early and right and contained the coronavirus. China‚Äôs GDP grew by 3.2% in the second quarter while US Q2 GDP shrank by 32.9%, the worst performance on record.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain - vote Trump out!

Trump is helping popularize the notion that suburbs are racist faster than progressive have ever been able to.
Yeah, that would make the virus real for them, but probably wouldn't end their love of Trump.
The difference shown in the fourth photo, where Trump ducks down to not appear taller than Putin... That pretty much says everything.
I don't think so. Trump sycophants seem to have the exact same mentality that flat-earthers do. Being in the Trump club makes them feel special.
Trump is the biggest racist in the US today.  And he seems proud of it.  He is hoping at this point that all his equally racist voters will vote for him on his racist platform.  I can only hope that there are more people in this country that are not racist and do NOT VOTE FOR HIM
Tlaib is a fighter who puts her actions where her values are. That's what inspires voters to turn out for her, and that's what will make her a powerhouse at turning out her voters against Trump this November.

He just wants to prove Trump right above all else. He's being a good servant.
I guess that's not you, eh? But prove me wrong, cite anything that's even mildly inconvenient for Trump.
Wow, you don't know Trump. His ego will not allow him to accept defeat at this point. He could be polling 0% support and he would be calling it a media lie.

They are only obsessed with proving Trump right.
He's reminding himself of what Trump's shit smells like.
Sadly they don't care and even go as far as to say it's all fake. It will literally take every single Trump supporter losing someone to the virus for it to be real, and then they will still try to blame someone else.

Eh!!!! Wrong answer!!! The real story is Donald Trump and everyone associated with him are traitors.
I say this a Democrat who is deeply, and existentially, committed to defeating Trump.  Tonight, I'm a bit shook.
Today, Trump signed an executive order targeting the cost of prescription drugs.  If he signs orders canceling student debt or medical debt, or decriminalizing weed, the work to get him out of the office will become much much harder.
Thanks to  for flagging this article. The idea of canceling student debt isn't new to Trump and his administration. He could do it.  As Dems and people who want to defeat him, we need to be talking about this and we should be worried.
Absolutely.  My family and I will have our citizenship status taken away and be on the pathway to deportation if Trump is re-elected.  No.
If Trump signs an executive order canceling student debt next, we're fucked.
For folks that want Trump out of the White House, this is really really really bad.
November will be wonderful. Trump will win re-election by a margin so large that the media will lose the last shred of credibility that it has. Then we can have real news again, and talk about world events.üëçüá∫üá∏

Elizabeth Warren voted to reign in Trump's military budget and abuses, just ICYMI.
I hate that this is going to reach more people today than the fact that she voted to give Trump's military a blank check to continue its reckless abuses.
You're literally enabling Trump's fascism.
I want to make one thing clear:  Any Democrat that voted against the amendment today to reign in Trump's military budget is PRO Trump doing fascist things with that massive budget you just let him have.
If you framed today‚Äôs amendment in terms of reigning in Trump‚Äôs abuses as well as deflating a bloated budget, the narrative is completely different.   All of the sudden Dems that voted against it are pro-giving Trump more money to do fascistic things with.
Today, lots of Democrats voted to give Trump - a fascist - a blank checkfor a military that he controls.   Including my own Michigan Senators  and    I‚Äôm beyond disappointed!
Democratic leaders have called Trump a fascist. I agree.   Today, lots of them voted in the Senate and the House to continue giving him an unlimited check for his military.   Imagine giving more money to a fascist for a military that they control??
Don‚Äôt give Trump a blank check on military spending.   Pass it on.
Why do Democrats continue to give Trump a blank check when he‚Äôs shown that he‚Äôs willing to use federal troops to violently attack American cities where lots of Democrats and people of color live?
Ronald Reagan and George Bush were more violently racist than Donald Trump.   Their actions led to the destruction of millions of Black and Brown lives.   The War on Drugs The Wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan

Trump stooges cause more violence. Period.
I'm super excited for that akward moment at Herman Cain's wake when Trump starts screaming, "Boar On The Floor," at all the Republicans.
It wasn't a mistake for people to vote for Trump once. And it won't be a mistake when people re-elect him. The other side has neither a good candidate or platform. "Orange man bad" isn't going to cut it.

Can she just shut up...how is she an elected official..she is just as bad as trump..just runs her mouth, looking for attention and headlines..
So... we all agree Trump killed Herman Cain right?
People just want to try in discredited this one from back In 2014 so now Dems&amp;Libs Trump Haters sprinkle truth with BS thats why  as a Good #Trump2020  good to put them in there place when you can üôÇ
Says the American living under Trump ... the most disgraced President ..... EVER. No one but Trump disgraces our great nation. Noe one but Trump has ruined our economy. No one but Trump has let the COVID crisis get to where it is. No one but Trump has failed as largely as he....
Covid destroyed their business. You know, the virus trump can‚Äôt seem to get a handle on.
DEMS&amp;LIBS Trump Haters sprinkle a little truth 10% with about 90%bullshit and watch and see who eats it upü§î
So why didn't Trump do that on a national level for USA? If that would have worked, why didn't he do it for us?
Answer my question first. Why do you respect Trump, he is a criminal? He robbed thousands of people with Trump University, has settled Sexual abuse cases with money, and stole from St. Judes Charity.
"not getting stds was my own personal Vietnam" Donald Trump
.....(his casino was one of 'em). Trump had 2 go begging on his hands &amp; knees 2 Putin. Y? No bank in the WHOLE FRICKIN' WORLD would lend him $$. Y? Bcuz he NEVER PAYS BANKERS BACK the MONEY HE BORROWS from them. By the way--voters KNEW this fact WELL-B4 Election Day in 2016!
So why do you respect Trump? He is a criminal.
I don‚Äôt say much of anything about anything these days. There‚Äôs too much fucking noise. But, were this to occur you would find me in the street. Armed if necessary. We vote.   Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Trump‚Äôs voters can physically go to the polls.. it won‚Äôt be cold, social distancing don‚Äôt matter, and a mask is optional.
Putin is Trump's ONLY "mentor". A more accurate title is DEBT COLLECTOR. Trump owes Putin more than $40 MILLION in a BIG-ASS loan he took out with the Russian King a LONG time ago 4 help in getting out of crushing debt from his bankruptcies in a couple of his biz ventures...
Of you‚Äôre voting for trump.. stand in line.. if you‚Äôre going the other way, mail it in!
Donald Trump was busy leading the country.
Yet you support Donald Trump?
We all want life back to normal. It shouldn‚Äôt be political. Trump thinks this is happening to hurt him. It‚Äôs not. Idiots will still vote for him whether they are working or not. Smart people won‚Äôt vote him whether they are working or not. Nothing will change based on the economy.
I see we've arrived at the circle of hell in which Donald Trump proposes postponing the election.
We had an election during the civil war, ww1 and ww2. Also the great depression but we can't have one now because Trump's gonna lose. It doesn't matter if if it's vote by mail or in person. Doesn't matter if it's by carrier pigeon or mental telepathy. Trump will lose.
Guess Comrade tRUMP is shitting his pants right now. Tick tock little man, tick tock, there is a prison cell with your name on it waiting for you...
informed Trump of the payments and bounties. He went on TV and said he believed Putin didn‚Äôt do that. What President takes the word of a enemy over actual proof the Pentagon gave him? He put no sanctions on Russia. Also, North Korea killed Otto Warmbier. Trump believes Kim Jong.
....show up in DROVES 2 vote her the HELL outta office--along with Trump. Though Trump's ASS was SAVED by Collins, don't look 4 him 2 SUPPORT her. Actually, that's her ONE shot at winning. If she has MORE brains than she APPEARS 2 have, she'll avoid Trump like the BUBONIC PLAGUE!
Obama had a lot of drop the ball moments, that being said, I appreciated that he was calling this shit out in public. I assume it's only going to piss Trump off because he's super jealous of him.
Really? What makes you think we're worrying about Trump tweets. We have more important issues here in the real world! We Vote Biblically not politically.
Kid u really have a lot to learn. Russia put bounties on our soilders. The Taliban (Which Trump had a meeting with) has been killing our soilders and getting paid by Russia. The Pentagon tracked payments received by Taliban fighters from Russian backed bank accounts. The pentagon
If the good folks running Twitter had any common sense they would suspend Trump for life if he loses in November. The chaos he will try to incite with his provoking tweets will be never ending if they don‚Äôt
Susan Collins was either LYING 2 cover herself, after voting 2 NOT ALLOW for EVIDENCE 2 b presented by the PROSECUTION in a "TRIAL" of Defendant Trump. Or Collins was being ASTONISHINGLY NAIVE in thinking Trump learned his lesson. As a GOP-CON in 50-50 DEM-GOP Maine, DEMS WILL...
Trump didn't close businesses.  Gretchen did.  Trump didn't ruin the state's unemployment system (I'm still waiting-- since March), Gretchen did.  Trump didn't create a backlog at the SOS so it's not possible to renew my driver's license, Gretchen did.
Trump didn't tell me to F*** off, like you did.  Trump (Fed government) is the only one that's helping me through the pandemic, not hurting me like your brown haired hero.
People wouldn‚Äôt care if it wasn‚Äôt for the left media which is 100% negative of trump. There‚Äôs no balance there to even allow an organization on the other side to be impartial
Conservative Legal Expert: Trump Election Tweets Are Grounds For Impeachment  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
The stupidity being displayed by Donald Trump and his MAGA base towards #COVID has been seen before. During the 1918 pandemic there was resistance to wearing masks. Just plain dumb. #WearADamnMask #COVIDIOTS #Maddow
IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID! Trump is DEFLECTING attention away from the ATOM BOMB BLAST that is the U.S. ECONOMY--which fell 2 a depth not seen in a HUNDRED YEARS! If Trump's response 2 Covid was taken SERIOUSLY by THIS POTUS--by Trump--the summer economy could have prevented this.
To any trump supporter if you still support this President after all of his failures and incompetence,it‚Äôs only because you like his white supremacy messageÔøºÔøº.Ôøº
Is everyone under the impression that average Americans get their news from Trump‚Äôs pressers? I‚Äôm quite confident the GDP numbers were a huge aspect of the news today. Plus, Herman Cain, John Lewis, Obama, et al.
Well, Herman (The Hermanator) has kicked the bucket, he proved his undying love for Trump.
If America isn‚Äôt safe, it‚Äôs happened under trump
....CHUMP?! ALL Democrats? Pretty SURE of the voting electorate, eh SPORT?! I'm guessing that u haven't VOTED too often. Ever hear of EXPERIENCE? It's ONE of a thousand things WRONG with Trump--who had none. Biden has MORE than anyone. ELECTABILITY. Biden HAS it! Not Bernie.
Trump doesn‚Äôt protect our soldiers from our enemies nor does he protect their right to vote by mail. Trump has betrayed his oath of office. Impeach and remove this threat to democracy! Does he get to steal another election?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Cmon, ‚Å¶‚Å¶ Make them put their names on this crap or hit delete. Journalism 101  ‚ÄúWe'll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing," a senior campaign official told CNN.‚Äù
If trump wrong with his calculations to make himself look good.  It‚Äôs the same thing Biden said trump should stop flights from China and overreacting. Now Biden said he didn‚Äôt say that. I remember loud and clear. Trump wall vs Joe Biden telling trump not to put band on travel.
y‚Äôall Latinos defending Trump for offering to pay for Vanessa Guillens funeral knowing damn well he‚Äôs only doing it for press..
The Donald Trump regime is slightly more real than the regime of Elizabeth the 2nd.
This commerical is the best. their son is in a coma for 3 years wakes up to find everybody wearing masks you remember Trump is still pres he said yes they say children in cages, #BLM the mother says I guess they should have them bc they keep killing them
IDGAF that this pairing is totally out of context.
But with Trump tweeting this he could depress turnout on his own base. We need to look at that as a good thing as it may tilt a state
I just saw someone on this website suggest voting as a way to combat trump delaying the election.  I-
Sure hope so. If Trump loses, America collapses and the whole world goes with it.
And I don‚Äôt want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn‚Äôt question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. üôÑNo wonder
Trump is in election trouble, so he's confusing Americans, eroding trust - Business Insider
Hard to FUCKING believe! Believe me: after Trump's done FUCKING UP AMERICA with this HIGHWAY ROBBERY SHIT, Biden--should HE lose--WILL ABSOLUTELY appeal the results. And WIN! Bcuz Trump will HAVE 2 CHEAT 2 come out ahead on Election Day.
Everybody talks about well we got to take out Trump so what really is the plan what comes next?
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn‚Äôt for progressive policies
I am totally in the "vote out Trump" mode.  The electoral college, the way campaigns are financed, the whole thing is stacked against people who think like me.  Certainly not a cure!
Trump when he found out he doesn‚Äôt have the authority to move the election date:
Lighten up Twitter and get on the right side of America. Your censorship of free speech is pathetic. You are an American company. Act like it. 1st amendment applies to all. Not just your politically biased side.  Donald Trump Jr. sounds off on 'Fox
Not everyone‚Äôs as informed and educated about the deep complexities of foreign policy and its generational effect on Americans as you. You‚Äôre right, but no one even cares right now. No intelligent dialogue about policy will truly take place until Trump is out of office.

ü§£ Thank you  for shouting "WHHAAT?!?!" on  just now in response to the news that Trump is suing to disallow #ballot drop-off in Pennsylvania. A much-needed laugh, and perfect channeling of my mood watching the news tonight.  #MailInVoting #Absentee
Wait so the Lancet is in it for money, but a group named "America's Frontline Doctors," who have no evidence of having worked any COVID patients, funded by Tea Party Patriots, are totally legit? I mean... if Trump is your Messiah, you can't be saved. I'll follow the science.
Big Pharma cancelled it on him
My thing is if Trump farts the wrong way, everyone gets the talking shit.
I can‚Äôt tell you how many voters, even strong trump voters, hate the twitter sprees.
I don't know why you are giving 'Admiral' Giroir any airtime. That guy has appeared all year to be as honest as the wolf dressed up as Grandma...and y'all know this! Him, Birx, Redfield, and all of their BS. They've been lying to the country for Trump all year! #CNNTownHall
Also consider: GOP secretaries of state and GOP local election officials. Will they be faithful to the Constitution or Trump?  This is not an empty threat  It‚Äôs an existential threat
It's true that men are better in battle because they can separate emotion from what needs to be done, but trump put women in many positions of power BECAUSE THIS IS THE BATTLE THAT REQUIRES OUR EMOTIONS  RELEASE THE MOTHER BEARS üôåüôåüôåüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Trump went too far? Really?  #RepublicansAgainstTrump  #DelayTheElection ??
Friday at 5:50,   joins us to talk #Trump's suggestion on delaying the #USElection2020 because he doesn't want a situation where the result is delayed for weeks, months, or "years" due to litigation. #cklw
That was very obvious to me.   Big Grech is battling the virus, its pigheaded deniers, State Reps trying to recall her, Trump and Trumps gun toting thugs.  She's tough as nails.  üí™üèº
Is Friday (31st) the same as Friday (13th)? It is for the TRUMP666 Administration.
Actually Obama‚Äôs corruption and incompetence is part of the reason Trump was elected. So no. We dont miss him at all.
They got all the drugs away so everybody can catch the Trump virus that will go away when it gets hot after 200000 Americans are dead they give me a break Trump is for Trump
Can I come back and dunk on you in 3 months after Trump wins?
trump and biden are literal bums im SICK
The Trump virus will go away when he goes away make America great
Donald Trump hates vote by mail because Putin can't hack those results just my theory.
Trump has multiple sexual assault cases pending...he is a pig. Maybe the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt throw stones if you live in a glass house‚Äù thing applies here.
You don‚Äôt need to understand civics to know when a term is over.  Trust me. Screenshot this and if Trump loses we can wager whether he‚Äôll leave at the proper time or. I guarantee he will. Either in Jan 2021 or January 2025 depending on the election outcome.
I think you mean the Trump virus
Ya quick to criticize Trump about everything, but ya real quite now that he offered to pay out of his pocket for the Vanessas funeral &amp; help her family out on getting her remains as quick as possible.
America was save itself Donald Trump well f*** everybody once he gets back in trust me and if you ain't learned nothing in the last 3 years and then something wrong with you
Tea Party Patriots organized and distributed.  McCarthy. Stone. Limbaugh. Hannity. Trump. Age of Darkness snuffs centuries of progress following the Age of Enlightenment.
Remember guys if you can vote early do it don‚Äôt wait till last minute. Find your LOCAL POLING stations. Check hours. Please retweet. Trump is going too try to mess with post office‚Äôs.
.....than his ability 2 LEARN anything past the age of 14. And Trump will FAIL more times in delaying a POTUS Election than Trump University in awarding earned college degrees.  Bottom Line: Trump can NOT get Election Day delayed. He said a LAWSUIT could delay decision 4......
You mean when you lived in a fantasy world? Sorry President Trump has shown the world how fake and Corrupt Obama was. ‚òπÔ∏èüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I personally don‚Äôt support Re-impeachment. It‚Äôs a distraction that will only help Trump. That said, holy shit! Glad to see conservatives finally put some respect on the constitution!
trump is no orator, he reads like a first grader, word by word, using his finger to follow the sentences. #TrumpVirus
Yeah because Twitter is so reality. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. A left wing owned, American hating social media site. There are a few intelligent people on here but not too many. This is mostly for losers to cry on. Trust me, Trump supporters have no doubt he will be re-elected. And so do you. üòÇüòÇ
Yeah, he definitely could‚Äôve flown his little ass down there to pick it up instead of whining. Damn, u think Trump was like that?
At least his brother did the time so there was accountability. Trump‚Äôs buddies are getting off Scott free.
Wohoooo we are doing it people. Keep up the great work. Power to the People ‚úä‚úä‚úä‚úäüëä
Joe is on point.  I am still angry that he and Mika gave Trump a giant megaphone leading up to 2016...but he is right on this one.
Fuck Twitter! Trump 2020!!!
All Trump's doing is EXTENDING the PAIN &amp; MISERY of losing 2 Biden. He will try something--&amp; it will FAIL. He will try ANOTHER--FAIL. Another--FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. His attempts at staying in power will fail more than his Business ventures. FAILURE'S even more certain...
It light of The Rolling Stones and Neil Young complaints the Trump re-election team is switching to ‚ÄúMy Friend The Witch Doctor‚Äù
You sound like a trump supporter!
Last Friday he signed a meaningless EO on prescription drug pricing. And he scheduled a meeting of big pharma execs for Tuesday of this week.   Then this happened and his ‚Äúplan‚Äù was DOA. Just like all his ‚Äúplans‚Äù.
Well actually if he dishonestly acts as the president‚Äôs personal attorney then while Attorney General he is the de facto president‚Äôs attorney. Only impeachment can change that, and Barr and Trump know that.
After Trump is gone, the official White House Twitter account will need a deep cleaning to rid it of the Trump virus.
We Have one of the most corrupt and incompetent governors in the country. Witless will keep us locked down for any reason because politically she thinks that helps her. Sorry bitch Trump will win in 2020 and you will lose big-time in your reelection Or recalled first.
Damn science...if only Trump had been the leader that he is supposed to be.
Trump would speak only of himself during his type of eulogy.
...and we are bitching and whining about Donald Trump. üò•
YOU are just as responsible as Trump

I‚Äôm assuming you won‚Äôt have time to tweet. You‚Äôll have to work overtime to clean up the mess made by Trump and his evil minions.
Trump is the best president we‚Äôve ever had and ever will have. The Biden followers are just too stupid to know it.
From the co-founder of the Federalist Society: I had taken as political hyperbole the assertion that Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and grounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again by the House and removal by the Senate.
Best video out there that describes exactly what Trump is doing. Help this go viral!!!! #trumpneedstogo  #Biden2020
You can't opening defy a court order and then claim to be the Law &amp; Order President.
Trump s going to lose and Republicans now fear that the GOP will be destroyed in the process.  Now Republicans want to impeach Trump.  Just #EndRacism
They had every opportunity to remove him for President Pence and didn't take it. World's smallest violin (they actually like Trump)
Oh, so like I said, there is no difference huh?  In fact, I‚Äôd say that Biden is far worse and much more dangerous than Trump.  Might as well keep the Zionists, racist, rapist conservative we have.
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That‚Äôs not the worst problem our country faced.. it‚Äôs trump üòÇ
We have stopped going to a bar near us because a house and a business next to it have Trump signs.  Pretty sure said bar owner also supports him.  Until we know for sure, a liberal brewery by us will be getting our business.
I think I heard that the recent biography on Melania suggests that she and Trump did not first meet, as they claim, at some party but earlier... And for money - prostitution
Great column by ‚Å¶ directed at the sheep following Trump   ‚ÄúNone dare call it treason, but perhaps one day they will.‚Äù
Here we go. Trump is gonna do his best to meddle with the election enough to throw things in his favor... he‚Äôll cheat if he can
Doesn't anyone else think it's strange that Americans managed to hold elections during the Civil War...World War 2...and no one worried that voters would vote, and votes would get counted...and then came TRUMP-- liar in chief and creator of chaos!#TrumpIsACompleteFailure
I can't answer for Donald Trump. But his desperate quest for re-election hints that the presidency is much more financially lucrative than the salary alone. Frees him up for a second job? Paper route? Deals with foreign governments? Quid pro quo?
And the narrative continues!! The Cabal wants Prez Trump out so bad that they have this weasel say statement. If you believe this idiocy,  then put a mask and GOGGLES on you idiot and vote leftist, I mean biden or who ever the running mate is, because biden is failing quickly!
All we need to know. In 2004, Stanton-King was convicted on federal conspiracy charges for her role in a car theft ring and served two years in prison. She gave birth while serving her sentence. Stanton-King was pardoned by trump in February 2020.
That standard is a lot higher than actually being trump though, lmao
The smart play for Trump would be to demand that all answers must be given like this.  But as we all know Trump isn‚Äôt in the same universe as smart.
At this point, anyone who is still a Trump supporter holds a vindictive attitude towards their perceived enemies and relishes the fact that Trump upsets them and harms them. Hence all the "anti tyranny" gun nuts who have no issue with what's going down in Portland
We're still going with the "economic anxiety" bit in 2020 huh? The vast majority of Trump's base is the same brand of wealthier middle class whites lashing out against a changing American demographic and embrace of policies that threatens their power and material wealth
One can hope, anyway. Let's make that margin as big as possible. Trump seems to be all in on the effort.
1. Hasn't been scientifically determined to be safe. 2. Hasn't been scientifically determined to treat COVID-19. 3. Is needed to treat other ailments.  Trump happening to say it works is the reason his fanatics are wanting it. He was never qualified to make those claims.
I sure miss Obama: ‚ÄúIf we want our children to grow up in a democracy ‚Äî not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a bighearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America ‚Äî then we‚Äôre going to have to be more like John [Lewis].‚Äù
He answers to Trump.
Detroit is one of several cities tapped by the Trump administration for an increased federal law enforcement presence to stem a surge in violent¬†crime. Officials say shootings have risen by 51%¬†over this time in 2019.
That's... that's the opposite of what's happening. The entire medical community is in agreement that there hasnt been enough testing to determine a substantial benefit to risk ratio, and because Trump and now the Tea Party Patriots have touted it, you guys want a mouthful.
It‚Äôs gonna be something like ‚Äúthe rules are so unfair to me‚Äù.  The smart play for Joe would be to agree to any rule with the exception of ‚Äúonly Trump can attend and answer questions‚Äù.  If Biden does that Trump will keep moving the goalposts in his effort to validate backing out.
Leave it to #BarackObama to bring politics into a funeral service. What a morally depraved reprobate!   Barry,you're time is up. You are a failed president who's constantly getting upstaged by your successor. You had 8 years and Trump's eclipsed you in his first 3.5 years.
Demon Semen is real! #DemonSemen #meme #memesdaily #2020meme #trump #TrumpIsNotWell
Call me paranoid but I was going to gladly tell Trump I will not be voting for him, but something about them having my answer along with my name, address, and phone number in a data base somewhere doesn‚Äôt sit well.
Why hasn‚Äôt Trump committed to the debates?  Joe did awhile ago.
Mark levin Donald Trump needs to back out of the White House and you know it. And take you with him if you want to go. Make sure to keep his number

I am sure that the friends and family of the 149,000 Americans that died from the trumpVirus will find great comfort in that.  Your empathy surpasses that of trump
But if China could have stopped it, why didn't Trump do the thing that China should have done?
DEMS r the ones with ALL the RISK. TRUMP'S the CERTIFIABLE CHEATER in POTUS Elections--the THIRD stolen POTUS Election in U.S. History. If ANYONE'S gonna CHEAT, it's the Cheater-In-Chief: CHEATS on his TAXES; CHEATS in Fed Judicial Confirmations; CHEATS in Pardoning criminals....
Remember the good old days like 3 years ago when Trump talked about his dick during a presidential debate?  Good times back then.  Good Times.
Gonna get my anti trump sign.
Trump just tweeted about his Republican friend who died of the Corona Virus today. Did you happen to catch that tweet?
Probably if Trump wins re election. They will want to keep the dirty Americans out
Agreeing with Trump on what? Trump is telling people to wear a mask. Trump is also looking for a Corona Virus cure from a doctor that believes in Demon semen and Alien DNA. I never mentioned Fauci, I don't need Fauci. You see I was one of the fortunate born with a gene related 1/
"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again."
I think the debates will seal things. I just don't think Biden can keep up with Trump on stage. Gonna cast a pretty strong contrast

THANK YOU! As soon as John Roberts swears in Biden, Trump is done. Let him chain himself to his desk and get dragged out kicking and screaming. Who exactly does he think he‚Äôs hurting?
Mail all your bills in with a stamp and envelope until Trump is gone. When big business feel the slow down, things will be fixed. Consider it a duty
I‚Äôll believe it when I see the #GOPCowards do something about it!!! Like impeach Trump NOW!! Let‚Äôs see what #MoscowMitch thinks about this!
It's good to be on guard for his shenanigans but isn't there also a huge theme in Trump's career of shrinking from the moment, not seizing the day and general passivity? I am deeply concerned about his potential moves but heartened by his long history of incompetence and failure.
So Trump lies? Hear Obama today?  ‚ÄúTroops with batons against peaceful protesters.‚Äù  Portland?  You decide who lies.  Depending, they all lie to suit them.

Trump &amp; republicans are presiding over the worst economy since the Great depression, created in part due to their ineptitude doing a pandemic. Why is the press allowing these idiots to act as if they're presiding over a healthy economy, while drawing their feet on workers help.

That's the same reason my sister didn't like her, she still voted for her, because the way Trump acted towards women made her skin crawl. That's also why my dad, who was a cop before he died of covid, didn't vote for him.
You'll vote for Trump, lmfao.
I live in Michigan, &amp; there ARE true Trump (Republican) believers here too!! No Democrat or Independent-Dem leaning voter had better just not vote &amp; sit at home! We need every vote this time!!
Lol, like this SHIT ‚ÄúExposure up 120% after Trump conference!‚Äù the city center got 30 exposure calls --  In the same window last year, there were 13 cases. No one went to hospital. Approx 19M people being 100% locked inside prob didn‚Äôt help numbers much w/ kids nothing to do

This is fake bullshit. It doesn‚Äôt help get rid of Trump in any way.
"Stupid people may not know..." Trump's comment on mail-in voting pretty much sums it up. Common sense should rule here but unfortunately seems to be absent with some individuals.
Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress  via
Trump: I didn‚Äôt know that the statement I made about delaying the election would have the impact it had.
Trump: Do I want to see a date change? No. But I don‚Äôt want to see a corrupt election.
The president keeps making an inaccurate distinction between mail-in and absentee voting.   More Trump: I want to have the election where people vote in person.   Minutes earlier, he said he votes by mail because he doesn‚Äôt live in Florida.
TV media goes on &amp; on abt how 10's of millions of followers see #Trump's bogus tweets. How does that compare to 10's of millions viewers watching him live on    flat out lying WITHOUT fact checking? SMH He just spent 5 mins. lying about mail-in voting!
Oh, that pesky Constitution! üòÇ
Everyone start to mail in all your bills: car, house, insurance, utilities, everything. When big business starts to feel the slow down, they will fix things. As long as Trump is president, mail your bills

Today, when we Eulogize the soul of an American who made justice his calling, and when not one but three past presidents mourn his passing- all Trump can think is "but why don't they like me" and try to draw attention from a more worthy man than he will ever be.
Trump really just goes on TV and lies about everything and we just allow it. That person would see children die if he can gain politically. Hell, not even gain - just stay afloat.

When you hear Trump question moving the vote back for "the safety of the American People" I want you to remember he didn't care about this a month ago or even three months ago.
This is very true--which is y Trump WON'T b able 2 find a judge that he can BRIBE(Money, Hookers, Promotions, all of the above) 2 get the Election "postponed" into 4ever?! What judge would choose 2 b the FIRST in U.S. HISTORY 2 delay a POTUS Election. This would b bad enough.....

Trump can't even read a speech right.
The fact that Trump would even suggest delaying the election is horrifying and should worry everyone who loves the Constitution. Luckily, he doesn't have the power.   Register to vote, request your absentee ballot if you want, and vote on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020.
Trump keeps saying China "could have stopped" COVID-19. If that's true, why didn't he stop it here?
Future history classes are going to try and pretend that all of these protests were about Trump, and we were all longing for the leadership of a calm and sensible Joe Biden.
Covid-19 is the killer and Donald tRump is responsible for most of the 150,000 + real people that are DEAD.
So kind President Trump.
Herman Cain, Trump's friend died. And that's truly a shame. He mentioned it at the start of the briefing.  Did anybody tell him about. Rep. John Lewis? He died too.
The Corona Virus numbers are down, unless Trump schedules a rally.
No. Why would he? Trump is the guy that helped the Police when Epstein was arrested.
Trump right now abt Covid
Have. Never would have. And Epstein has been tracked by authorities for his crimes since 2005, Trump didn't bust in like Rambo or however you people think it went down.
Trump has not committed any of this.
Nice talk. I‚Äôm not talking about research. I‚Äôm not medical. I‚Äôm talking about the dishonesty of the whole Democratic Party and their propaganda, especially when it comes to anything Trump. Common sense will tell you that Trump saw those ideas somewhere and repeated it. That‚Äôs it
Well countryhood then. Stop trying to bash Obama because you're a Trump supporter.
Donald Trump supports cancel culture.

It is fascinating that‚Äôs Chuckkkie just can‚Äôt seem to grasp that every time he tweets something like this he‚Äôs admitting Trump and his cronies are stunningly inept and incompetent.  But the KKKirk isn‚Äôt exactly Brainiac. Although I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs his favorite comic book ‚Äúhero‚Äù.
AdmittingüôÑ... That‚Äôs the whole reason he mentioned it.   Do yourself a favor, instead of stop watching CNN/MSNBC clips w/Trump coverage or anything related. Watch the whole interview/press conference and then right after, watch CNN. Pretend Trump is your uncle &amp; see if it‚Äôs fair
Trump is very mistaken. Trump must get permission to get on local ballots, not the other way around. Thus he can't stop his election because there is no National Elections! This really isn't that difficult to understand. Trump has no power to stop what he doesn't even control!
Yeah you should have stopped at "from berlin". Come on globe and mail, enough with these targetted, bs Trump bad articles. I'm paying a subscription on a canadian newspaper, not a subscription to a Soros/democrat newsletter

tRump is directly responsible for the death of over 150,000 lives and the many that will add to that number in the coming days, weeks, and months.
‚ÄúKatie: Is $1,200 dollars enough?  Trump: We‚Äôre going to see it may go higher than that actually.  Katie: Where would you like to see it at?  Trump: I‚Äôd like to see it be very high because I love the people I want the people to get it you know the economy is going to come back‚Äù
My favorite part of Trump saying he wants to delay the election is the libs freaking out all over social media about it, as if Mussolini has any power to change the election date. Y'all are being just as reactionary as any conservative.   Stop it.   Do better, be better.
.....Schadenfreude as he MUMBLES &amp; STUMBLES his way thru the Presidency. It wouldn't b so DAMN amusing(not 4 a NORMAL person)if it weren't Trump as POTUS.
Trump had 3 solid years of Republican control of both houses. That allowed this sociopath to run wild. Most of his shenanigans would not have been tolerated in normal circumstances. I agree we have to flip the senate as well as the presidency.
Herman Cain's death and the lives of over 150.000 are on your head Donald tRump.
I know exactly what you mean Cher. We do need him more then ever right now. He made Trump cringe. And we need someone who can do that. Make Trump cringe and scared all at once. I loved watching Trump cringe with fear when John Lewis got after him.
You‚Äôre very very very nice to think any Trump supporter could properly identify a complete sentence.
I think the turtle has drinking some of that alien sperm. He's been drinking it right outta the alien's (Trump) sperm sack.
Trump is exhibiting the Teen-Angst Persona of his MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER--one of MANY forms of MENTAL ILLNESS. Tho he knows he can't postpone the Election, his psyche's TEENAGER-TRUMP just CAN'T let this fact go without having a steaming SHITFIT. I must admit a bout of....

You can be someone who won't vote for either Trum or Biden, and still be very concerned about Trump's threats to cancel the election. It is still important to vote, especially in the downballot local elections.
McConnell says election will occur on time
He died a hero. He gave his life to show his undying love and commitment to President Donald Trump and America.
3. He was supporting Trump, a man he thought was his friend and believed the pandemic was a hoax. Because that's what HIS president told him.   This is facts, that happen to include Trump and his supporters Herman Cain.
I don't think Trump gets to choose that, especially not by January.
Like the at least TWO statements you made already?   Lets address:  1. Herman Cain was 74.  -He was in the elderly category and were he not a friend of Trump, he wouldn't have been in Tulsa.  2. He was a cancer survivor, he had compromised immune system during a pandemic.
I'll patiently wait. This sh*t show is only going to get worse. Trump has absolutely no idea what to do at this point.

His lawyers have told him that there is NO WAY that he can "WORK" the Constitution's CLEAR language that POTUS-Elections will ONLY happen on  FIRST Tuesdays in November. Trump will hav 2 get his TrumpTroops 2 SABOTAGE America's  polling places. Hope I didn't give him n idea!
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
Yeah, this is so disingenuous. Impeachment over one of Trump's tweets? How about impeaching for putting children in cages, for ignoring a pandemic that has killed 150,000 Americans, for refusing to submit to Congress's oversight... I could mention more but I ran out of characters

Trump will pardon every member of the crime family, including himself, on 1/19: Blanket pardons, for any act contrary to federal law that may have been committed, previously alleged or not. There are variations on that theme, including his resigning and having Pence pardon him.
Steve, I completely agree with your tweet, but can‚Äôt help but wonder if this is simply another ploy from Trump so as to take the spotlight from Rep. Lewis‚Äô memorial. I think he can‚Äôt stand that presidents are attending the memorial for a real American hero - everything he‚Äôs not.

And I don't know if you haven't figured it out yet but your God Obama turned a funeral into a Biden rally. And yet you still blame everything on Trump. You're a joke.
She‚Äôs a Spartan. Not a Wolverine. I‚Äôm very proud of her. She cares about her constituents in spite of some of their stupidity.    trump is so afraid of strong women in positions of power
Trump is thinking I must create a distraction, how can I make myself the center of attention! When you're so small that you have to ask why I'm not popular? It's a simple answer, you lack empathy and are a souless human being with no dignity, honor or respect.
So tired of the VoteBiblical morons who also have Trump Pence signs in their yards. Stupid idiots and hypocrites
I agree. I was talking about individuals that are dumb enough to believe what Trump says, i.e masks don‚Äôt work, we don‚Äôt need to social distance. Not that anyone deserves to die, that‚Äôs horrible.
All the more reason to have worn a mask, socially distance, or stay home.   Your overly emotional response to criticism of Trump is a mental illness and you should seek help. You are not well.
Here‚Äôs where 300 Trump judges pays off....I hope

i want you all to know that a few weeks ago, i turned on the news to hear trump trying to discredit mail-in ballots, which reminded me that i needed to apply for mine! so anyways my vote will be mailed in specifically because trump reminded me to sign up for my ballot (-:
why the hell not!  i don't feel the mail-in-voting will be fair for President Trump.  dems  will basically stop and nothing to get biden in office like terrorizing are cities, killing policemen etc.   i think people need to think of the alt. of Trump, biden and the soc. dems.

I tried just not following him, then I tried muting him - but I‚Äôve had enough. I no longer have any interest in what Trump says. Nothing he says is worth my time.
Hopefully he will say the election is being moved.  All the MAGA drones will stay away from the polls.  Trump will lose by a tsunami, following an earthquake following a hurricane.  Then this national nightmare will be over.

Well what a bold statement, considering there has been no allegations of fraud and the only voters cheating in the elections that has led to criminal charges was from a Republican. Yet with that said, if you get your people to vote this isn't an issue. Trump is afraid of "voting"

Trump is always talking like a mad man but I am against mail-in voting. Way too open to fraud. I will indeed find it hard to accept the results of a mail-in election.
Don't let it -- in your heart, you did the best thing you could do - based on the "information at the time".  I don't think pills "trump" the creator's time 'to take them" and have them start in the next lifetime again.  I'm sure she's getting the groundwork ready for the next.

Be gentle,  also the type that thinks Trump is the one physically destroying the country and killing people because of a CCP-engineered virus and a general population that's willingly/knowingly spreading it amongst themselves. Tell them "Ask ActBlue"
Let's make it clear, Trump knows he can not delay the election even one minute. He did know, however, that 3 presidents were gathering to honor a great man today and couldn't bear being left out. Infant trump had to "spit up" on America to get some attention.  #NobodyLikesTrump

Bs, liberal media were the ones downplaying it the first couple months. Trump shut down flights from China only to be ridiculed for it.
I find it no coincidence that Trump sowed seeds of voter suppression on Twitter, on the day of John Lewis' funeral. And also on a day that Herman Cain (who contracted COVID-19 at Trump's Tulsa rally) died.  He's not a Commander In Chief, he's a Deflector of Grief.

Cain had a choice. He chose to endanger his own life in support of Trump and paid for that decision with his life. I‚Äôm sorry. Understand this folks, we are in Jim Jones territory where people will intentionally put themselves in harm a way for their leader.

When big events like this occur Trump reveals that the presidency is far to big for him, his petty grievances show his inadequacies. Only real Leaders can share the sunshine with others and not feel diminished. Trump is a very, teeny tiny man and very unworthy of his title!

We call it the trump economy
Herman died cause he attended a rally,,, With Friends like Trump, Who needs Enemy's
The only thing that needs to happen right now is the defeat of tRump and the destruction og the GOP. Then the Democratic Party can move to its proper position as a centre right party leaving room on the left for a proper social democratic party. That won't happen if fascists win.
Way to go team trump!
I agree.  Trump is throwing out wacked out ideas and normalizing these notions.  It's all dangerous and bad.
The Trump Virus
The solemn respect and ceremony that was shown for John Lewis is - I Bet- being jealously coveted by  Trump who wants a military style burial- Only problem-  HE WONT RATE ONE!!!  Ok guys, just back the garbage truck up here and let's get the whole dumpster in there!  RIP J.Lewis
Yes Obama got political in the speech but it is believed that this is what John would have wanted since this is what John had fought for so therefore it was warranted. Also the fact Obama didn't even say the name Trump is the most impressive.
It's both.  Trump has been complaining about mail in balloting for a month now.  He is discrediting the election.
Hey Mr. Sunshine (Donald Trump), this is how I see it: under relentless and unceasing attack, we ended the war on America, and stopped the far-right Corporate, assault! #November32020.
And you literally are an agent provocateur. I sincerely doubt you ever intended to vote for anyone but Trump. This press for a defunct movement is just trying to discourage people from voting for Biden. Change won't come through the Dem Party. Start and build your own. - &gt;
Sorry to hear that. This was a preventable death. Listening to you and trump will get you killed now you want children to be the next experiment...disgusting.
Stop and think for a moment what conservatives in this country would have done had Obama tweeted what Trump did today
Greed (tRump &amp; his peeps)
Exactly. Trump‚Äôs trafficking of migrant children is disgusting. Thanks for being onboard.
I should also mention that Trump is pretty notorious over here for saying stupid shit like this, and then doing nothing. This really isn't much new to us Americans
Maybe he's as delusional as Trump
Well according to an interview Trump's ex wife Ivana gave to Vanity Fair back in 1990, Trump used to sleep with a copy of Hitler's speeches by his bedside. Creepy.
They will stop at nothing to push Trump‚Äôs narratives, even jeopardizing their own health. They will literally die on the ‚ÄúCOVID is overblown‚Äù hill, as we‚Äôve witnessed today unfortunately.
Well.. this group of brain dead trump followers aren't conservative in any way at all.. deficit up 5.6 TRILLION.. money being stolen non stop.. a president that bangs hookers and a first whore that has done porn.. nothing conservative about this.
Interesting how Trump has turned the left into war hawks...
We can drop it off at City Hall. They have a drop box inside and out with a lock on it. Oh and did you watch any of John Lewis's funeral. Former President Barack Obama did a Eulogy for him. It was great. At one point he didn't mention any names. But he said a lot about TRUMP.
Been waiting for *this guy* to show up for a while during the Trump administration.  Refreshing.
Hey Cher you want hear some great news. Michigan has several Thousand people who are mailing in there votes. We're going to PISS OFF TRUMP ROYAL LOL. I can't wait to see what he now with him. And best thing is it's called mail in voting. But we don't really have to mail it in.
I‚Äôd eat a dogshit sandwich if it meant Trump was gone tomorrow
Is it a possibility? Sure. There's a few loopholes that could let him in theory. Will it happen ? Almost definitely not. It would require most if not all of our government to be behind, which they're not. Even Trump supporters are shitting all over him.
Trump: Suburban voters will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housingü§î
Curious tweet from you. Here you are admitting Trump is a lifelong racist.  Ya see Trump isn‚Äôt at that funeral either.   AND there are no pictures of Trump like the ones below. Now why is that Chuckkkie?
I'm very much so aware of the previous pandemics. I'm also very much so aware of the ill handlings of that time and this. At least this governor gives her all to help us. Trump has been recommending things they has killed people. His inactivity has also been a part of the deaths
that man (a cancer survivor) went to a trump rally and is now flying with the angels??? el oh el
Seeing  üåπ &amp; ü©∏ ü¶∑ Twitter freaking out over the possibility of Kamala being VP is pretty hilarious. Even more laughable, that the K-Hive is somehow the worst group on here. It's almost like they forgot Trump and Pence are currently in the White House ü§î

Tell Congress: Defund and dismantle the DHS agencies taking part in Trump's "surge" of unaccountable federal forces terrorizing communities and being sent to largely Black and brown urban centers across the country! &gt;&gt;  via
All the MSM need to say is  Trump can‚Äôt do it instead of analyzing and debating a blatant lie.  Move on to the news that actually affects Americans.
Bernie to Trump
POTUS can do multiple things at once, he has many who work with him. There is a valid argument for healing the country. There is also a valid legal argument for going after Trump..
What did like about Trump?
Gosh Mr. Sunshine (Donald Trump), I BELIEVE you! November32020.
Members of the White House Correspondent‚Äôs Assoc need to unite in asking ‚ÄúWhy is Trump lying about U. S. election integrity?‚Äù and keep asking until an answer - not a denial or BS response - is provided.
Trump burner
Also Trump: Voted by mail from Mar-a-lago when he claims residency in the White House (Fraud)
This isn‚Äôt Trumps fault, States are ran by Governors, not Trump.
Trump is a disgrace
I‚Äôm not a Trump guy but to say he killed a person who willingly went to a rally on their own is beyond dumb.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump‚Äôs selfish policies,are helping Texans to die.
This Idiot   has gone and is going further with stupidity, than any person in World History...with the exception of Nero. Just as Nero destroyed the Great Roman Empire, Trump is in the process of destroying our America. Prepare Folks for HE WILL ignite the Fire.
So Barack Obama and Trump agree that the filibuster should be abolished. Does Obama have any idea how much damage Trump would have pulled if Congress did not have this check?
You think we're gonna vote from home, but the post office (after decades of republican and democrat underfunding) is being pushed off a cliff by the Trump Administration. How do y'all think those ballots are gonna get through?
Horrified by 2016 #election I held this #Windsor On walk in solidarity w women's march in #Washington. I couldn't continue my interview w reporter - I knew people would die because of #trump &amp; I was overcome.  Sadly, my intuition was right.   #TrumpMeltdown
All of these people believe in Trump, but what is Trump giving people to believe in? Beating protesters? Dying for his political events? #WearAMask
I do not believe a word he says. I also believe he had taken that medicine. I think he took that job knowing he did not like Trump and he trying to ruin him.
He‚Äôd be out of their league...a fish out of water. Trump can‚Äôt carry the water for any of these three men.
Let us pray for Trump he‚Äôs in need of some medical assistance.
It is best that The Trump not attend John Lewis' funeral. Why add fake sympathy especially when everyone would know he is lying.
In eulogy for Rep. John Lewis, former president  notes there are sustained attacks on the integrity of upcoming election.   Obama notes those attacks include targeting mail-in voting, calling it a crucial need for voting during a pandemic
Make America Great Again Like It Was BEFORE trump!
Excuse me Mr. Sunshine (Donald Trump), didn't you send to Portland, Blackwater, Xe, Academi, or whatever Eric Prince is calling his private army nowadays? #November32020.
And yet he chose to commit suicide and go maskless at a trump rally in Tulsa where he knew the virus was present. I‚Äôm sad to hear that he passed but I can‚Äôt praise stupidity.
He was over 74, and a cancer survivor. Masks minimize risk, but he shouldn't have been at that Trump rally.
You of course,are referring to the Trump virus.
Herman Cain got COVID19 at the Trump Rally in Tulsa and was in the hospital for three weeks.   He was high risk and still tried to be Trump's "friend."
Since Trump &amp; everyone is talking about Demon Sperm and Aliens I feel that now is the time to point our that Trump has battled Chupacabra, Black-Eyed Kids and Satan. All those amazing stories and more can be found here.   #Maga #DemonSemen #AlienDNA #Ghosts
Nobody, and I mean nobody of sane mind, actually believes Trump is trailing Biden (who can‚Äôt form a sentence).   What‚Äôs Interesting here is  can‚Äôt even say  but rather refers to him as ‚Äúopponent‚Äù  That‚Äôs embarrassing on so many levels.
MR. TRUMP, NO MANNER OF ANY PROCESS IS PERFECT, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FRIGHTEN OR MISLEAD AMERICAN VOTERS WITH YOUR LIES, YOUR RE-ELECTION IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU HAVE RUN THIS COUNTRY IN THE GROUND IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY YOU COULD, NO MORE!!!!
Barack Obama‚Äòs description of John Lewis‚Äôs bravery on Bloody Sunday‚Äîwhen racist Governor George Wallace authorized the use of violence against marchers‚Äîsubtlety reminds us of Trump‚Äôs authorizing use of violence against #BLM protesters.
Trump doesn't read Twitter. We don't need responses, we just need people to actually vote. That's it. Just do the bare minimum required of your citizenship.
trump is going to change the months around so that November is where next July would have been.  That is how he is going to delay the election. The closer we get to that month, he will change it again.
Personally I don't get it either. Electing Trump as president is like giving your kid a can of gasoline and some matches to play with.
I love when Big Gretch posts, she brings out the Trump supportersü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Republican Jesus,has granted Trump and friends,special powers,to override,the constitution.
he volunteered for that. He loved that man and believed and loved what trump believes and loves. I hope trump follows him on to glory in the days to come
The emoluments clause,doesn‚Äôt apply to Trump.
The trump administration doesn't want to be thwarted in their ability to spread lies!
I‚Äôm so sick of Trump and I hate the fact he ever ‚Äúwon‚Äù in the first place. Regardless of what happens, or how we vote, he‚Äôs going to lose this election.
Trump's folly
Bill Clinton just devalued Black life on national television at the funeral of fallen civil rights hero, but we only can muster up energy for Donald Trump? Come on, man!
Trump is winning over the ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù vote.
Mr. Cruz agreed. ‚ÄúI think election fraud is a serious problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, no, we should not delay the election.‚Äù  Election fraud ... ACTUAL material fraud you say?  BASED ON WHAT EXACTLY?  You're as bad as Trump when it comes to baseless conspiracy theories. SAD
Obama is everything. I can understand why trump don‚Äôt like him
I just can't get over the contrast in end of life dignity between John Lewis and Herman Cain. One died beloved by millions, a symbol of freedom and justice; the other died of an easily preventable disease from a Trump rally, lying about it to the very end.
No surprise here \\\ Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election ‚Äî But Congress Sets the Date
Oh yes. Trudeau is so close to Trump. The guy who refused to rent to Blacks. Won‚Äôt attend anything John Lewis. Took out a front page ad to demand 5 black guys get the death penalty, says the blacklivesmatter murals devalue the area. Is actively trying to keep POC out of the burbs
Probably nothing more than business interests, Trump just doesn't care about America. With him it has always and always will be Trump First not America
Do you own as much Twitter stock as Trump?
Hey dummy
No, it just means your audience is made up of Trump supporters that believe the media is the enemy of the people.
Wtf. When AG Barr was questioned "if you were asked by the pres to stop counting legal votes after election day would you?" he then implied, yes he would, because some states have laws that "must" be followed.  But if trump wants to delay the election those laws don't matter now?
Yeah sure, whatever... Trump wants to postpone the election!!!!
Have you actually watched that full press conference where Trump ‚Äúrecommends injecting bleach to cure covid‚Äù?üôÑ U know there‚Äôs actually at least 2 new innovations that show what he was saying wasn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounded? UV light injections and a wild new ionization treatment

I will give you this though, President Donald Trump follows the same strategy that engineers/scientists generally follow.  "Ooh, can I do this?" "No, that is against the laws of physics." "Hmph, fine."

Herman Cain‚Äôs last words are rumored to be ‚ÄúDo something really dumb for Trump! What do you have to lose?‚Äù
} I think a lot of people Low key working for Trump^ yep
Since there can't possibly be any truth there.  It must be what Putin and tRump discussed on that last phone call.  I guess Russia is either invading Germany or just threatening and extorting Germany.  What Putin wants tRump gives.
TV networks should not cover this impromptu Trump presser during the John Lewis service.
Trump's allies are disposable to him.
You know tRump‚Äôs playbook: we‚Äôre at the part when he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really know‚Äù the guy. He‚Äôs demented

A few less tRump voters by November.
Trump is scared because after Herman Cain died needlessly, his Black support has dropped by 20%
Thanks for proving Donald Trump is a bottom feeder who can‚Äôt humble himself as the ‚Äúleader‚Äù to put aside political differences for a day of unity. Speaks volumes Kent. He doesn‚Äôt deserve the highest office. It‚Äôs why I have ZERO respect for him and you. Trump is a clown.
Such a kidder, that Trump!
Trump sure could have used that vote
Thank you, you expressed it perfectly. Much respect for Republicans who speak up against Trump.
Most likely result is far right extremists starting riots on November 3.  Which is tRump's insurrection.
Read the article please, it talks about Trump's lies. We all know Trump the idiot is a compulsive liar. What is less understood, it seems, is that Biden is also a liar and not to be trusted---the policies he's pretending to support now run counter to his decades-long record.

Cheering is something that is NOT being done on the left. No one is happy this poor mislead man is dead. He bought into the personality cult of Trump and paid the price that thousands of Americans are paying.He is just one of many needless American deaths because of #TrumpsVirus
Not delay an election, but force children to go back to school during a pandemic. Trump can‚Äôt get to hell fast enough for me.
Yes tRump's new post master general is trying to make it impossible for the Post Office to do its job.  Imagine having a boss that hates you and all that you do.  That is all of tRump's cabinet, every appointment.  tRump wants to destroy democracy in the US.
Probably will get crickets. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about POC
I couldn't imagine giving my life to help Trump gain political points with dipshits. Everything is broken.
Big Gretch, will you demand Voter ID so Trump cannot interfere in our election? I dont think he realizes how much that would backfire on him
I agree, I dont think Trump understands how badly Voter ID would backfire on him. Demand Voter ID so Trump cant interfere!
Since Trump is desperate about his waning support, maybe he can be convinced to give us free things like healthcare and college? ü§°

In 20 years, people will look at the United States and think WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON OVER THERE?  But, If you vote Trump, we will miss out on depth of life. China and India is huge and culture groups are making sense.  Work Facism is the old America. Time to make America Great!

100% agree w/  Trump has permanently dismantled any old ballasts in the GOP.  If he loses, the Post-Trump GOP will largely push the same ideology and just look to repackage it more palatably.  ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs politics win, it‚Äôs just Trump that was the problem‚Äù they‚Äôll say
Silencing people is just making Trump's base bigger and stronger.  It makes 2016 look like high school politics.  Thanks
Man, this is so sad. The leaders of China need to pay for this. They put this virus out intentionally! Think about it, they don't want Trump re-elected. He's their nightmare. They are killing people around the world with this virus, they need to pay for it in some way.
Demoncrates are the enemy of ALL free people.... make no mistake. Vote Republican 2020 if you desire freedom and equality. Democrats along with Soros billion are hard at work trying to maintain and advance suppression of ‚ÄúALL‚Äù people. TRUMP 2020

I'm not defending Trump by any means and I'm not saying he doesn't bare the brunt of responsibility. That said, Cain attended, didn't social distance and didn't wear a mask. All his choices. Had he chose differently, he'd be alive.

I don't get that comment? Democrats have moved on, from what?  Stay awake for a sec, Herman Cain is dead because the Trump campaign took away chances of keeping people safe during their unadvised Trump rally by removing social distance seating, because of that people got sick!
Putin asked tRump to move troops, so he can invade Germany when we are having riots due to tRump saying that the election was bogus and he is president for life. Because Putin making his own gambit for president for life. They pretty much already gave it to him. Putin needs cash?

Donald Trump should RESIGN. Pass it on.
Turns out Biden was a prophet.  And if his prophecy coming true surprises you then you haven‚Äôt been paying attention the past 4 years.  That Trump was going to float this at some point was a very easy sure money bet.
Not true.. he was a trump supporter.. you CANNOT support this person.. who has stolen from charities and supports incest and consider yourself a good person at all.. That's the same as saying "some of those nazis are good people" but we can disagree.

Once again get it through that thick skull of yours it is NOT the China Virus but the Trump Virus #TrumpVirus
It was a trap to get the dems to lock in the date. Trump just played them like a fiddle. Next he'll do debates.

I know Trump watching John Lewis funeral looking stupid as hell
Gtfoh if your tweeting PresidentPelosi. Pelosi has done nothing to stop Trump she has only enabled him and the Republicant party.
You hope people are tired of gaining unlimited power? Because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting by aligning with Trump
He doesn't think a delay will help anything BUT his argument that the result was not legitimate.  IF the election were changed to November 4, He will say his voters al went November 3.  It would cost a lot of money, take more time, and tRump will still lose.  Imagine the riots.

It‚Äôs feigned remorse. As a malignant narcissist tRUmp is incapable of feeling such an emotion.
BREAKING:  former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has died of the coronavirus, which he contracted at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
Twitter today is people who assured the world Hillary Clinton would definitely win saying that there's no way Trump can delay the election.
Wish I could be reassured about the things Trump ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù but somehow always gets away with after doing them.
Mail-in paper ballots dropped off at City Clerk‚Äôs offices, there is what, a 0.0006% of a faulty ballot? EACH electronic voting machine can be HACKED! Students proved that! Foreign states can ALREADY hack our power grids, DNC &amp; RNC sites. #Putin OWNS Trump, Trump OWES Putin! VOTE!
Sorry to hear of the death of Herman Cain, who was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Supposedly the Trump campaign is using multiple companies to funnel money to family members.  Between that and the misuse of his golf courses for personal benefit, is this not criminal?  Can‚Äôt something be done?
Trump can't delay the election like he can't dismantle USPS.
I don't say the H word lightly, but I fucking hate Trump.
He looks scared because he knows they should be wearing masks. He's scared of getting sick, but he's more scared of Donald Trump.
Shows that they do not believe in law and order.  Not only do they not care about crime. (Their jobs.)  They had have, legal binding contracts, which they are breaking.  But their hero tRump does the same.  The right is wrong, they always resort to violence to get their way.
And for all in the media who are asking is President Trump feeding his base red meat?  No genius‚Äô, he‚Äôs trolling the left.
This is clearly a power play by Trump. We could hold an election, but he refuses to even try
It is time for tRump to declare bankruptcy. Again.
Gov. Whitmer blasts President Trump over suggestion to delay election
Another day, another opportunity to remind everybody to trust Trump only at one‚Äôs own peril.
His reckless ones maybe... But the "Blexit"-ers and anyone who was feeling a little "uneasy" is most likely walking away from this one. If it isn't clear yet, it soon will be that Trump has no friends.
Masks do not prevent you from getting the virus. Herman King is a cancer survivor who chose not to wear a mask and he was fully aware of the consequences. Its a shame that people are using Herman Cain‚Äôs death as a way to get people to wear masks. Plus blaming Trump for his death.
Ha ha President Trump was fishing for suckers
When are y‚Äôall gonna be honest? Is the Trump coin that seductive?
Mr. Cain was a grown man who chose to ignore medical/scientific advice to appease Trump. He chose to put his life on the line for Trump. He chose to endanger others, including his own family for Trump. Pointing this out is not gloating. It‚Äôs a public service announcement.
you take offense and claim that you were asked that question on TV because you are black when the name of the group you belong to is literally called ‚Äúblack voices for trump‚Äù.. fake outrage or jus completely oblivious?
why try? he was not a good person. he supported incest and stealing from charities (which is what EVERY trump supporter is)... we don't have to feel bad for people that die if they weren't good when alive...
The selfishness of Trump can kill you. He must be stopped and removed from the oval office before anymore carnage is done.
Out and out cowards of the highest degree. Tell Trump to fuck off or resign.
Trump has you just as paranoid as he is. Cult leaders usually don‚Äôt come unhinged. I‚Äôd run if I were you!
Well, don‚Äôt go to a fucking Trump rally where you‚Äôll catch #COVID19. At this point, I have zero sympathy for people that won‚Äôt follow the medical device from informed and educated doctors. Wear a damn mask. Maintain your distance. And avoid gatherings.
Trump‚Äôs been calling them fake news so long they started believing it themselves. It‚Äôs battered wife syndrome.
Gov. Whitmer weighs in on Trump's idea to delay the election.
The Rona train running through that Trump rally
If Trump tries to delay the election then the liberty tree must be watered
Only trump haters listen to Dr. Fauci, #MAGA there will be a day of reckoning.
Maskless at the Trump rally catching the Trump Rona
In humanizing that a man believed his friend, the President was telling him the truth, he was just supporting his friend.   Which killed him. Trying to be Trump's "friend."
His family didn‚Äôt deserve this. He chose to give up his life for Trump.
My parents have jumped aboard the Trump train over the course of 4 years after voting third party in 2016.   They've also gone full blown conspiracy theorists at this point too so... They're feeling pretty great for some reason even though nothing has benefitted them at all.
Trump killed him with the stupid Oklahoma rally.

More updates as more comments come in from MI delegation.    "We aren't going to delay an election just because this impeached president's poll numbers are falling."  (w/
Herman Cain, former Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of a major pizza chain who went on to become an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.
Interesting Trump tweeted about "delaying the election" and then they released this news.   Maybe because they know, this is the nail in the coffin of the Trump campaign.
And that leadership isn't Trump. Never again can our nation be so stooped by the carnage of a grifter con artist!
Trump's only chance is if the virus does actually dissappear before election day.
Though, if Trump falls way behind he might
I love how Democrats in Michigan accuse trump of being a tyrant while praising Big Gretch for being an authoritarian.
imagine being so dense you compare whitmer to hitler when trump exists
I don‚Äôt understand their desire to die for Trump. My sincere condolences to his family.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman‚Äô  via
Aaaaand there it is.
did you just say this considering you cheerlead for a president who is paid to govern but instead watches fox news if he isn‚Äôt golfing or watching oan? at least the media matters people do it as part of their jobs. trump does it just because.
You mean headlines saying things like "after attending Trump rally he was hospitalized with covid" Praying for his family and loved ones.
Trump insured that people in that arena sat close to each other by removing the social Distancing seats and encouraged people not too wear masks. That's called evidence of negligence, luckily Trump had everyone sign a waiver first. Trump is complicit in this death that's factual!
Trump has the media on his side.He would never have won the nomination in 2016 without it.
My apologies. Humanizing Herman Cain's death is my goal.   He believed Donald Trump to be his friend, I don't believe he thought himself to be at risk, and though in his life he became a meme, in his death he truly is a testament to the many people that call Trump a "friend."
Herman Cain Went to the Trump rally no mask after overcoming stage 4 colon cancer. His fight with cancer put him at great risk with Covid. Again, Supporting Trump, went to the rally caught Covid. Now the family is‚Ä¶
Ignorance and hubris killed Herman Cain. Trump's insistence on pretending the Covid-19 was nothing but the common cold is exactly why this man is dead. Don't allow Trump to pretend he had nothing to do with this death. His lack of leadership is why people are still dying today!
