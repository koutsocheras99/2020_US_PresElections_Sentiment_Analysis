Biden won’t last a full term
Obvious meltdown !! I love every second of it !! I bet him and Mika or whatever or Fuckin name is talk about trump ever night at home before nighty night !!!! What a disgrace they both are !!! How could anyone sane think that joe Biden could be President !!!
And you're a Democratic strategist? What did you expect? When Harris ambushed Biden in the first debate, her fans were cheering- she really got him! That there are those in Biden's campaign who haven't forgotten is no surprise. I expected this. Maybe I should change careers.
On the contrary, I would think that her eyes being on the 2024 nomination would make her that much more engaged &amp; involved in what is going on throughout a 4-year Biden term. A unique opportunity to be an incoming POTUS that had direct input on the previous four years = winning!
I'm Joe Biden, and I Forgot This Message! Trump 2020!

That’s why I feel they could swap with anyone. They lose nothing. Last minute “health crisis” I can totally see it happening. I think there’s a better chance Biden gets replaced than Biden actually debating Trump in a traditional format on live TV.
They could run a god damn ham sandwich vs Trump and it would get the same votes Biden would.
I agree that they could swap Biden out. I don’t think there’s any movement for Biden. Just the fever pitch Trump hate that any Dem can run on. I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden gets out last minute.
This is all garbage.  The USPS has been in shambles for decades.  Obama and Biden had 8 years to fix things but did nothing.
On your dreams. America is burning because of you. We are the laughing stock of the world. Stop your tweets and try fixing everything you have down. Biden has a big job ahead of him to fix all the wrongs you have done.

Biden didnt do shit in those years of experience except pass &amp; defend racist ass laws. Trump has buisness experience which helps out alot but anyways. I dont think you need political experience to be a decent candidate
Yes and it will be for Biden
I'm a liberal and I DON'T WANT HIM TO QUIT! I want to run his ass out of office by voting for Biden. I want him to be humiliated beyond humiliation. I want him to lick his wounds from defeat until he has ulcers on his lying tongue!

Just spoke to a customer (a Palm Beach re$ident) who will vote for him again, despite her disapproval. She thinks Biden is feeble and hates Susan Rice—convinced she will be VP + her kids went to school w/her, “she’s a baaad person” &amp; behind Benghazi. 😣
First off Nadler your response to the Portland riots that burnt down buildings,attacked police &amp; innocent people with every weapon they could get their hands on. You call it a MYTH! You act like Biden who doesn’t know what’s going on in the world! Wake up there was a warrant!!!!
It only matters if he votes for Biden and gets others to do the same.  A statement is just the first step.
So when Biden says something idiotic, it's a joke or a misquote, according to the left, &amp; evidence of mental or physical illness to the right. And when Trump does the same it is a stroke to his foes &amp; 4 dimensional chess to his sycophants. I just think they're both dumb.
Vice President Biden also wrote an op Ed for the New York Times at the end of January about the coming pandemic. Seems pretty prescient for a guy who is being accused of being in cognitive decline.
So will Biden pick Susan Rice?
I cannot say anything nice, so I will just say, Biden and whoever he picks, are losers.

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Neither does Biden.
Chris Dodd is a lot less influential than you think he is. The real power behind the throne is Dr. Jill Biden.
Washington post is lying again. Lying is not going to help your candidate Joe Biden.
Unlike Joe Biden, Trump will never condemn Putin for placing bounties on US Soldiers heads.
My Monday Newsmax column The Biden camp admits its candidate lacks the courage to lead
no way trump will debate Biden..NFW.....he's a moron...unteachable and lacks self control...Joe will destroy him simply by breathing and looking at him like the fool he is....
You are completely delusional. The person in charge is TRUMP NOT Biden.
🚨🚨 “The choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the US but for the world generally to deal with #climatechange” 🚨🚨
We don't need corruption in the White House we had 8 years of that before Trump who had to clean up their mess, Joe needs to retire not Trump. Trump has his head together, Biden needs to take care of his medical issues
Can Donald Trump repeat Putin, Bounty, Taliban, American Soldiers, without fumbling? When is able to stand before the American people and repeat those words then you may come back and comment on Joe Biden's gaffes.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‘law &amp; order’ campaign for a bit since it’s not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via “grassroots movements” and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I’m seeing
I hate that we’ve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it’s needlessly ugly.
It also would cost us FL. Old school party boss Democrats are this stupid. I trust Biden isn’t.
A bunch of old, formerly powerful and influential políticos want their last day in the path of the Democratic Party. All I have to say is there is a reason Biden is still around and they ain’t.
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don’t believe me look at Joe Biden’s draconian record on black issues.
Good morning and TY Carmen!🙏🏼 Happy Friday! 🎉🍻🎉
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
So don’t go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it’s absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as “progress.” The only reason why Biden isn’t seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn’t? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn’t a single policy that Biden supports that I’m in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn’t any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn’t either. It’s pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats
Pure evil!!!!!!!!!! repent now, confess your evil doings. YOUR JUDGMENT IS COMING. YOU ARE NOT ETERNAL SIR....... YOU, HILLARY, BIDEN, BILL, OBAMA AND ALL OF THE ONES INVOLVED.
And just so you know Kamala Harris our president has been scared of s*** it's your little Joe Biden that scared and hides in the basement.🤣
Joe Biden robs black people
Biden &amp; Democrats are going out with   new election adds like our President is responsible for Wuhan virus how dirty &amp; lowlifes this people are willing to try to win this election specially with Mr. Biden at the helm his not capable of running a small village ! Delusional Joe.
I would like to know the same thing. Everyone voting Obama and Biden are predators
Obama is a predator so is joe Biden
Fortunately, this can all be nipped in the blood If and when Biden wins Florida on election night.
TY for the tag fatal!✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿
Untrue! What really concerns Ms. Greenhouse is that there are any Conservatives on the Supreme Court! That said she looks forward to Joe Biden “fixing” that by packing the court!
I would pay to watch Joe Biden debate Joe Biden.
Is Joe Biden capable of fulfilling his duties of President? If he wins,, will the Democrats exercise the 25th Ammendment immediately after the elections? Are they trying to cheat?
I’m still mad y’all really left us with senile ass Joe Biden to run against Trump I truly hate this country!!
Joe Biden, Jim Clyburn, and many other Democratic leaders said this and got hammered by Roses on here.
I’m far more concerned about another four years under the aspiring dictatorship of a madman. Come on man, if you were truly a Democrat you would have a long laundry list of why Biden is far more preferable than T
F**k off Bernout. Don’t slide in here with that nonsense. Biden is in excellent health. Bernie Sanders will never be President.
I like AOC. I like Biden. Period.
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.
Sexual assault survivors who do not accuse a Democrat because they ignored the accusers of pedofile Joe Biden
Yesterday's AG Barr hearing was an example of what a Joe Biden administration would be. What a shame.
I don’t know for the same reason the dems and Biden never trash China
either joe biden or joe budden gotta change their names cause i always mistake one for the other in these headlines
I’m speaking of the Politico pieces that came out in the waning days of her campaign which detailed much of the internal drama. And simply speculating what Biden’s campaign is likely concerned about while vetting VP prospects.
Biggest concern with Harris from Biden’s perspective imo isn’t the debate moment, but the pieces on how dysfunctional her campaign was. It was rife with internal drama &amp; the staff leaked like a faucet.   The culture of the campaign is tea leaves for the culture while in office.
The “Lincoln Project” an attempt to remove all traces of Lincoln from America and replace them with a Joe Biden Puppet! The only question is who on the Left will pull the strings!
Patriots can you imagine if Joe Biden pics Kamala Harris and he dies ?? That piece of s*** will be our president !! I'm horrified !!Biden is bad enough as president. 😯😯😯😮😮😮😫😫🤬🤬🤬🤨🤨🤨🤯🤯🤯😮
Because unlike Kamala, Susan Rice will not mention Joe Biden's voting record
If you still need to be convinced to vote for Joe Biden in order to defeat Trump at this point, then you’re not a good and sensible person. I’m not wasting time trying to convince anyone. I’m about encouraging the people ready and willing to save the Republic.
Where is go Biden ?  You’re basement
It quotes Biden.
Thanks for the boost fake Joe! 🚀
Joe Biden is on the tuition he’s on his way out with his dementia issues if you haven’t observed his behavior
Florida. It might be tough, but I’m hopeful. BIDEN 2020
Why does the MSM are not asking for Joe Biden to be more public and present the DNC platform? Why is he hiding? Oh by the way, he's a racist. Listen to his past speeches for proof.
Get your head around this! Biden’s clueless!
LOL just pointing out the irony, which wouldn’t be so ironic if we weren’t in the middle of BLM, police violence, criminal justice reform...  Plus Joe “1994 Crime Bill” Biden? The campaign slogan should be:  Biden/Harris “Law &amp; Order: we *will* put your ass in prison!”  😂😂
😂😂 Trump 2020: “Law &amp; Order” Biden 2020: “Law &amp; Order”  as you can see, it’s ironic *especially* given the moment
Nope the error was discovered around 5pm. Politico corrected it around 5:30. Biden campaign responded to it at 6. All after the press conference.
You hit right there. This was all about checking Chris Dodd. Biden knows they pics of his notes if he gives them a chance.
I support Biden's choice, whatever it is.
Voters are worried that Joe Biden might win!
Joe Biden never fails to make himself look worse! The lights are on and no one’s home!
If Joe Biden is President it will look exactly like Munich in 1938! Joe will trade everything for “peace in his time”!
I hope that between now and the beginning of August Biden's senile dementia has not progressed and that he says that he will be the vice-president of so-and-so, because every day he looks more disoriented and the radical Communist Democrats say nothing about it.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
They took it down but it was
Well, add  to the list. Those jerks cut away from Barr to cover Biden. 👎
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
Sure.  Most countries stopped it ?  And you think Biden will make it better.  The Lincoln Project is ALL ANGER
No epidemic, no President Biden “Puppet”!
A far better question is will the NYT fire it’s editorial staff and option writers if Joe Biden looses too? They should consider doing that!
Uranium One deal. Who benefited? Clinton, Obama, Biden, Brennan, Clapper, Comey, all involved. Is this going to be investigated? Just asking.
Then he will refuse to be president because we all know Biden can’t beat him.

Seriously cut the shit with the whole "Biden is bad too" thing. This is a choice between Hannibal Lecter and Fred Rogers. Let's put the house fire out first, ok?
If Biden was in office we be doomed
One of the main differences between President Trump and Joe Biden if he was to win, Trump Makes his own decisions while Biden will have to be told what to do.
Biden thanks you.
Since she’s moving out soon, she should consult with Dr. Biden about this.
He’s not assaulting peaceful protestors sweetie he sent his gang in to arrest antifa rioters that George soros paid them 15 an hour to do such thing in Portland 😑 Democrats are killing black people but want them to vote for Biden? Lol

I have no doubt there are people on Biden’s team who don’t want it to be Kamala. I also have no doubt that when they tell him, he politely smiles while thinking ‘I don’t give a flying f*.’

Dearest Soledad, you keep hugging and rump swabbng Joe Biden, it's good for you I know but in your heart of hearts you know that he is grossly incompetent as much as you hate Trump , Biden is grossly incompetent to lead this Country. Stop being such a hypocrite, ITS TASTELESS!

Its all bullshit these tests came to us already infected with the virus so the world shows high numbers of covid. Exactly what's happening. Chyna hates trump prefers easy ass BIDEN ! THATS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Joe Biden is a conservative Democrat.  Over 45 years out in the open of public service.  You will never be able to paint him as a socialist!  Nice try, but no.  Just no
IMO Biden probably holds Susan Rice in this regard. She has the resume, they’ve worked together extensively.   The race isn’t close, hasn’t been, &amp; this gives Biden more latitude to make a governing decision before a political one.
If there’s a VP who would put their 2024 ambitions first &amp; undermine the President to get there, becoming a primary source of drama in the White House, Biden probably won’t pick them (contrary to conventional wisdom).   He’ll go with who he feels will be a good governing partner.
have you two morons bought and read the new book out called "FALLOUT" ? Oh my God it exposes how scandalous and corrupt the Obama and Biden administration was. Boomerang boomerang💥💥 Criminals
I don't care who he picks, as long as we beat ftrump and pence. Biden 2020!
You and all the other hateful morons deserve what you get if the progressives and Biden run this country and I hope you get it right up that you know what
Did you agree to burning down Democratic HQ in Maricopa County? No? Then don’t try to tie mess to Biden that isn’t his.
The far left like yourself are the ones that are racist ! Go back into history : Abrahan Lincoln he sign the declaration to free the slaves &amp; he was a Republican &amp; next who has more for all minorities is Mr. Trump ! Joe Biden has done nothing in over four decades for anybody.
Worst Presudent Trump Ignored Science and Healthcare costs That Job! Too Bad! I Choose You, Joe Biden! 👍❤️🇺🇸
That sounds like a much better America to me. Vote Biden 2020!
I sure hope people really get out because this is no joke and I don't want anybody staying home because they're lazy I'm end up with crazy Biden.
You are one of the reason i will not vote for Mr Biden, remember All Lives Matter.

Kind of sad when Biden makes little comments to try to stay relevant
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You're talking about Joe Biden's crime bill, btw. And democrat slavers, segregationists and and kkk members. Since we're going back that far. And BLM's stated goal is to keep black fathers out of the home. Anyways, nice talking to you even if we don't see eye to eye on everything
What if Joe Biden chooses Bernie as a running mate? Landslide.
Not voting for Biden nor Trump
Not Voting for Biden nor Trump!!!
Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
Question of the day, what do you wanna be when you grow up? I want to be "a voter registration physician",according to Joe Biden every city should have one. OMG,any moron that votes for this moron deserves what will become of this country if he gets elected
Jorge I’m 305 grew up in westchester anyway you don’t need to listen or give anyone any explanation. All these dems following Biden a puppet for the communist democrat party think they know more than us. We Cubans know communism just like Nicas &amp; Venezuelans. Be you don’t change!
Biden, stop babbling like an imbecile. Prove to us you won’t sell us out if you get the White House. Commit to charging outgoing administration for each and every crime committed. Set a precedent.
I thought you’d be mad at the inherent Biden disrespect here.
Man would’ve been great if you went at Biden like this. Soft af a little to late
Stop staring at me.

Biden and Obama do not need to wear masks if everyone knows that they are both criminals, bandits, gangsters , and they are both communists.

If the President chooses not to run I’ll vote for his V.P.! What will you do if Biden looses or asks where the President (Obama) is when he’s sworn in?
Karen Bass is a rightfully respected Congresswoman who is a great leader for the CBC.  She is not going to be VP. Leftists are propping her up as a hit on Kamala. Biden isn’t going to give away his lead in Florida and he’s going to pick someone who isn’t also of retirement age.
You need to get out more! It’s Noon on the 21st! What will you do when Biden doesn’t win or show up?
“Nonconformity” has no future at the NYT or on the Left! The NYT staff &amp; the Left will not continence it! We must all speak &amp; think as we are told to by our “betters”! (Not!) The “re-education camps” are just a Biden win away! (Think Manzanar here) Brooks is a “Useful Fool”!

Ugh he’s thoughtful on race relations but he is a Bernout. Please ask if he is voting Biden.
At this point, i imagine Joe Biden needs to wear ear plugs to sleep to prevent his brain from LEAKING out through his ears like a FUCKING SMOOTHIE because WHAT THE FUCK FIRST racist president??? Really Joe?? THATS the hill you wanna die on???
I think he should choose a person that is capable of governing this country if something happens to Biden, I don’t care if they are white, black, navy blue or purple
Joe Biden's America vote for him if this is what you want
Biden’s tax plan would “pull the rug out” from under the real estate industry: insidersThere was a CNN story today that the Biden aides said the VP announcement was pushed back till appx the 10th now, when they had said around the 1st for a while now.   Is this why?  Were they leaning to Bass?

Biden is not choosing anyone, his puppet masters are. Let's get the facts straight
The best ad you could air is a compilation of all of the gaffes of Biden in just the last months. The country needs to see what fake media refuses to let the people of this country see so they can understand how sadly his mental capacity has deteriorated.
Never ever i a million years would I vote for. Racist, rapist, pervert who is so senile that they won’t even let him do a real interview on tv. Anyone who would vote for Biden has a few screws loose. Trump has done an amazing job with our country. #Trump2020
Before Obama paid to have this virus brought to this country we had the best unemployment numbers in history and will again as soon as Trump is re-elected. This country is gone if Biden were elected...but the people of this country will not let that happen.
Oh shut up...your husband should be in jail for spying on Trump’s campaign. The evidence is very clear that Obama &amp; Biden was running the show. They BOTH had and have no business being in our government. The people are tired of your lies and corruption.
The silent majority are the Republicans who are voting for Biden
I want Kamala to be the pick, but as of right now the only way Biden could lose me would be to pick Nina Turner, and then I'd probably hold my nose and eat that bowl of crap.  We have to remove trump, period.
Biden has yet to crack 80% approval with blacks while Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election with 88% black approval  #MAGA2020
Barbra Streisand calls 'bully' Trump 'unfit' to serve as President
So...the [locally] elected officials is the “change” you’re referring to? We FINALLY have a wave of progressive politics becoming more mainstream, but Biden  isn’t a part of that. Biden is a STILL all about maintaining the status quo and i KNOW you’re smart enough to KNOW this.
They're losing just about everybody except for the Biden voters that are trashing our cities. But there's plenty of fraud votes combining illegals and dead people to make up the loss.
5. Within ANY OTHER time frame, Joe Biden and Donald Trump would be buddies...why? Because they respresent the interest of their privileged friends, policical/business buddies, and THE DONORS...NOT the American ppl, NOT the working class, and DEFINITELY NOT Black people.
4. Joe Biden’s entire campaign has pretty much been  A. Obama’s buddy B. Im not Trump  What the FUCK kinda marketing ploy is that??? THE AVERAGE AMERICAN VOTER DOESNT KNOW ANY OF BIDENS POLICIES because OF JUST THAT. He’s STILL an old fashioned establishment Democrat!!
Ok, lets go:  1. The two party system will FOREVER be bullshit if we continue for ANY REASONS other than proposed POLICIES  2. YOU cannot frame yourself as a “responsible voter” by supporting someone with an such an anti-progressive track record as Joe Biden
Buckle up, every1! Any former Rep that speaks out agst 45 will be slandered/libeled over the next 99 days. Have faith. No one believes it. Thx 4 taking the heat off Biden, even just 4 a sec. 💙👍🏻
The sad reality is: in many ways, Joe Biden actually IS worse. This is why being socially aware of his entire political career is so important.
If you like violence being poor shit healthcare hate the police and America don't care about your childrens future then Dummy Mummy Biden is your man!#SimpleDonkeyVoters
WE deserve BERNIE SANDERS, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO CORTEZ, NINA TURNER, STACY ABRAMS, ANDREW GULLIM, ILHAN OMAR, AYANNA PRESSLY, RASHIDA TALIB....HELL, I’LL EVEN TAKE ELIZABETH WARREN...BUT JOE “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black” BIDEN???? FUCK THAT.
Voting isn’t *just* about winning or losing, but also what policies we condone...and supporting Joe Biden despite his overwhelmingly BULLSHIT ASS track record will only allow the DNC to continue to think we’ll accept the barest of BARE minimums, AT BEST.
I have a hot take for y’all that i don’t think the TL is ready for; i am perfectly okay with Trump getting re-elected so that the Democrats can finally learn their goddamn lesson in thinking we’ll support ANY candidate they prop up...cause Joe Biden is NOT the move.
Where's Dummy Mummy Biden????#SimpleDonkeyVoters

Hey, yep still hanging in but on less for a while as we work towards some issues prepping to move.
The day after Biden wins the Presidential election I will still be dancing in the streets from the night before.
Good piece on why there was no blue wave in Fla in 2018 and whether Biden can take the state this year. The answers are found in Miami-Dade County.
If the dems and biden start talking about this it will gurantee trump the win. People arent locking down again. Keeping people in will take more law enforcement than a peaceful gathering in portland.

Doesn’t matter - lots of us who lean right are voting for Biden!
Fully intend to vote for Biden.
Biden is an idiot who can't even read his lines &amp; forgets where he's at plus being 77 yrs old he'll had the office to Pelosi to give to Hillary Rotten Clinton. Be careful America its a scam waiting patiently to destroy America. We'll Be 4 Sale Again
Biden event, tonight, livestream, $15 and up.    Hillary Rodham Clinton | Senator Tammy Baldwin | Mayor Pete Buttigieg | Senator Kamala Harris | Dolores Huerta | John Legend | Barbra Streisand  and many more.
Then maybe you shouldn't vote democrat because if you had any sense you would do your homework &amp; think for yourself than allow the dems to think for you. Biden is the worst fake actor along w/Pelosi &amp; the rest of the criminals you love 🦋💋

No, I haven't forgotten.  Neither has the media.  Trump is a Russian asset.
This video completely misrepresents George Carlin. He was talking about both parties &amp; the entire corporate media. That’s Biden, Obama, the Clinton’s, Democratic Party leadership etc... CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times  etc.. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
You are the smart one I do not keep up with Biden sorry but like your tv program:}
I hear you but we know they will not.  Then they will be on tv putting the blame on President Trump for C-19 getting out of control.  Wake up Trump did not make the virus &amp; has no cure.  He is doing all ANYONE can do even Biden.
We not asking beloved. We demanding. If they wanna continue to get our collective support, they should EARN IT. This is how democracy SHOULD work.  Also; Trump AND Biden are pieces of shit, but whoever’s willing to LISTEN and OBLIGE, I’ll consider as a viable candidate.
If you like this shit then Dummy Mummy Biden is your man!#SimpleDonkeyVoters
Idc about parties, i care about policies and for DECADES, Biden been on the wrong side of progressivism.   I dont trust him or the people propping him up as if he’s some kind of black savior. FUCK him and every career politician that doesn’t care to EARN my black vote.
Sad but this will continue until after they hope Biden goes in, they the LEFT truly does NOT CARE about you or your family.  I feel Trump does who would do all he has &amp; not get paid?

Another poll showing Biden ahead in Fla. This time 51%-46%. No surprises: Trump does well in Panhandle, Central Fla reflects state as whole, Biden does well in SE Fla. More older folks turned off by Trump.  MOE +/-3.8, R=1,005.
Joe Biden LITERALLY, word for word, said that “YOU AINT BLACK” if you don’t for him....and, y’all STILL GON VOTE FOR HIM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They defended him and hid it all and laughed.   They all defended Joe Rogan.  The bros attacked Hillary, Kamala, Biden, John Lewis etc. etc. etc. etc. with lies.  They were going to throw chairs at freaking Barbara Boxer - a legend of the congress.  They are all toxic af.
When Biden wins, I’m going to sleep through the night without my dental guard. 👍🏻💙🇺🇸🙏🏻
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Rest easy my soul 🤗..... I am not the biggest #Biden fan, but how can you not respect his generosity.   #Presidental
This election is like Star wars. The Socialists ie Democrat left wing are the empire trying to destroy the rebels. The rebels are the Republicans refusing to surrender to the left wing socialists. Pelosi ie Vader and Biden the emperor want the rebels wiped
Biden/Harris is going to win via a landslide!
I’m calling this now. Trump drops Pence for Haley. Any day now before Biden so he could be first to pick a women or I should say second.
Miami newspaper just published a confidential letter signed by 90+ leaders within Democrat Party of Florida. The letter was to the Biden campaign about his Florida ground game was in disarray.
I live in Eastern Central Florida and haven't seen a single Biden yard sign... Not 1.
I have been a Democrat before...I worked on Pres. Clinton's  &amp; Pres. Carter's campaigns;  I can tell you first hand that the m.o. of the Dem Party is to throw a lie against the wall to see what sticks...just like Biden calling Trump a racist,which is freaking laughable. U r sheep
AND...in case msm has not told you yet...the facts are coming out and Obama &amp; Biden were dead inthe middle of spying on Trump's campaign using phony documents, they altered docs. and fyi...what Nixon did pales in comparison to what they did.
You don't know what hell is...just let Biden win and let the Far Left Socialist/Communists take over. The lack of common sense in those on the Left is mind boggling. You will reap waht you sow. Trump had this country with the best economy &amp; employment numbers ever pre-virus.
You can beat Biden off? I’m sure.
What?  That is not how it works.  If they don't vote fairly regularly they get scrubbed off the voter rolls.  The registered voters in this state are fairly regular.  And they will vote for Biden over trump...
Biden doesn't tweet now....
We know if Biden is elected these LEOs will be assaulting gun owners' homes w/ flash bangs, tear gas &amp; live rounds to "hell yes we're going to take them all." They'll instantly stop being "Trump's stormtroopers" &amp; morph into "Biden's anti-terrorism task force" while you cheer. /1
What the hell is CCP?  I'm glad you're on top of this NBA-commissioner-supporting-Biden crisis, since it's the worst crisis our nation is facing.   Is the NBA commissioner a private citizen, free to support whomever he wants?  You Republicans are unbelievably awful.
😂I never heard of that clown.  Appears to be a trimp bootlicker.  I think Bors is a genius.  I love his work, except for the Biden-bashing and Bernie worship.
Central Florida Biden vs Trump donations.    Daytona is neutral.  Ormond Beach is once again for trump, as expected.
You tout your rosebud for the DSA and you are all faux socialists.  You know nothing more than spoiled ignorant cosplay nasty key board warriors.  Go volunteer for the Dem party and make sure Biden wins.
If that is your standard how can you vote for biden?  How many bankers in the Big O’s adminisration?  How many that lie about their heritage?
That's because they are sheep they can't think for themselves and are to lazy and unwilling to research the truth &amp; facts Mark. DEVIDEN BIDEN Ba"Ba"Ba"
47 years of wasted taxpayer dollars and nothing but problems to show for it unless your Biden relative,  DEVIDEN BIDEN
45YEARS of NOTHING DONE BUT SELLING OUT AMERICANS, THATS DEVIDEN BIDEN!!!
They keep telling Biden but he forgets by the time he gets to the podium.
Vote Trump in 2020  Be careful who you vote for in 2020 because remember Biden is 77 yrs old that's too old &amp; he won't be in office long before he hands it to Pelosi &amp; she'll hand it over to the worst criminal in…
There is also no chemistry.  Warren attacked Obama and Biden constantly and she said he was running in the wrong primary, etc.  Long bad history.  They do not have common ground.
I'm going down to Democratic headquarters tomorrow to try to buy a Biden yard sign to go with my Dump Trump yard sign.I think asswipe may have trouble in Florida. Yay, about time the old farts woke up.
I don't see her happening.    She is 74 years old for starters and Biden made comments about bridges to the future generations.
I feel ya,  I just told one of my needy friends that if they’re not planning to vote for Biden, I wasn’t planning on listening to their problems any longer. Haven’t heard from her in 3 days.  Adios!
Dan, Please tell me how america can vote Joe Biden as president of the United States? Do they not understand that if he is elected this country is done! Please tell me I am not to worry?
I truly think that is going to move closer for us.   Kasich for Biden at the convention.  Lincoln Project and RVAT have split the state between them to put boots on the ground and ads targeting trumpers.  It is a state that is going to be heavily targeted by NeverTrumpers...

Trump's job approval is at an average of 42.2% and he's trailing Biden in the polls nationally by almost 9% according to Real Clear Politics.
Trump likely found out he is suffering from dimentia so now he has to say that Biden has it. Can I get a covfefe with that salad, btw?
I want a - I'm a Republican - Not a Fool -Biden 2020 yard sign. Any idea where to get 2?
Charlamagne Tha God calls Joe Biden 'donkey of the day' DONKEY OF THE DAY
Biden opens up 13-point lead over Trump in Florida, poll finds  I say that’s Bullshit

This is posted by Republicians for Biden!
Ok. I am convinced..All Democrats are Jackasses..well if he is gonna place a label of untruth upon an opponent, maybe I can place a label of truth to counterpoint his bullyboy tactics..Biden is a Pedophile..there, it is..own it, cuz the video evidence supports this conclusion
Biden is so far ahead many Democrats don’t even need to get out of bed and Vote!But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Ridiculous and obnoxious that this kind of misogyny is still rampant.  is an outstanding and qualified VP candidate.  should definitely pick her. #KamalaHarris #joebiden #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #kamala
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
95 days to go! 17.3M+ cases &amp; 673k+ deaths globally, 4.4M+ cases &amp; 152k+ deaths in US, Herman Cain dies of Covid, Nunes refuses to admit if he got dirt on Biden, Kelly leads McSally, Obama’s powerful eulogy, Trump campaign pauses ads, Biden to hopefully pick VP soon. #ResistOn🇺🇸
⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.

If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
We will make #GoodTrouble to elect Joe Biden! #WeWillVote
We definitely need debates. Have you seen Biden?  He’s not all there.
Obama and Biden promised they will do that next time 🤦🏿‍♂️

I'm old enough to remember this.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
She’s senile along with Biden
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left 😂
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)
“The language very closely echoes recommendations released earlier this month by criminal justice reform task force that Biden and former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) organized.”
Agree!  We’ll deserved and we should make sure President Biden does it!
Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden  #FoxNews
Vote for Biden and give him the Senate and those pulling his strings will have us as East Germany in a year.  You will wake up too late and not be happy.  But, too late.  How do you not see this?

Went to the beach 3 years ago n still got sand on my nuts lol I hate Joe Biden
Posted some "pedophilia bad" on my story, now the liberals gon swipe up talmbout "yeah but still vote biden" Bitch ain't noone said his name But fuck that nigga tho
Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Then do it and stop procrastinating! Vote trump! No commie nadler Schiff warren s Biden’s et al .
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020
...whatever "progressive" is supposed to mean now.  Bernie Sanders is not a "progressive". Joe Biden is not a "progressive".

I think he googled "fake name that's not Biden"
He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.
If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
You want to fix the problems of America &amp; Foreign affairs. Joe Biden needs an all women cabinet!!! Kamala Harris Stacy Abrams AOC Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren Val Demings Keisha Lance Bottoms Muriel Bowser Lori Lightfoot Veronica Escobar Jenny Durkan  Gretchen Whitmer Karen Bass
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.
Biden - you will suck up to anything in order to appease the needy so that you can get elected and then you’ll do NOTHING
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let’s not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn’t get into office? Let’s not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.
Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
We don’t need to see Biden being interviewed. It’s more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
- this lady speaking about Biden is so wet behind the ears - She is right about 1 thing - BUDEN is going to need a smart VP because he is totally incompetent- Senile to the MAX
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. 🤔
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there
Why bother?  Leave it for Jill Biden!
Of course not. Biden is Lambchop. The only question is to find out who is playing the political role of Sherry Lewis.
we'll ask president biden to look into it...

More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS

Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!Man, Democrats are a tough crowd. Biden always said he was announcing his VP choice sometime in early August. It's July 31st and he's getting dragged.

Ridiculous and obnoxious that this kind of misogyny is still rampant.  is an outstanding and qualified VP candidate.  should definitely pick her. #KamalaHarris #joebiden #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #kamala
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
Not a single Bernie supporter could ever stomach Donald Trump, and Joe Biden is about as centrist as it gets.  Apparently saying someone is a leftist is all the fear mongering conservatives need to shit the bed.
Think about this.  Biden is ahead by close to ten points nationally and leading in every swing state and he hasn't announced his VP candidate yet.  Look for a bounce this week.  Now the campaign needs to concentrate on getting out the vote.
Never happen Mr Biden
Anyone Joe Biden picks to be his Vice President will be a million times better than Mike Pence. Let’s all keep that in mind.
Barr Durham really messed this up.  So many should have been indicated with what we know already. Now we endanger the Republic by allowing absolute criminals or treasonists to be on a ticket for a national party.   dug up the goods on Joe Biden. Barr won't go there

Joe Biden didn't create his job. The people of Delaware kept employing him, then an overwhelming number of Americans sent him and his boss to DC twice. We're about to hire him again. Trump found jobs for his daughter, son in law, daughter in law, Rudy's son, Barr's daughter, etc.

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden said he wasn't announcing until August. The guessing games are on us.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Biden/Beto would have been the ultimate!!! Beto 2024!
Actually, it’s not settling.  If Biden is elected, and he probably will be, he will be too cognitively impaired time be anything but a figurehead.  Assuming the Dems sweep, the progressives will be in charge.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
Bottom line, all those protesters are voting for Biden. And they don’t like that...
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
we are all in for a Biden Warren ticket... thank you 🙏🏻
Biden what you gonna do ?
That’s why this election must be a landslide victory for Biden so Trump will have to get use to the disappointment! 🤞🙏🌊🌊🌊🌊💙✌️
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
I hear what you are saying, but I’m not willing to push anyone away right now that wants to join with us to elect Biden and rid us of Trump and as many Republicans in Congress as possible.  If we are lucky, once we get back to some semblance of normalcy maybe we can all work

Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
And don’t forget all the money China has paid the Biden’s and others in DNC. Chinese driver for Feinstein - with FBI checks etc. no one caught on to this, either, for years! Doesn’t pass the smell test.

Dear, not all of that will happen and that which will is needed.  Why don’t you go read Biden’s various plans before you make wild assumptions
Let’s be honest, his federal storm trooper stunt will just add to the votes for Biden
Wow, You know President Obama and President Biden along with VP Kamala Harris absolutely had nothing at all ever to do with Trump's Best pedophile friends of Epstein,Maxwell and Dershowitz.  Trump even brought Ivanka into the "friendship"!
Sorry but in this case Biden and medical experts including psychologists are calling this one.  How many parents don’t want to wear masks either? They  put their children in danger every day.  56% might want to send their kids back to school but that doesn’t mean they’re right.
And trumptards are complaining that John Lewis’s funeral was a Biden campaign rally?  We need to brace ourselves for the constant refrain “the postal service is incompetent.” He’s going to hit us with that like he did with “fake news.” Say it enough that your followers believe it
Absolutely! Vote for Biden. Or my dog. Or anybody but Trump.

idea of a solution. I don't need to trash Trump to make my point. But whatever Trump sees when he looks in the mirror, and what Trump claims to see when he looks at Joe Biden are so far away from the reality.
It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

It is my observation that Biden supports China fully, Why? They do not Want a strong President like Trump, so they are Financing Sleepy Joe &amp; the Dems fully against Trump, so they can continue to abuse our USA and the world. #MAGA2020! They are in for a big surprise!
It is my observation that Biden supports China fully Why? Because they are Financing the Dems because China wants to get rid of the only  President with what it takes to deal with them properly...Sleepy Joe cannot and will not.
Barack Obama forgets he is no longer President! How inappropriate to use a funeral to make a political statement! Biden is the one running. Tell him to come out of the basement and start facing the public! #ObamaIsNotRunning
Silent majority used to be independents and republicans voting for Biden. Now that MAGA hijacked the name, lets call them what they really are what they really are “LOUD MINORITY”
The Joe Biden narrative that's being pushed is ridiculous &amp;cruel. I'd like to see someone bury a child&amp;not take the opportunity to show affection. Not everyone is comfortable w/physicality &amp; maybe he erred by being inconsiderate but the sexualizing's being done by the storyteller
Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a “fraudulent vote”. I’m happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
Obama is giving a campaign speech for Biden. 🤮 He’s also pointing out Islam’s goal -no matter how long it takes -to change ALL Americans to accept the tenets of ONLY Islam.  Sounds like the Dem party/Progressives today to REMAKE America.

Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
I can’t even fathom why Biden would pick Kamala. Could there be a worse VP pick?
For most, trump lowered personal income tax for everyone. Voters have to determine if a) taxes are their priority b) if you have a job now, are you confident that you’ll keep it with trump/Biden c) if you don’t have a job will you get one with trump/Biden
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
Kamala Harris is very ambitious. People who run for president usually are - Joe Biden 2020 notwithstanding. (He’s trying to rescue America.) That in and of itself should not be disqualifying. What are they really concerned about?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn’t answer! Of course for Biden lol joke

Respectfully, you’re barking up the wrong tree. There is no objective metric that would have trump being a better fit for the country than Biden. Did you know that On average, Democratic presidents grew the economy 4.4% each year versus 2.5% for Republicans since Truman?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Are we talking about the same Joe Biden who passed bills and yelled on the senate floor (about black people) "LOCK EM UP" That Joe Biden?
So,  basically,  Biden will lie or conceal his true intentions in order to get elected? D--n,  this politics business is hard work!
Essential that if Biden is told to add Harris or Warren as VP that Republicans pound home that Biden has already told us he won't do a whole term and the VP will essentially be President.  Could be in the first year.
Now if you’d actually read ANY on Biden’s plans we could have an adult discussion, but that obviously out if the question
That is what concerns me about the upcoming election. I left the Democrat Party several years ago as I believed then and continue to believe now that the Democrats biggest problem is the Democrats. I will however vote for Biden
Biden's notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris  via
Respectfully, the Democrats dont plan on giving him anything. He will be like a hamster in a cage running on a wheel.  They are/will control EVERYTHING he does.  A vote for Biden is a vote for a group of left interest groups pulling the strings.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
It will be essential for Republicans to refer whomever pathetic Joe Biden is told to take on board as "Ms. President."  Let people know every minute of every day that he will NOT be President, but she will within a year when he resigns for health reasons.
BIDEN DOES NOT WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE. STOP LYING!!!

Biden was right! If you question the left... “YOU AIN’T BLACK!”

Sure and Biden without a track record is more qualified. Not happening. Trump 2020.
It is sad that the left is using Biden as a puppet when clearly he is not well just because they hate Trump so much. #WakeUpAmerica
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)

Biden didn’t win on policy, he won bc the DNC and Obama made an incredible Hail Mary and got everyone who wasn’t Sanders to drop out and support Biden. I’m not even mad, it was amazing. Attributing that win to Biden’s platform is a mistake, the policy being complete shit aside
Why do you continue to conflate Biden votes as votes against M4A? I’m guessing that there is no moral or financial argument that can be made so you are making a strategic one, yet M4A is overwhelmingly popular. You already identified why ppl voted Biden and it isn’t the ACA

She must have passed Biden’s sniff test‼️‼️
Biden is not weak DJT 🤥💩 weakness shows in every aspect of his mind personality lack of morals &amp; character soul and actions‼️You are repeating propaganda from DJT🤥💩and Fox Fake news.
Creepy Joe Biden voted by thought. It's known as "Telepathy Dementia".
...If Twitter suspended one of the Bush, Obama, Reagan, or Biden kids during a Presidential election, I'm sure they would do nothing too...Your doing great man, just don't leave your head in the sand too long, it's hard to get off.
Mr. Biden You can’t be trusted. You talk out of both sides of your mouth ALL THE TIME. You lie constantly, the Covid numbers are so clearly inflated and easy to prove, your record going back forty years on race is appalling, You all but say you don’t want “ them” on your block.
On Tax Day, difference between Trump, Biden is on full display
Biden’s reclaiming his time
Went to the beach 3 years ago n still got sand on my nuts lol I hate Joe Biden
Posted some "pedophilia bad" on my story, now the liberals gon swipe up talmbout "yeah but still vote biden" Bitch ain't noone said his name But fuck that nigga tho
Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Lets not confuse a Biden vote as a vote against M4A: like you said, most ppl voted bc Biden was perceived as the best to beat trump, and then a majority in every state said they were for M4A I’m exit polls, a fact every Sanders supporter is acutely aware of
Joe Biden has to read aloud the reporters name to next ask a question? There's only about 8 people there?
Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I’m Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
My Takeaway from todays "Hearing" 1) Democrats have gone over the edge, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!  2) Republicans have all but given up in this "Fight"  3) AG Barr has the nerves of a SAINT.  4) Swalwell is still the laughing stock of the Democrats.  5) If Biden wins, we're F'ed!
Switching between Biden's "Press conference" and the Democrat "hearing" is like switching back and forth between the hot tub and the freezing pool.  One second you're boiling with anger, the next you're falling asleep.

I just switched from the Democrat shitshow in the House to listen to Joe Biden.  In the House hearing I was fired up and Angry.  Now I'm falling asleep. Can this man speak any slower?
It’s rare that he sticks his head up. They told Biden, “Hey Barr is killing us, hurry up and get out the basement”.
should you take reporter questions like Biden from friends who are taken quietly in order with scripted questions? What is this crap?
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
has stated he wants your kids taught Islam in school.   Islam promotes violence &amp; hatred, no thanks Joe.  If you want China ripping us off he is especially good at that.  Do you want  telling you what to do, vote Biden.  If Biden gets in were doomed!
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020
...whatever "progressive" is supposed to mean now.  Bernie Sanders is not a "progressive". Joe Biden is not a "progressive".

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
Its like the Trump v Biden debates.. I wouldn’t be surprised.
Sorry, i might have used the wrong word. Delayed for now. But this smells like the Biden debates, if you ask me.
With Biden, we will! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
And they’re all voting Biden. That’s what pisses you off..
This is very informative and a good reason to vote for Biden in November and return control of the senate to the Democrats.
Biden couldn’t find Cleveland.
You already had your opportunity. We saw the Obama-Biden Administration! What’s different now?
...Hunter Biden’s extensive international travel during the Obama-Biden presidency, including at least 5 trips to China, will raise additional questions.” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. Read:   #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA  #WeThePeople
... During the time period of the records provided, Hunter Biden took 411 separate domestic and international flights, including to 29 different foreign countries. He visited China five times.  “Given the #Burisma-Ukraine-China influence peddling scandals...
Judicial Watch announced it received records from the U.S. Secret Service showing that, for the first five and a half years of the #Obama administration, Hunter #Biden traveled extensively while receiving a #SecretService protective detail.
Joe biden." Do I get dessert with that?".
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let’s not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn’t get into office? Let’s not have that again. Time to rally people!
Did I say I like Biden? Charlie Kirk is a grifter and the conservative movements needs to stop treating him like he’s anything more than an absolute idiot.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...

Anyone Joe Biden picks to be his Vice President will be a million times better than Mike Pence. Let’s all keep that in mind.

New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.

⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia
Hi. Mom for Biden here. I attended the launch party last night with  and it was refreshing to hear positive and informed ideas. I can’t wait to vote for a candidate who will value and protect the lives of children, teachers, and staff. #MomsForBiden

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a “fraudulent vote”. I’m happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.

We definitely need debates. Have you seen Biden?  He’s not all there.

I'm old enough to remember this.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn’t answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left 😂
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
They asked Biden what flavor jello he had for lunch.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)

Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
Kudos to  for not trying pressure Biden into picking a Black woman as VP. She’s got great political future &amp; is good for USA
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. 🤔
Great!  is going to have Stacey Abraham’s on #reidout so they can pressure Biden into tapping SA as VP. Keep it up  Paint Biden bad if his pick isn’t Black. Because color is critical to qualifications, right?!?  is better VP pick but must be next AG
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.

And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies

Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
What a waste. Joe Biden will take it down.🌊
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS
Part of Joe Biden's Inaugural speech will be "I will tear down this wall"!
Follow if you're riding with Biden!!!
Omg.  As Biden would say, that’s a bunch of malarkey.  🙄
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can’t let Biden win
Thanks Stacy
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

Trump sending a few LEGAL Federal cops in is an overreach, but this Obama takeover, which Biden will absolutely push harder is not. Explain that.

At least to about the middle of next year. If it is still raging on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will institute a national "wear a mask" program that will FINALLY get it under control.

Believe me, Biden and the rest of the Country would rather he not attend the Inauguration. I hope I never have to see his orange face again and especially his family of grifters.
I’m pretty sure Biden’s supporters are the one’s tearing up cities...we sure as hell know they’re not voting for trump. Also, she doesn’t stand up to him bc it’s all an act. She knows he’s not a racist and that he gives a shit about America.
I stand proud and will vote for Biden so that we can take our country back.
“Us” is the campaign. It doesn’t do the country any favor to have dirt on Hunter Biden.
Floridian here &amp; I’m in (954) 1 of the 2 most bluest counties in this state. Not even a sign or bumper sticker of Biden however seen many trump2020 in 561 &amp; 305. You guys are being played just like in 16 with HC. One day y’all will wake up
Sucks bad don’t it! Vote for Biden and watch more of ur $$ leave!!
Biden already views the 11 mill illegals as American citizens. If he gets elected, he’s guaranteeing a pathway 2 citizenship for every single 1 no matter what their history is. &amp; if that happens...they can vote! just bc biden says he views them as citizens dsnt make them citizens
.. as our client. Mr. West said on his son “selag from Jesus is king..”we got the product, tools,minds, youth.. we need to TELL Ebro and Biden, Trump what u need.#vision2020
Nope. We are voting for Biden.
If Biden did not have strong foreign policy credentials, I'd be all for her, but I think Kamala Harris would do well in a debate and offer some different assets. However, it should be a person he can work well with personally and trust implicity (whoever that is).
They are hurting Joe Biden and helping "him".
I will cancel your vote for trump with my vote for Biden.
Once the election results look promising for Biden, trump will begin to doubt himself an he'll go into deep depression and if he doesn't find answers it will probably ruin him. Even if he did cure his narcissism (took me 9 months) there will be too much remorse for him to handle
Sending you love from Hillsboro Beach..Go Biden❣️

Idgaf. Just can’t let trump back in. Anyways when Biden dies or retires we get a better one so ya. U seriously think any of us like Biden 💀
Mr Biden he is an ignorant narcissist who only wants self praise. Can’t deal with him.  Keep hitting him hard, we are behind you
Biden and trump are both shit. But I will take the lesser of two evils. Especially considering that trump poisons our nation and purchased underage girls from epstein. Im good thanks.
Joe Biden was anti-busing 4 over 4 decades. He touted accomplishments working with segregationalists. Biden said 'without orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. The Media loves REWRITING and FORGETTING History. Trump's a counter-puncher not a racist
Amazing how they were able to obtain a future video of America under Joe Biden.  Oh wait...
She supports Biden?

Biden is an animal
he’s got a point biden is pretty racist and probablematic. if you look into his past you’d find that , however he isn’t worse than trump. he is racist but, he is actually making an effort to pretend to not be racist and heal the country
Despising trump doesnt mean I like that dotard biden either.   One is not exclusive of the other.  But the fact is trump is way worse with proven incompetence. And yes, everything I have uttered about the gop is true.  I was a republican so I know.   Dont be a clown✌

Mr. Biden,  You should get out more, you know and talk to people other than yourself.
Lol I always have to remind myself that a large part of why I like Biden, is from The Onion.  He was far from my first choice but he's a good and decent person, and right now, that's exactly what we need.
Joe Biden said that without "orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. Can you imagine if Trump or any Republican had said this? It never ceases to amaze me how the activist media makes such suckers out of Democrats who are just blind to our history!

bruh.... trump sucks, biden sucks, kanye sucks. why don’t we all vote third party for once?? why do we HAVE to vote republican or democrat??? like idgi. we’re acting like those are our only two options? We have the green party and the libertarian party, what’s wrong with those??
Joe Biden just stated that Donald Trump is the first racist ever elected President. Quick fact check. The first racist President was Andrew Jackson whose portrait hangs directly over Trump’s desk. BTW, whatever…
This will only serve to shore up his propaganda with the cult. It won’t change anyone else’s mind other than to strengthen voters to elect Biden!

This is very accurate. Voting for anyone other than Biden or Trump is a waste
Vote for Biden. No matter who you are Trump doesn’t give a flying fuck about you
i think your underestimating senior population in Florida and how high turnout will be among dems in broward for bidenRemember . . . what would Dems have done different . . . keep in mind Biden and other Dems called the China travel bans xenophobic. And . . . our economy was record strong BEFORE the virus using policies Dems voted against.
Your right, the economy would NEVER have contracted under a Hillary shutdown, NO ONE would have lost their jobs if Democrat led this pandemic. Ignore 3 years of success. Heck even Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic, clearly we'd be better off . . .
Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.

We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.

“Several additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered”
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.

Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.

Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it’s insanity... and you’ve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden 🤪🤪
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..

Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.

Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.

His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.

Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.

A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
If it wasn't for 2016-2018 id probably be a Biden supporter 🤭😂
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.

I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.

I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
Must be a Joe Biden supporter

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden’s choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
No one’s voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, “Stupid” too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.

Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.

His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn’t want him as vp
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️

You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden “smells” children? C’mon... look at our country today!! We couldn’t take much more of all this winning!
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn’t happen under Obama/Biden. It won’t happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....

It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
I’m not even sure of a virtual debate at this point. I didn’t realize how bad Biden is it’s embarrasing that this was the best Dems could do after 4 years.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
I absolutely believe this... I worry what Trump &amp; Barr will do the days after he loses (if we vote)&amp; Biden takes office! Trump will sabotage the country &amp; no telling what else.... but regardless, Trump &amp; his Administration will pay for every crime committed &amp; ever dime grifted!!
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris

Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I’d be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory—that Biden’s heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers—Amy Klobuchar

As head of #TrumpCrimesCommission will you work w/   and do this on day ONE. Can y’all give me some hope????And btw Biden campaign why are YOU not responding to ALL messages. I thought you had a killer team???? This is getting ME very concerned.
Biden is a segregationist and Harris is from a slave owning family in Jamaica  perfect match
And y’all “i dont like Biden” mfs better not fuck this up for us
Barack Obama And George Clooney Trade A Few Jokes And Talk Of Defeating Donald Trump At Virtual Fundraiser For Joe Biden
Two choices in 2020. Trump v Biden. That's what we got. If you're anti Biden, then you're pro Trump. It's plain as that.
BARR is tRump’s personal attorney, Just like Michael Cohen was and we know what happened to him!  After Biden is elected and the Senate turns Democratic, BARR will be looking at JAIL BAR’s.  Rush Michael Cohens book!
We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
Bingo. Harris, Rice, Demings, Bass, Duckworth, etc...doesn't matter. Donald Trump doesn't care about running a country. He cares about being liked. DON'T GET INTO POLITICS IF YOU WANT TO BE LIKED. Because - no matter what you do - many won't like you. Biden is ready to lead!
And he still makes more sense than Biden, figure that out.
Can you break the law then run for office to avoid indictment biden? American's hopes and dreams of justice described by this article. You better give us some REAL criminals Barr, not some sacrificial small fries. Some higher ups gave the orders!
My bet offer is open any time you want.Biden with a 14 point lead I saw today. Easy money for you. Wondering why you won’t though?Funny thing is that for all the news hype about it, Bernie won the Cuban vote over Biden in the primary. Also Karen Bass is a boss.
Dear Biden,   do the United States a favor &amp; delete twitter.   Sincerely,  The people who are voting for you.
As a Floridian, I can honestly say it would be disastrous to Biden’s now good chances of taking Florida—and with it the election.
It’s so cute how Trump supporters accuse Biden of everything that Trump has done. If true, it would only reduce the race to a comparison of their personalities. Who would vote for Diet-Coke-Soaked-Sack-of-Dog-Logs-Donny?(say it fast 3x’s and Trump will actually crap his pants!)
You get voter outreach training from Biden's team, sounds like it... Maybe log off and start phone banking for Biden.
🏴‍☠️  you will lose election. Then, January 20th, 2021, at 12:01, on the order of President Biden, you will be taken in to custody by United States Marshals, and tried before the world at a trial the size never seen before. 🏴‍☠️🖕🏻✌ #ImpotusAmericanus

Hunter Biden In Lucrative Deal With China-Owned Company — While Dad Demonizes The Entire Industry – We The People Daily
There are a lot who are on the fence. You throw a literal commie on the ticket, and you'll have cubans and Venezuelans voting en masse against Biden. Remember it was angry Cubans that tipped the election for the GOP in 2000 (Elian) and 2016 (Obama's late-term Cuba policy switch).
Let him be 1 of many that get prosecuted!  Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden
Of course Biden would do this you fool!  In fact, Biden would do more than just sit there for an effing photo op, which is all Trump is interested in.  Are you people really this gullible.  Read Mary Trump's book if you dare.
Just throwing this out there. Nothing prohibits Biden from choosing Obama as his running mate.

Amen! I have seen the light. Brother Micah, if I repent what percentage of my wealth should I give to you and Joe Biden to make it right? You have told me that rich men do not get into the gates of heaven. What is the cutoff point? Is having 1,000 dollars in savings too much?
He even said it to others in the Administration, including Biden. He can’t deny that he gave aid to the enemy who attacked our democracy, yet there he still is holding the 2nd most powerful political office in America
Biden Predicted Trump Might Try to Delay Election |   via
I probably won’t be happy all the time if Biden becomes president. However, I I know I won’t end up calling him a facist fucktwit like the current occupant.
The Federalist Society guy jumped ship. Former Republican party backers now endorsing Biden, etc. They all but announced it was safe for others to follow their lead. Trump is a losing game. Even Fox knows that.
It's a good thing that Biden has knowledge of how the presidency operates because I'm not counting on Trump to brief him on ANYTHING. I'm not even counting on trump to SPEAK with him during the transition.
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Sterilize the WH after they leave. Biden’s shouldn’t move in right away...
In fairness on FL, take out the two suspect pollsters, Gravis &amp; Q (who just has noisy polls here), and July looks pretty consistent for Biden at it just beyond MOE leads
Because Democrat idiots will cheat w mail in votes. Black lady was caught recently w 66 mail in votes, for Biden, in her possession. Pay attention!! Kids going back to school needs to happen. What do you not get???? How do you not get it???? You may want to go back to school!
I may vote for Biden just for this. #TweetingAintWorking
Then text back stop lol. Don’t be a jerk and just end the convo. I get texts from the Biden campaign and I’m not a dick to whoever is texting me because I know it’s an 18 year old volunteer texting a set list of numbers.
Joe Biden's Child Care Plan Is As Much About The Messenger As It Is About The Message | HuffPost
Never expected to see that referenced, damn
I get it, but here's the thing. Politicians like Biden, Clinton &amp; Obama set the stage for people to elect Trump. If Biden gets elected, he will set the stage for someone far worse, like Tom Cotton. Who is just as fascist, but the press will roll over for because he's in the club.
Has Biden's position on marijuana 'evolve' yet?  Because when Truml is gone (please FSM), this whole country is going to need a joint or two to remove the anxiety from the last four years.
His handlers are frikking out.  They are treating Biden like they Barred AG Bill.  A hopeless clown show from hell to quote another tweet.  JSMH.
No problem, that just means Biden's senile ass will get kicked sooner. He's gonna be lookin around for CornPop, blind as a racoon in a snowstorm. He won't even know the election is happeing.
Expect monthly kisses to be blown to China in the Biden admin.
Nowhere do I say or imply that Biden’s political campaign shouldn’t have also been ended by SA allegations as well. I personally used my florida primary vote on a certain Vermont senator with a record clean of sexual assault
Why does Micah prefer Joe Biden to President Trump? What other Democrat primary challengers did you like in the Reagan and Bush years? Let’s engage. #workersoftheworldunite
It’s crazy to see how many republicans are registering to vote for Biden
I agree that's 45's tactic. I hope people do not become complacent with seeing #Biden lead in the polls and neglect their right to vote. the one thing about 45's supporters is that they're passionate and will make it to the voting booth. I think it could be a close election!
I enjoy your podcasts but felt the Biden mental decline segment was beneath you just as those claiming Trump is in mental decline . Trump isn’t in mental decline he is just a extremely lazy and the job of US president is very difficult and requires attention

No, Obama and Biden were the worst.
Can't wait for the "Biden 2020 Eat a half a bowl of shit" challenge...
And the fallout could be worse because wanting to be Pres in 4 years is what many assume Biden's VP will do.
Like Biden?
He endorsed Biden 🤔
This is the type of approach I can trust and get behind to vote Biden (Solely based on our current beyond fucked up state)
"Others argue that she’s too ambitious and that she will be solely focused on becoming president herself."   When was ambition a point against a man in politics?
That Biden is not competent!!
The Biden house has a more pleasing color scheme too.

It is incredibly insulting that they think people will hold their noses and vote for Biden just because of TDS.
Know that UNLESS your goal and agenda is to radically change and/or destroy the greatest Country on earth, you can not vote with any sound rationale for a Democrat or Joe Biden.
If Biden wins we’ll be too busy shooting our way out of Socialism to worry about them.
No, it's not that many. Despite any surveys you may produce, he'll probably receive fewer this time than last. That's why the desperate attempts to make Biden look as racist as possible. The only hope is to disgust enough blacks to stay home to make a difference in close states
That Joe Biden is naive or malicious? What is your point?
I know Biden wasn’t a lot of people’s first pick but yeah, it’s kinda a big deal to people who aren’t white kids from New England that he win
Its very disheartening but please consider voting for Biden. We will make some progress under Biden and a trump 2nd term will be devastating.  Many voters had the same attitude in 2000 and wouldn’t vote for Gore over Bush. The Bush presidency was a disaster.
When are we going to talk about the fact that a) the former VP clearly has Alzheimer’s (someone in my family has it bad, I know the signs), &amp; b) that this is the cream of the crop for the Democrats?  For all the talk about Trump and the 25th Amendment, Biden will get it for sure.
Abrams is like meanest woman at the DMV. I’m praying Biden picks her.
And if Trump wins, lot's of Biden voters will push the "he didn't win, fraud, Russia" claims before or during the violence they're committing
That’s fair, I for one despise the fact the the DNC left us with Biden as the democratic nominee. However the fact is that at the time he endorsed Biden there was not another option that would have had a beneficial outcome. (Not endorse any1/endorse Bernie only to have him lose)
The infamous "other Biden"
Dear #President, I will try to help balance out the fraudulent #Democrat votes by submitting at least 20 mail in ballots... Should I vote for you or Biden? Joe said to vote for you because I ain’t black.
He made a judgment call at the time, he’s a numbers guy and the numbers told him Biden would be the nominee. He also has continued his work after suspending his campaign with things such as Humanity Forward and The Data Dividend Project.
A potential Biden AG would never be questioned like this by democrats, but u can guarantee the feds will be just as fascist
Why?  We all know Barr is just going to lie. We're all voting for Biden anyway. #loseTheTurdOnTheThird
Green Party &gt; Biden.
The combo of these things means that by October, polling numbers should move back in Trump's favor providing for a much closer race than currently envisioned in key states.  National polls may keep a 8pt lead for Biden but NC, TX, MI, FL will be tight again.
The effort to block Trump from Facebook and Google is ongoing but has not worked so far. Trump is outspending Biden on digital 3:1
No one is writing stories about fundraising but Trump has a $400M total advantage and a $100COH advantage.
Very unpopular election analysis:  Biden strategy of letting Trump drown in an ocean of negative media attention is working BUT it is not sustainable.  Support for Biden comes back to baseline once campaigning starts post-convention.

Actual reason: Biden wouldn’t make it through the introductions without screwing it up.
Biden could take a dump on 5th Avenue, and his supporters will still vote for him.
I think that’s Biden’s slogan now. Trump has been campaigning for him all year.
If you're voting for Biden and pushing for his election you're a Biden supporter. Dress it up how u want. When Obama was letting police at DAPL use water cannons and dogs on Natives fighting for water, was that not fascist? Or killing American citizens w no due process?

They’re only doing it because Trump is a good Catholic who attends Mass every day, unlike that Biden guy.
I saw an interview in which she laughed at her slight of Biden.  I hope she is not the pick...I will vote for him anyway but I think she is a BAD choice!
If #Biden wins the election the #coronavirus bullshit won’t stop immediately because then it would be too obvious it was a perpetrated by the Dems, but watch at how quickly it goes away and all these bullshit restrictions suddenly are no longer necessary. #Election2020
Biden is to Trump's right on China. "Trump rolled over for the Chinese" Check the replies to see how Asian ppl feel about this
I'm worried about what he's actually going to do if he wins. If Trump loses M4A is delayed 4 more years. If Biden wins its most likely going to be 8 or more since no one will challenge him from the left
Just a note, this is the mainstream media actively pushing conspiracy theories. Why? Biden wants to flip Florida.
Oh hell is he starting this 💩again? I thought he and Joe had come to agreement on how they were going forward on Health care. Warren supported Biden so I thought this was settled. We’re doing Single payer on the ACA. We’re doing what we can get passed. Bernie fu^kn LOST‼️🔥

Calling whatever happens, if it happens, a debate is a stretch.   I’m betting Biden’s controllers refuse to debate, assuming Biden actually ends up being the candidate. Odds of that no better than 50-50.

Biden would destroy Trump in a debate. Especially if they have someone fact checking responses or if Trump were to release his taxes.
Saying Biden is questionable because he spoke at Senator Byrd’s funeral means questioning the liberal lean of those Republican Senators who spoke at the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy?  I would think honoring someone in their official status would be an exemption!

So this FL looks closer to reality right now - with a long f’n way to go, so take no rest.  It means nothing  But when  next survey shows something like this, it’s not as media will tweet “trump slashed Biden 13pt lead” - it’s just shows Q is bad at polling Fla
100 days to Election Day. What are you doing to help elect Joe Biden and other Democrats?
Kelly 3pts ahead of Biden is quite interesting
Vote Biden he won't kill your grandparents or children
I’m a data guy. But I do believe in the notion that some things cannot be quantified.  Biden is likely to win November.  How can I put a number to that?   Sure I can write some code (actually I can’t code worth shit ) - but it’s all somewhat arbitrary.  92. 85. 73?  It’s “Likely”
I’m def starting to fall out of love with election models for this reason. Sure Biden looks really strong now. But we have 100 days to. The potential for shifts is there and the put a hard number on it is realistically impossible. It’s fair to be “likely Biden” but no number
Maybe not, but his party does! Biden won’t run the country if he’s elected....the sociopaths on the far Left will! People like AOC, Cory Booker, Lori Lightfoot, Rashida Tlaib etc.
How do they feel now. I know a few Trump supporters who regret their vote and will vote for Biden bec he seems like a “good person “
Is it worse simply because Biden did it? If Biden had said the Kansas City Chiefs was in Kansas and Trump had called Arizona a city, you’d still be saying that Biden’s error was worse. Please be honest and admit it.
And tweeting that Biden called Arizona a city.... HE HAS TO GO!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Will Biden debate trump? I really want to see him at a podium in front of a hot mic
48 years is nearly 50 years.  Biden has been in politics cheating for 50 years.  Believe nothing from the media or DNC. 50 years to fine tune thieving ways.
Biden a socialist? I wish
I think you could make a good contra argument that once Biden's elected this all goes away.
I just think it’s amazing you won’t shut the fuck up about Obama/Biden but ignore my tweets where I state Trump has mocked disabled, has multiple rage allegations from multiple women(that started WAY before his presidency), and literally does not know basic fucking geography.
Why is this man in my mentions trying to have me decided if Trump or Biden is more mentally competent? They’re both fucking stupid.
Biden and Trump are both equally unfit to be president.
The video Jonathan shared shamed Obama, Hilary, Biden while uplifting Trump and calling people who don’t support him morons and stupid. But then Jonathan wants to cry wolf &amp; say “you’re bashing me for not sharing the same views😂😂”
Lmao so you agree that the under trumps watch when republicans controlled the WH, senate, and house (until 2019)  the national debt has gone up by 7 trillion? The buck has to stop somewhere 🙄 I know it’s hard for y’all to admit but I’m sure y’all will again care when biden wins.
If trump is planning to dump Pence for Nicki as a VP to counter Biden? I think it is possible. Shit, anything is possible with this covidiot in chief.
Universal child allowance should be included in Covid legislation. I am also in favor of UBI but i think The child allowance is more Doable as a first step. If it is not done now, it should be first bill congress passes and Biden signs.
Biden and Clinton
Also, I made a little something to try to express how grateful I am to Biden, you and the wonderful CNN team. I take care of my ill mother &amp; I'm stressed a lot. With all this mess going on, it's nice to listen to calm, truthful voices.
I fucking love Bernie going sicko on Elon  Just REALLY wish he went after Biden on his bullshit like he did to Elon 😐
Some say the same about Trump voters. but I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a president. And for me Trump has none of what I'm looking for. Biden may be lacking as well, but he possesses some of the qualities I like
Again I'm not disagreeing. I'm not saying Trump's brand of racism is worse or better it's simply a different kind of racism than the other presidents had. At any rate he's a big races that needs to go. That goes without saying. A stupid comment by Biden does not change that
None of us buy that Biden  has a 13 point advantage in FL. I am not counting on Trump losing his home state. I hope he does and I will work to help Biden get FL’s vote. Caution — There is NO way Biden is up by 13.
Typed Joe Biden’s assistant
COVID could have an impact on this because there is less events, less times for the Montford/Ausley types to go to the regional fair and remind the locals who they are.  Campaigns will be alot more remote.    So I expect Ausley to outdo Biden but not Montford levels
Yes. Because NO ONE has harmed the country as much as Trump. So even if Biden is mediocre or traditional status quo, it will be a VAST improvement over what we have now. Before we can gain ground, we have to retake the ground that we lost since the beginning of 2017.
I called it about a month ago when asked what could stop Biden from defeating Trump. An alien invasion might just do the trick?
I wouldn't say it's causation per se, but I think a lot of people were pacified by Obama's commitment to the Paris Accord that Biden will go back to. It's not nearly enough. I'm not arguing that Trump is good, just defending the snooze button metaphor OP used for Biden.
The cut to defense wouldn't even have got us back to pre-Trump levels and the dems still rejected it. Is there anyone who still wants to tell me Biden would be better on foreign policy?
stop saying the president is becoming more normal—he has not changed! Why aren’t you interviewing Biden more often?
4/ this is of course ignoring the large, specific problems with Biden the candidate. Arguably, Trump has yet to inflict anything as damaging as the crime bill Biden defends to this day.
1/ We can't treat the Trump presidency as an abbheration, it's part of a continual trend. The tea party rose to prominence in the Obama years directly resulting from George W (who is now pushing a ton of money in Biden's campaign) and that the left had no real representation
Again, I’m not saying don’t gripe that Biden will be taking money from special interests and that will affect health care policy.  Just recognize that where we are is a reflection of who we are.  The politicians don’t get better until we do.
I’m not even sure what your point was.  That Biden doesn’t favor UHC?  That’s not a mystery.  My point is that this is acceptable to most people.  They don’t actually care about UHC, no matter what polls say.
Flamdip- I can also say if only the Dems had taken it seriously. Nancy Pelosi said "come to Chinatown there's nothing wrong" that was in February. Biden himself called the president xenophobe. So stop the BLAME Game!

As a Floridian who’s been in quarantine since March, I suggest that the prospect of death from the Trump-DeathSantis virus is stoking a surge for Biden among the senior electorate. Hear me now, believe me later.
Trump propaganda is funny as hell bro this nigga using violence happening under his presidency saying “this will be the world if you vote Biden” isbwosjshs &amp; ppl actually believe that
can we please fast forward 32x through 2020 to get to Joe Biden’s inauguration? Plz and thx
If Biden and the Democrats we're still as racist as you're trying to make us believe, then you should be supporting them and would be against the Republicans.
Okay, time for Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, et. al. to issue a clear, definitive statement opposing rioting, destruction of property and threats to human lives...and to tell (or even ask, if that’s all the oomph they can muster) the “protestors” to quit and go home.
Most white supremacists HATE Biden . Most white supremacists love Trump. Evidently the white supremacists feel that Trump represents THEIR interests. Otherwise, they'd support Biden  . That's all I need to know.
You pretty much missed my point. People were trying to label Biden as racist and say that Blacks should not vote for him for that reason. I'm simply saying that while not every Trump supporter is a white supremacist, nearly every white supremacist is a Trump supporter
Andrew yang was light years ahead of biden in brain activity. It’s CRIMINAL he’s the nominee and not you.
The first national Biden ad of the year.  It's only going to get worse
Opinion: If #JoeBiden was a Black Bear (video)  #JoeBiden2020
Blake Jones Most preposterous statement of 2020 so far. I've never seen such a misuse of the word "first".
Trump has not done himself any favors among Florida’s nation’s largest senior electorate. Nor has his mini-me DeSantis. Both are willing to write off seniors as collateral damage. This has been unfavorably received and Biden vote totals will so reflect.
👀 Disturbing. Can say I have never seen this nor done this as a nurse ...  Senator Biden ” I had nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would…actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move, to get me moving.”
So he’s saying that he’s expecting Us to wake up with Biden as President? If so, great!
Biden Bros are the best at voter outreach
The snake analogy is faulty. If you believe Biden will be as opposed to civil rights as Trump currently is, i don't know what to say. White supremacist love Trump. Trump defends white supremacist. White supremacist hate Biden.That's enough information to make an informed decision
Biden is a decent man who made some mistakes in the past. Trump's pattern is indecency on so many levels. The positive things he does are the aberrations. One man changed for the better. The other one is as bad as ever. If Biden is half as decent as Obama, we have a winner.
Biden wrote the misguided crime bill true. But Trump advocated the death penalty for some black teenagers that would later proven not guilty. And he still won't admit he was wrong about their guilt.
A man who can never admit he's wrong is dangerous. And since there's no way to make Trump look good, the strategy is to attempt to make Biden look bad. But compared to Biden, Trump will always look and actually be multiple times worse
Biden at his worst was not as racist as Trump IS NOW. And let's not start comparing which of vhas said more insulting things. Trump is the king of insults. And when he says something dumb, instead of admitting it and apologizing, he doubles down on it
We know who Biden is. We know who Trump is. That quote from Biden is old. But the hate we hear from Trump is in the present. So you comparing biden's past with Trump's present. I'm going with Biden
An unenthusiastic vote counts the same as an enthusiastic one. Those who vote for Biden with a frown count just as much as those who hope for him with a smile. So enthusiasm doesn't really matter
GOP death panels-DTs death panels.Texas and DT is still trying to cancel the ACA at the SC. So Texas you still want him as potus&amp;you still want R Senators⁉️ VOTE differently to fix this‼️Vote Biden‼️He’ll Guarantee you have health insurance with no limits on preexesting condtns.
No, Biden wouldn't use federal troops to "dominate" protestors
'He can't relate in any way': Obama and Biden critique Trump in new campaign video
I understand that Biden should not have said what he said. But but there's something different about Trump's racism that defies words. This may sound crazy, but Biden was both completely wrong and completely right at the same time.
This tweet, and the thread, make me think 2 things: 1) VBM "fraud" is one of the biggest self-inflicted wounds ever 2) I'm more confident by the day that Biden wins FL (and by extension, the presidency)
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama stepped up their attacks on President Donald Trump and defended their time in the White House.  #BNC #BlackNewsChannel #Update
Joe Biden calls Trump the first racist president, apparently forgetting the ones who owned slaves - TheBlaze
Welcome to the block list, you loon. Biden has his faults but he’s not a pedophile. Bye now.
In the black community we call this being real....the media is spinning it like we don’t approve. Black people love Biden, we made him the nominee. No Democrat wins the nomination without the black vote. #Biden2020
if Biden wins people will legit leave the country and not just flex like the people who said they would leave when trump won. mark my words and don’t be offended.
Looking for something fun to do Saturday⁉️📣  Join Florida Democrats in the Treasure Coast 🚀 on Saturday to discuss how Joe Biden’s plan to build America back better fits into our community and how you can get involved.
If Biden is following his own Aug. 1 #veepstakes deadline, when do we think it’ll come? I thought something would leak today (there’s still time) and then speculation all weekend and then Monday morning announcement.
Swing state Fla now 51% for  38% for  Biden widens what had been 4% up in April,  says..
The Q poll also has Biden up 51% to Trump 38%....  Other polls have recently showed Biden with a lead - but not that big in Florida...MOE is 3.2 plus or minus.
I believe Biden is ahead in Florida.  I believe - as I have for a long time - that Biden could &amp; would win Florida.  I also believe Quinnipiac is the Blake Bortles of Florida polling.  That’s all folks.  Get back to work.
Biden Says Trump Is Spreading Racism and Dividing America
Did y’all know that Trump is the FIRST racist president this country has ever elected? (According to Joe Biden) We waz STRAIGHT b4 Trump!  This dude (Biden)man!!  I mean, how many presidents on our money today owned slaves tho?
How It Starts   👏👏👏   #Biden #Biden2020 #Trump2020
I have to change the wording for Twitter as I watched it deboosted in front of my eyes. ~ if it weren’t for them. I wouldn’t be President. They did a terrible job!  Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries
To be fair, we reported late last year about the president's personal dislike for adult regulated use. But there are people in the industry who are continuously saying that an XO on the schedule 1 status could win voters who aren't sure about Biden.
An interesting example of LV polling taken already to me is this mornings new St. Pete Poll of Florida. LV model has Biden up 6 which you would expect in an environment like we are in today, no?
Joe Biden has been in politics longer than most Americans have been alive. What accomplishments does he have to show for it?
Repeat these five words — American. Voters. Elect. Biden. Please
Capt. Lysol's legacy.   #Trump #Trump2020 #Biden #Biden2020
Isn’t amazing how you are showing what’s happening now in Trump’s America and saying this would be Biden’s America!!! #VoteBlue
This is what we expected from a Trump America but these images are still shocking. We must elect Biden to have a more tranquil country .
Join me and hundreds of others in signing this letter to Presidential candidate Biden- We need a #NoFirstUse policy to disarm from nuclear weapons!
OK my initial reaction was that the quote was nuts, but the context is important. Biden didn't mean "first racist" -- it's clear from full context he meant first presidential candidate to run on racially divisive issues and get elected. Small, but important, difference.
What? It’s in Biden’s interest for trump to keep talking about this. The more trump portrays Biden as a drooling vegetable, the more Biden can overpeform in the debates. Trump being obsessed with this is great for Biden and he will do nothing to stop trump from talking about it.

The same President who waited until 140k people died now wants to wear a mask after Joe Biden started wearing his. Your  guy flip flop so damn much
We must elect Biden to avert the slippery slope to authoritarian rule. Look at history — this slide happens by steps over the course of years. I am scared of what would happen in a second Trump term. Congress has been shown it is weak to defend us.
Barney, that was just an observation based upon your copy of the Maiden tweet. Nothing gets accomplished here, especially not with name calling. It's just something to argue about. I support the President,  yes,  but that would be based in fear of Biden and associated loons
joe biden said donald trump is the first racist president ... yeah we fucked either way
Oh Lord, Joe! I don't think so! I'll buy "the most blatant", but you don't have to go back any further than Bush to find repressed racism, though I'll concede his may have been altruistic. I have seen fairly open racism in at 4 Presidents in my lifetime
I agree with you about the others. But I think Biden probably had in mind the old school obviously ignorant George Wallace/ Strom Thurmond/Lester Maddox redneck direct appeal form of racism that has folks chanting white power. Those you mentioned try to appear intelligent
Weird post, Boris. This actually is Trump’s America. We’re living in his dystopian version of America. Vote for Biden in November to restore the light.
Joe Biden Tripped Up Badly by Running Mate Question... 'I'm Having a 2-Hour, Uh, Um, Vetting Report'Yet, the real question that ponders us all is:  "Where's Basement Biden?"
You really need to research Biden's History more, it's truly horrible.  You're ignoring the lives he's destroyed in Latin/South America with his love of Regime change.  Look at Honduras for example, or what's going on in Yemen.🤷‍♂️  Crime Bill?  Patriot Act?  NDAA? #NeverBiden
Joe Biden sounds alot like a certain Bloody Socialist Cuban Dictator that murdered over 100,000 Cubans in 58 years of Absolute Power.
Well, for starters it's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands than Trump &amp; has left more destroyed lives in his wake.  The biggest reason I think Biden will be worse is all the "Resistance" will go back to brunch &amp; ignore his evil, just like they did with Obama.
Oh u mean like the witness of Biden rape victim...? I mean that one definitely has witnesses n all democrats by the way... trump in the other hand was always a pretty boy that could have hit anything he wanted... 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Indeed, Biden is absolutely the worst candidate the DNC could have rigged it for, with the possible exception of Bloomberg.  The Democratic Party has been closet Republican for decades.  I don't vote for conservative Warmongering Segregationist sex pests regardless of party.🤷‍♂️
He said in the begining that LatinX votes weren't part of his strategy making it obvious that he has zero intention of doing anything that benefits those of us that fall into that group.  Biden is only going to help his real constituents, which none of us on here are a part of.
The most unprofessional assembly I have witnessed since the Bork hearings chaired by Biden.
The SC isn't the argument for Biden you seem to think it is.. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Projections are that more than 250K small businesses are going under and  want to give then $0 in aid while giving states $1.1 trillion in aid.   This is a microcosm of how Democrats intend to treat businesses in a Joe Biden presidency.
Oh hell no!
Florida supports Joe Biden by 4 points.
Biden attracts 247 people to watch him read from a teleprompter, but he is ahead of the President in the polls? If you believe that I have a bridge for sale.
If by "getting pulled farther left," means Joe Biden wants to make sure everyone has healthcare, and make sure that the Police get more funding, then I guess you are right.
Rasmussen's polls have been proven to be inaccurate over and over again.  Literally 99% of the other polls have your approval rating at least underwater by 8 points.  If you want to talk about polls, how about admitting that 99% of polls have you getting clobbered by Biden?

You always have been and continue to be exhibit number 1, entered into evidence as being the absolute dumbest president in history. You are also exhibit number one in making Biden look like a rocket scientist. Enjoy golf this weekend, it requires zero IQ, perfect for you.
Curious to know Mr. Biden plan.
I'm Joe um er um What? Oh yeah, KJoe Bi Biden and I've forgotten this message
Is screaming “rigged election” 3 1/2 months before even one vote is cast He's admitting “JOE #BIDEN IS GONNA WIN BIG AND HE'S TERRIFIED, DESPERATE AND PANICKED”
Wow! Joe Biden and the DNC are sure starting off on their Campaign Propaganda really early this year.
You just have to worry about the President touching little kids if Biden wins #Trump2020
The difference betweeh Joe Biden and Oprah Winfrey. Oprah was smart to not run for President. Joe Biden will lose, any way.
For those who don't believe me, please see this article.  Biden wants to give $300 million in additional funding to the COPS program, the same program that Trump wanted to cut.
Joe Biden is literally proposing to give police more funding than Trump wants to give them.  So keep purveying your ignorant lies.  It's not working.
should just STFU &amp; let us here from #Fauci about what is really going on.  armed Magats swarmed Fed buildings to open their states &amp; look at them now. When  has 0 answers they blame every1 else? China, Biden, Obama etc. #GOPComplicitTraitors
I think she is too ignorant to be embarrassed. It’s a ludicrous assertion, as anyone with even a rudimentary commitment to facts and knowledge of Biden’s career would know.
Do you think JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SAGE TO SMUDGE THE WHITEHOUSE?? THERE HAS TO BE SOME BAD BAD JUJU
Joe Biden's (Obama) Administration saw the longest continual job growth in history. Yesterday the GDP hit an all-time low.  who do you think you're fooling with your b*******.   don't listen to me listen to Donald.
Anti- Trumpers continually accuse him of criminal conduct absent any proof. They need to look no further than their candidate Biden who is the poster boy off ill-gotten gains.
America, everything we supposedly “hear” from Joe Biden is not coming from Joe Biden.  He is unable to think clearly enough to come up with even a fraction of what we are hearing.  There are other people behind him steering him to do and say what they want. Biden is a front man.
There is a poll indicating 62% of Americans won't reveal who they are voting for..   This statistic alone explains the so-called Biden lead..  How many Dems fear retribution.  Zero  Trumper's don't fear retribution.. they absolutely KNOW there would be retribution
So you're telling me Joe Biden you're worried about his dementia which he doesn't have... Without mentioning Trump's complete batshit crazy behavior bipolar schizophrenic
"We choose truth over facts."  —Joe Biden
a 19 point swing to biden if true.
#letsmakeadeal. From a reliable source. Biden negotiations with trump went well. Biden/Trump Ticket. Joe the first year and Trump has the next 7 years. #SLAMDUNK    Let the mailin ballots commence!
Stop this stupid talk Cher.   You have no clue what BLM is .  You have lived in fantasy land .   Sonny slap you down.  Your not in real world.   You let Biden in and keep this crap your saying up .this will be the end of life as you know it. Lot harder to fall when rich! Venuzala
Obama &amp; Biden have always been about division &amp; racism.
Yeah, because that was a totally unrigged primary...🙄  Better get dialing those suburban moderate Repubs your party is always running to the right after.  You're gonna be them if your party is running Biden.  You gotta replace the indie, prog and youth votes y'all alienated.🤷‍♂️
Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  Quite an improvement over the day he had 19 people watch his event. That was the day that President Trump raised $20 million online.
Im worried about the  election. People will decide that there will be lots to vote for Biden, so they won't vote at all. Everyone who can, plan to vote.
Sure seems to be a lot of real conservatives coming out against Trump.  When I heard that George Will would be voting for Joe Biden I thought I had stepped into bizarro land. Another prominent conservative ws calling for impeachment because of the change election day tweet by djt
If Biden doesn’t win, you fucks at the  will have to file bankruptcy.
Just look at this creep.... Tell me he isn't eye balling this young girl. JOE BIDEN WAS KNOWN IN THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN CIRCLE AS  "PEDO JOE"
Like butter.  The Brits are following the polls and making lunch money bets on Biden. The real money accounts, fresh off scraping the table of the Remainer's rent money, and most of the Yanks (including me) are taking the odds... hard
Where's Basement Biden?
Joe Biden doesn't need to Tweet . When hes President he really won't have the Time. I only wish a Representative of his keeps the feed alive.
Becuase Joe Biden is a child sniffer
Think about Susan Rice. I did like Warren for President though. Biden needs to go with smart strong experienced color.
Interesting who's the authoritarian...Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists  via
Vote for Biden to save our country #DumpTrump #lovetrumpshate
Trump claims that the 2020 election is “rigged,” hours before he claims he will win the election “big.”  Doesn’t that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.

Keep fooling yourself, your epic failure continues. Just keep doing what you're doing, it's helping Biden. #TrumpIsARacist
Biden is a mess.
I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn’t aged well.
This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
My account havked by the Biden’s, just saying. Trump 2021.
Joe Biden is our Abraham Lincoln and then the second Civil War Jefferson Davis is in the White House... Trump is Jefferson Davis, the ""house that Jeff built"" is also Trump Tower.  In America Up Is down, left is right, and everybody right-wing Confederacy down the rabbit hole ..
We became China the moment Democrats sold America out. Its clear with Hunter Biden's 1.5B deal with the Chi-Coms, Dems became beholden to the Communist regime. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
It's because they have no other rebuttal for choosing such a problematic candidate like Biden...  They are such shallow, two dimensional thinkers. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
You sound hysterical. Get that TDS treated.🤔  There's an argument to be made that Biden isn't even the lesser evil, that's how low your party has sunk.  Might want to hit up your Superdelegates to use their power for good for a change &amp; for what it was intended. #ReplaceBiden
Yes, I’m sure Joe Biden does have a ton of Chinese bots deceiving you into believing a false popularity.  Which is also similar to the election.
As expected...🙄  Same response I get when I ask #JoeBots to name Progressive policies that Biden has championed during his 50+ years as a Democrat...
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.🤷‍♂️  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won’t concede.
Biden right Turley a traitor,  your all going down.
In April, Biden said, “I think Trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.”  Trump's campaign called his comments "incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate"  Today Trump suggested we delay the election
Lmao Scott finds one poll that has Biden with a double digit lead and he praises it like it’s gospel. He must be embarrassed.
The President of the United States, really just said, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote"  Remember when Joe Biden said he believes Trump will try and delay the election and Republicans attacked him for it?
You got to ask yourself this question. Why the hell would project Veritas put out a video like this? I think it's some kind of a setup.
LOL. Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. You're one of my Representatives here in Florida? no wonder we are fucked.
Joe Biden is the poster boy for term limits. A record of more than four decades of service that is devoid of accomplishment yet boasts anti desegregation rhetoric.
I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for “low-income housing.”  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
According to Gallup Americans think if you contract covid there's a 9% chance you will die..  Gallup also says that Biden is leading in the polls  Is that a function of how ignorant we are or a function of our media leading us over a cliff.. like lemmings.
There’s disgruntled people everywhere. It wasn’t Biden. His note said “doesn’t hold grudges”. Which tells me he’ll make the choice. Don’t forget he’s got some pretty impressive advisors. The guy that used to be his boss. Have faith.
Did the media EVER make any attempt to root out the Biden corruption..?
Gallup has a poll that finds Americans think 9% of people will die if they contract Covid..  Is it any wonder Gallup shows Biden ahead in the polls..?
LMAO. If you think Joe Biden is a socialist you are dumber than I thought. Democrat or not Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. Please to avoid embarrassing yourself further don't use words that end in -ist or -ism.
LMAO he CANNOT complete sentences better than trump. Go watch for yourself. Trump will dominate Joe just like he did to Clinton in head to head. Joe Biden has also been seen biting little girls hair. He asked a 9 year old girl if she was 18. Give it up.
I didn't say Trump was good, I said Biden is shit.  He absolutely has more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does though, so there's that...🤷‍♂️ .#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Lol, you're one to be taken seriously. 🙄  RussiaGate is Q-Anon for Centrists...😅  You also apparently don't know Biden's History very well. 🤷‍♂️
You're making my point, of course Biden appeals to conservatives, because he is one.🤷‍♂️
Yes Biden and Rice
Biden is a senile old fool.
Again...I don’t often agree with Biden (or Trump) &amp; we may have varying visions of what succes ahead looks like...but this is still true! Many will tell you we are doomed specifically BECAUSE of our “heart” &amp; history. Ignore them.
#NobodyLikesTrump This thread was developed by malcontent Biden losers. Biden, a mentally deficient man, is an embarrassment. It is hundreds of times worse to know that there are really stupid people that would vote for him.
i live in florida (a MASSIVE swing state) so im 100% voting for biden tbh
It has to be Harris; Rice is obviously qualified, but she has no constituency. Warren's constituency knows she's out &amp; are voting for Biden. Aabrams &amp; Duckworth would be fine choices, but again, Biden would be trading a guaranteed bloc of voters, demographically diverse for...
More racism from our Putin puppet. Biden will fix this ridiculous move of yours when we throw your a$$ out in November. You killed Americans with your negligence in dealing with the pandemic, you allow Putin to kill our troops, you are a racist and expect to be re-elected? Nope!
Well anyone who's Biden pick as VP will become president. Somehow in this case ambition is irrelevent. Unless they want a weak president who would be nothing more than a figure head.
There goes Texas, Pennsyvania...
Texas loves Biden!
Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.
biden too
Name one thing he has done to help Veterans.....and don’t say choice cause that was in place by Obama/Biden
We might be, but Biden sure isn't.  He still thinks the Devil's Lettuce is a gateway drug...🤦‍♂️  Well, at least that's his public position, the real reason is that his pharma backers don't want people to have access to a medication they can provide for themselves for free. 🤔
Who would you rather see as Joe Biden’s running mate?
Biden stated that “the police have become the enemy.” No wonder they all pulled out of the DNC
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don’t lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president “sugar”. He’s not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won’t admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he’s put MANY minorities in Jail!
In some ways he's worse.  It's undisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.😖  The Democratic Party has become a mockery of everything it's ever claimed to stand for.  I'm #DoneWithDems.
My man, they're dragging Biden around by the arm like he's Ray Charles in a crowded mall, I'm pretty sure incontinence has made an appearance and he cant make a sentence.   What are you doing?
Texas is still a “Red State,” but the people of Texas also know a crook when they see him.  Joe Biden may not be as Red as they prefer, but he’s a good, honest, hard working man who cares about all of the people in Texas.  That’s why Biden will win Texas.
The Great State of Texas supports Joe Biden.
Biden and Obama tried to do this but Republicans called it “Socialist price controls.”  Nancy Pelosi tried again in 2019 and McConnell blocked the attempt.
Keep talking. You’re Biden’s best reason for voting for him. Keep on talking.
Trump’s just mad because Joe Biden took press questions and Fox News covered it.  BTW Biden looked awesome!
Not right now.  It would be too much of a distraction.  We need to concentrate all of our attention on the election of Joe Biden.
Great point! Ethics of sharing that w Biden an issue?
Watching Biden’s performance at his “news conference “ yesterday reminded of a movie.  Peter Sellers as Chauncy Gardener in “Being There”. Character had no intelligence jusr like Biden. He couldn’t call reporter with answer on teleprompter. Idiot
Great TShirt idea. "If you vote for Biden, you ain't a cop!"
Biden and the Democrats will pander to anyone for a vote, but this is beyond frightening for Capitalism and American freedoms.
You are aware that VP Biden has never been “president” so your prognosis is very inaccurate.
Donald Trump was all ready to campaign against Bernie Sanders with his bogus attacks of “socialism” and “radical left.”  Then Joe Biden won and now he still thinks that his strategy can work.  Biden has been in office for 40 years. We all know he’s not “radical.”
Joe Biden won the Primary.  He is far from being “Radical.”  If anything you are the “radical” one.
I don't even think that's a given.  When they can't hide Biden in his basement anymore and he actually has to debate and give long form interviews his cognitive decline will be impossible to hide anymore. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Your TDS is showing.  Biden isn't the lesser evil...🤷‍♂️ #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden  2020. SW Flor
So biden answer questions today but if you noticed it was pre meditated he read off a paper of what reporters to call on completely set up pre-planned questions and answers did anybody else realize that Trump doesn't read off a list for what reporters to call on. Complete sham
14 weeks. We'll have 14 weeks of Joe Biden
Never seen anything like it. They attacked Barr like rabid dogs; they never let him answer or respond, they insulted him, called him names; pathetic human behavior, by Democrats. We saw evil today; we saw &amp; heard raw racism, we saw our future if Biden is elected.  God help us...
The fact that you think Biden is far left outs you as an incredibly low info voter.😅  Go read a book Sunshine...🤦‍♂️
If you took every time Joe Biden misspoke his entire life, it would not even equal a single Donald Trump press conference. We are supposed to applaud Trump when he lifts a bottle to his lips and can repeat 5 words.
As for the worse?  There's a strong argument to be made that Trump is in fact the lesser of the two evils.  It's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.🤔#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
I don't remember supporting Jordan, but I do support Barr's protecting federal property. I think the media is a disgraceful and dishonest bunch (both sides).  Biden is in early onset dementia in my view. Thanks for responding  Anyway, without snark, enjoy the football games!
I don't know why #ShitLibs can't figure out why we won't vote for their candidate.  They'd lose their minds if a generic Repub was running with Biden's record.  #JoeBots are low info, VBNMW cultists that only think what they are programmed to.😖  #BlueMAGA or Red?  I'll pass.
So very true.. Trump likes grown women. Pedophile Obiden likes little girls and children....
He's destroyed so many lives at home &amp; abroad between his Warmongering love of Regime change &amp; his authoritarian, racist crime bill alone.  Biden is hot garbage in a restaurant dumpster during the second month of a sanitation workers strike.  In August.  He'd stink on ice...🤮
I do not. In fact I go out of my way to have flag on dashboard &amp; display Biden bumper stickers, I wear flag scarf at luncheons &amp; use small flag on table for group lunch.  I have been approached re flags meaning. Always say it’s a good identifier of American citizens.
A vote for Biden gets you the AFFH.  What is the AFFH, you ask?  LISTEN TO THIS!!  Stanley Kurtz on Democrats' push for a fundamental transformation of America's suburbs |
Wow a #Biden deadhead #Absurd af
When Biden picks Kamala as his VP, we’d better get #KamalaIsACop trending again.
Which, actually, is like a modern day share cropping proposition by a Bigoted Joe Biden and his Democrat Plantation.  Remember this November folks.  Don't vote for Racist DemoKKKrats.
Starting to see Biden commercials here in SW Florida. They are positive and I find it refreshing after hearing Trump’s ugly, lying negative ones.
If Biden wins the Presidency, I would demand that each vote be investigated for fraudulent voters. It is a fact that many of the 42 million non citizens, many illegal, are registered to vote and many will break the law and vote. Voting is reserved for citizens only.
Biden has the questions before the press conference
Yet, Delusional Dems &amp; the Fake News Mainstream Media fails to question Basement Biden on his acts of corruption.
Biden knew the questions before getting them!
Is it me or is Joe Biden in a 7 second delay and in an alternate universe?
My money is on Biden knew the questions today!!!!!
So Biden is now saying we need to stop sending ourjobs out if thecountry. It is a great idea. However President Trump has been doing the job of bringing back our jobs since day 1. Biden is too busy plagiarising Trump’s ideas to know what he should do
Since neither party will give any of them any support now is the best time to help get a 3rd party to 15%.  I'm not voting for the lesser of two sex pest conservatives.  Biden is hot garbage and so is your party.  If you have to silence the truth to win you don't deserve to. 🤔🤷‍♂️
As I understand it, hearing was delayed an hour Because of Nadler’s accident. It was supposed to be over at 2 PM ET, and Biden’s talk was scheduled accordingly.
Bunker Biden, laying low.
Val Demings appears to be a solid pick for Biden's VP role in this hearing. Her comments around police are woke enough to appease AntiFa and moderate enough to appease real Democrats.
Lets see, Comey lied, McCabe lied, Brennan lied, Clapper lied, Strzok lied. Obama lied. Biden lied. Susan Rice lied...the whole Administration lied...NOT a single 1001 violation charged. 🤔🤔🤔 WHY???
Another campaign slogan for Joe Biden, Vote for me or you will be killed
Just saw a Joe Biden commercial I know that he can’t talk that smooth what a faker
Joe Biden's new campaign slogan,  Vote for me or we will burn your city down.
Trump could have saved the lives of hundreds of Texans while also taking action to make sure their economy would thrive.  Instead he chose to ignore the spread of COVID, leading to mass death and economic turmoil. Texas loves Joe Biden!  #TrumpKillsTexas
He's  too Bernie,  I agree with him on Trump.  Don't like his views on Biden.
Complain about Biden and the Democrats on Twitter.
Not given a chance to put HER facts out? You mean MORE LIES. Face it, Obama/Biden are CORRUPT TO THE CORE! They spied and got caught. They MUST be charged with TREASON!
I mean I'm no Bernie Sanders supporter but I think he's not senile.. and not corrupt.  He's totally wrong.. but I think he means what he says and believes it..  Biden on the other hand is just a whore.. doing or saying anything to get elected.
I'm absolutely serious. Is there even one good reason to vote for Biden?  One?..  Help me here. I really don't get it.
Biden will never face Trump. His campaign will keep him hidden away allowing him out in only the most scripted and friendly environments. Now the VP pick will go toe to toe with Trump. She will be destroyed but at least her cognitive faculties will not be in question. #Trump2020
Imagine if President Trump started to talk and act like Biden. Would the MSM and the Dems demand that the 25th amendment be in play?
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'
Did you check with Biden to see if you are? 🤔 #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden rallied votes for it under they pretext only to later admit he knew it was bogus from the start.  That's what you're owning a little piece of with your vote.🙄  The man is a soulless, evil Ghoul...😖 #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden still supports Fracking, TPP, and throwing people in cages over a plant and is already Sabre rattling over Venezuela.🤦‍♂️  I'm not owning the small piece of those actions that my vote would represent. #NoMore will I let the DNC hold the Lesser evil gun to my head. #NeverBiden

VOTE FOR BIDEN - he will make America great again!
Joe Biden can’t even speak coherently, much less tweet anything.  Who tweets for Biden??!!
When will Biden speak about being a criminal suspect in the Ukraine?
Since when is it good bragging about being a fossil?! Not to mention Trump has done more in less than four years than those 8 POTUS combined, all of whom dirty Joe Biden says he knew “intimately.” Biden cannot even speak coherently.  Wake up America.
BLM donations go to Act Blue which gives the money to dem campaigns including Biden. It is on their websites.
Fair enough, tho I'm not convinced it was Team Biden, it strikes me as Dodd &amp; the shitheels at Politico stirring the pot. Still, I'm waiting to see what Joe does about it, officially. We absolutely do not need campaign surrogates going off on their own stick like this...
Karen Bass will not be Biden’s runningmate.  Take it to the bank.
same for biden with african americans**
he won latinos in texas by more than 15% in a fractured feild. he was clearly the candidate they perfered, something that would drastically improve his chances at winning the state on a general election. it’s the same for biden in a state like georgia, for example.
yet biden “won”
The  unafraid to pick  as his VP is also the Biden who would be my first choice, which is why I know he won’t do it. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Anyone think Biden Dies ironically in October ?

Biden still wants everyone to feel like victim. What a liar!
Focus your unsought, inadequate advice elsewhere. I donate monthly to Biden &amp; 13 other candidates. Progress &amp; change can happen rapidly, in steps, or not at all. Temper your idealism with some realism. Democracy implies compromise &amp; shd be as inclusive as possible. #DontBeAMaga

So you will be going with the baby killing, mob rule, anarchist Joe Biden and his ANTI-CHRISTIAN party that allows RIOTS, ANARCHY but not CHURCH.  Great REV you are.
My interpretation was give in to the narrative that Dems &amp; GOP/ Magas &amp; Biden supporters are the same. Telling liberals not to vote for Biden is Trump-affirming &amp; as regressive as it gets.
I’m asking Ryan as respectfully as I know how. I haven’t forgotten his inspiring effort to remove Trump &amp; GOP from office, prior to Biden winning S.Carolina. Now that no longer matters.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
I like the idea of Medicare for All.  Also think Biden’s plan below is excellent &amp; more appealing to a majority of Americans. Also more  progressive than any ideas I’ve seen from you for months now.  I miss the Blue no matter who Ryan.
Ryan, will you please tell us specifically what’s problematic about Biden’s environmental plan? He has moved considerably left in order to be more inclusive for ALL liberals on the spectrum.
Do you even know what you're becoming part owner of by voting Biden?🤦‍♂️  Do you have any principles that you won't sacrifice on the altar of political expediency? #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Trump defines suburban women as “housewives.”  Just Biden defines them as equals to men.  That’s why we support Joe Biden.
Then you may want to start lobbying your super Delegates to use their power for good for a change at the convention.  Biden &amp; the DNC are dividing your party. 🤷‍♂️ #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15

Anti-Biden Ad Misleads on Race Claims #NorthCarolina #TrumpLies #NCarolinaVoteBlue2020  via
My personal opinion is that Joe Biden needs to get out on social media much more whether it's having a town hall on MSNBC or NBC or any of the channels and to reach out more to the Latino and black communities they are waiting to hear from him. This is how we have to do it¡
Lol Joe Biden doesn't have anything to do with the protests. Most of the protesters don't even want to vote for him. These protests are literally Trump's protests. Righties love to say that this is what it'll be like under Biden, but it's literally like that now under Trump??
Well apparently his visual acuity is right up there with Biden's mental acuity.
America is safer with Biden in the basement. He is just another  empty suit that the Dems can control. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism.
And still, where's Basement Biden?
Remember when Trump was campaigning for Bernie Sanders to beat Joe Biden so that he could incorrectly claim that Democrats are "Socialists?"  He failed, but that doesn't mean he won't gaslight Americans into believing that Joe Biden is the Trojan Horse Candidate for Socialism.
Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash author, has a new book,  "Fallout".  This book describes the corruption of Biden, Obama, Clinton with Russia and China. Claims Biden is even more corrupt than Clinton .  Remember, Dems always accuse you of that which they are guilty of

Yeah you sure don't want make it a Trump or Biden choice. Trouble for you is that is the election we have and sooner or later Biden is going to have to prove he can be president.
Liz Peek: Biden-Democrat sweep in November would destroy country. Here's their plan
What gets lost in all of this analysis is that neither Biden or Democrats are fit to govern.  You trusted Pelosi and the Demicrats in 2018.. and look what happened.
If you think voting for Biden will bring back your father's Democrat party.. think again.  They have crossed over to the dark side..Campaigning for Biden! #Biden2020
Wow i think that was Biden.  If Biden knows the answers why did he not do anything in decades?  As per Kamala Harris he was against bussing, he put the crime bill forward, he adored Robert Byrd his mentor which founded the KKK.  Biden sucks.
Friends of Biden are taking shots at her because she took shots at him. There is no love loss there - this is a ticket being pushed by the party not the nominee.
Gonna be wild when Biden picks Hillary as VP and this site self destructs...
Yeah just like last time CLinton ahead in the polls, She is not in White House so drop that mike!!!!  PS how to think Brain dead Biden will be in a room with China or russia?? They will eat his lunch he cant hide in basement when it comes to national security.
These Army Veterans Plan to Vote for Joe Biden. Here’s Why. ⁦ ⁦⁦ ⁦ ⁦
It looks like Kamala Harris is at Joe Biden’s top of mind… and possibly the top of his VP short list?!?! Kamala is gaining some traction in the Vice Presidential race -- political pundits are betting on her to be the ticket to Joe’s success. It’s RACISM and SEXISIM
You compare the US to other countries, or when asked a question, you deflect by saying, “In other countries....” You are the President of the United States, but hopefully, come Jan 2021, Joe Biden will be President and I won’t have to listen to your deflections anymore!
My bigger concern about Warren is what happens to her Senate seat if Biden wins. MA has a GOP governor and seems highly likely he would appoint another Republican to fill Warrens seat if she became VP and if Dems take the Senate back this year, it's not going to be a huge margin.
Joe Biden is anything but an appeaser. Now, let’s talk about people who can’t say no to you...
Honestly, my bigger concern about Warren as VP is her empty Senate seat if Biden wins. Massachusetts has a Republican governor and you know he'll appoint a Republican to fill her vacancy and if the Dems retake the majority this year, it's not going to be a huge majority.
These Fox Hosts are eating their words now...   Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
I live in Tampa and everybody I know and work with hate him! I constantly see cars with Biden stickers and black lives matter signs. That bastard is hated here in Tampa.
Did I miss something? Is California in play for the repubs now? Why would Bass being more popular in California matter? Harris is the only real nationally known and respected option. God I hope Biden and the Dems don’t fuck this up. Pick Harris and move forward!
It it true that Biden is not including Stacey Abrams to be his VP running mate because of ??? What's that about???
A rock could beat Biden!
You mentioned Daniel Cameron and his hesitancy to press charges while also pointing out his support of Trump but it's not Cameron's job to do so. It is the district attorney's role. The district attorney is a Democrat and a Biden supporter. I was making a similar observation.
if Kamala Harris had not been loyal to the #LGBTQ community when it was politically popular, we would have had to wait even longer to get married in California. she is loyal even when it doesn't help her politically.  if anyone understands that, my guess is it would be Joe Biden.
If Rep. Val Demings isn’t picked as Joe Biden’srunning mate then we definitely need her to run against the idiot DeSantis in 2022.
Yes BIDEN 2020 Vote Blue all the way
I don't think that was ever really an option since Biden is being cast in the role of being a functional and rational adult and sped up VP process would have run against that narrative whatever else the merits might have been.
Trump is his buddy. Biden is his friend. The only candidate who won't block a prosecutor from bringing him down is
I personally don't care if Harris is not the VP selection. Just like you are surrounded by people you can work with to accomplish your goals, Biden has a right to select a WOMAN as he promised. It is people like you who want to change the VP requirements after such a promise.
I would rather be spending my time campaigning for #BidenHarris2020 than I would trying to split my time talking about Joe Biden and the vice presidential race. It's becoming tiresome, Joe.
We don’t care how we have to do it..WE ARE VOTING. TRUMP MUST GO....   BIDEN WILL WIN.
And Biden just woke up in his basement . Wondering if he is going outside today and maybe take a question . Na maybe tomorrow. Just put out a statement that you don’t like Trump , day is done.

Nope.  Joe Biden election night will be a repeat of Hillary Clinton Election night 2016.  🤣🤣🤣
I have to to what end is the public mudslinging actually useful to the process since is Biden even reading newspapers right now?
Sounds like Biden’s entire campaign
What if Michelle and Hillary ARE the switcheroo they're planning to unveil at the DNC?  BUT... all of this Epstein stuff comes out now, as well as the Crossfire Hurricane declas..  It's not a "political attack" because they aren't running yet.   They will be STUCK with Joe Biden.
The same Democrats that did everything in their power to make everyone forget Biden's accusations and make it as the victim(s) were lying?
That is why I will be voting in person, for Biden.

You are quite wrong in many ways. Joseph Biden is an American citizen, and the American citizens are the people who hold Donald Trump accountable. You and I can pick up our phones and demand that our representatives and senators do XY or Z. Biden can do the same.
Nothing on this list ... that I can recall; in fact what OBAMA/BIDEN Administration accomplished, Republicans have undertaken amazing efforts to dismantle, undo and unravel nearly everything‼️ Today, we are economically in middle of 1930’s GREAT DEPRESSION &amp; 2008 GREAT RECESSION.

the Biden regime will deliver more conservative policy and more austerity than Trump
According to the RCP average, Biden is up by 6 in Florida. Maybe, MAYBE with that kind of performance, Dems could take control of the Florida House. That would be a big deal, not only for redistricting, but just for the kind of stuff that only matters if you live in Florida.

I think having never held elected office will hurt her chances. But I also don't think that Biden has actually chosen yet. Which means Kamala is still in the running.
I don't understand why Elizabeth Warren isn't the leading contender for the VP spot. No offense to those in contention but Karen Bass? I mean she's great in her own right but is she going to draw in voters who weren't already on Team Biden?
Biden is a stodgy old white guy - and that’s fine. Old voters like that I guess.   He could use some style to this campaign!!!
Don't forget Joe Biden's 1994 Crime Bill which has incarcerated more black Americans than any other legislation EVER.
Guess he's hiden with Biden. Laying low with Joe.
thanks to the old ass trashy white men claiming to support Joe Biden who keep inserting racism and or misogyny at every point in the process these days, at least we know Kamala can weather any GOP criticisms of her.

Your "hot mic" example did not catch Biden saying one single inappropriate, or sexually suggestive, thing.  Every single point noted about body language is accounted for by the generation gap and by the young girl's sense of bodily autonomy being invaded.
Thread. Biden's team better wake the hell up. They are seriously dropping the ball.
Yes, really.  I'm voting for Joe because Elizabeth Warren (who I voted for in the Primary) did not gain enough support, and because Kamala Harris was out of the race, very early on.  Biden is a fossil of an era where men felt comfortable imposing themselves on women and girls.
Democrats will continue this atrocity until Joe Biden wins which he won't they also.want ppl to vote through mail in votes bc it will be a disaster &amp; room for fraud in high numbers its already happening &amp; its the only way the can cheat so Joe Biden could win &amp; we can't.allow that
Agreed. This is making Biden look weak and petty.
These old white men need to shut their traps on Biden's VP search. These leaks and attacks on Harris make Biden look weak and not in control.
No one listens to Ed Rendell. Not for a long time. I sure hope Biden doesn't.
I don’t care who thinks what and you shouldn’t either. Joe Biden ***will not win*** with anyone but  ESPECIALLY if he needs to introduce the world to one of his fringe picks. This is silly.

He does seem to be extremely worried, yes. For someone to behave like that at a supposed friends funeral, he has to be extremely worried about something and I imagine he knows Biden is going to lose the election.
Stop it. Tell your people why they should stick with 45. Biden has the advatntage that he has a heart, can appoint qualified people and isn't seeking the presidency to stay out of jail or to enrich his family. #enoughisenough

Some time in 2021.                                 NORAD: “Mr President, this is General O’Shaughnessy at the NORAD Command Center. We have a situation sir!” President Biden: “Who?”  #Trump2020 #MAGA #BidensAmerica
What’s evident is all of her detractors have vendetta’s or have skeletons that make them person’s of interest. They fear her. America needs someone with upstanding character and moral fiber that strikes fear cause let’s be frank, Biden really doesn’t. These are unusual times.
Silver alert, someone tell Joe Biden where he is...
Trump is going to do anything he can because he knows he will LOSE against Mr. Biden. The entire country knows trump does not like to lose and so he is going to do anything he can The BS about Mail in voting is sick. Trump himself says Absentee Voting is good (Same thing Mail in)
Biden has already shown he’s tougher on China than trump. In January, Biden called for us to be tough on China &amp; demand transparency from Xi on coronavirus...at the same time trump was (checks notes) doing nothing but calling it a hoax &amp; praising Xi for doing a great job.
No one thinks Biden is the best candidate but at least he would surround himself with good people not like the goons that drape them selves around the president. Aren’t a lot of them in prison now?
if her colleagues didn't like her, then why did Kamala Harris have more total endorsements than anyone but Joe Biden in the primaries even after she dropped out?  more foolishness from some foolish washed up clowns.
I can tell you in St. Pete, FL we still have an over abundance of upper middle class white women supporting the Fuckopotamus Orange Shitgibbon.   🤬🤬🤬 We must vote this Nov like Biden is behind, we cannot assume victory! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I laughed so hard I peed my pants Biden can't do anything he is a puppet. It is the left in the party that is running the show. The minute Biden is elected the VP whoever it will be will take over you know it and so does everyone else
Please keep pounding the all of your points, we are all going crazy, kid transmission, mask, no mask, goggles, riots, reverse law enforcement, my God, the country is upside down, Biden, left extremists, I take back my time, Obama grandstanding..
They can’t both be perverts? Stop defending one piece of shit and calling out the other just because he’s a Republican. Biden isn’t any different than Trump.
"An energetic and courageous leader, Harris deserves the support of HispanicLA and the Latino community in the United States at this crucial moment in history. We urge  to choose  as his running mate."

That’s only one victim out of the hundreds
Does anyone actually believe that Joe Biden has the remaining cognitive function to make decisions of import or are they just pretending to think this because OrangeManBad?
Calm down? Everyone’s been justifying trumps rape case, nah keep fucking on
No. Not in the slightest bit the same scale.  At no time has Biden ever hinted at sexual impropriety with an underaged person.  By *extreme* contrast:
Didn’t see that coming!He’ll Slick Willy his way out of it and, if Biden’s elected, all these investigations will go away.
You obviously didn’t watch the last election where Killary was to win my a landslide. Biden has no chance so be prepared for another 4 years of greatness
So you want someone that is in cognitive decline? Biden can even put together a sentence and you think he can run the country? Trump will easily win the 2020 election!!
Last I checked.  We weren’t close to 15M unemployed on Biden’s watch.  With a million people filing for unemployment weekly.  I’m looking forward to you serving me appetizers at the local eatery when Trump loses in November, Ronna.
these clowns are easily beatable for such a (relatively) little amount of money that all it would take is a few ads to create some national buzz around these races to sweep a whole ass red state and help Joe Biden &amp; Steve Bullock.
I guess it’s magical thinking to wish for this man as Chief Justice of SCOTUS?
That would be Biden
I already have.  Investigate Bill.  If fucker is guilty throw em in jail.  If anyone knew and didn't report it? Throw em in jail
Donald Trump lies.  He’s a liar.   The Republican Party is lying.  It’s all they have left.   Biden speaks to a child here.
Where is this video from?
If I were Biden, I'd pay for a thirty second ad of just that screenshot on the screen, uninterrupted, for the entirety of the ad.
Agree 100%....VOTE FOR BIDEN...TO SAVE AMERICA

Come on my republican friends !!  DEBATE, DEBATE!  NOW👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Biden does not have a snowballs chance in Hell👏👏👏👏👏👏
Media is remarkably uninterested in Biden's support for segregationists and his eulogizing KKK Exalted Cyclops.
That’s what Biden said. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello, Chris Matthews, I miss you very much. I agree with your choices for President &amp; Vice President. Barack will make all the difference in the World, campaigning for Biden.
What was it you were saying about Biden being wrong about tRump delaying election?  Guess you don't know the  after all.
I want a debate ASAP between President Trump and Biden! It would be epic. Biden is scared of Trump and knows he will get his head handed to him💥👨🏻‍🍳🙂
Apologies, a bit defensive from all the trump nut swingers going after me. I don't think Biden is literate in pretty much anything but I haven't seen him make any egregious statements (so far) with regards to the virus... but I also don't watch the news
Joe Biden will never win in Ohio.   Trump 2024.  End of story.  #MAGA
I still predict Biden chooses a RINO for VP.  Mitt Romney’s son also reaped the benefits of that sweet corrupt Burisma $$   Paul Ryan worked on the inside to help cover up and squash investigations   The list goes on and on plenty of fake republicans to choose from to seem legit.
She would be a disaster as VP if Biden is elected.  Vote Trump and a red ticket all the way!
It wAs working out well until China sent their damn virus to our shores.  Fact is this those swamp creatures in Congress hate Trump because he doesn’t bow down to their demands.  Joe Biden will kiss China’s ass and all of our jobs will again go overseas.
. blasts  for coming to #Tampa today to fundraise instead of dealing with coronavirus
We knew what to do in March. Biden warned of this in JANUARY. A coordinated, federal response with a POTUS not downplaying the virus, calling it the Democrats new hoax, pushing stupid anti-malarial drugs, could have saved lives and jobs. Yet here we are.
Save it from what? Hasn’t he been in office this whole time? I mean the guy shows footage of total chaos from current America under Trump and blames Biden who is somehow doing this by hiding... I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.
Kamala want be the Biden's nominee
I wish you hadn’t added the quote from an “anonymous source” talking shit about Biden. If they don’t have the cojones to own it, why give them a voice?
You mean the #WuhanVirus #ChinaVirus #CCPVirus Has robbed us since it was #ChinaLiedPeopleDied  if you support Biden you’re a pedophile!!!
The problem is that nobody but the MSM and Democrat don't pay attention to his tweets anymore. We only pay attention to what he does in comparison to what Bernie Sanders wants cuz we all know that Joe Biden is his puppet
I know there's talk about the trump campaign continuing to seek foreign assistance &amp; an Oct surprise, but I can't imagine what they could say about Biden at this point that could be worse than what we know about trump. Does anyone even still have the capacity to be surprised?
Lol know your facts and history the virus 🦠 originated in Wuhan China 🇨🇳 so it should be known as #WuhanVirus or #ChinaVirus or #CCPVirus or #KungFuFlu but don’t let history or facts corrupt your narrative. Oh and if you support Biden you are a PEDOPHILE!!!!
Joe Biden didn't just warn us about all of this in his January USA Today Op-Ed. He warned us in OCTOBER.
Media Accidentally Reveals Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s VP  FROM WORST TO WORST, WAKE UP AMERICA. YOU REALLY WANT KAMALA AS YOUR PRESIDENT?????
I wonder if Hunter Biden is hanging out in China with his employer?
Biden lost his keys he’s still looking
So- since Biden is clearly in a state of mental decline- and you know it- WHO exactly are you voting for???
So was Biden floating a dangerous conspiracy theory? Will you address that please.
In Florida, Joe Biden is reaching polling heights Hillary Clinton never did
In Florida, Joe Biden is reaching polling heights Hillary Clinton never did
I'll wait for as long as it takes to count every damn ballot to make sure Biden is the winner &amp; you get taken away in handcuffs you sick old, delusional, manchild! #RidenWithBiden2020  #BlueWave2020  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Joe Biden is the only person the Democratic Party could get to do run for President.
You just described Biden and his regressive plans and higher tax policies and his trade policies will make America energy dependent again Yep vote for senile sleepy Joe and America and Americans are doomed
Dems have already been caught tampering with and throwing away and changing ballots and votes How come you do not know? Did you hide in your basement like senile Asthma patient lying politician Sleepy Biden?
Mind Blowing how anyone would want Biden and BLM groups  So much hate and anger 😡 You can dislike President Trump's personality ....but he has gotten more done at the sametime the Democratic party has been trying to drag him down . Trump won't crack ,he puts America 1st
Who would vote for hiding face mask wearing with Asthma and sleepy memory problems Old Joe Biden? He wants all the lefty crazy regressive policies 🤮🤮🤮
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
I have never identified as an "anarchist," but if Biden is joining in  calling for the arrest of anarchists in a context where anarchist political philosophy is equated with antifascism, then yeah, as far as Biden is concerned, sure, I'm an "anarchist." Define the term
Is it me or does Joe Biden sound much more authoritative than “The Donald”?
has delivered a better thing then you. Who ever responds to this will receive a Zoom call by me so I can thank you for contributing to Trump. I can just hear Biden crying and losing. He doesn't deserve the job as POTUS and Dr. Jill, no way, Jose will you ever serve as my
In a recent interview, President Trump said "I've been busy being the servant of our nation not to mention Zoom, I love it it's incredible to communicate with my Cabinet. I believe Trump has fought against this jackass, Joe Biden. Biden needs to wake up and face realty.
Republican nominee Donald J. Trump seems like he deserves a second term. I said I was Team Biden, WRONG! I am Team Trump 100%.  your father has fought long and hard and I am personally endorsing your father as of July 31, 2020  1:49 AM.
Listen Im never going to vote for Trump, EVER! But Im not voting for Biden either rn. Im looking for any reason, and I mean ANY reason, to give Biden a chance for my vote. But if he literally cannot concede on any progressive issue.. Then I cannot concede my vote to him either.
Says  failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump  #TrumpFailedAmerica
I understand your point, but don’t forget, Biden does not hold any elected office at this point. He can’t simply summon a vote to the House or Senate floor.  I take your point; he should be more vocal. But, there is only so much he can do.
Joe Biden’s beating Trump in Florida — where polls go to die
BHO is running for his life.  His senior staff are doing live interviews on national television sucking up to No Brain Basement Dweller Biden.
Further proof - priority one for a new Biden admin with a Dem senate - DC and PR statehood at ALL COSTS.   Even if it means killing the filibuster.   The balance of power in the senate MUST be balanced out!!!
hope you win this..look at poll between u and biden.. not good
Yeah because Joe Biden doesn't write them.  What we do need to worry about Joe's dun downing, his corrupt ties to Ukraine and China and how he touches children.
They just want to install a stair lift in case Biden moves in.
Love you Sleepy Joe. When you and Barack were at the helm, I slept better at night! BIDEN 2020!! 🇺🇸
A traitor mother fucker!  ‘Your Daddy is a traitor’: Ex-tea party lawmaker slams Don Jr’s attempt to mock Joe Biden -
Fact of life ever since Hillary Clinton got away with Ben Ghazi her and Susan Rice Barack Obama Joe Biden James Comey clapper all the rest of them there’s no accountability. Do you think it is a coincidence federal buildings are burning just before Durham report comes out
Special Interests and their elite media allies all hate Trump bcuz they can’t buy him  Like they’ve owned Biden’s ass for 50 years and will again use that power to raise taxes to reimburse themselves for their ROi  You think otherwise?  Hope and Change motha fucka
But instead you will see Joe Biden, Hillary, Bill, Comey, Clapper and so many Democrats behind bars - where they belong.
Hi I’m Joe Biden and I’m not terrible on Twitter.
Those beach facing condo’s are $5-10 million  each.   bought Joe Biden for less than that.
If you honestly believe Joe Biden even stands a chance, just shows how out of touch you are with reality.
Don’t forget he likes for the little boys to swim between his legs and play with his hairy legs 🦵 🤮 Biden &amp; Obama’s Administration was the most corrupt administration in US history!
Also he did some prison reform stuff basically fixing what Biden did back in the day.
I'm surprised at Obama &amp; his less than nice speech that showed his true colors it was mean and lies what he said shame on him I thought he had better sense defending the rioters &amp; not our military &amp; police no wonder ur being investigated go hide in the basement with Joe Biden
He's not going to lose the election. The boomers will vote Biden over Trump. I am voting 3rd party.
Ballot harvesting??? Come on Liz! Btw I’m an independent who will be voting for Biden but if my choice was Trump or you my vote would be you even though we disagree on many things.
Because the district attorney is in charge of doing that not the attorney general. And the district attorney in this case happens to be a Democrat and a Biden supporter.
Joe Biden Can't Walk Straight or Remember Where He Is😵
Why was Obama speaking in John Lewis funeral where was Joe I thought he was running 4 president oh there hiding him he might say the wrong name or talk about someone else or 4gets what to say Joe Biden is still hiding in the basement poor man he knows not what he says or does
Kamala, exposed. 😏 ** Willie Brown’s Mistress #HeelsUpHarris To Be Biden Heartbeat Away From WH?
I think Biden is a dumbass too. Your brains can’t imagine not boxing someone like me into “republican” or “Democrat.” I’m an independents in all things because I actually have a fucking brain in my skull and i use it... frequently.
Wow your trash.  All of the dems with no facts say racism.  Let me explain racism, Biden crime bill, Biden says you ain't black if you dont vote for him, saying he does not want schools to become a jungle.Trump prison reform, school choice, lowest unemployment for all. STFU liar
So what are you going to think when Biden does?
And Biden still cannot state one sentence correctly.  What is he going to do when on a call with leaders from other nations? Or god forbid in a room with people like china who want to destroy us and he has to remember he even represents america.  China virus
No i support facts.  Where did the virus originate??? Answer china.  Does china give a shit about us?NO. Does Biden say that china is not a foe? Yes. DId Hunter Biden make a billion from the china government? Yes.  FACTS!
Joe Biden without question using my legally requested Mail-In Ballot. Because I’m not an idiot that wants to stand in line for 3 hours to vote. That happened before in Florida &amp; people got 😤 angry so they fixed that debacle. POTUS is a Bozo!
Because President Trump is our best hope for a future for this country. Biden and his “policies” will be the end of the US as it was envisioned.
Recent polls putting Biden ahead of Trump pushing fundraising efforts from
Dear Trumpsters, China owns your President and his Grifter family 🖕 #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpVirusCatastrophe #TrumpFailedAmerica #Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  Truth ⬇️
. addressed  and said the upcoming election would be a battle for "the soul of this country" at the #BlueGala on Thursday night via  via    #FlaPol
Any voting fraud is from Republicans. Voter suppression also from Republicans. Republicans cheat. They  don’t believe in actual representative govt and thereby fight against democracy itself. Biden must win to save our democracy. This is not hyperbole.
If you look at the rate of Biden's mental decay, I'm not sure he'll be around by Nov 3rd. I shudder to think if Biden were to win and we lose the Senate in 2020, this would cause a cataclysmic social and violent event that would end the US.
China owns biden they bought him through Hunter
The majority of republicans in Congress would rather have Biden as president.
Why do MSNBC give the president time to make political statements like it did in 2016. Free rallies every day and not answer questions. We want Biden to have the same amount of free press or stop it altogether.
My timeline is weirdly sexy this week. Sex with demons &amp; #DemonSemen are apparently a thing. The Master Boaters for Trump are planning to sink Biden. People comparing masks to condoms &amp; talking about giving up sex forever if it would send Trump to prison. Weird, wild stuff!
If you truly loved your country, you would have endorsed  . She's the real change. Biden is just a blue Trump.
Not to Joe Biden.
lmao! Please find a new line of work. Go see whats wrong with Biden's Head. We all know something is very off there
Its literally Biden's best potential EC map
You elect biden
Maybe but you will be a albatross around Biden's  neck. At least you agree with locking up black people for small offences.
She will fit in well on the Biden team.
Bush, Cheney normalized ... Trump criticized for removing troops from Syria and Germany? Maybe he should conform the way Obama did ... the Change candidate has won 3 straight elections (so the DNC selects Biden)
I Joe Biden and I’m guilty of this message.
Although I have decided (reluctantly) to vote for Joe Biden, this troubles me: of all the women whose hair he sniffed, or whose necks he kissed, or whose shoulders he rubbed, not one of them was black.  Not. One.  So, is Joe Biden just a pervert, or is he a racist pervert?
Well her and Hunter Biden anyway
Joe biden doesn't support dismantling the police (which is the true goal of the rioters).  So no, it will continue. And they will just call Joe biden racist. Because... He is
Nate Joe Biden will never be President of the United states.  Never.
carrie bradshaw is voting for biden y’all know what to do! 💫✨🧚
I hope they do a follow up video if Biden wins and he sees how much more is taken. 🙄
Plus-envious of any country now that has a sane, NORMAL, reasonably intelligent, caring human as their leader. That gets science. It’s incredibly stressful to have to endure this death, this mayhem, this mass confusion...these lies...We are just so f*cking over it 🥺#Biden
Biden is an alleged sexual predator so idk what you're on about
I so hope Biden is elected because once Assange in extradited I'm betting we're gonna get a "twofer" with you as well. You don't just want Trump to get reelected, you need him to get reelected. I can't believe I thought you and Matt and the Intercept were gonna advance journalism
What do u think it was in the civil war ww1&amp;2 ? They had elections.. UE just making excuses Bc trump is way behind and u don’t want Biden .  This is going to b a landslide nothing u or trump can do about it !!
You are pathetic the coverage on Fox for Lewis was excessive as an avid Fox Watcher I had to turn it off. Especially when the most corrupt president in the history of America used his funeral as a campaign rally for Biden
What a mess I hope Biden fires this guy Jeesh
Exactly when did you start working for the Biden campaign??
Why is my bar for who should be president so low that this one statement puts Biden leaps and bounds ahead of Trump.  So looking forward to the day when waking up I don’t have to think ‘please don’t have tweeted something moronic’ #dream #why #icanteven
It says they weren't invited from the fake racism claims which are lies Biden says vote for me r ur not black, crime bill, Byrd's my mentor.  Spare me the crap
Biden sucks. Vote for Biden.
Twitter is a strange place, politicians &amp; media use it in the roaring 20's, but the 2 party system in US is destroying America &amp; Twitter is part of that  And you support Nuclear Power Joe Biden Not going to win Florida w/that public policy.  Turkey Creek Nuclear plant is a danger
Apparently I’m dumb bc I said that Biden isn’t part of the radical left 😂 and his “proof” was that Bernie backed him 😂 apparently the libertarian party is radical left, too 😂 and Joe Walsh 😂 and everyone who isn’t a Trump supporter 😂😂😂
Yeah Biden approval ratings are soaring I bet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Black People should buy up all the hood and bid it out for sale to big developers on your own and split it even shares and you’ll make money instead of Biden Pelosi and them stealing your valuable land &amp; throwing you out in the suburbs-did they even ask Bkack ppl that? No!
Why you so afraid of a President who speaks his mind &amp; doesn’t blow smoke up ur ass. I know it looks like Biden &amp; the Dems are going to change the world for the better &amp; ur bored w/this life-but it will be a mess &amp; it’s to line their pockets with Green industry money
Yep if Biden is elected you will never worry about anything ever again. That’s how life works.
Cuz they didn’t want him there &amp; he respects ppls wishes. Trumps not fake-U ppl love ur fake talkin Presidents. Lewis wasn’t going to go to Trumps funeral either. From what i heard Biden didn’t go either,but he’s a real racist so i get that one. Lewis probably didn’t like him
If you know how terms work you know that Obama was sworn in in 2009, just like Biden will be in 2021, not 2020. So Bush owns everything from 2008.

If you’re voting for Biden, you ain’t a republican.
15 points
China is the Democrats, the media, social media and the Democrats. They've got Obama, Bush, Clinton and Biden on a leash. California is now another Hong Kong. We're at war. They're hitting us every minute. The GOP is weak and pro-China. Uh-oh.
We know Uncle Biden ❤️
Or Biden. Or an average adult. Or a toddler. Or my dog.
Biden isn’t even being endorsed by the radical left. This thing is done! It’s over!  4 more years!!!!
We will once  again  have a president who can speak  in complete sentences!!  #WeWillVote  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #Biden
So you're voting for Trump? Or just not voting for Biden?
Biden may be unfit for the Presidency. trump is unfit for humanity.

We cannot have him removed or have him step down at this point.  I feel that sane Republicans that are leaning Biden would swing back to Pence.

What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?
Oh really so Biden showing affection and love towards his grandkids is different tho?? Trumptards say the darndest things when it comes to their Master.
So you think Joe Biden is better deal ? I hope he remembers he's running for president that's the best candidate that the Democrats could come up with. I want somebody who is not in cognitive decline to be the president of the United States. #TRUMP2020
Reconsider your run for VP. Joe Biden and America 🇺🇸 needs you. Time to serve your country.
Dr. Jill and Jennifer Garner is a hell of a kickoff, Moms for Biden.
How about we all agree on mail in voting if Biden agrees to debate Trump?  Problem solved.
You will be gone...don’t worry..Biden is moving in January 20TH.
Leak in the Dam? Babysteps?  I will donate $100 to the first  SENATOR who says they are not voting for Trump (abstaining is fine dont need them to endorse Biden).
A vote for anyone besides Biden is a vote for trump. BIDEN 2020 ):
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
But Biden though????
In my opinion any almost would be better than sleepy  joe senile Biden A career corrupt politician
Gee I wonder why LOLOL The stable genius is going to win by a landslide!  Poll: Trump voters have higher enthusiasm than Biden supporters
She harbored a Chinese spy for years. Biden sold influence to, China to enrich Hunter. He extorted the Ukraine. Wow you liberals sure can pick them.
Voting and participating in the democratic  process  are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change  agent you  have  in a democratic society.  You  must  use it because  it is not guaranteed.  You can lose it  ~John Lewis  #WeWillVote  #Vote  #JohnLewisMemorial  #biden
Of course - but they go on record when they vote. That's important.  I can prove it's important- all the Dems or Independents who oppose Biden brings up his past voting record.
Unfortunately the youth that went to Bernie's rallies didn't show up to vote in the primaries.  And yes, the DNC did everything it could to make Biden super viable.  Ultimately we failed. We just didn't get behind anyone else in a big enough way.
Nope. Not what I said. Here, take a look at this and tell me what is missing from the Dem platform:
what doe's that have to do with Biden authoring a bill designed to accelerate the incarceration rate? and proudly bragging about that bill up until very recently?
If we can go to the grocery story, Home Depot, restaurants, &amp; Disney, surely we can mask up and spend 10 minutes in a voting booth. Mail in votes are fraud and they’re asking for it bc they know Biden will never beat you!
Great New Hampshire 👍 Can you please give #Florida a friendly in-service #electiondayholiday #Biden
I don’t think we should put anything past him. He is clearly mentally ill and treasonsous. This can’t be confirmed by the rule of law-because he demolished the rule of law.  please ditch your King Fuckwad. Our entire country is at stake.   #Biden
He is not wearing a mask inspite of many of the people around him getting the virus so he can get COVID-19 too.  An excuse not to run against Biden in November.
Biden wins in a landslide that’s all u really need to know.
We have a functional, mobilized radical left for the first time in 40 yrs. An empowered, emboldened, right wing (thanks to the influence of the Lincoln Project) Democratic Party will be the biggest threat to that. Yes, Trump bad but if Biden loses you can expect huge protests
If in doubt I suggest you remove political ideaology differences from the equation &amp; focus on the honesty and integrity for comparison of the 2 Candidates. You won’t find Joe Biden’s Niece writing a negative book on him.
Joe Biden shoepeg corn pop for his VP.
Trump won’t admit it, but he won because people hated Hillary. People like Joe Biden this time around, so as long as Trump continues to be Trump, this is going to a crushing win by Biden.
Check out Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan last week talking about this. Clinton was not ahead of Trump in Texas and It’s showing Trump and Biden within the margin of error IN TEXAS NOW. The local and national polls in 2016 were much more favorable to Trump then than they are now.
Would the corporate press try and explain away everything Biden did? If so him
So Biden was correct to predict that the Liar in Chief would bring it up? trump's entire presidency - every lie, every drop of his epic incompetency - is ripe for a 'scathing denunciation.'
All week, I keep on getting fund raising emails from Biden campaign, most featuring a potential VP candidate. Is he looking to see which one will draw in most donations? 😇
Yes. A Biden Landslide victory. #SweepyJoe
SATAN U CANT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WHEN U SATAN HAVE FUCKED IT ALL UP. NOV A REAL MAN WILL BE PRESIDENT! BIDEN!
#Biden2020 #Biden2020Landslide #Biden  Awesome Super Hero Shirt
At least you’re honest and that’s refreshing. I did not vote for Trump but I can tell you with honesty. I research Biden’s legislative record compared to the laws and executive orders passed by Trump. Biden is a lot worse to Blacks than Trump is. Facts
Between the USPS store and Joe Biden/VP merch I’m literally about to give my paycheck right back.
Doubtful. Haven’t seen ONE Biden sign/sticker or poster. #fakenews
Biden’s on fire all right.
Biden is definitely a puppet. No doubt about it
Joe Biden, his bones are brittle, his brain is mush.
Sleepy 😴Joe Biden needs 24 hour nurses and definitely not in the Oval Office  What is wrong with the DEMS 🤯🤪🥴minds that they are pushing and 🤑fund raising for a very old senile 😵sick Biden THAT SHOULD RETIRE
He has to come out now. He knows Barr/Durham are coming at him soon. He's hoping Biden wins - but he can't be sure. So, he's beginning the next phase of outright support of sedition. He's been behind everything all along.
Now do you think the president should accept the outcome or should we or should we go around calling Joe Biden’s presidency illegitimate?  I mean Hillary is still complaint and trying to blame everyone but herself.  Your thinks they have  this in the bag the kids again.
“And remember, if you want to be a good member of the Scuba Squad you’ll have to wear a mask. Also, be nice to the pizza delivery guy Biden. It’s not his fault he can’t read.” -Dr. Fauci (probably) #covid19 #Fauci
You know I can’t imagine anyone voting for Biden or half the dems but i hope trump don’t mess it up with his mouth
I’m pretty sure people aren’t insinuating it’s disappearing but if Biden wins the actual coverage of the virus will disappear. Two references would be the protesting coverage along with the lack of coverage of the Swine Flu in 2009/2010. I’ve actually had both!
Lol.  Biden couldn’t run a hotdog stand.
I bet, I’m sure your lube and cantaloupe with Obama painted on it are warmed up to his body temperature. Obama the loser uses a funeral for votes for Biden-disgusting but we already learned that about him-he used black ppl before &amp; is doing it again-big lies coming ur way again
As long as Trump loses before Jan 20th, when Biden takes the oath of office, it doesn’t matter when the election is held.  The shorter that “lame duck” Trump is in power, the better.
I saw this weird headline the other day, that for some event he was doing, Biden had written in his notes something about not to hold a grudge against Kamala. I didn't actually read the story.
This is contrary to reality. Plenty of videos and photos show Biden and Obama meeting with people, comforting them, etc. Few such anecdotes even exist of Trump doing the same. Specifically, when has he even acknowledged, much less commiserated the staggering death toll of covid?

What does that say when Biden won’t even attempt to pass a test that your 5 year old can pass? Trump was showing that it’s a very basic test. It wasn’t to show his smarts, it was to show Biden incapability.
NOBODY forgot about him like they do you!! He's NOT running for President, this is between Trump &amp; Biden NOT the kids, otherwise you, Don Jr, &amp; Ivanka WOULD be in some serious trouble!! Be careful what you wish for, ESPECIALLY being that you're part of the Trump CORRUPTION!!
Joe Biden’s beating Trump in Florida — where polls go to die
Let's hold it today and move the inauguration of Biden up to tomorrow?  Works for me.
I’ve been in Ohio for the past week and saw probably the only Biden sign in the state yesterday
Lmao c’mon feel how you want about Trump but Biden? A better president? He can’t even remember what office he is running for. #VoteGold #Jorgensen2020

Watch this video: Trump v. Biden. Biden wins.

“Radical left” is socialism; Joe Biden is a moderate. Just because someone is left of you and your alt-right nazi supporters does NOT mean that they’re radical. You just sound stupid, but your supporters believe it 😂
Thx followed
Another chance for me to remind you folks Qanon will have plenty candidates in 2022 wanting GOP nominations, looking to get in on the action of a would be anti-Biden midterm
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman’
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
I'm a unaffiliated, I like options and ideas. I will be voting on November. I will be voting for Biden... #WeWillVote   and then.... #SaveTheDateforTrump
Joe Biden is so far ahead in the polls the are going to issue a Silver Alert soon.
In fact, even if Biden wins in November, MOST of his support is likely to be a combination of working class and minorities. College educated whites will not make up a majority of the Dem coalition anytime soon. 2/2
The Black and Latino working class will still overwhelmingly back Biden, though. Those groups are critical to the Dem coalition and Biden wouldn’t come close to winning without them.  Either way, current polling is showing a shift toward Biden in the WWC as well. 1/2
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
Are you going to apologize to Joe Biden, now?
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
Schools are safe, voting is not. Got it. I will crawl over glass during a hurricane to vote for Biden.
Well if that is slanderous the. The president has thousands of law suits he can file against Pelosi Schumer Shiff Brennan Clapper Obama Biden and a whole host of others who have slandered his name and lied repeatedly about the Russian hoax.  They knew there was no collusion!
Democrats have made a mockery of our electoral process and it is them that has cast doubt about n whether the process will be fair.  Remember democrats for theee years stated that Trump is an illegitimate president. I wonder what the talk will be if Joe Biden wins by some miracle
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
i want to k word myself every time i open instagram .. biden lives in ur head rent free like he truly does not give a FUCK about u dear .. stop worrying about kanye 2020 and worry about what happens when daddy’s not paying rent anymore and ur stuck with a liberal arts degree 😭
Another thing to remember, Trump’s “Delay” tweet is an admission—an admission that he knows he’s currently getting blown out by Joe Biden. He’s very afraid.
And he will run ( or one of his devil spawn) again in 2024 and blame Biden for not solving all the issues he created
it’s actual delusion i cant imagine putting that much energy into “settle for biden” .. like we settled for capitalist bernie and the grassroots movement still failed it isnt getting better than that dear.. put that energy elsewhere .. you are obsessed with the bourgeois scam

Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Only if a consequence of him breaking silence allows prosecution
who is paying u to repeat “XYZ is a vote for trump” over and over again??? biden does not need to pay for advertising u do it for free why do u suck old white man war criminal dementia cock for free ... like WHO is paying u??????
Infants for Biden??????
Make that two. I wanted Warren to run in 2016 and I supported her in 2020. I voted for Hillary and I'll be voting for Biden.
Putin wins. Biden has no choice but to assassinate him.
You're right. It's divisive. I'm a lifelong Democrat. In 2016 I voted for Bernie and then Hillary in the general. I voted for Warren in the recent primary, and I'll vote Biden in November.
Lock him in and move Biden to Pelosis' office
Hillary, a seasoned politician, lost to Trump. To select a running mate by physical features is wrong. Biden cannot run a second term, leaving the VP to run for Pres. Trump will be Pres. again. This is not a beauty contest!

After you get long, meaty answers from Joe Biden, of course...
If you have a source for Biden saying that Trump's plan to contest the election - not simply move the date - will be pre-empted, please share it. Thanks!
Example; Trump’s cognitive test.  We laughed at him because the headlines were the test being simple and remembering five words.  What if we had experts talking about the what the test measures? Then we would have been talking about what Trump wants which is Biden taking the test
The swamp just threw up Joe Biden like an old piece of baked Just Fishing just to see what they can get the big fish or in 2024.
I totally agree, but I cannot vote for Trump or a third party candidate (because they would be a lame duck for their entire term.)  As much as I dislike Biden I don't have any choice but to vote for him.  Also, for better or worse, WE chose Biden, in the primaries.
Who will presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden choose as his running mate?   and  are live on #BattlegroundFlorida breaking down the possible VP candidates:
Biden hasn't even spoken out about it.
Biden is not a lying racist with dementia. A lying racist with dementia cannot/would not do this:
You can buy “Pence will be the GOP VP nominee” on PredictIt for 89¢ a share (it turns into $1.00 if true, zero if false).  For 87¢ you can buy a share of “Biden won’t drop out before November 1”.  These are insane valuations.
I'm old enough to have seen the voting for lesser evils play out with no change.... I wish that was the answer but it doesn't work....so I support nuking .  They are years ahead of us in strategy where Biden is concerned.  They have the next 20 years planned out,bet on it.
If Biden wins the EC they will immediately pivot to wailing about the debt.
Far worse is Trump's lack of response to Russian bounties on American soldiers' heads. Get him to take THAT seriously, then we can talk about Biden's so-called "non-response" here.
Racial propaganda from that video clip would make me think the black population in MT rose by 5000% overnight. The same b.s. Trump did against Biden with the old lady on a 4 hour hold with 911 while her house was being broken into. Tap into white fear. Smh.
Even better news for Biden then
Mr. Biden did you happen to see the tweet from Mr. Trump about Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good) and then at the end saying (Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???)  Mr. Trump is trying to change the day of the election.
That is how I see it. I voted for him because Hillary. And he isn't better. Biden is a POS. Things will escalate soon.
Joe Biden Inadvertently Opens the Door to More Education Choice
Hey, does anyone know if Joe Biden is still alive?
You don’t walk away from Allies!  Trump has no understanding of this.  Yes, pressure all NATO nations to pay their fair share, but you don’t abandon those Allies! Vote for Biden on November 3, 2020!  The Date for Trump Supporters to vote  is Wednesday November 4th!
PLEASE send Biden to this brain bus!! He needs this badly!
Time to put Biden in office and get rid of the cancer in the oval office now before he totally destroys the country.
My timeline is weirdly sexy this week. Sex with demons &amp; #DemonSemen are apparently a thing. The Master Boaters for Trump are planning to sink Biden. People comparing masks to condoms &amp; talking about giving up sex forever if it would send Trump to prison. Weird, wild stuff!
yeah if Trump was denying President Bernie I'd be lacing up my boots but Biden? lol
PA Republican here, you do not have my vote. Im voting for Biden. 🖕
This is so dumb. Republicans saying a third party vote is a vote for Biden and democrats saying a third party vote is a vote for Trump. A third party vote is a third party vote. Vote for whoever you think will do best for the country. The two party system is a scam.
So ⁦ described  as being “coherent” at the news conference. Coherent? Is that the new standard? Not “measured”, not “thoughtful” not “in command of the facts” but “coherent”? Cops use “coherent” on DUI arrest reports. #trump2020
Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.
Right!  Exactly “who” stops him if he decides to not hold an election or honor the results?  SCOTUS? Does the government automatically just become Biden’s?  No.
So Kamala Harris got white men in Joe Biden’s campaign to slander and denigrate her so she could set her people on them? #MakeItMakeSense
What can  accuse Biden of next? All those honorable Russians providing facts and evidence are endeared to unwitting accomplices like Hank and depend on him to amplify lies.
I have been setting aside money to buy A LOT of #BidenHarris2020 gear the day it comes out, which drastically decreases the amount of money I have to spend on weed, which is becoming necessary to deal with getting to that point thanks to a few loud and wrong Biden donors.
The thing about fascism is that anybody who knows how to look for it can see it coming a mile away.

I find it astounding that Biden does not go over 47% in any of these matches. This is why we can't count Trump out yet.
So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?

What are you guys talking about? Is Biden POTUS? Does he have powers of executive orders? Is he a senator? Biden doesn’t know where he’s at. He will do what his owners tell him to do. Nothing is more clear than the Democrat party is now openly a communist party.
a democracy constist of peace which you failed to give to all your constituents.  You allowed chaos to ensue and it is you that have president Trump all the political adds to use against Joe Biden.  Enjoy the loss in November.

Kwame, do you remember that one time that I tweeted you: "If you're justification for something awful that Biden has done is to bring up Trump, that's not a very good justification." ?
If Biden wins it’s AOC’s party.
Joe Biden has a huge enthusiasm gap!  Joe Has a real problem remembering where he is.  Joe has a huge issue with Latinos and his support from the black community is decreasing as each day goes by. Joe lost the support of law enforcement.  We are the silent majority remember that.
Probably Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris lost my confidence in her when she used a bussing issue to paint Biden as if he was complicit with that issue. SHE HAD TSHIRTS ALREADY MADE AFTER THAT DEBATE. That's was cruel and inconsiderate of those who fought and died dealing with that  #WarrenorRice
Once HILLARY and OBAMA are fair game... Its a whole new ballgame...  after the DEMS COMMIT TO BIDEN... and MANEUVERING against A SWITCHEROO
If you think Joe Biden...if he wins will be running the show you are delusional. You will get your wish if as Ilhan, AOC and the rest of socialist/jihadist/communist freaks will be running the show. But hey don’t worry #socialism will work out this time...lol
I mean i said after Bernie backed down never Biden, but today Trump suggested postponing the election due to fraud. As much as i hate it i dont think there is an option
Easy and convenient to elect Biden.  Don’t fall for it FL- need in person voting for a fair election.  Verify ID to the person voting.  Unbelievable that you can vote in states like CA WITHOUT photo identification!!!
To LOCK-IN BIDEN  AS the ONLY top level actually running for office
He’s only trying to take the focus off of the terrible GDP number that came out this morning. Only Congress can change Election Day and just because Trump Is so far behind  Biden, he thinks he in his sick head thinks he can do this. Vote Blue all the way!
Biden Basement 2.0 ,Where the guilty and demented hide.
Ok trump your getting me worried why waste your time saying stupid things like delaying the elections it ain’t happening get on the ball get sht done stop crying like a little btch if you can’t beat Biden then you deserve to lose dum tweet make market go down your best thing
Biden comms have been great, but id like to him him get tougher on pythons 😉
Just wait until you see the street named after Joe Biden.
Don the Con..you don’t have a chance in hell of winning. I would crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden.
Just admit that your a scared little boy to loose this election because you're a horrible businessman and even worse leader.  Just go back to your TV show and let America heal with Joe Biden!  BIDEN 2020
They picked Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Biden!!!!
don't care if bill barr's creepy gestapo is in the middle of a circle jerk in front of the lee county clerk, i will be voting for Joe Biden on November 3, 2020.
Am I the only one who doesn't want president pelosi in January? Give me an election and give me biden.
Do you really think biden can run this country? The guy cant even speak ir think right, that only is scary
Joe Biden, April 2020: "Mark my words. I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.”
Trump campaign labels Biden's statement that Trump will try and delay the election as, "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Then Trump suggests delaying the election.  You can't make this up.  America in 2020.
are you all ready to take to the streets to defend your right to vote for Joe Biden?  yeah, me neither
Many people say you haven’t done yours and that’s why they’re voting for Joe Biden.
And what has Biden done to prevent it? Nothing. He could easily ask his buds in the House and Senate to draft legislation that would make it mandatory for the courts to rule on an election challenge within 30 days, or something similar.  But no, just gripe about it. Cool.
BIDEN CALLED THIS IN APRIL
Why not let President Biden pick out his own color scheme in January?
Biden just gave very brief remarks, and he doesn’t know where he’s at. Keep trying to shift the focus to BS like this instead, but it won’t work.
Joe Biden called this in April. While it’s infuriating to read, it’s important to remember this—the dates of federal elections are set by Congress, &amp; the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration. In other words, he can’t do shit.
Who is afraid of joe Biden... except small children?
He shows many signs, including his gait which is getting worse everyday. Soon he will need a wheelchair as walking will become impossible. He already needs help and direction. Pretty sad really #Biden
Loved that movie
I detect sarcasm, but I’ve got plenty of action on Biden at +105 already.  And via the numbers Biden should be -220 or so right now. Trump threaded the needle last time with a ~29% chance, but if election was tomorrow it would be &lt; 3%.
You should be worry at your age to defend your property with defunding the police if biden wins, is going be a disaster!
You betcha!! Hopefully Biden Rice!!
No worries, I'm voting for Biden at the voting booth. Although you'll still vote by mail I'm sure.
Gotta get out of this morass somehow.  Also at the offshore books as of right now: Biden -160 Trump +140
You sound like a winey spendocrat that missed the rally!! This will pump until the late October. A Biden administration will provide the 15% haircut in the indices
Fact is there are alot more registered democrats than registered republicans. The anti Trump vote will far surpass the vote for Biden vote. Biden can become president if he goes more center.
What did you do already give up in Michigan and let Biden have that one.maybe try Ohio you might be able to get some votes there,but does,not look good.Better call Putin
Pro tip, shadow campaign is not the term you should use when writting anout white men trying to stop a black women from getting a job. Looks weird
It’s called “Operation Crossfire Hurricane”. There’s quite a few articles out there, key players, Obama, Biden, HRC, Stzok, Page, Wray, Steel and a few others,
would you prefer a 'whole bowl of shit''? if you're not for Biden, you're for trump. not hard. at least he has a chance; Bernie had none maybe try to get over it.
Ingraham: Do you know his name? | - she nailed it. All #Democrat supporters are full of shut. There is no logic to vote for #Biden
Joe Biden’s beating Trump in Florida — where polls go to die
Vote for Joe Biden. He won't accuse your mother of being a violent anarchist and teargas her, or shoot her with a rubber bullet and leave her with brain damage. All for the crime of exerting her First Amendment rights.
These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won’t be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?
Such A Joke!!!  IF BIDEN KNEW HOW TO SAVE AMERICA, WHY DIDN'T HE TELL OBAMA!!!
You are an idiot, you work your ass off and live in the hood? Your racist brain can’t tell between lazy bastards all colors and those that build companies to work at WTF? Do you really know why Biden is in the basement? Haha.. Better learn
Bravo! Biden 2020
Law abiding DEM citizen here.  Love our country, hate #dividerinchief who only wants to divide and forward his  own agenda and make himself look good for which he is an utter failure.  he is strangling our nation and he will do anything he can to win this election .Biden for Prez
Biden will select whom he feels will help him carry out his agenda.

No no it’s true what Trump did. Obama and Biden had their own plan AFFH. If you don’t believe look it up. That is what Trump and Ben Carson got rid of.
A man made super bug. Biden knew about this 2 years ago and so did polish and the entire sabatoge team😂

I love Harris. I do not fear her. She was by far my first choice for the actual nominee. But her stat is too bright. She would outshine Biden in the role of VP. The VP needs to be someone who can take a backseat. I’m not sure she is a backseat person.
SHAME! Jill Biden and your a Doctor no less should not the Hippocratic oath apply even more so when it comes to family?Your legacy Mrs. Biden will be a selfish woman, an opportunist, weak, look what you have allowed them to do to your family. S H A M E !
God you are so right Jill biden shoukd want his last years not to be toture but that what selfish people do. as far as the dems go theres is coming  once the real democrats realize that CNN the rest are lying to them its over  truth like sunshine. NO FILTER
Instead of asking for opinions, it is time to tell ppl that follow u on Twitter what you think about Trump, Biden, COVID, Portland, Seattle, George Floyd, Troop withdrawal in Germany. Get off the sidelines, Step up to the plate.
Honestly, not a fan of Trump in many respects. Yet, facts are facts. That he is has improved the US Economy drastically in the last 3.5 years. That was until Cov-19. Yet, not his fault. Regardless, we're going to need him to get us out of that mess. As Biden surely couldn't...
Why NOT, you guys did when you voted for Trump's incompetent ass!! Biden is 100% BETTER than Trump is on Biden's WORSE day!!
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
Have democrats lost their fucking minds they killed a black man because he had a difference of opinion, CNN &amp; MSNBC have said nothing in fact they didn't even mention or know his name just like the 3 young children that got shot bc of these rioters &amp; Joe Biden they fight dirty
Killing black ppl bc they support Trump.where is Al Sharpton, Rev Jesse Jackson, Oprah, or BLM there are none bc it wasn't a democratic supporter is this what we're doing now killing voters &amp; supporters so Joe Biden can win 4 political power this is inhumane &amp; democrats dont care
Is this the best we got in this 330 million people for president, Joe Biden, we are in big trouble he can't even speak right let alone run a country &amp; meet with foreign leaders what will Joe say to them rub my hair from my legs &amp; see it turn blond come on man this man is wierd
Lets face it Joe Biden couldn't save a fly if his life depended on it so how is he going to save this country this man is clueless and does not know what's going on in the real world how could he if he's stuck in the basement he does what they say and says the wrong things often
Its almost as if democrats have no feelings 4 human beings like their from another planet of fuck you all just so Joe Biden can win &amp; save the day when he can't even save himself from the misery that he will bring 2 this country with his not spoken policies &amp; hiding in his bunker
Just to remind everyone. I am not a Trump supporter. I am not a Biden supporter. I view them and the parties they represent as corrupt, dumb, and unprincipled authoritarian sell outs. (1)
Bottom line democrats would sell us to the devil if they could for money their so greedy for it that they can't see straight &amp; the thought of making billions makes it worth their fight 4 Joe Biden to win he will make them &amp; himself richer with our tax dollars business as usual
He didn't say Biden himself was a radical leftist, just that he's a puppet to them. I will say while that's somewhat true Trump himself is pretty much a puppet to radical right wingers
if ur truly a republican there is no way in hell you could ever vote for biden. no way.  If you really are.. Change you voter registration to democrat because you're clearly no republican.
Biden Obama didn't...
More like Biden is at the Bottom.
Deaths in Florida when Biden was VP.!!! Since election rigging was not needed it wasn't a panic... Is this Scamdemic magically cured after the votes are counted.???
How do you feel about people saying Biden will underperform Clinton with Hispanic voters? Is there any truth to it?
Biden’s been on his knees for a while.
One of the VP’s main jobs is to prepare and be prepared in the event they have to become president all of a sudden. An ambitious VP is definitely needed when Biden isn’t in his best health, folks just don’t want a black woman as VP
Like Biden as a Presidential nominee?

Glad to see ppl finally realizing Biden will not be the President. He will be the figurehead. The VP and Pelosi will be President. Biden will sign anything put in front of him. He will say what they tell him. Chameleon Harris &amp; Crazy Nancy in charge!
And the thing with voting, I can 100% tell you if Biden gets elected, we are fucked. Everything we’ve done to this point would have been for nothing.
Global warming has been taking place for the last 20k years.  There are complete cities submerged all over the world.  Like Obama, Biden will sink $B’s into failed companies.  If we stopped using fosil fuels today, will Europe , China, and Russia follow suit?  Take a guess!
My keyboard trie to sabotage tf out those tweets 🥴 Tried to tag Biden instead of Budden , Changed Cyn To “cunning” and is adamant about Tahiry being “T-shirt” 😭💀
Harris: hands down could be president on day one if anything happened to Biden. I like Demmings and Abrams, but Kamala has it
It certainly won’t improve under Biden. Trump only guy who stands for law and order. Have you heard Biden or any Dem leader condemn the riots? These are paid actors, you do know this? They will only stop when jailed or not getting paid.
If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?
I’ve never seen a president who whines as much as Trump does. I just hope enough people will vote for Biden to get Trump out of office! #NobodyLikesTrump
The difference is that’s Trumps daughter sitting in his lap kissing his cheek. Biden is sniffing girls and groping them.
I've never seen child porn, so I wouldn't know. Unless you count watching Joe Biden touch little girls inappropriately on YouTube vids.
Trump and Biden tied in Georgia: poll
But Biden said he was definitely open to diverting police funding to other programs, which is one of the things PolitiFact said was meant by "defund the police."
A BIDEN Victory !!
The people participating in these gross attacks against very qualified women, are allies in Biden’s circle. We need them to exit
I think Biden will pick Harris. He's not going to play this game.
Like this is just a genuine albeit tongue-in-cheek representation of what I feel the correct position is, and it is a more honest stance than either pretending Biden is great, or pretending like he is equally bad as Trump.  Both of those alternatives are egregiously dishonest
Wrong.  Stop telling lies. Biden 2020
This is a newfound hill I will die on  It is both morally gross and practically ineffective for progressives to pretend like Biden is a genuinely good candidate.  To acknowledge this while still advocating for defeating the actual fascists is both honest and good praxis.
We need a woman VP. I back Senator Duckworth. She has the credentials that will allow Republicans to get behind the ticket. If Biden goes to far left he runs those Republicans off!
I’m just waiting for some kind of media dump in October when they find “evidence” on Biden. We keep hearing that is coming and everyone will see the “truth”. I’m sure there will be some good “deep state” dirt involving Obama too. The koolaid is strong!
Wow... Biden is looose change😳😳😂😂

No!!! I am voting for Biden. All my family in Florida and Texas is voting for Biden. If Trump gets re-elected, I am moving to another country. I can’t deal with four more years of hate, ignorance, arrogance, and lies.
At the end of the day, if Biden loses you can only blame him and the Democratic establishment. Period. So if he wants to assure his win. I suggest he step up
Opinion | The Media’s Biggest Favor to Biden Was to Ignore Him  via
I didn't ask anyone to vote for Biden. We all deserve much better.
Such an idiotic thought process too. You WANT a VP that's qualified to run for #47, not one sitting in the shadows doing nothing. While he's our best option right now, an 82 yo Biden is not the answer for 2024.
Why is anyone voting for Joe Biden? He's just a blue Trump! #VoteGold #JoNotJoe
Biden's note to self: Don't squeeze her when we meet.

Think now about how hard they are going to work over the next 96 days to make sure he wins again so Biden can’t undo it all. We need to work twice as hard.
Kamala is highly qualified candidate and as others point out, you need to pick someone who could be capabale to step in. If even true which I doubt, this is intended to harm not suppprt Biden. It’s not an ally if this is what they spread.
She must be related to Biden. Memory shot !!!  CRS full blown
This is how the right wing thinks .. and yet they call Biden crazy ?? Lol

Joe Biden will lose and it will get worse I'm afraid.
I’m agreeing with you. I think people are projecting misogyny onto Biden that isn’t actually there.
Let’s be honest here, the VP pick will probably be someone no one is talking about now. It’s alway been like that if you look at history. How many would have guesse Quayle, Cheney, Biden, Palin, (lol) Pence or Kain? Maybe Gore in 92 and Ryan were expected but that’s it.
Ok...followed...#FBR
Joe Biden has a 3rd sense. It is nonsense.
If Biden Is Elected, Residents Fleeing Chaotic Cities Like Seattle and Portland Are in for a Rude Awakening
He’s not a dem. He’s a NeverTrumper. He’ll support the Biden ticket because it’s the right thing to do to get rid of Trump, but he’s not a Democrat.
Any person that Biden picks is going to get the full BS wrath of the Trump/right-wing dumpster fire machine. After the past 4-years Benghazi isn’t going to matter to anyone who isn’t already in team Trump.
I think people are misinterpreting the simple sentiment that when we hire someone, we expect their job to take priority over their future ambitions. Somewhere along the line, I think people twisted it into a misogynistic sentiment Biden never actually held.
Remember the “Biden is going to announce his candidacy and Stacy Abraham’s as his VP at the same time”?  That was such an odd story on every level.
You know why you all want Barr gone is because he is about to unveil what Obama/Biden did to president Trump and his administration and democrats are freaking out about what John Durham is about to reveal in his report.
I gotcha. I am in a similar boat. I find myself thinking like Ron Swanson and the Libertarian views. I only asked because based on your tweets I don’t see any hate towards Biden so it just had me thinking where you were at with this election.
LG was part of Ukraine coup along with McCain, Biden, kloubachar.
Most of Trumps true base are too dumb to even know who Susan Rice is at the moment. Any VP Biden selects will get the wrath from Trump’s re-election camp. More Trump voters know who demon sperm doctor is than remember Susan Rice.
Joe Biden will never be President of the United States. Never.
Joe Biden will never be President of the United States.
I feel that's why Biden was picked. The dnc wants him to get elected and then they have him step down and make his vp the president. Likely a woman and of color.
Well, who would you suggest Joe Biden pick as VP?
So by not voting for Biden, you’re actually placing a vote for Trump C’MON MAN!
I want to see video of one white liberal guest being asked if Joe Biden is paying for his support. Or liberal black, Hispanic, Asian whomever. The media is the enemy of free thinking, peace loving Americans.
I am expecting indictments on trumped up charges (pun writes itself ) in October, maybe some perp walks up to Obama or Biden himself
I want Joe Biden to win.  But I really want Joe Biden to win Florida, just so I can say I live in a blue state.
Whhhaattt
Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  🤣😂😅
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.
Am the only white woman I know in Fla for Biden
Did he say and do all of this shit? Noooo. But we know now !  Biden 2020!!
Interesting thought but I don’t think that that would cause republicans and independents who were already voting for Biden to not do so.
Strikingly similar article to the one written in April about   the mad libs version of the VP whisper game.  'Joe Biden allies quietly working against (insert woman's name), claiming she is too (insert an otherwise complimentary adjective).'
You think conservatives who are willing to vote for Biden will still vote for him with Kamala on the ticket? Warren is a Harvard Law Professors who teaches constitutional law, yet your logic says we're better off with another person who has to learn on the job.  Research Kamala.
He can’t control opec prices . Just like he can’t make it rain or control hurricanes. You can’t bring up China , Biden sent our jobs there and then made millions.T put billions of tariffs on them so not a great comparison for your guy. Try some other kind of hate in the playbook
. How's this?
Joe Biden Says He's Not Available for Interviews😨
She is not as qualified as Warren and she comes with some very serious baggage that Biden cannot afford.
Followed all
Look at Joe Biden, doing the right thing and telling all of us that we can do the right thing right along with him. That is presidential leadership.

Oh give me a fucking break. Why extend any benefit of the doubt for republican "concerns" here when they basically aided and abetted Russia interfering on Trump's behalf in 2016?!?! Hell Senate Rs are the ones pushing russian propaganda right now to damage Biden!

Yall could've said that was Joe Biden and i wouldna known different.
The America-hating libs that are constantly in these comments (because they have no meaning in life) should come to grips with Biden losing. Because he’s gonna lose. And their tears are going to be even more delicious than last time.
If I’m Joe Biden and I see a bunch of Kamala Harris supporters gearing up to play the “sexism card” even though he has said that he would pick a woman VP regardless. I’d think that it would convince me selecting her VP would be more trouble than it’s worth.
I'm seeing that some liberals are now promoting a no-vote for Biden because of his "pro-business" stance. Can you help explain the pro-business stance of Democrats and why some liberals are so opposed to Biden?
Biden has said he’s picking a woman regardless so playing the “woman” card is kind of bullshit. Every time a woman candidates supporters do it, the tactic always seems to backfire.
Sounds like she's the best candidate if she's the only one getting smeared. Reminds me of all the Biden smear attempts that have tried &amp; failed.  Dodd's bs about Karen Bass also smacks of racist tone policing, of wanting a less assertive BIPOC woman. #fuckthatshit
Yeah, if you are pro life, do u choose the party of pro baby killing &amp; protects criminals from the death penalty?  Or the party that is anti abortion, &amp; a handful of death penalties befall criminals each year?  No logical prolife person would choose Biden based off this argument
This does not say anything about the definitive distinction between left and right wing values that motivate policy.  This does not say anything about the fact that Biden would be a republican 30 years ago.But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. 🌊😀☮️🌹
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you’re part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote 🗳  Senate to become Dem majority 🗳
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‘conspiracy theories’ about Biden
Great. Let’s bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that—just until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.
"We’ve seen huge transformation in Biden’s climate plan,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.

No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
95 days until the election and I’m organizing for Joe Biden because he has a 4-point plan to give essential workers the long-term support they deserve   ⬆️wages, quality/affordable healthcare, free tuition for public higher education, encouraging unionization + more

Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done

most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it’s insanity... and you’ve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden 🤪🤪
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.

I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.

His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.

U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat

Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Clinton Sistah Souljah: “I‘m a Clinton Democrat!” Biden fundraiser comments: “Fuck Joe Biden” Lmao Absolute 🤡
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.

Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She’s senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Hunter Biden looks 1000 times better, murderer
Where are all their masks.??
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn’t want him as vp
Someone’s having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States 😂
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
I thought It was rice, but now I think it’s Harris. U don’t leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
Dude, I think she’s the pick. Why would they leak if she’s not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden “smells” children? C’mon... look at our country today!! We couldn’t take much more of all this winning!
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn’t happen under Obama/Biden. It won’t happen.  Trump is a liar.
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....
As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you’ve just been well behaved for Bernie’s sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch
is sick mentally and thinks he can beat  .  Mr Trump has done more for Americans in 3 years than Biden has in 40 or more.   Biden has no clue on how to deal with COVID 19 or 9 as he calls it.  #FourMoreYears

Pretty interesting that Covid-Don names a bunch of states he obviously thinks he is losing to Biden: NV, OH, PA, FL, AR.  Looking forward to the grants to TX, GA, KY and SC.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Georgia Tossup 🤔. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.Ask Biden &amp; Obama. Both of them hardly ever worked on weekends! 😮

IMHO most DEMs are not voting to put Joe Biden in Office. DEMs vote DEM, (GOP vote GOP). If you like AOC you’re voting for Biden. If you like Warren, you’re voting for Biden etc etc.
You can’t honestly think that Joe Biden, based solely on the the way he has acted over the past 3-5 months, is completely there and capable of running a country.
Joe Biden is displaying all the symptoms of senility.
Let Biden decide if he wants to remodel . I don't think Trump's trashy brothel look will appeal to anyone else .
And now Trump is demolishing the GOP's vote by mail machinery with the same self fulfilling fatalism in the general election.      With enemies like this, why does Biden need friends?
While I agree that Trump is out there, at times we’ve seen Joe Biden with the inability to form a simple coherent thought.
I think Biden is in a lose-lose when it comes to the debates. If he debates President Trump, I think his current mental state is pushed even more into the limelight. If he refuses, he looks weak, and people begin to wonder why he ran from a debate.

There’s zero chance the Democratic Party lets Biden step into the ring with President Trump and debate. They do not want the world to see that Biden is completely lost without a script. They will find every possible way out that they can.
The narrative that Biden has moved to "the left" on climate seems wrong to me.   Has he embraced bolden targets? Yes! Has he made important changes that'll benefit the economy &amp; climate? You bet.   What he's doing here is adopting policies more in line w/ science.
Yeah, I think that's right. Fracking is a good example - he's staying far AF away from it, no matter how hard the left pushes a ban.   No easy way to fit M4A into the Biden vision of how the world works.

I find it frustrating that the message out of the democratic narrative is vote for Biden because we can't have 4 more years of Trump. BUT that is a pathetic reasoning to vote for a lackluster candidate who is only slightly better...and that is not saying much about Biden.

Are u insane lmao. Trump will win in a landslide. Not everyone is a dummie like you that going to vote for Biden lmao. A guy who was VP for 8 years and in politics 40something years and hasn’t made any changes cause if he and his buddies did we wouldn’t have any issues for trump!
True! The only choice is Biden
Looks like Biden’s VP pick is coming down to Susan Rice and Karen Bass (the most un-Karen of Karens):  via
President Biden, what a relief.
I predict Harris because that's who Barrack &amp; Michelle wants unless something changed.  (Rumor has it that who they were behind the scenes promoting. Part of reason Biden got their endorsement very late.)
CNN: Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders.   via
If you discount his refusal to accept more or less every notable left-wing policy push of the last several years, Joe Biden is *basically* a perfect progressive

Biden is no better than Trump.
Roger,  Sir your Old Enough to know better!! This New Democratic Socialist Party is out of their Minds and God Forbid Crazy Joe Biden Wins this Country is going to our next Cival War!
Let’s talk core issues. Dem sponsor Planned Parenthood is population control. Dems From LB Johnson to Biden all racist giving your perception of good. Policies that have  weakened black families and killed MILLIONS. 2 parent homes went from 84%-30% weakening black community.
I'd like to know who this group of people is, who are so under-informed they think Biden is plausible, but also watch every little thing Trump says. Frankly, I doubt they exist.
It's been six months since Joe Biden called trump xenophobic for restricting travel from China. 6 months ago CNN called it the China virus before criticizing trump for saying the same thing, 6 months ago democrats were too busy to worry about covid with their impeachment hunt
Trump supporter want America together, not divided.  I do not hate anyone that support Biden as I know they have been lied too and haven't researched for themselves to learn the truth.  The woman in this video was a hater of Trump... but she did research.
And Trumps vocabulary is on a 5th grade level. Biden was not my first pick but I’d vote for a flying purple donkey before I vote for Trump.
My grandmother posted one video about Biden and my uncle went off for the next hour 😂😂
If Biden wins Florida he wims the election. I say that as a Floridian Key will be turnout. For Dems that is South Florida, Orlando areas. For Reps, it is Jax, Sarasota south, the Villages.

Larry Elder: Joe Biden's repeated lies on race should serve as a warning to voters
I can't fathom any Conservatives jumping ship for the Party of Obama, Clinton, &amp; Biden, but there's no doubt that the Republican Party has appeared to hit a ceiling: they've performed roughly the same in the last three elections with 25.8%, 25.3%, and 25.2% respectively.
Mr. V.P. Biden, time for a revolutionary idea. Parents required to substitute teach in the schools their children attend. Protected by similar laws for jury duty. We need to peel back the cover of education and transform what we can with what we have minus many $ needed
I'm very confused as to where all of these anti-Trump, Biden-voting Republicans are. Trump has a 96% approval rating in the Republican Party. Although national demographics would suggest the country is moving away from Republicans, I'm still very suspicious of national polling.

This one is tricky because the tweet is so short... but no, Biden didn't write this tweet.  -   Funny how the mole is telling you what they are thinking... They're "worried" about Biden tweeting.
it ts my duty as American regardless of party to vote the good I not  a Biden person but for the sake of democracy I'll enthusiastically vote u out. #RidenWithBiden2020
I'm disabled I've voted by mail for years as a Republican  is it only rigged for Democrats or both I have agoraphobia I voting Biden trumplicans are to wired all my family are republicans and nobody's voting trump
I hope you are offered a position in Biden's administration.  You are valuable to this country.
But after two tries Joe Biden remembered where he was yesterday.
Fact Black lives matter formed under obama, where was Blm under obama, where was Joe biden....oh yes thats right silent. When you get the vote its your responsibility to make change, the change happening now wasn't happening, sure trump has no hand in the change, but 50 years.
i’m all for getting trump out of office but the fact y’all said “give me biden” is trash and exactly why our political party system is beyond flawed
Trump 2020! Your boy Biden will be useless
He is not mentally fit and they know this.That is why they want Biden in Office.We Must all vote Red Trump 2020
Careful. Every comment you make just takes another vote away from Biden and Trump to give to Jo. Keep going 😉
Kinda how Biden lied about de funding the police. Oh we're not de-funding the police we're gonna just move some of that money elsewhere...smh.
Trump is scared he will lose the genera election to Biden with his poll numbers. In his press conference he cited sources such as  saying there are potential problems in voting by mail. He does not hold the power to delay the election. Congress decides date.
oh no the infected numbers are going up, silly me I just thought it was going up because more people are getting tested....my bad Ill stop using my brain. Biden is incapable of forming a sentence plus he and dems rigged the primaries because bernie was the better man.
Biden’s VP will be the intended Maoist Communist Democrat President.
What point? If anything, your profile tells me you idolize a former candidate who’s entire campaign was short lived. But yet I’m the brain dead one for supporting a candidate who has a better chance of winning? I hope you have room in your mouth for Biden’s balls next to Yang’s
Don’t be mistaken......Biden’s team is not picking a VP. They are picking the intended president. Vote like your life depends on it. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsHateAmerica #DemocratsAreADisgrace #DemocraticNationalConvention

We are voting for Joe Biden!!!
It's still a toss up at this point. Biden and Trump are the same. Both campaigns aren't even trying to win.
C'mon.. The Daily Show? It's comedy you idiot. I don't think you really wanna go dumb thing-for dumb thing against Biden? You haven't a chance little man. "I may be Irish but I'm not stupid".. Biden 🤪
Read this.  If you don't want to deal with this asshole administration for four more years, vote Biden, and then vote for who you think is in your best interest for local and state elections. If you don't pick Biden for pres you better the odds for incumbent. Don't do that.
It doesn’t matter who wins. War is coming. Liberals will riot and burn cities if Trump wins again. If Biden wins he will ban so called assault weapons and start another civil war
Nothing will stop us #WeWillVote for Joe Biden  I am retweeting this and I hope you will too.✌
That's laughable! At least Trump can articulate an intelligent thought sans teleprompter; more than I can say for #RidinWithBiden2020. 🙄 Just #VoteTrump, Biden is no match, debates will be so much fun! Let's do this, shall we? 🇺🇸🦅
I don’t want Biden as my president
Was this a funeral or a Democrat campaign rally for Biden? Gee, we're sorry Lewis died, but let's all stand up and talk about voting and elections.  WTF? These people are disgusting.  Seriously!!
What would be awesome right now, would be for Biden to put out a press release that  he is going to announce his VP at 5:30 tonight.   Right when Trump has a news brief scheduled.. OR, better yet, set it for 6:00 as Trump always makes people wait a half hour
No.  A VP needs to be eligible to become President.  No one can serve more than 10 years as President.  I’d something would happen to Biden within the first two years, Obama would not be able to serve because it would take him beyond 10 yrs.
President Obama is right - we have the capability to not only restore our founding ideals that all of us are created equal, we also can build a more perfect union together. That’s why we will elect Joe Biden this November &amp; that’s why we shall overcome this dark time together.
HECK NO !!!  My Mom is still alive ( Thank God ) and still a Republican , she wrote in Kasich in 2016 , but is voting Biden this year. My Father hated Clinton with a livid passion- he would have hated Trump the same way, for the same reasons. Disrespect for the office and lies
This is a scary but possible scenario that Trump could employ to steal the election. Please read and contemplate - then act by voting for Biden.
"Voting for Biden is like eating half a bowl of human waste" signed, a Democrat. That should tell you something.
Remember that time that you were all about the me to movement and believe all women and then called Joe Biden’s accuser a liar? That was awesome!
This is disgraceful.  He should have asked the host if they were paid by Clinton in 2016 and being paid by Biden in 2020.
The next time the senator takes something that Mr. Biden says in jest seriously, remind him of this. Mr Cornyn is a hypocrite
Possibly. But I think Trump and Biden both are in different stages of it. We dealt with dementia with my in laws and the signs are there. More so in Biden but Trump definitely as well.
If Biden has health issues before then, they'd have to postpone anyway.
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will be a Trump Landslide win anyway,the Dem fraud will be a wash
After Joe Biden picks his VP,it will secure a Trump Landslide and win,and best of all another 4 years,l would want no other for the economic recovery!
Yes, that is why we MUST hold them accountable. Bush Jr Admin got away with everything. They left much fatter than they came in while Obama/Biden was putting the country back together and working hard for the people while securing a second term under racial assault.
The fact that you think Biden has any chance of winning is as laughable to people who vote third party. If Biden was a good candidate, why are people hesistant to even support him to begin with?
Of course he is. New York wants him. And whatever AG Biden appoints will go after him. And seize all of his assets.
Without evidence. That makes Biden prescient.  #RidenWithBiden2020
Exactly the concern. There were reports yesterday that some Biden advisors are running a “shadow campaign” against Kamala Harris for VP, questioning her loyalty and motive.
No way he’s going to lose to Biden and most Americans are sick of it we just have jobs and are to busy living normal lives. We will vote them all out and mail in voting for everyone is BS. Shit I can’t even get packages from USPS sent correctly and in a timely matter to my house!
I would crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden...#WeWillVote
Nah, if Biden becomes president then it will be 😂
HELL NO.  The sooner we get rid of  the faster Mr. Biden can get on with the job of fixing what Trump broke.
Not even responding to how a pandemic has changed this country. That was China. We had no reserves of PPE or vents and still got them. A vaccines been fast tracked( where’s the one for Swine flu??) and it’ll be better soon. Thank the Lord Biden wasn’t in charge.
Good point, you have to live on another planet not too see Biden didn't do anything
Coming to America if Biden wins.
More credible than Biden
I’m starting to think Jill Biden is part of the Silent Majority.  She probably values her Investment Accounts.
Obviously, because Biden is about as competent as a ham sandwich!! LMAO but AMERICANS will vote again for Donald Trump in a landslide because he is the best president ever and we don't want to live in a Socialist shithole!
He has pressers practically EVERY freaking DAY! And round table meetings,  and visits to different places where he stands and takes open questions from media without a teleprompter or script. Biden never does. He reads his speech and then leaves if he goes out in person at all!
Here is #biden doing the opposite.
Trump could be destroying Biden but he keeps kicking himself
If someone chose a third party candidate over Biden, that means that they don’t like Biden as a candidate for president.
It wouldn't help him anyway. As long as enough states hold elections and those states comprise 270 electoral votes, Biden is sworn in. If not, then the Speaker of the House is sworn in.  There is no path for Trump remaining president no matter how much he tweets.
Delaying election doesn't help him. On January 20, the Speaker of the House would be sworn in as the new president. If only red states delayed their elections, and as long as the remaining states formed 270 electoral for Biden, Biden would be sworn in.
This is how I envision this year's presidential debate, you have Trump on one side saying "person woman man camera TV TV camera man woman person..."  &amp; on the other side you have Biden doing a push up challenge. W/ the moderator saying all I said was hello #2020StrikesAgain
Quote of the day: " when negotiating with the enemy what do you want? Trump or Biden which will fall asleep at the meeting".             'Newt Gingrich'
Hey  you are supporting a man that is talking about violating the voting rights of every American because he thinks that a legal form of voting will cause him to lose. You are playing yourself. And I'm a vet that supports Biden too!
I don’t want Biden as my president 🤷🏽‍♀️
I'm just going to say it now. If Biden wins in November I am going to be insufferable. I have so many receipts to collect.
Really not that hard. It’s Economics.  Many felt he was better for it than Hillary, who was also a flawed candidate.  Can make the same case for why the love for Biden? Do not see the same kind of support that other Dems were getting like Bernie.  All i hear is bridge and not DT.
And have drank all the BIDEN BS koolaid!  GET OUT OF THE BS TRANCE and WAKE THE HELL UP!!!
Ha Ha, Boner boy Biden... What a Moron😀 Pathetic human being..... Loser asswipe😀🎠
We have a fan club hoping Mr Biden picks you as his VP.  He would show his 47 years in gov didn't go to waste.  You were able to muster what, 2% support in your own run for President. Magnificent 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Oh, please be Biden's pick for VP.  I can only imagine the political ads to remind people of your Sunday morning appearances defending the indefensible.  BENGHAZI
Kamala, I love what you stand for, BUT you don’t have charisma, your voice doesn’t resonate with people. It’s very nasally. If you accept VP position, it will get Trump reelected. Biden sucks!!! He should’ve chosen someone like Cory Booker as VP.
The born again fiscal conservative/hypocrisy boom will birth in January '21 if Biden wins the election.
Wouldn't that be giving in to being bullied?  Biden needs to pick who he feels will be the best VP to work with to accomplish what he can for the US...nothing more.  I believe those insisting on Kamala are making sure she doesn't get VP..
Do they even hide the fact that they are secretly choosing the president. Biden can't lead for 4 years.
A hundred million people are going to watch all or a little of the three future presidential debates. A hundred million people are going to watch Joe Biden struggle with cognitive decline. Will that change the polls? Extremely curious.

Once again, Biden displays his racist self since that “crazy” woman is a BLACK IMMIGRANT that graduated from medical school. Her facts re HCQ are correct, backed up by 62 studies. Just another racist and DEADLY smear campaign from the left.
Sorry if this is offensive, It's the only truthful response I can imagine for Biden's continuing ignorance:
Please research how many blacks Trump has pardoned and released with his prison law that overrode Biden’s that put millions of blacks in jail.
Want higher gas and utility bills?  Ok vote for BIden!
Agree. She was actually my second choice for prez, but I will support Biden no matter who he chooses. A golden Retriever would be better than Pence.
Yikes please don’t vote for Biden
Let me tell you in my county in FL people have been telling me same thing I voted trump in 2016 and now I dislike some of what he does but I will NOT vote for Biden or democrat. People overwhelming are confident in Trump some won’t say it right away but it’s clear he will win!
People who are not sure whether to vote for  let me give you some insight, watching my county, I have listened to a lot of people and all voted for trump in 2016 and all will be voting for him again why because Biden is hell to everyone! The dems included!
Last I checked, Biden is NOT President.
Anyone you know not going to vote #ProLife U.S. Catholics Dismayed that All Biden’s VP Choices Are Pro-Abortion
Why do people refer to Joe Biden as Vice President?  He lost that job title 4 years ago.
When does Biden announce his VP candidate?
Florida and Texas are also going to go for Biden. We need a HUGE margin to keep him from claiming the results were rigged
does Biden have a plan or are they strictly just trying to get you out of office at all cost?
That Obama had to be the one to marshal through ARRA, rather than a lame duck W, cost him tremendous political capital. The deadline is blown, so at this point Pelosi should extract a maximum price to help preserve room for Biden to maneuver next year.
I think Pelosi may at last understand that allowing the GOP to take the most politically difficult topic off the table on good faith the rest will be dealt with is foolhardy. And that regardless of who signs it, this is effectively the Biden admin’s first bill.
Did she tell you Biden wants you to be his VP??
Let's get a Biden representative on as well.
Tell them Bernie . You were the only Democrat that made sense . I know they have cheated you . I don’t like that at all it has your voters pissed off im a trump guy but a healthy govt I beleive that we need both sides to vote on you have a better chance then Biden
Pleaseeeeee Delete this account ASAP has to literally be the most bigoted shit I’ve ever saw I my life‼️ like at this point I’ll even vote for god damn Biden! 🤦🏾‍♂️🤯

We not talk about the Green deal but I do know Joe Biden is not going to raise our taxes
Great to see Pres.Obama ramp up his involvement in the election process. It's good to see men who like Biden act Presidential for a change. And bring class and intelligence to the proceedings. I'm hoping our next President will help us earn back respect we have lost worldwide.
I'm riding with Biden!!!
Yes. The DNC wanted Biden. When Bernie was leading and CNN had the "unplanned outtake" of Liz confronting Bernie about who lied, it effectively ended both of their campaigns. Then suddenly, surging stars Pete and Amy dropped out. And now we have the least fit candidate.
Biden stood up to a gang member with a bike chain around his arm. Mitt almost murdered his dog in the most beta way possible.
Somewhere in his basement, Joe Biden secretly wishes he could be questioned like AG Barr....not given a chance to answer, that way he decreases his number of gaffes LOL
Maybe FOX just got smart and knows that you have ZERO chance of being re-elected, so now they realize that it is in their best interests to go with a winner...someone who can pull this country out of this quagmire...Joe Biden.

I bet Biden can't do it.
And Biden can't remember where he's at. Can we stop pretending Biden is still Biden? He's mentally challenged. I had an uncle who was downs syndrome. Everyone loved him. He was great. But you wouldn't hire someone with severe mental deficiencies to run the country.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
I figure he's a one-termer, if he even waits the full 4.  But this country needs to heal, rebuild trust from other counties, and undo pretty much everything Trump has destroyed.  Dump Trump, then deal with Biden.
i questioned Conway's motives in another post and was told to hush.  I know they want something, conservatives are never nice.. Biden needs to win big.. Obama / Regan big. Trump cant win or we will all be in cages with the kids.   Give Biden a chance, just to get Trump out.  /1
And I understand your frustration.  IMHO Biden is trying not to make the election a holy war, and not to give Trump any ammunition to rally the idiots that voted for him last time.  The real key is to get a dem president and as many progressives as possible into congress / senate

Are you kidding? MAGAts only know Biden as the guy who let a Black Muslim socialist in the White House outlaw Christmas.
Biden wasn't my first choice, but I wasn't going to vote for Bernie. Why? Just like you, he wanted it all his way. You don't want to compromise, you want to hijack everything for your own purposes or you'll act like a brat. Nah. Be a spoiled brat elsewhere.
Biden's a centrist. Bernie is to the left of him.
Also, good to know you're supporting Trump for re-election &amp; in favor of the destruction of the Republic under Trump. Bold move of you, but I'm sure it'll work out. 🤔If you can't vote for Biden in Nov because of his VP pick, you're a Trump supporter. Pure and simple.
Lets not pretend Bernie would of have done anything to win over Biden voters if the shoe was on the other foot, his whole campaign was "I don't need you, and you will bend the knee."
That's such an idiotic thing to say. I'm hoping they're only there as long as it takes to get President Biden sworn into office.
There's a lot of pissed off people in my area. A lot of houses with a trump signs are surrounded by houses with Biden signs. Its like a rebuke of trump and anyone supporting him.

I have little enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, but I will of course vote for him. That said, in the event of a second civil war, which is becoming increasingly likely, I'm firmly on the side of the anti-fascists.
Joe Biden announced he will name his Vice Presidential pick next week. My bets are on Kamala Harris.
The Dems will assuredly come after BLM &amp; other organized movements when they happen under the Biden administration. And, this time, the media won't be siding with BLM on the populist wave - they'll be turning liberals against it (like they did under Obama). Blue-Red-Blue, repeat.
If you had to choose between doing 50 fix and flips with Trump or partner with Biden in a 16 unit multifamily deal which one would YOU do?  Would you let politics decide for you? Would you choose the best business person?  My guest Danny Randazzo  on the #MoneyIsShow chose 👇
Michelle Obama already has the hearts of most of America. I’m also assuming she and her family are set financially as well. She just started a podcast after a successful book tour. There is a reason she’s staying relevant on purpose. If Biden doesn’t win, she runs in ‘24.

“Mr Biden, what would you do to help people who can’t afford health insurance?”  Biden: I’m glad you asked. What I’d do is,...feathers, there was a pigeon and a stick of butter would carry the weight
Reagan coined the phrase I didn’t leave the Democratic Party it left me.  He cited communism as his reason for switching.  Robert Byrd the former grand wizard didn’t leave Dem Party, and Biden referred to him multiple times as boss and leader.  Man can you afford this? $100!
I can’t wait for Biden to be in office so I can argue with Democrats to persuade them that we need UBI, Medicare for All, and Green New Deal. It’s really boring just getting along with them as we all fight to remove this one insane guy from office.
well show me a demon and I will show u the next Texas GOp senator.
There’s a difference between Obama and Sleepy Joe,  Joe has no enthusiastic support.  In the 08/12 wins Obama had a big turnout.    Heck if you did a vote in the Democrat Party,  Socialist Bernie would receive more votes than Biden.
Gillum especially was a popular candidate at the time with a lot of enthusiasm behind him. Biden doesn't have that.
Yes and we will be voting against all of you. Biden and Obama has their time to fix so called systemic and institutional racism why didn’t they do it if it was an issue. Why didn’t the 1st black US President solve the issue huh?? Why did he say jobs could never come back to USA?
It was a joke, #Biden even said so. Boy, you #trumptards are desperate. #TrumpDeathClock
Everyone who pays attention &amp; actually follows world events already knows the US &amp; China are locked in Cold War 2.0. Regardless of your political views, its unfortunately inevitable. With Trump now &amp; likely Biden in near future, this conflict will continue
Biden if# taking questions from the News media which is Bull Shit! He has hand picked newscasters asking Softball Question which he reading answers provided for him ATotal Joke 👎🏿👎🏼👎🏾👎🏻👎
Biden is not available for interviews with Chris Wallace because he is already booked until the election is over and throughout his presidency. Just no time.
I really hope Biden has a place for her in his administration. She always impresses.
I'd rather listen to Biden. I follow enough people on Twitter to get the highlights and avoid the bickering and the bullshit. Earlier, I listened to one Republican briefly rant about antifa and I had enough
Exactly why Trump will be re-elected.  The Dems blew hearing today and CNN knows it.  So they try to change subject but Hidin Biden changes subject back to ‘I don’t know what I’m doing here’......
Joe Biden is taking Softball Question from hand picked newscasters. He is a Phony.
The Democratic Party just voted that Medicare for all is not going to part of the platform and far left not happy about that. A gap is opening and not good for Biden.
Biden speaking right now quite eloquently.   All the #MAGA #FauxNews dementia propaganda proved complete B.S. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica2020  🍊 🤡 on the other hand, knows less then 100 words and half of them are name calling.
Who gives a fuck about Biden. Jo Jorgensen2020.
Aerosmith, Pearl Jam, more push campaign candidates to seek consent before using their music
Joe Biden will say anything at any time give away anything at any time he will do anything to try to get a vote please remember what this guy has done in the past and if you do you cannot vote for him
Such a weird take to just completely sit out an election, based on the age of the candidate for one of the offices at stake in the election. There are other races too and I’m sure not everyone is “too old”. Also weird that Bernie is not “too old” while Biden is.
Wow ... poor old China Joe wth the man has dementia and was a known KKK lover as in Byrd, Come on people open your eyes you are voting for the VP or Jill Biden just saying you know they will pull out the 25 th and the Vp and whoever is speaker becomes VP.
Trump 351 Biden 187 #Landslide2020
He is complacent and complicit with the violence. BIDEN is a tired old elite and he cannot be in CHARGE of our great America!
Then don’t vote for him. But God will need to help us all if Biden gets anywhere near an office. Plus what was the policies Obama implemented that made life better. We know not taxes, so which one?
They have to. Once Biden is sworn in, Trump ain't shit again and can be thrown out on his ass.
Running-mate rundown: Tracking Joe Biden's VP pick  via
You are seriously deluded if you think Joe Biden gives any thought to what you say. Going to fake your way to the best seller list again by the RNC buy a lot of copies?
If Trump wins this election, 2020 will truly have been a repeat of 2016.  "Trump might not except the election results." This was said back in 2016.  "Biden could win in a landslide." The same was said about Hillary.  "The polls have Trump losing." Just like back in 2016.
Biden could literally go on vacation for the rest of the election and win, you guys are the best campaign he has. Keep it up.
Don’t know about you, but I believe big pharma. How about your add that out next president, Biden, wants to defund police. You are incapable of telling the truth.
But her reasoning made no sense. She said people in her district really didn't like Biden and she didn't want to argue with them by endorsing, yet Biden won her district in the primary by huge numbers.
Biden talks about Rasism, but the fact is, he is the most racist person I have ever seen on media in all my 51 years! Stop being sheep and open your eyes. I don't care who is POTUS, as long as they can Effectively be one. Man, Woman, Black or White and keep promises they ran on.
I have seen only one Biden bumper sticker on the back of an old white mans car here in Jacksonville, FL
Soon they will be coming after your guns. Remember Beto's comments, remember Biden saying in his administration he would put Beto in charge of gun reform.
I would never trust the leftist Yahoo Finance.  Come mid October, I'm going 100% in cash.  In the event Biden wins, I feel the market will drop 30% within days. Just my opinion
This is what the entire nation will look like if Biden is elected and Dems take the senate. Vote!
I do agree with the rest of your tweet tho. Biden sucks.
Biden signs going up in Florida! 97 days 16 hours 33 minutes to go....Let’s do this! #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsACrybaby
Yes your right by not voting in a lunatic and corrupt politician like Joe Biden and get getting rid of these psychotic radical people out of these cities they govern.
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'
I feel like it’s a really missed opportunity for the party to show they’re more representative to everyday Americans and they came off as elitist. It makes me worry about the Biden Administration a bit more.
That's the only way the Biden won't beat Trump.  THE ONLY WAY!!! keep wishing 🤣
You're right. There is no way Biden will pick Bass when there are so many other, equally qualified people.
I love a good Rand Paul insult
Extremes make extremes. We have a far right leader which caused far left groups to emerge. If this were really the case like you say then Democrats would’ve never (overwhelmingly) elected a guy like Biden.
He WILL win and liberals will riot and burn cities and start a war!! Or Biden will win and he says the first thing he will do is ban what liberals ignorantly call assault weapons and start another civil war!! No matter what we are having another war soon. Race war could be soon
But electing Biden or Jorgensen in November
Joe Biden will ..1️⃣ not even debate the president 2️⃣do an interview 3️⃣answer questions 4️⃣take a cognitive exam -Joe Biden will Freeze, Forget and Fail
If Trump gets gets re-elected, FL's nightmare will continue until 2022. DeSantis didn't take action when we had 15000 cases in one day. He didn't take action as we passed NY He won't take action as we pass 1/2 million. Biden will win FL but it will be a referendum on DeSantis.
It's #LyingTrump again.
Obama SLIPS Reveals The Plan For A Joe Biden Presidency | Huckabee's Bre...  via
2020 DNC platform under Joe Biden voted against legalization of marijuana. WTF?
This is not surprising but it's still really disgusting. Joe Biden will spend his last decade fighting to enhance corporate power and profits while working people ration insulin and ignore urgent health problems. This is such a dumpster fire.
Everyone is saying what if Trump wont give up the presidency... well.. if there is a dispute, and Biden is not elected by a margin then it gets to be fun, and Trump will like it even less
Sounds like it's time for Biden, the the treasonous terrorists and the supporting left politicians to all be arrested and prosecuted for their crimes. The coup cabal has some serious explaining to do. People will not vote for Biden at Gunpoint.
They only gonna give a guy credit if he was hired by Ronald Reagan 37 years ago and is old as Joe Biden.
You can never be too prepared, I would encourage all Americans rightly so without felonies etc. who are mentally able to handle a fire arm legally the right way. We have to be ready because if trump wins, this will be 100 times worse, and if Biden wins oh well let’s not go there
He will (pick) a black woman who would have no possible chance of winning on her own!! Then IF Biden wins, liberals will have him declared unfit for office and she takes over. That’s the plan
Tell me why all I see is crooked sleepy jimcrowJoe Biden commercials on tv in Jax fla area!!!!!;
Oh you’re right, Trump causes the virus and made you Biden voters go out to burn and loot the cities
A US Sen took orders from a QAnon acct via Twitter, anything can happen. Biden talks of taking the Senate at a Dem debate. QAnon acct notified Sen (Chairman) Graham that theyr'e after the Senate so it's time. Then Graham opens probe into Biden. I don't believe in coincidences.1/2
The Sanders supporters are, once again, sore loosers. Even after Sanders himself told them to support Biden.
Probably some truth to this t-shirt. I don’t think Biden will be allowed to beat Trump in the Nov election.
It’s ok, #biden likely forgot about it. Make her VP!
By voting for Joe Biden November 3rd because we sure as hell aint great now
Get those votes ! On debate stage trash #Biden
So let me get this straight...#ChimbombAna,    is upset that Joe "Grab them by the Pussy and stick a finger in"  Biden is using Dodd to vet womyn?  That's some crazy "conserving Conservatism" right there.
You mean like Joe Biden!!!
It’s general direction towards Biden hiding in the bunker  Bc of a positive result
The fact that you give our president so much light and energy into your day shows how much you’re concerned Biden won’t be elected. You didn’t see me criticizing Obama for eight years I just did my research and waited each election year to vote maybe we all should just calm down.
Oh, MSM will spin that. Last thing they want is Biden on stage, alone, with Donald Trump. They will protect him with everything.  Nice of you to offer 🤠😊😌
It’s bullshit...Twitter won’t take it down because they feel it’s freedom of speech not when I say Biden was our first gay presidents V.P. Expect this to be deleted  btw you idiots who listen to this crap 4 years ago trump was 10 points behind killary now he’s 9😊
Trump knows where he is, knows what office he’s running for and what he said 10 minutes ago. That’s all of a lot better than Biden.
That just talking to talk.  I am taking real life bias and applying it to the Presidency. I have been pretty good at too. Hillary got sport and strategic and got sent into retirement.  Biden will be sent to his final place as well if he picks a black or bi-racial lady. 💙🇺🇸
32 years ago but the exact same message. Democrats didn't think that message was racist until he became President.  Go back 32 years &amp; watch literally ANY of Biden's interviews. He was a different man when the wind was blowing in a different direction.
Same here.  I would say 10% of the people I know who voted for Trump are voting for Biden.  100% of the 3rd party voters are voting Biden.  Not a single person I know who voted for Hillary is voting for Trump.
Jill Biden is absolutely beautiful both inside and out.  I can’t wait to have a true Lady back in the WH.
Joe Biden is a good man.  Jill Biden is a class-act.  I can’t wait to have a man of honor back in the WH and a First Lady to be proud of.
Again...not even advocating for Republicans vs Democrats....just that the guy will be a figurehead not a decision maker if it's Biden.  Maybe they run the country centrist (hopefully)....maybe they won't....but impossible to say for sure.
I think Biden 8-16 years ago....absolutely.  I just don't trust a man so clearly in mental decline will be core policy maker for his presidency.  Not saying it's necessarily far left but I just don't believe it will be him.
President Biden, tear that wall down!
I think you have that one backwards. Trump has offered to debate and the Biden campaign responded that “they weren’t going to play Trump’s games”. My grandfather suffered from dementia so I’ve seen it first hand. There’s no doubt that Joe is in early stages of it.
Trump has done more for Women Business Owners in 3.5yrs than Biden in 44yrs in Gov.

LOL. Biden is doomed.
Article for those who like to read....Joe Biden to pay respects to John Lewis on Monday in Washington. The simple fact of giving a damn is not difficult.
I only come here to tell you idiots what you have done wrong/. Write in Kasich, or don't vote. Trump/Biden, sorry, stupidity runs rampant. Hoping I win a lottery so I can get the Hell out of a US that would vote for either of them!
if Biden wins they won’t only legalize it, they’ll pay for you to have it while you stay home from work!
Hillary was crushing Trump in the polls too. It’ll be interesting to see if they debate because I feel like that’s where Trump made his way last time. Biden is mentally slipping, I know people deny it but it’s obvious, so his running mate will be key.
Fuck Joe Biden
Dogs for Biden.
She was an amazing woman. ♥️
It doesn't erase the fact the openly admitt to be marxists, secondly blm funnels their donations they receive through act blue which is a super pac for the DNC, no wonder basement do nothing, calling black people criminals Joe Biden is getting rich.
Called it weeks ago. Biden will not be permitted to debate. There will be no debate! I can't imagine this going over very well with majority of voters.
When patriots put rioters down because they've had enough of this BS, will Joe Biden think they are "fine people" too?
I’m wondering why none of the post above ever mentioned about Joe Biden‘s MENTAL  CAPACITY.  Are you Guys are ashamed with your 77 years old Senile candidate! Lol.
No, they're with him to the end. They know they have no other choice. Holding onto power is all they care about, so they'll be with him till January 20th if Biden wins.
Why do you keep lying? Joe Biden does NOT want to defund the police.  You are so dishonest.  Also why’ll first your grandchildren get to choose distance learning and everyone else MUST go to back to school?
I expected the screaming of “the deficit, the spending” from GOP with a Biden win .. so it’s earlier than I thought.. but Ricky is really more concerned with getting is name recognition up country wide for Presidential run 2024.. he has been nonexistent in Covid for us here n FL
Are you all enjoying Biden's New America yet?
Stop spreading fake news.  You should talk about your 77 years old candidate Senile Joe Biden. Joe is suffering from 2nd stage of severe Dementia.
The sandbars of Florida are certainly pro Trump. There's a ton of Trump, Rebel, pirate, and Don't Tread on me flags out on the water. I've never seen a Biden flag, nor did I ever see a Clinton or Obama flag. Trump has the boater vote in Florida.
Trump takes questions daily at the White House from reporters from all different networks. Joe Biden doesn’t leave his house.
Dude, this is America under the Trump administration.  Biden is not president... yet.
Joe Biden is a Corporate Avatar...  I Garantee he didnt contribute one paragraph about this "Plan" for women in the economy.
She is clearly blind to  authoritarian Nazi-like leadership.  The woman is heard telling shoppers, “I’m not a Nazi,” claiming she wore the symbol of hate as a political statement.  “If you vote for [Joe] Biden, you’re going to be in Nazi Germany."

Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Well, when Biden is sworn in, He can just use the military to get him out of there. They're pretty good at getting war criminals out of bunkers.
Yea let’s see Biden struggle through a debate first
I really tagged Joe Biden and this fool tagged Ye 😂💀
Wow, GDP avg 2%, under Obama. Joe Biden did get 1.5 Billion of CCP bank $, Hunter kept it. Obama caught spying on Trump. Obama used IRS against people Did nothing when Syrians were gassed. Gave Solindra 600mil that never produced 1 job.
1. Kind of a big deal.  2. Looks like China will be colluding  with Biden... will require spying and witch-hunt Hoax investigations
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Dan did you see Mark Levin's show last night? You might want to look into it. Check out Biden's plan for the suburbs. Obama tried it but President Trump has pushed back much. biden wants to destroy the suburbs and our country.
I prefer Susan Rice, Kamala Harris is not my choice at all  There's reportedly a 'contingent' of Democrats lobbying against Kamala Harris as Biden's running ...  via
Ruth, Talking to You is a waste of time as your just not Bright enough to Speak! Then again Crazy Joe Biden doesn't Speak either until the Squad tells him what to Say!!
The GOP strategy in avoiding a special session to deal with the state budgetary apocalypse is:  1) Ignore 2) Get reelected??? 3) Vigorously fight against federal bailout appropriations while muttering deficit 4) Blame Joe Biden 5) Get reelected???
I'm a former Republican I'm voting for Biden to save America I wish he was a little more progressive is at least want 4 things  1 Medicare for all. Legalization of marijuana trump to be held accountable and more affordable housing for disabled and combating covid possibly Ubi for
Because moderates and centrist Rs &amp; Ds chose establishment Biden by using Red Scare tactics against Warren &amp; Sanders. He's the candidate you &amp; others chose, don't go talking smack now. Btw, when Obama asked someone to help lead us out of the recession, he asked Warren not Biden.
Trust and believe that Biden is more lucid than Trump. You are one of those poor Trump supporters who cannot fact check and relies on Trump lucidious commercials to sway your judgement - talk about fake news.
You have become a great lier like your father.  Biden never said he would defund the police.  Always twisting things.
Other than people like you and General who were able to take full advantage of our once beautiful Capital, I’m sure Joe Biden knows what has happened better than anyone.  I wouldn’t worry. We just need to get Mr. Biden back in office.
Over 90 field organizers for the FL Dem Party write that the Party + Biden Campaign is "suppressing the Hispanic vote in Central Florida".
That’s what your going to get with Hiding Biden!!😂😂
- No one is coming to Joe Biden for anything - The man can't even get out of his basement - Especially Seniors that have dealt with this Criminal for most of our lives!!!!
Did George H.W. Bush have to express regret for calling Ronald Reagan's economic plan vodoo economics? If he didn't, someone might want to mention that to Chris Dodd.
That’s not how it works😂😂 Trump can’t be like yeet we not counting these Mail votes for Biden 😂
New ads for Biden campaign that target senior citizens, which polling says may be in play.
No we all know the rose Twitter doesn’t believe her either. She’s just a convenient excuse not to support Biden.
Naw, just another embarrassment. Same stuff Biden and Hillary was talking about I reckon in the 90's.
You want to beat off Joe Biden?
Biden supporters are not interested in jobs.
Trump is NOT running against Biden ~ he is running against VOTER FRAUD !
Trump et al assumes that if there is a black candidate on the ballot blacks will automatically vote for him, which in their reptilian brains means less votes for Biden. It seems to never occur to them that blacks, women, etc, aren't an automatic voting block...
We know one thing- Obama is not guilty of killing off 140,000 Americans by pretending that a pandemic wasn’t happening. Poetic justice will be served in November and again during Biden’s inauguration.
Done!
You will wake up in January when Biden takes the Oval Office. The USA is the biggest laughing stock of the Universe right now because of the orangutan 🦧 in office. My greatest hope is that we still have American citizens left (have not been killed off by the CoronaTrump virus)
You will wake up in January when Biden takes the Oval Office. Until then, you should seek therapy.

Good morning! Coming up after the break I've got the latest CNN poll numbers for Biden/Trump. We look at a few key states.   Hope you had a good weekend!
Neal do you watch Mark Levin? If so you need to check out the show from last night. It is about how biden would destroy the suburbs.  Very scary.
Not Peaceful
Cry me a fucking river they were butning the Presidents church down they were told to move a block down and refused they got off easy if you ask me.
Biden wants to scrape past weed convictions 👀👀 we will have to wait and see... cause that’ll be amazing
Thank you for your support of Joe Biden, made me love you even more.
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown  #FoxNews
I can not wait to see this , person who called #biden a #racist
Yes, let us hope the truth comes out but don’t see how it can. How can you believe her and not Biden’s accuser?  She had strong evidence. I hate all of this, no matter who it is.
Even *IF* Joe Biden comes on and gets interviewed by Chris Wallace, Chris Wallace is going to throw softball questions, just like he does every Democrat who he interiews.
if your intention is to mock Biden by trying to lure him into a person woman man camera tv test, no wonder he’s declined. be better.
BIDEN THE CHICKEN , WHIMP REFUSE TO SIT DOWN WITH MR. WALLACE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP.  WHAT HE SCARED OF??
Trump is milking the Portland debacle. The anarchists are giving Trump the election. Gun control people are buying guns. Lasers to permanently blind police. And Biden is still against law and order.  Vote Biden - higher taxes, more "peaceful" protests, China.
#Biden will say if you don’t for him, you’re not brown.
I will do that and I'll weigh that against what Joe Biden has done as Senator and Vice President the last 44 yrs and then make my choice.  Have a good night.
Will give equal time to Biden’s record on race ?
Except, he will win again due to the American public voting for law &amp; order and the return to prosperity. Biden and his party can’t do either. 👊
America’s options are really Trump &amp; Biden 2 creeps
Congratulations Obi! I’m a Republican for Biden 2020!
Biden is not calling for DEFUNDING. You're flailing at air, Donald.
Biden and Trump are the same. Both can fuck off. Want change? Make politicians fear you.
Chris Wallace is an honorable journalist and I regret that Biden won't agree to be interviewed.
We always knew he had  only Republicans in his best interest.  He pretty much confirmed it!  We need a president of both parties!  Biden 2020🌊🌊🌊
So, anything that you find on Trump, you are gonna  me Randall?  No sure why but, ok. I see how you conveintly scroll by &amp; make excuses for Biden. You and your pal are incapable and inmature for balance. Atleast, Claybo and Chauncey makes an effort.  They acknowledge stupidity.
What about Joe Biden’s mental health?
They have been much more active on Twitter of late, basically projecting DT's actions and their sycophancy onto Biden and us normal people. Their desperation is palpable...
Right because their democrats, they get away with murder. Quite literally murder...let’s face the crap Obama is hiding soooo much stuff I can’t. But let’s exacerbate anything we hear about Trump because it’s Trump. We’re screwed if Biden wins. Get ready for increased taxes people
I knew it - I knew they took out #Lewis just for this occasion - First they needed to block the interview with Biden and Chris Wallace and 2nd they are trying to stop the hearings -  Do not let them cancel anything!!!!!!!! Please "Stand Your Ground"!!!!!
Joe Biden is sneaking in the kitchen again, stealing kitty nuggets from the litter box.
Yeah, Biden is definitely the best option.
Biden’s down in the basement bathroom ‘finger painting’ on the walls. “Oh Joe, not again!”
Then you were not paying attention to Joe Biden.  Empty headed trumpter.
He’s not racist. Ask Tiger. Or Jerome Adams. Or Tim Scott. Or any other Black Americans working with Trump. It’s a false narrative. The Democrats are the party of racism, always have been. The KKK, Jim Crowe, &amp; worst of all Lyndon Johnson. Look up Biden speaking on his crime bill
A fallable and inept Biden presidency could either lead to stronger fascism or stronger leftism. Are we really ready for that tug-of-war? I'd say the leftists (socialists+) have a long way to go in the way of solidarity. We better get it together friends. Love each other.

Why isn't Joe Biden condemning this? Why isn't any of his 4 VP candidates condemning this? Does the American people want this new America? Sickening.
Joe Biden represents the Maoist Communist insurrection. He wants to make America like Venezuela
Biden Roaches
I'm looking for a #Biden/Harris ticket. Either way, I will support whomever he chooses, 100%!!
All those who I know voted 3rd party in 2016 are voting for Biden in 2020.  That’s bigly.
Sounds like a peaceful protest. Wonder what big bad Joe Biden has to say about these threats
Very basic economic indicators, but what took Obama &amp; Biden 8 years, has taken Trump &amp; Pence 3 years.  His ability to make America great can not be argued with. #keepamericagreat #homeofthefree #american #americanpatriot #economics #politics #trump2020

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The thing people forget is that voting isn't the end of it, you also have to put pressure on the people in power once they're in power. If the pressure is there, I have no doubt an Independent AG will investigate all of Trump's crimes. That's on us, not Biden.
What’s stopping you from arresting Obama/Biden/Hillary??
Stutters dont make you forget basic history, Obama's name, where you are, &amp; what you're talking about. Biden looks very lost every time he speaks. Youtube or Google it.

True but I think that issue is helping lock the young vote into Biden whereas they were disengaged or Bernie or bust before.
Trump 99% Biden 1%  And That is a Stretch!!!  LOL!
The most likely result of actual, five-alarm crisis is the failure to inaugurate anyone at all at the stroke of noon on January 20th, which would result in President Pelosi. Which, given most Republican electeds would prefer Biden and legitimacy, is highly unlikely to transpire.
and by the way and I find you rather attractive I hope you don't feel that I am a sniffing Joe Biden I'm not it's a compliment to you
what I do if I don't wanna vote for Trump or Biden fr? cause ima feel bad if I don't vote period
Just saw an great new Joe Biden campaign ad. It was all positive covering all the most important issues in our minds his experience and involvement. It paints him as a diametrical opposite to Donald Trump. IMO the worst and most self focused POTUS we could have ever imagined.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Pass it on !
GREATER ENTHUSIASM FOR TRUMP THAN BIDEN REFLECTED IN VOTER REGISISTRATION.  That means new voters are registering Republican just to VOTE for Trump!!  #TrumpLandslideVictory2020  #Trump2020 #TrumpLawAndOrder2020
Lets not underestimate the fact that Joe Biden does indeed have dementia and can barely string together a single coherent sentence. The debates are for sure going to hamper turnout on the Blue side. Independents and young voters will be cringing hardcore the whole time.
Go back to sleep Biden!!
Joe Biden is a Corporate Avatar.     Does anyone really think he is capable of writing a tweet like this?
Joe Biden to tour military facility and “wants to ride on a tank” per sources. MY COLUMN:
Biden is easily controlled.
That along with the New Health Care Plans soon to be announced - Joe Biden hasn't got a chance in "H E Double Hockey Sticks" of ever being our President! LOL!
No I'm registered w peace and freedom party I'm ridin w biden
This is hilarious - the FIRST hurricane of 2020 to make landfall on the country and it barely makes the news! I guess with the riots, the election, Biden, the Chinese virus, and various female celebrities being naked, a hurricane just doesn't seem important.
Joe Biden is a professional incorrect person, be it on crime, on dividing Iraq into three republics, on killing Bin Laden, or even on how to use an ear loop mask.
Joe Biden endorsing a Green New Deal means the brain-dead "I'm a Democrat," boomer liberals that flood the primaries will support that style of legislation in the future. Same goes for single-payer. Its all a game of voter influence. Moving the population moves the politics.
Good ad for Biden.

Why should Trump bother? I mean Biden said in 6 months when he takes office he’ll have plan in place....granted we have to wait 6 months and god forbid our WORTHLESS US Government stop to lying to us and do what’s right!
Biden said he was considering a Republican VP.... The answer is no.
Every last option we have is trash   Biden trash Kanye trash Trump.....straight 💩
"I just can't vote for Biden so I won't vote," sounds like...  "I just couldn't vote for Hillary so I'll vote for a reality actor," which in 2016 sounded to me a lot like...  "I just couldn't take my family to DisneyWorld so I took them to #Chernobyl."   #COVIDー19 #marytrump

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No. Never Biden. Never Trump.
And why do you think she'll become president?  Do you think there's something wrong with Biden that will preclude him from serving?
😂😂 voting for Biden cause you’ve had your feelings hurt a few times lmaooo, Biden is the least qualified candidate in a while
Thank you for the words of warning and concern, Mr.Biden; soon to be Mr. President! 👍👍😷😷
I believe  that even though Ye reveals he is persuading people so Biden loses, it doesn't reduce the persuasion. Maybe it makes the persuasion more effective.
Biden has so many Corporations $upporting him he doesn’t need any of my $900.00 a month retirement income.  We HAVE to take financial corruption out of politics.
U look like the worst used car salesman on Planet 🌏 earth .... Biden.
Do you mean Republicans in govt. or public  figures or regular Americans? My folks are Republicans now ( were liberal when younger) and became more conservative with age - but have no tolerance for Trump or people like him - voting for Biden instead.
Biden's accepting of the progressive platform isn't exactly designed for Biden to do anything about it - its a strategy to 1) get people to vote for him, and 2) to change the priorities of "Democrats," or active primary voters. Moving voters left is incredibly important.
Is everyone missing the obvious? Biden is running for president.  He's incoherent, forgetful, and a creepy sniffer.  It's embarrassing.
The Case Against Biden  JB: cognitive decline  DT: total dipshit  JB: crime would increase DT: turn on your TV  JB: creepy DT: rapey   JB: inconsistent on racial progress DT: very consistent racist  JB: Hunter Biden scandal DT: like 70 scandals &amp; counting  #COVIDー19 #marytrump
Yes at this time, for this election, any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump
Eeeyup. My son is coming up on his 20, also USN like us.   Told me he didn't believe how many supported Bernie and now Biden.
I agree, your last sentence is right on. All the left is talking about Trump losing, they'll have to evict him -- it's them projecting their actions if Biden loses, which l still maintain he will. Polls are weighted heavily to the left. Same as 16
biden is winning so suck it
Just donated to the Biden campaign.
I think most republicans except ur base trumplicans will vote anybody but trump I'm voting first time for democrat Joe biden
Bernie voter I'm voting for Biden 1st time Dem voter I'll vote for a rock instead of Biden I like he's adopting more progressive stances not like Bernie but enough we get a progressive vp I'm all in #BidenForFL
Uh...JFK and FDR were Democrats. JFK was the first Catholic President, Joe Biden will be the second. And tRump is the WORST president since Reagan...something even W couldnt achieve.
The GOP should lose the Senate so that Biden will have all the congressional power needed to achieve his"Build Back Better" agenda. With all the work that will have to be done, he's going to really need it.
I’m not even thinking about Biden until there’s a debate
Seriously, you blame Trump for the Chinese Corona Virus and the fact that the scientists recommended to shut down the country for 6-8 weeks. Get a clue. It’s all China’s fault. And if Biden is elected, China will own America
Is your goal to beat Biden or is it to become president? Claim you’ll beat Trump as well. You just come off as someone trying to take votes from Biden, rather than someone trying to beat Trump.
I am on board with whomever Biden picks. After the VP position is filled, there are MANY great women available to him for many important positions! I am EXCITED to see what jobs are assigned to whom!
⁦ too week to stand up to China!  Voting for Joe Biden is voting for the end of freedom
My choice is #Biden/Harris2020. I will, however, support whomever he chooses, 100%!!
Which Scientists? Should we have listened to Biden and kept the borders open? Or Nancy and met her for tea in Chinatown? Please. The deaths are on China and her lies.
What will he do if Biden walks in or get this guy endorsement.......
I have a joke about Biden but... it's, you know...the thing!
Dude, why do you want to beat off Joe Biden?
You’re doing what to Biden?!
Same here, although l think obama was far more evil whereas biden is just a dummy and went with the flow. Besides Obama is illegit. I'll never be convinced he was from anywhere but Kenya and mentored by a Marxist
So you’re not trying to beat trump you’re trying to beat Biden 😩🤔👎👎👎👎 you won’t get my vote #TeamBiden
Where are the photos of Biden. I’d like to see them. Change my mind
“I can beat Biden off...” - Kanye West
But that’s a feeling. Trump was good friends for decades with Epstein and has visit his island several times. And you think he had nothing to do with it. But Biden who has no pictures with him, is in on it.
Chris Smith R-NJ House foreign affairs committee wrote a bill to allow people to sue China for Causing The release of Covid 19. The other bill would establish a truth commission. Max Baucus Biden pushed him to be US Ambassador to China the fix is in vote Trump/Pence 2020
I’m on #TeamJoe! Add your name to say you’re on a Student for Biden today &gt;&gt;
Because Biden doesn’t try and start ww3 every five seconds, and illegals can’t because legal immigrants unless they are given the ability to wich you guys don’t like. And about felons... they just love trump
Personalities ,or POLICIES.  TRUMP VR BIDEN.  BIDEN fake or made up   POPOP personality ?  Biden policies far left progressive socialist.   PRESIDENT TRUMP POLICES FREEDOMS TO CHOOSE, AND CAPITLASIM .  TRUMP PERSONALITY NYC ROUGH AND TUFF BUT ANYBODY CAN CHANGE AS WE SEE.
I won't be voting for Biden in November.... Because I'll be voting for him in October thanks to early voting.
“Bass, 66, and Harris, 55, were both children of the civil rights movement and early supporters of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Both were the highest-ranking women this summer to lead police reform efforts in the House and Senate.”
Translation - isolating seems to be working for Biden. Think I’ll try it myself.
I am concerned about the cognitive function of his followers. Biden's moronic episodes only exist for defense against prosecution.  He has a seemingly compelling argument for a rubber room rather than a cell. He's running to avoid all Democrat prosecutions and sentences...
Why does Trump call Putin everyday? Does he know that Putin is not a Christian and does not believe in God and our Lord Savior Jesus Christ. Putin is evil and can not be trusted. Don't lecture us about Joe Biden. He is a good man.
I hear you. I feel the same but also feel/hope/believe that Biden will win and the repairs will begin. It must be...👍😢🙂😷
I think a lot of what people point to as mental decline are his speech problems, which he has had his whole life. But no, we have worse now, the difference is Biden is capable of having a staff that doesn’t cater to insanity
Im seeing people walking away from Dems all over, many Dems saying they won't vote for PedoJoe, and even lots of people saying they are voting for the first time ever and voting for Trump  Ive seen some saying they did vote Trump 2016 voting Biden, but not a lot
For those who speak Biden. We call it ENGLISH!
Let’s have the election first. My guess is that Biden is going to be the one who won’t accept the results of the election.
Sweetie if you want to be a Socialist then Vote for AOC as she's telling Crazy Joe Biden what to do!!
Might want to worry what’ll happen if Joe Biden gets elected
That will be exactly what happens if Biden gets in Somehow we've got to put TERM LIMITS FOR ALL on the ballot
49% support ! #Democrats will blame outside interference after #biden loses
More important than MJ's number, Cornyn is running three points ahead of Trump and that should be enough. Even if Biden wins Texas I doubt it will be by more than that.
I thought he was talking about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for a minute there
I would think Biden is also going up up for treason during the Trump spying situation.  He was party to Obama leading  the treasonous acts!  Would they send Biden to Leavenworth to serve his sentence?
Hey twerp, I am a 70 yo Democrat. I could hardly be called part of a left wing mob. No one wants to defund the police. Joe Biden is an honorable man. Of course you know nothing about honor.
I'm not trying to help the President, but I think his game was to compare himself to Biden and somehow look better, but that hasn't turned out how he wanted imo
Biden agreed to take a #CognitiveTest!
We need you to win big! Please debate Biden a lot, so all America can watch his unfortunate mental &amp; emotional decline...as long as he doesn’t refuse or make up an excuse not to debate you. We will miss you here in Jacksonville, but appreciate you looking out for our safety!
Strange that the incumbent thinks this is a good thing to campaign on. Shouldn't Biden be using these exact videos against Trump?
100% Bullshit  ... the Biden signs in my very red neighborhood say so.  #TrumpIsLosing #Biden2020Landslide

If Susan Rice gets Biden's VP slot, Valerie Jarrett will actually be the one running the show.  Obama appoints Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes to posts
Yes, when we look at the many achievements of Joe Biden over the last 50 years it has to be exciting.  He finished at the top of his class and has multiple degrees.  He is outstanding at making friends with those that can help him.  Really, all he has done is backslap and con.
Not this again you all really think if he had something on Obama,Obama and Biden would be in jail right now I’ll tell you what y’all keep waiting for it
The average American doesn’t want crime in the streets.... We want law and order.....You can’t spell triumph without Trump! Can’t wait until the Trump/Biden debates......
Biden Back to the defense of marriage act just so ya know.
Clinton had spent ~35% more $$ than Biden by this point. Similar fundraising figures.  (Tougher to compare incumbent cycle-over-cycle, as they raise/spend funds for years prior to re-election campaign.)
I hope prayers will help bring them to their senses. Walking away means you've already lost, and if  Biden wins nobody will be happy in the hell he plans for us all. People have to stand with Trump to save America.
Funny. I don't know any racists, and almost all my friends and family are Trump supporters. Never seen a Trump supporter online say anything pr do anything racist either.  Hmm I wonder where all the racists are hiding? Oh, yeah, they're probably on a Biden thread with other libs.
To be honest. I don’t understand the whole “Biden” must make a VP pick now. He’s being consistent in not announcing until August.  Also there’s been a lot of speculation in the past VP picks have dealt with the same I think a lot of negative media is coming from certain groups.
The Biden hats are going to be cool
I am quite certain that Biden will be happy to have a ceremony for Trump's hanging.
Funny cause I know several biden supporters that don't wear masks, as for myself I wear one but only because I don't need to worry if I'm entering a place if they require them or not, I've just excepted it, so I wear one everywhere but outside.
Like Joe Biden, half the time Biden doesn't know where he's at, but yes I've heard some of stuff, he's unorganized. People don't like trump because he sounds boring, personally I care less about how well u speak but your actions.
"Trump vs. Biden: Who’s winning the money race in your ZIP code?"
I think he said it was 2018.  Have no idea other than he’s convinced he will be perceived to have better cognitive skills than Biden who hasn’t had a cognitive test.
I've been seeing trump signs in yards but the houses all around those have biden signs. I think its the neighbors rebuking the trump signs.
-President Trump has drawn more donors across the conservative panhandle, SW FL &amp; Northeast FL.  -Mr. Biden was stronger in many parts of southeast Florida, a liberal, densely populated region.  ➡️via
That’s 100% Joe Biden

You mean sorta-like Biden?...
Young Blacks haven’t learned Biden’s Ulegy at David Duke’s funeral (Grand Wizard of KKK) or racist statements he’s made forever! He &amp; son Hunter extorting millions &amp; possibly BILLIONS frm China &amp; Ukraine!
Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting and promoting women’s rights. That's why I joined Women For Biden. Join women from across the country as we continue the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families.
Me too! But unfortunately, Chris Wallace is going to throw him softball questions, and give Biden the answers to the questions that Chris Wallace is to ask him. Its a rigged system. Just like 2016 election
What’s the point of this?  To ridicule him?  Go back to your mean girls clique.  This is not necessary.   I am a Republican woman for 42 years that voted for your Dad and I will be voting for your father’s friend.  White suburban women are supporting Biden.  #RepublicansForBiden
Joe Biden's disastrous plans for America's suburbs  via
Trump says: "Person, woman, man, camera, TV". Who brags about passing a cognition test? And they say Biden is senile.
#MarieBarf - I will bet you money right now if you can show me solid proof Joe Biden is leading Trump on anything - The Man is a Criminal for Gosh Sakes - What part don't you understand????
Biden will fix it. Unbelievable. 🙄
They sure would ask Obama or Biden and they would try to answer; Trump would just blow them off or insult them, as usual. 😖😔😷
Exactly?  When you specifically asked who other than Dr. Fauci?  Now I see why you vote for dudes like Joe Biden. They do the same stupid stuff for 50 years with nothing beneficial and it's ok. You boys are cheerleaders and not real thinkers.  Emotional cheerleaders.
Ok, then tell me  What should we do then? You not offering anything substantive my guy, other then “hurr durr Biden sucks”  Not voting in Nov isn’t an option.
That ought to pop up in every Biden speech between now and November.
Joe Biden knows what he is doing, Donald Trump does not!!!
Biden’s proposal is to increase the top bracket from 37% to 39.6%.
No more of your BS....stop trying to scare old ppl. Biden has experience and will not get rid of the police, but make it better.
I’ve been up this morning, catching up with mom! 🤗 We’ve been talking politics, and WHO is going to be Joe Biden’s VP pick. There have been some pretty impressive people make the multiple lists, released. Who do you think it will be?
It will take about two Biden terms and 1-2 Susan Rice terms
I don’t any that are, but I’ve seen several life long Democrats post they are voting Trump.  Biden is not the answer given his history and health issues.
- Good grief Andrew - all this discussion on the impact of the election if Biden wins.  Apart from tax cuts for the wealthy Trump has not been good for America. We have had a house of cards.
OMG! What pitiful and embarrising words from a former Jax sheriff. Oh, yeah, city was murder capital of FL while he was sheriff. He &amp; Trump obviously live in some alternative reality when it  comes to public safety. Replace them both. VOTE Deegan &amp; Biden.

We got you Joe Biden!!!
"Help Americans buy their first homes"! Where have I heard that? Oh yes, during the Clinton and W Bush years! It lead to the mortgage, housing, and financial collapse of 2007-2008, and resulted in Bush's TARP and Obama/Biden's stimulus. Sorry, but I don't want ANY more of that!
You only have two options? Trump or Biden? Nothing else?
I listen to various news forums but not Fox which is the epitome of fake news so yes, I have a clue what’s going on! If you support trump, good for you but that’s your problem. I want our new president to heal our country and eliminate divisiveness!  Biden will hopefully do that!
Biden has proposed measures to help Americans buy their first homes, raise the federal minimum wage and boost taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

I have seen exactly 1 Biden sign. Many many many MANY Trump signs. I'm on NE Florida.
Oh god, if debates happen. RIP Biden
Bravo! Well said! I match my monthly Biden donation to  for this precise reason!
Peaceful protests coming to the suburbs once Biden is elected.
Great!! Continue to work for Biden!!
Have Joe Biden show up at her desk with live streaming crew giving her notice of dismisssal and perhaps revert her to DOJ for ongoing cases. VP can do that too in continuing, coordinated efforts on other Trump criminal accomplices.
Sorry, we were swamped out by 73 year olds who, in their final Earthly act, wanted to stop Gen-Z from having healthcare and marijuana. They came out to vote for Biden like it was life or death. Can't do anything if much of the Dem Primary crowd is addicted to "news."
Biden needs to stop kissing China's butt and start blaming them for this virus instead of our President - He may want to lay some of that blame on #Obummer since he delivered it to the Wuhan Lab! #NoCoincidences
They are working overtime to elect Biden
We don't recognize "America" now. It's now being run by an international CRIMINAL enterprise. If Biden wins &amp; the Dems get the Senate, the crooks &amp; traitors will be going 2 prison. #RIPGOP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Is Biden the "Chaos Candidate"?
welcome to your city if you vote for Biden bunch of thugs brought to you by the Dem Party save us
I think it’s going to end up a lot closer,  it that it’s this large a margin says a lot imo. Hillary didn’t lose by that many votes, and the 2018 Senate/Gov races were extremely close, so Biden winning by a decent margin isn’t hard to picture.
did you catch Trump's briefing? Trump was going through a list of numbers and it seems like 600,000 ventilators was in his notes. He caught the error, stopped and immediately said that it was 600 new ventilators making the correction.  Contrast with Biden.
“Carlson Endorses Biden”
Can Biden ever escape Obama’s shadow? Can he think for himself. I would like to hear Biden’s “real” voice and ideas. Not what Pelosi wants him to say. Very disappointed with the dems “revenge” tactics and  hatred for Trump for 4 years. Out to get him attitude is not leadership
You mean the guy that you wouldn’t even endorse until everyone else was out of the primaries and even then you waited for a long time! Remember, you and Biden actions created Trump. Eight years wasted nothing for minorities or any strong legislation. #WalkAwayFromDemocRats
Neither Curry nor Trump cares about the citizens of our country, literally shut the fuck up. He only canceled because of Biden’s criticism on how poorly trump is handling the virus lmfao.
Why is Biden pledging allegiance to the foreign corporation UNITED STATES? That's the enemy from Rome! Are people this dumb? #biden2020 #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpHasNoCredibility #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #TraitorInChief #Biden2020Landslide #AmericaOrTrump
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
I’m lookin at it like joe Biden would turn a blind eye... or forget it was even happening because of his dementia
They are invisible like Joe Biden
I'm canceling my account because all I see on every other commercial is you bashing our President and praising Joe Biden it would be one thing if it was equal but I haven't seen one pro President Trump commercial on  it's unacceptable not everyone watching is a liberal
This the smartest decision he's made in 3 1/2 yrs. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares all of a sudden. Cases are spiking here in FL. He's only trying to save his worthless ass. Biden leads him here by 13 points !! To little to late Donnie !!
I disagree with Obama's &amp; Biden's politics but the former was mentally sound. Biden's had a long career but like many ppl his age he's showing signs of rapidly decreasing mental acuity. Trust me, when it starts things can go south fast. He shouldn't even be put in this situation.
Come on Dan you are a rat on a sinking ship. Biden nor any human politician will be perfect but why as a much respected veteran, and in my opinion war hero, are you continuing to support a horrible human being aka Trump? Fight the Dems over policy but pls be that better Rep.
Biden can still read?
Come on, you must be a shill. Biden never did anything for any Americans except get rich off our backs. He has no chance of winning the Presidency,  he cannot put together two coherent statements. #DeepStatePuppet
Meh, just a typical Joe Biden supporter.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.
Because Trump is insane, Libertarians can’t win and Biden can
Biden has a fucking mush brain. This era sucks
It's interesting, and I RTd the "Warren-Policy Ear" article earlier, even thought maybe it could be Rice.  Gut keeps bringing me back to Harris, especially after reading the stuff on how close she was with younger Biden.
I have no idea what prompted this latest “gaff”. This man has NO business running for anything. And the new polls out, Fox showed, claiming Trump’s behind him are as laughable as the inane things Biden says. Well it would be laughable except there are a few people voting for him.
America as we knew it was destroyed 4 years ago. Stop the chicken little nonsense. President Biden is happening so wait for it. Along with President Obama taking your guns &amp; creating death panels. 🙄
Jeezus. Biden is up 13 points in FLORIDA?
Maybe, but if there’s no Republicans left for a majority we can get policy onto Biden’s desk a ton easier then Trump
I want our country to be in the competent hands of an experienced leader. That's why I voted for Hillary Clinton, that's why I voted for Obama, that's why I voted for Joe Biden, Florida 2020 Presidential Primary Election, ready to mail; deadline August 18, 2020. Dem since JFK.
Who did they ask? I live here and don’t know a living (see what I did there) soul who’s voting for Biden.

Best thing to come out of it was your concession to having the RNC here in Jax. You say you were doing the right thing but we here in Jax know our City Council and Sheriff opposed it. Don't know what polls you were looking at but we didn't want you here. #duval #VoteBlue #Biden
Patriotic Women are so beautiful, which you know absolutely nothing about! The only thing fake is the little plastic Joe Biden dildo that vibrates you to sleep every night!!
Of course that would be the best way but I'm sure the Democrats will come up with some excuse before allowing Biden on stage with Trump!
I'm voting for Biden because all my dead ancestors will be.
They may do the Debates via Satellite - It could work - Biden needs to get front and center in his fight for the President - Then everyone will know who to choose!
You're an absolute lunatic.  We don't need a law and order candidate in the WH.  We need a REAL PRESIDENT.  You Go Biden.  Bye, bye.  Can't wait to see you go.
Wonderful!  Biden is for me.

People need to start waking up and using their brain for more than just trying to understand Biden, Antifa or BLM's point of view. I think there's plenty of time for that in court.
I live in Jacksonville.  Although I believe Biden is up, no way by this margin.  I think it’s closer to 5%.
Fake Polls for Fake Presidential Candidate #basementjoebiden
Biden may very well win FL, but no, no one is winning FL by double digits.
Biden is using Warren's slogans and plans. Obama is echoing her call for big structural reforms. She remains a popular choice, if not the top choice, among voters. Leaving  out again, as Hillary did in 2016, is just wrong.
You know, Biden’s thing!!

Well remember that Trump is only 3 years “younger” than Biden, so basically whoever wins in November will be hovering around 80 at the end of his term. And I agree, that is a problem.
The fact that they have Trump leading Biden on the economy makes me think there's some accuracy to the top line number.
Trump still ahead of Biden on the economy and losing by 13 is something.
Biden is not fit to be president at all😂
Age is not a determinant of capability. Look at Ronald Reagan. Let’s get off the “Biden is too old” horse. Joe actually cares about America, and us Americans. He will restore dignity to the White House and to this country.
Teaser | President Obama and Vice President Biden: A Socially Distanced ...  via  Aww shit😳
Biden Is a smart man, he literally said “we will put 720 million women back in the work force” the population of the US is 300 million😂😂, He also said we have 120 million dead from Covid, he wants to raise taxes, he literally said, the first thing i’ll do is take away tax cuts
No, Obama did not immediately endorse Biden.  It's called "respect for the process".  He did not want to bias the results....something you know nothing about.
. . . . Sike. Not voting for Biden or Trump. You can't change my mind.
Thanks  💞
That’s what they get now, little more than half or like 65~ish% but if Biden gets elected the taxes will be over 50%
Check out my thoughts on why Joe Biden needs to have a Black woman as his running mate!
If Biden wins, we may not see January 21.    I have a sickening feeling that the probability of that increases as  Trump continues to drop in the polls.
Wrong! These are liberals, Biden's ppl, throwing temper tantrums ONLY in blue states, allowed by Dem mayors to do this shit. And they are crying because Trump wants to stop them.  This is BIDEN"S MESS!
I hate Joe Biden too.
This is bullshit that's ONLY happening in Biden loving BLUE states that want to defund the police where their governors and mayors wont let cops do their jobs. Biden wants to weaken cops nationwide so ALL CITIES will look like this! It's not that hard to understand.
Watch “A Socially Distanced Conversation: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden” on YouTube
can we stop calling Joe Biden sound bytes “Snippets” and start calling them “Sniff-it’s?”
Absolute bullshit! He's perfectly clear and always makes sense. A miracle considering how much pressure he's under.  Biden can't speak without a teleprompter and wants to get out of debates because they know he can't debate Trump.
Yeah fuck the libs for selling us out the fascism. Their protests will get crushed or biden will make things “normal” but the system will not change, leading to further mass death from our global imperialist policies and foreign wars of aggression.
I like to think that Biden’s America wouldn’t involve people attacking peacefully protesting mom’s like the current America. I’m willing to take that chance.
Biden is called the modern Linden B Johnson because of how racist they both are.  said this
He looks and sounds depressed himself.  Ted Cruz-You need President Joe Biden to give you a reason to shave again.
Why have you alk turned.  HOW XAN A. HOSTOON 5 CALL MY PRESIDENT A RACIST.  BIDEN NOT A RACIST.
At least Trump will make China accountable for what it did to the world with Covid-19.  Democrats will no and cannot do shit about it, since they made fortunes off China. China owns Biden!! - or what’s left of Zbifen since she’s mentally gone in 10 months.
Joe Biden couldn't find my town with Google maps and turn-by-turn directions.

Well Biden is currently under investigation in the Ukraine......so there's that. You want the press, the same press that lost a multimillion dollar lawsuit  to a 16 year old for slander, to vet people.....JUST WOW
Taxes are only going to get worse if Biden gets elected... he’s said it multiple times

Biden and Obama both need to be Lock up .
I would count your blessings that you don’t have a Democratic Governor allowing anarchy while stealing away your rights.  Trump is the only leader that can get the economy going.  Biden is losing his mind and hasn’t done anything in office of note in 40 yrs.  🤷‍♂️
For the life of me, I can't understand how Biden's wife allows her husband to be a cardboard puppet, at the will of a group of people in the background! How does a wife do that? Oh, I forgot about Hillary allowing Bill to have his various "outlets" and shenanigans!
I just watched a  campaign ad on tv. Bullshit accusations of  Guy speaking saying that Biden absolutely said he wanted to defund the police, while showing some of the violence between protesters and police. Trump’s voiceover... he approves this message.
thinking abt how biden said trump is our first racist president,,,, who’s gonna tell him abt andrew jackson
Would you not say that Biden is a racist when all he’s going to pig is a black female what happened to the white females and white man or a black man Biden is definitely a racist
I've had turtle meat. I didn't know what it was (long story), was handed a plate of it at my first Navy squadron, thought it was chicken. I loved it.  Sorry, Biden has nothing on fried turtle.
Biden release his tax to fair and honest to ALL Americans. Why doesn't Trump do the same? He said is honest, prove it!
So if it was about Joe Biden it would be bad for him but because it’s Trump bragging about passing the dementia test 2 years ago, it’s just sickos. Love that maga worm brain logic
I am genuinely concerned about the aftermath of the upcoming presidential election... not just if 45 is re-elected, but also if he's not. How will 45's cult react if Biden wins? Law enforcement has already shown they will shy away from the angry white mob.
Communist Socialist Monopoly......what you will get with voting Biden.
Biden said DAY 1, NOT number 1...

"Biden's America" or what Trump's propagandists wants us to believe it will be is happening now underHas anyone floated Rachel Dolezal? She fits the requirements Biden set forward, no?

Good ‘ol Joe Biden as I remember him Best. Enjoy🦹‍♂️
The FBI and U.S. Justice Department say a Tampa teen masterminded the massive Twitter hacking in July that included Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Kanye West, and several other celebrities and tech CEOs and companies. He's being charged as an adult.
Trump is courting them. Biden is not. In 2016 Hillary did not push for campaign events in Tampa. Trump did. Im getting bad flashbacks.
This is the same thing the Far Leftist want to do here. Puppet Joe Biden would let it happen.
if Trump is terrified he is going to lose against Biden why do you say everyone has to vote hmmm
This is who will debate Biden
He follows a lot of people, including VP Biden and many other athletes &amp; politicians.
It wasn't a eulogy, it was a shameful display. By the way, Obama isn't running, Biden is and he is senile. Trump in a landslide.
Biden needs to campaign hard in FL by calling Trump a caudillo or dictator. Biden needs to campaing in FL more.
4.00 pm "If you elect #JoeBiden there will be blood shed, disorder in the streets and lots of crime".........(he just changed his name to Biden. STUPID TRUMP! It's happening under YOUR presidency
Speak for your self, most Floridians I know, including myself, are voting for Biden and can’t stand #ImpotusAmericanus
I'm guessing this is who Joe Biden calls?
Liar again  your a failure Florida for Biden
Liar. Democrats have had a bill passed since may   Your a failure. Florida for Biden
Biden's VP will most definitely be better then Biden himself so yeah. But can I still hope that Biden doesn't get the nom and we go with his VP instead?
Your grasping at straws. Pathetic your a fraud and a looser  Florida for Biden
trump is so bored when he attacks biden. he doesnt have nearly the energy he did when going after hillary.
Neither is Biden or the Democrats.   So this is just a plain stupid tweet.
Even after Biden is sworn in, yes. Lots of racists to monitor.
You are soooooo right.  Soooooooooooo right.  Then Trump is going to blame Biden because Biden will have to raise taxes to make ends meet.  There is nothing backing American money. NOTHING.
I asked Mayor Jerry Demings about his wife, Rep. Val Demings, being in the running for Biden's VP pick. Demings says Val is ready for the job and would be great. He says they haven't heard she is out of the running so they're hopeful. Biden is expected to make his pick next week.
The latest things are the police and BLM . I am for making thinking better . How they r doing it is not . I do not agree with the immigration policy they want . I always felt I was more down the middle but now I am more right . I do not agree with Biden capital gains tax.
I saw five people on the side of the road waving Biden signs in Marion county last weekend.  Nothing yet in Orlando.
We’re not safe now.  We were safer from 2009-2016 so I’ll take a chance on Biden!
seeing people talk about these people like a magic reset button's going to be hit if biden wins while over 150,000 people are dead will do that.
Old news.  Went out the window when Biden was accused.
Will be close ... 1-2% but that would be in a FL Biden +7 scenario...
guys theyre going to hit biden on boat parades. game. changed.
Who’s Hiden Biden?
It wouldn’t surprise me if liberal Biden critics saw this and said:  “What about Muslims who aren’t his friends or neighbors!? #bidenisracist”
And they follow that up by nominating Biden.  Literally anyone else on the Dem podium would have been significantly better.  More corporatist BS.  More income inequality.
why are you having Biden’s wife on Fox?  Where is Trumps wife? She should be the first 1 to interview since she’s our First Lady.  Don’t care to hear what Biden’s wife says .Bad enough listening to Biden on Fox. She will have plenty of stations to visit like CNN
As much as I trust Biden not sniffing a little girl’s hair.
per trump  Bernie: "Joe! For the love of God, I beg of you, please offer some sensible, moderate positions"  Biden: "Shaddap you neolib shill! God love ya, we're going full communist, folks. I'm talking red revolution ladies and gentlemen."
Yesterday while he was eulogizing John Lewis I couldn’t help but think what if Biden blew it out of the water and picked Barry (had he not already committed to choosing a female running mate)? Wouldn’t THAT make 🍊🤡 eat his 🎩🤣
whoever had "actually biden is to bernie's left" on your trump 2020 bs bingo card, feel free to punch your ticket today
Something to consider:  What if Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump are all guilty of sexually assaulting women and children?  I see a whole lot of finger pointing between "camps" as if "their guy" isn't involved in Jeffery Epstein's crimes.   #Election2020 #maga #Democrat
trump at a white house event is claiming biden is way to bernie's left. just insane, losing rambling.
There are videos of Biden “diddling” kids?
The problem is what the left wants went to far and for me it’s not about liking trump it’s about loving America! And Biden is in no shape to run a country. The things he has said he wants to do is nuts also . This is why people will vote Republican nothing to do with Trump
I wonder how many major pieces of legislation the people who call Joe Biden "mediocre" have passed. Or how many dictators they have stood up to. Or how many right-wing justices they have prevented. Or how many economic recoveries they have overseen.
Im glad you are supporting Joe Biden, but how in god's name do you justify voting for a blatant racist who ridiculed the disabled and had 13 rape allegations against him? All before last election.
Obama took Biden aside. He looked him directly in the eyes.  "Joe, I'd like to talk to you about the Black Nationalist Marxist Initiative..."  *Avengers music swells*
IT’S AUGUST AND THERE IS NO STRATEGY TO FIGHT COVID 19 IN AMERICA OR IN BRAZIL. TWO FAILED INCOMPETENT DESPOTS!! BIDEN 2020 🇺🇸
Biden says we won't have to worry about his tweets. I wouldnt. I would be far more worried about the valid concern over taking car keys away from you.
can someone out there get me some photoshops of biden wearing a dashiki or on m'baku's throne from black panther, were really gonna do this?
It makes me sad that Biden’s family is allowing this charade to continue. My dad had dimentia. The signs are there.
So what was probably an accurate record of a Biden campaign moment is now seen as propaganda by the trump-corrupted leadership at VoA. Got it.
When does Biden start getting read in on security briefings???
Biden is a placeholder in my view.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
Not Biden. Democrats have caused racism &amp; division to thrive, and Biden himself has given into corruption. Trump is #DrainingThatSwamp. Biden has no accomplishments, has given into the far left mental disorder of wanting nothing for American but all for "ME ME ME". #FourMoreYears
This is actually true. Of the many things I’m worried about that a Biden Presidency would bring, his twitter account is the least of my concerns. It’s behind “if he can remember what he had for breakfast” and “will Bingo Night become a thing at the White House”.
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
Nice speech by Hussein but he's so IGNORANT he doesn't even know what rules were initiated by the Democrats or Republicans.  LMAO!!! He like Joe Biden makes a fool out of himself every time he speaks !
Epic fail: Sean Hannity fails at making fun of Jie Biden. He’ll still become your president, fool.

Do people who vote Libertarian take votes away from Trump or Biden?
Where is Joe Biden?
So when is Chris interviewing Biden?????
looking expectantly at biden rn
Never liked him in first place to be honest. Michelle Obama was a more acting VP than Biden. What’s going for him right now is that his opponent is more of a POS than he is. I’ll wait until 2024 to acknowledge a president if we actually get one from that election.
A vote for Biden/Bernie will: Re-establish relations with Castro Cuba Support Venezuela dictator Maduro Restore Chi-com dominance of our economy Open our southern border Eliminate America first trade deals  Restore Iranian nuclear debacle Restore Chi-com WHO dominance More....
JUST THE FACTS:  Obama bought Iran with pallets of $$$ Obama\Biden\Hillary\Rice lied about Benghazi.  Still do. Obama's tutor is a radical leftist america-hating lib Obama started the FAILED Russia hoax Obama married Michael
Is it possible that they finally realized how ridiculous it was to warn of violence in “Biden’s America” with footage from... Trump’s America?
If he wins? It’s a must or this country is doomed!Prepare your passports if Biden wins. Biden doesn’t have a clue and who knows who he will choose for VP. Trump is the man for our USA! Think of everything he did the 1st yr in office. An office that he took over already screwed up
Already a better presidential candidate than Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
You already do. Bernie has influenced Biden’s platform, he talks to Elizabeth Warren weekly.
Oh! Biden/Obama created lots of jobs...IN CHINA!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Lol we obviously aren’t in the same circles. Tho Trump gets hella hate now cuz he’s the current PRES, Biden is being called “Jim Crow Joe” amongst the youth ... and he and many leaders’ hands are not clean.
Well Biden was not president, TRUMP is and we have 150k dead because of his mismanagement and stupidity.

Joe Biden says Trump’s failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
Remember . . . what would Dems have done different . . . keep in mind Biden and other Dems called the China travel bans xenophobic. And . . . our economy was record strong BEFORE the virus using policies Dems voted against.
if biden wins he should commit to conducting the census for real, to overcome all the bs trump threw up and the virus. no reason we can't do a real census in 2022. the count is vital to our future.
I down biden can tweet. This was written by one of his handlers

Oh we will know a clue who has won because the numbers will be overwhelming in favor of Biden but while we are waiting for at least a week you can begin packing your bags.
Actually this has always been going on. Trump has given the supremacists cover to surface more. They are paying people to destruct to smear peaceful demos. Biden is about to win so the $hit show goes on.
After Biden wins I'm quitting social media for an extended period of time, not watching the news for an extended period of time, and up the drinking an extended amount in celebration of having the #orangeshitstain out of office and out of our lives.
Hey Mr entitled. No one cares. But I know everyone wouldn't  let Biden near their teenage daughters.  Damn baby sniffer.
Joke is on the Karen who posted her ignorance on FB. She promoted more business to the Pizza restaurant. Rep. don't go bashing people with Biden flags. Side by Side the world can agree Rep. Are the tolerant ones. Dems just look like whinnie babies.
A new name for Candidate Joe Biden. -Uncle Mumbles 🤪🤡
I like how Joe Biden is following 26 accounts: 25 political accounts + Lady Gaga.
No one cares,  Trump 2020.  I am an independent and can’t afford to pay Biden’s tax increases.  Also he is scary, can’t imagine what he would say in situations that he needs to keep secret.   Remember 2011, he almost had all those seals killed.  Dope!
#Resistance   VOTE FOR BIDEN!!  Let's elect decency and the rule of law back into power.  Let us regain our global standing.  One thing that Mitt Romney was right about - Russia is our enemy &amp; now China has the globsl upper hand.

With Biden the storm troopers will be more diverse, the APC's and unmarked vans will run on biofuel, and you can use whatever bathroom you'd like at the black site detention camp.

You fucked it up and my entire life has been upended. Everyone I know even the Republicans are voting for Biden to get you out.
Tucker Carlson can fuck all the way off. Nobody says that about Obama.  Can't wait til we have a President Biden and these neophytes STFU.
and the establishment elites chose the weakest candidate in the 2020 Race period, a republican rapist with dementia, so if #Biden looses it's on them &amp; NOT on me, you keep that kind of voter shaming $hit. 🗳️4 Trump= 🗳️ 4 Trump 🗳️4 Joe=🗳️4 Joe The left votes POLICY.

I agree. Biden is toast.
Jo - ya I would do that.  Biden puke.  But - troll away then I say .. troll away
Don’t care. Biden will be President.
Bingo. Biden can’t find his ass with both hands.
Right!!! Biden is creepy AF!!
It will be known when all legally cast votes are counted. Could be that night. Biden in a landslide.
At the first debate,  should hand  a phone and challenge him to Tweet something. Biden has no idea what is going on.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you mean an election speech for Biden
Yep    says Biden wins in a SLAM DUNK.
No we won’t. A low key racist, incrementalist like Joe isn’t the harbinger of sweeping reforms we desperately need, and protestors aren’t delusional enough to believe that he is. I DESPISE the “lesser of two evils” argument. But when the greater of two evils is Trump? ✅ Biden
Exactly like you call a successfull black man and its obvious why bc your racism runs deep. All you try and do is misdirect and sorry ppls opinions are not fact. I provided you a list of factual racist things Biden has done.u cannot give me one factual thing of trump being racist
Just look st Bidens political history. All kinds of racist actions.
Biden is a conservative neo-liberal who promised our corporate plutocracy nothing would change so... makes sense. Let's see how replacing the progressives with Never-Trumpers pans out.
Biden said he would announce his VP pick around August 1st, right?
Traveling all over the Midwest haven’t seen one Biden sign lots of this!
Biden is a racist. Hiw many other white liberals would call a successful black man a NOBODY. I swear white liberals are some of the most racist ppl I've ever encountered. What would you call these black ppl?
Trump's with it! He knows how to tweet even before he was elected. He knows how to read other tweets and share what matters most. He knows what science says, what doctors are saying, but you Biden, are led around by doctors and told what to say, and you still mess it up! #Worried
Joe Biden isn't even the one tweeting! We never worry about  tweets! He uses them to drain the very swamp, the "Establishment" that Biden is caught up in! We are thankful for his tweets, his openness, him doing everything he can for America. #MAGA #KAG #4MoreYears

Act like Biden is trailing by 20 points.
I know a little about everything. Unlike u, I would die for my country! I TRULY believe president Trump has been touched by the hand of the Lord! What makes me sick, is its clear Trump is being cheated out of a fair election victory and I refuse to recognize biden in that case.
Now Biden needs to get out of his basement and campaign now that the polls are tightening.
The race usually narrows around this time. I tried to tell ppl gloating abt Biden's lead...
I am a mom and a FL educator who will definitely be voting for Biden who doesn’t court the NRA.
if we speaking in terms of how they are seen by others not personally it’d easily be biden. people are calling him the last resort but for hillary there was a lot of people who actually wanted her in office.
the economy is plunging and cnn is happy finally you all thinking impeachment and cnn daily bombshell did not work so you guys think well we finally have the recipe to bring him down if Biden wins anarchy that’s going on now will be on steroids
Why we have the term NIGGER.
To all these imbeciles that claim "President Trump has divided America"If Biden sleazes his way into the White House, they will see genuine division! They will see millions of pissed off  Patriots storm Washington and over throw the Globalist coup.  By force! Give me liberty!!!
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
What Does Susan Rice Bring to a Biden Ticket?
The District Attorney is up for re election. The national spotlight was focused on her. Like Joe Biden who is backtracking like crazy on prohibiting fracking nationwide, she has seen the writing on the wall.
Just say it, Mr President. Just flat out say you hate black and brown people. Be specific. Your disgusting base will love it, and it will finally galvanize those still having a tough time swallowing the Biden pill to vote Dem in November.
We saw in 2016 when Dems went overboard trying to pretend Hillary's horrible track record was worth defending in the name of blanket "feminism" &amp; we've seen in gross amounts with Biden &amp; recently Kamala Harris as people start washing her horrid record for a possible VP pick
We will remember him as the Food Stamp President, and Joe Biden was his right-hand man.
Just to let you know, here in Florida, there are lots of Biden sign and flags all over!!! We are turning Florida blue!
If he didn't receive foreign dirt on Biden, he should say so. If he did and turned it over to the FBI he should say so. Instead, he said (effectively) no comment. What's Nunes hiding?  via

#WeWillVote I’m registered to Vote by Mail &amp; will vote for Joe Biden.
Biden overperforming Cooper just tells me this poll is suspect
Biden wants to make America remember how it feels to be anything close to united, to love again, to drive this hate this country has out, to bring us together instead of divide us.
it seems like the overwhelming number of Dem primary voters, including me, chose to believe him.  You can continue to moan about what he said to his donors. I’ll vote for candidates that will help to achieve Biden’s proposed policies instead 🤷🏻‍♂️
His website has a 37 point platform with actual ideas for helping this country. Donald has his past accomplishments and a gift shop at his. Biden won’t tweet white power videos, spend almost 300 days at his private golf clubs, and make millions off of taxpayers.
Biden wants to actually lead and unite this country out of the darkness we are hurling towards, to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporate, to actually address the pandemic instead of wishing it away, he has an actual plan for racial equality, an actual plan for doing ANYTHING
As for “Real Policy”, Biden’s promise to establish a public option to expand healthcare access, reform the justice system(eg: eliminate private prisons &amp; ending cash bail), raise the minimum wage &amp; provide free community college is is already more than Bernie will ever accomplish
I did not address your claims of “imperialism from Biden” simply because it was ludicrous.  Joe Biden, who has repeatedly vowed to reinvigorate traditional partnerships with likeminded countries &amp; has promised to reenter the Iran nuclear deal, is a imperialist? LMAO.
Remember when Biden said Trump was going to try and delay the election and MAGAs were like “LOL NO WAY. JOE HAS DEMENTIA LOL”, but now Trump is saying he wants to delay the election &amp; MAGAs are like “we should delay the election”.  Remember that. Remember that when it happened.
So Biden has lost support in that poll. Looks like polls are tightening.
I’m an Obama Biden Democrat and I’m proud to say it! Make America Great Again! Vote for  ! We shall overcome! 🙏🇺🇸💙
... which seems like it was a pretty even playing field.  3) Biden’s base contained much more POC &amp; working class voters.  Take swing state Michigan as an example. Non white voters supported Biden by 55%-32% &amp; non-college educated voters supported Biden by 54%-38%.
On running America like a business: In business, if you act like an idiot, you lose money. In government, if you act like an idiot, 100,000+ people die, and 30+ million lose their jobs.  But you can try to blame Obama for it. #TrumpPandemic #Trumpocalypse
1) The media buried Biden after NH. No one was crowing that “he was the only one who could beat Trump” 2) All other candidates endorsed him? Lmao. Do remember that coming into Super Tuesday, there were two major moderate candidates  (Bloomberg &amp; Biden) and two progressive ones...
Right? And that swagger, though! That’s my President! Still proudly wearing my Obama/Biden t-shirts from both elections! 🙏💙🇺🇸

I am a trumper - but no to delaying the election. That will make me vote Biden.
That’s fine. Delay the election. Trump is out of office on Jan 20th at noon anyways if he isn’t re-elected. No election just means no trump or Biden. Win-win for me.
Your right, the economy would NEVER have contracted under a Hillary shutdown, NO ONE would have lost their jobs if Democrat led this pandemic. Ignore 3 years of success. Heck even Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic, clearly we'd be better off . . .
Every moment you spend tweeting is a moment you're not phonebanking for biden.   Hop to it, or it's your fault trump wins.
Obama/Biden handled this hands down a billion times better...no doubt
Like Joe Biden?
Today we honor the life of an American hero. A man who spent his life fighting for equality. A man who supported Joe Biden for President. A man who’s REAL opinion mattered. A man who’s life mattered. He wasn’t a “sellout black puppet.” It’s a shame you can’t value him. #JohnLewis
That's actual footage, cupcake.  Biden likely has Alzheimer's, and it's getting worse.
Biden never undermined democracy and became an authoritarian. He help fixed the economy the last time republicans tanked it and we will do it again
Politico really doesn't want Kamala Harris as VP. Must mean she's the correct choice as she makes old white men scared. They're also really giving Dodd a rub and tuck.
Today .. I’ll be there with my Biden button!
You’re right. I’d still take Biden over her.
Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
well, when Barr goes on a world tour, looking for people to spew dirt on Biden or disprove the Russian elections hack, that's kinda factual....
As Biden Nears VP Pick, Demings' Police Career is Reexamined
This is slander - the person(s) controlling Biden’s twitter account are just typical manipulative socialists. Biden isn’t capable of tweeting, much less speaking, a complete cohesive sentence.
Kanye: I heard you had tiny hands  Trump: I saw your video with kim, you got a tiny something else  Biden: where am i?
Support Joe Biden...not pizza.  Joe is a winner &amp; Trump is a BIG ....
For God’s sake, Biden &amp; Bolshevik Bernie are on VIDEO admitting they wouldn’t have done anything to stop Covid regardless and we wouldn’t have even known about it. Only reason we even know of it and doing anything is because “Trump is POTUS and we must play games regardless.”
My opinion is that Trump knows it will be harder for certain demographics to get to polling places to vote in person versus by mail AND that those people would tend to vote for Biden.  If they still want to vote, he is willing to let them risk their lives...literally.
Voting for Biden and helping get the monster out of the WH is in no way a wasted vote
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
I don't think Trump is going to do so well in the world, because he has no plan for the virus or his campaign. (except to bash Biden).
Threaten to suspend it and then see how fast this mail in voting stops. This corona is serious stuff. The Dumbacrats say you don’t take it seriously and don’t do enough . Biden is stuck in his basement. You can’t do rallies and cancelled the RNC. Suspend the election. !!!!
And Biden is going to whoop your ass in November. Make sure your bags are packed my guy. #Biden2020
When do you think the first conspiracy theory will start that Herman Cain was killed by Dems, Clintons, Soros, deep state, Fauci, Biden, MSM, etc?  Who will make the first idiotic tweet?
CrazyTown Extended - Joe Biden Edition  via
All these things can be true at the same time: - Trump is morally unfit for office. - Biden is morally unfit for office. - Trump has helped millions of Americans. - Trump has ignored the plight of millions of human beings. - The only good thing about Biden is that he isn't Trump.
Joe Biden doesn’t like black women. RACIST!!!
Remember when Alyssa Milano suddenly discovered due process when Joe Biden was accused?
I’m not against NATO, but the other countries have to meet their obligations, or by their actions they are saying they don’t care about NATO. Reagan comparisons aren’t valid as the USSR doesn’t exist and no one sees that China is that new threat yet. Even ppl like Biden
upset that Biden backers can't vote Absent Minded...
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!
Same. Plus I want to vote FOR policies that I agree with. The issues surrounding Trump and Biden are much worse than the ones surrounding Hawkins.
Duck Dynasty star hits Biden 'hypocrisy,’ abortion flip-flop
There is 0 reason for u to get involved. These r peaceful protesters until guys in unmarked vans pull up n snatch citizens off the street with no explanation. Man I can't wait to see u locked up for 'crimes against humanity'. Biden is gonna sick his AG on u and u goin go bye bye!
Such priorities in the middle of a global pandemic! Biden 2020
So, yesterday...Biden had not one, but TWO bouts of verbal diarrhea while Trump flew to Texas, gave an AMAZING speech and flew back to Washington to work the rest of the day. Not even gonna be close in November. Have a wonderful day all you very fine triggered Liberals!
re herman cain's death  the trump people - including his son - keep attacking biden for not having traditional campaign events.   joe biden's campaign events never killed anyone. trump's rally did.
President Trump, and the rest of the free world leaders, will make the Chi-coms pay for what they have done to the world economies, &amp; the death that they wrought throughout the world. Does anyone think that Joe Biden is capable, or even willing to confront the Communist Chinese?
Trump is back! You are back on the top of the most idiotic statement of the day after Louie Gohmert, took it yesterday.  Thank you for your mental and verbal diarrhea, making the Joe Biden's Presidency a fact!! #WorstPresidentInHistory  #jailfortrump2021 #TrumpMeltdown
It might - this could be some virus that eats the brains of liberals. It might explain Biden’s condition...  NEWS ALERT: Dems attempt to turn Trump supporters into ZOMBIES but end up catching their own disease.   WE are immune due to overwhelming evidence of intelligence.
You are back on the top of the most idiotic statement of the day after Louie Gohmert, took it yesterday.  Thank you for your mental and verbal diarrhea, making the Joe Biden's Presidency closer and closer. #WorstPresidentInHistory  #jailfortrump2021 #TrumpMeltdown
Keep the poor where they are at and keep the colored away from white suburban areas got it  you're going to lose to Biden n that's sad cuz he sucks dick, less than you but nonetheless

And push for a healthcare system that is not directly tied to employment so people keep their healthcare aka single-payer #MedicareForAll  Sadly, Biden isn't that guy.
Yes, we rather protest with Biden in the WH.
Way to go. Looks like you are not going to let the fact that Joe Biden is senile from stopping you from voting for him. Very revealing
Suburban, white, woman, mom, wife, antifascist voting for Biden. Oh, and I'm a Floridian. #SuburbsForBiden
Biden in April:  "Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.”
There is nothing that they can “uncover” about  Biden or his son  that would make me vote for DJT. Nothing.
None of Biden’s victims listen to him either in private.
Most likely she was cloned when she went into hospital in 18(?) for 2 weeks for cancer? That’s pretty quick for an octogenarian to get over cancer! If they had her clone ready it’s about right. They need updates so her getting sick fits. Biden needs updates often too. DJT knows.
Obama and Biden started locking kids in cages, it's a fact. Another fact there is nothing peaceful about the protests in Portland, Seattle and maybe all the murders in Chi-town.... I apologize if you are blind &amp; deaf
yes the economy tanked, thousands are dead, and trump is getting his butt kicked in polling  but JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER HAD A BOAT PARADE.
I'm over here cheering for a Joe Biden campaign commercial like I'm cheering for a football game
i hope theres somebody dedicated to yelling at joe biden 24-7-365 to ignore the deficit bs from the gop.
We just sent back ours! 7 votes for BIDEN 2020!!!
Riden with Biden‼️
New poll shows Biden with just a 4-point lead over Trump in Florida
Joe Biden and cohesive thoughts. Two things you don’t often see in the same sentence.
Bumbling Biden in rare form. Stayed tuned . Plenty more to come
Means basement Biden wants slavery to return.
A couple of months ago my mom was watching Good Morning America. It was so....... empty. A good 90% of it was just... Nothing. Then I realized who watches this: the elderly and stay-at-home moms &amp; dads. The kind that vote for Biden.
I need to run Trumps campaign.  Here’s a new add: show Biden yesterday not knowing where he is or what year it is. Close add showing Biden being helped walking by a nurse. Stuff writes itself
But you must also see that Joe Biden shouldn’t be allowed to live by himself ....
They could say the same thing about Mayor Pete, or really any VP pick seeing as Biden will only be able to serve one term at most. So whoever he picks they will be the default dem nominee in 2024.
Biden 2020 . Is this Iowa or Delaware? What am I running for?
As a born and raised Floridian, I do not have faith in the polls showing Biden leading the state. The reasons why; Scott, Rubio, DeSantis, Gaetz, Yazoo Yohoo whatever, Osceola County, The Villages, Panhandle, Seminole County, Jacksonville.
I do not care who Biden nominates, any woman of color will face the same challenges here in the south where it's still 1937. I will vote for Biden to get us out of this disaster, and focus on ideal candidates in 2024.
The result is a much smaller lead for Biden than last week’s Quinnipiac University poll that gave Biden a 13-point lead.
Harris slept her way to her present position.  That is the primary reason Biden is considering her as VP.
Make the commandments he’s broken??? Btw we are all sinners my friend we do it everyday. It’s sad cause Biden has cognitive issues he will be crushed in the debate if he shows up. Then he will never make the Bernie Bro’s happy he’s in a tough spot
Thank you for the morning motivation to vote and work for Joe Biden #biden2020

I will proudly vote in person for Joe Biden
WHO WILL IT BE? Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would name his running mate in the first week of August.
Another win for your owner. Putin. Don’t worry folks Biden is going to fix this.
Having said that i'm still mad at Pamela Harris 4 attacking Biden in that early debate like she did even though he wasn't my choice. If this is a barrier to the close relationship needed then he should choose someone else. Val Demings for instance.
So a "newsperson" manages to capture the scoop - takes a picture of Joe Biden's personal notes &amp; media decides it's newsworthy. Do you suppose that "newsperson" would take a picture of Biden brushing his teeth or with a camera that penetrates clothing?
Brother turn off CNN &amp; MSNBC really he’s not a racist m, a jerk and conceited yes a womanizer most definitely but he’s really not a bad guy the Left has only 2 senators you forgot about the gay man on his cabinet as well look at Biden’s racial remarks 1977-

I wasn’t a biden supporter but surprisingly there was no one in the 22 candidates that really instilled confidence and experience for what this moment calls which is a statesman/woman that is a commodity.
Liberal Racists Think that if you are black or brown you therefore cannot be affluent and live in suburbs.   More JOBS is the only way to get more people who can afford to move out of Liberal police-less crime-infested cities.   Joe Biden will ensure people can't afford to move
YES!!  SUSAN RICE is the best choice as Joe Biden running mate and VP!

Conservatives are banned constantly from all platforms. You think it's bad now, it will be 10x worse if Biden wins. This isn't about just you, it's about our country as a whole. You flip flop constantly and then wonder why no one has your back.
"Poor kids are just as bright as white kids" -Joe Biden
"Poor kids are just as bright as white kids" -Joe Biden
Find me 1 place were Biden says he will defund the Police.   Because there is no such a place, just a doctored misleading TV campaign by Trump.  Also show me evidence of Biden being corrupt.   Why there are no indictments against Biden?
Not a hypocrite at all. But if you vote for Biden you are.
Why didn’t this video have Joe Biden pop out of the mailbox &amp; steal his mail at gun point? Listen to President Trump! Go online to your local Supervisor of Elections site &amp; request a mail in ballot. If you do not receive a ballot get your lazy ass up and show up at the pollls.
LMAO. Let me guess you’ve never watched Fox. No they don’t have any leftists on there. The CEO and his stupid wife just maxed out in giving to Biden jus like they did to Hillary and Obama.
Harris would be a huge mistake. Think of the midwest voters. They’re ready to break from Trump, but they won’t go for a ‘woke’ candidate. Biden needs a midwest veep, not a coastal elite.
Remember the movie Death Becomes Her, yeah that’s what’s going on, they cannot have her die just yet. I believe they are doing the same thing with Biden.
And if you wanna get into it about how Biden isn’t that great, let’s go. Bc Trump is worse 😋
"Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden walks out of his campaign field office, Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, in south Des Moines, Iowa, with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden."
Even if the polls have Biden at 99% chance of victory, you all better still get out and vote
Both of my grandparents died of alzheimer’s. What Biden is doing is truly an embarrassment. What’s even worse is that if he wins, his VP could end up serving for 12 years as President.
Maybe she should tell Biden too
thinking of when jord posted on their facebook how they weren’t going to vote for joe biden bc he’s a predator ❤️ the internalized self-hatred really popped out huh
Barr said yesterday that if (Biden) was being investigated, he would release that info even right before the election.  Anyone see a double standard here?  Obama in 2016 should have released the info that the racist Trump was really under investigation.
Contenders scramble as Joe Biden zeroes in on running-mate choice
No, I'm voting third party, I'm not supporting Trump, hell, unlike Biden, I'm actually supporting the protesters. I go third party out of my distaste for Dems and Repubs. It makes me feel good, like I voted for the really better people. I wish more would try it.
Joe Biden wants to have more police officers and increase police spending,so this ad is a complete lie in every way.
How when he isn’t fighting for extended federal for us! Where does he want us to go w no money? I can’t w him. Can’t wait to vote Mini Trump out of office and his daddy Trump gone! Don’t like Biden but anyone is better then Trump at this point.
Spoiler Alert: Biden’s VP will be awful, so will his cabinet choices, so will the next 4 years.
Your placard insinuated that Biden's supporters are killing cops, destroying property, looting, etc. I didn't put those words in your mouth, you posted them. Don't post statements like that if you don't mean it. Again I assume you aren't in favor of cops shooting unarmed people.
Obama Biden was pretty bad.
I’m praying you are FIRED from your post when Biden wins. You should be ashamed of promoting Trump as anything other than the one to blame for the botched response to a crisis that has killed over 150,000 of YOUR countrymen. Shame on you!!
CAS says Folks we're apolitical but we do believe in an economy built on renewables.....Joe Biden’s climate bet: putting jobs first will bring historic change - The Guardian
I don’t necessarily disagree however I do think she’s more politically aligned with Biden than any of the other VP picks. I do think Biden will choose someone a law enforcement background and more specifically a Black woman so it’s probably between Val Demings and Kamala
Dems always over emphasize identity politics of race, gender &amp; sexuality. Glad Scott called it! Remember Biden says you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him.
You are sundowning worse than Biden is...if you believe what you say
Seeing so many Republicans for the supposedly radical socialist, Joe Biden, makes me really nervous. He's a kind of moderate conservative parading as a moderate centrist. I'm probably going Green this year, call me when Nancy's gone and things start really changing.
People I used to go to church with are EXHAUSTING! you’re gonna vote for all of the recent anarchy to continue.... because Biden believes that women should have bodily autonomy? And yes this was posted by a cishet man 🙄

We don't know how the party will respond if Biden's VP runs. The last time that happened was 2000, and the party did roll over for Gore (Bradley did not have much support).
Biden is picking a woman. The other options are all women. The people that don’t want Harris, want other women, some of them women of color. It’s not misogyny.   Did you see her come for Joe? I loved Harris and voted for in CA senate but would never support her as President.
So, the Section 8 housing that MANY disabled individuals who rely on thru SSDI for their living income will no longer be "a burden" ?  Does he even realize that this is a huge percentage of his, what, 36% following?  Don't worry, President Biden will address this in January.
Val Deming's tenure as Chief, however, also comes with criticism over complaints of excessive force, settled lawsuits, and a 2009 when Demings' service weapon was stolen from her work truck at home.   FULL STORY:
THIS is why they need term limits. Why has she not been removed due to signs of sundowning, like Biden? Why is someone who cares about this woman NOT protecting her &amp; getting her the help she needs. Instead her derangement passes bills.
Val Demings rose through the ranks of Orlando Police Department in her 27 year career, including 4 years as police chief.   Her personnel record shows overall many points of success and accomplishment.   FULL STORY:

Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden
1. Biden is testing the media to see how a Harris VP would shake out. Why have notes on her if you weren't even discussing her at that event? 2. Biden has no idea that cameras have zoom and messed up 3. If it's not Harris this tease is gonna piss folk off
Capitalism has staying power. Trump gets credit for helping the rich. No one else. He inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden. It's a news media scam that all trump need's is a good economy to win re-election. He needs a brain transfusion &amp; it prob still wouldn't work.
In Florida, we call this Biden Syndrome
If i was an adviser 2 the Biden campaign (prob good that I'm not) or working on a trump documentary i would put 2gether a compelling case how trump handled the covid crisis exactly like he handled every other tragic event in the last 4 yrs. Incompetent &amp; driven by severe neurosis
Biden is not getting elected buddy
You errored.  That is Biden you are speaking about
Black Americans are the reason we have Biden as the Democratic Nominee. Forgive me for taking the advice of men like John Lewis and Jim Clyburn over a fool like you, willing to hurt all Americans with a vote for the Green Party. It’s clear you don’t understand the stakes. 🤷🏻‍♂️
#kanyewest   I appreciate that you are running for President, because you would be a better conservative President than Trump. But, sadly, I think all you will do is pull Black voters away from Biden, and help Trump get reelected. Unless, that's your plan all along?
I am voting for the future. While I would have loved to see Bernie in office, Biden is the only way to get tr*mp out of office.
Given the circumstances of Biden's age, I imagine the narrative that his VP will be "anointed the successor in waiting" would be applicable to anyone he selects. Regardless, I doubt this issue rises to the level of *the* reason Biden picks someone vs how they pair ideologically.
To Joe Biden:  you have a personality in Kamala Harris that will make America stand up.  In her debate with you, she said how it was.  Isn’t it better to challenge an incumbent then support them like the Republicans do w/ trump.  Don’t kick the can down the road; pick it up!
One can only hope that when Biden gets into office he will put a halt to this nonsense.
With Trump, instead of U.S. progressing, we are regressing.  I imagine President Biden will re-implement it.
Biden wouldn’t have stood a chance if Bernie just killdozered him 😫
Biden needs to be the Abe Lincoln of our time. Look at the Douglas-Lincoln debates for example. Lincoln made a stark contrast between Douglas. Unity. I’m writing an article about this. Coincidentally, we have  to help with that analogy for this election.

Except for Russian assets in the United States that are US citizens, there is not a single solitary person in the United States, who cares about the future of the US, who should vote for Trump.  It should be 125 million for Biden and less than 10,000 for Trump.
Did it ever occur to you that all of this civil unrest is your fault. Here we are with a corrupt president and the people of America don’t know what you’re going to do next. America is scared. We need Joe Biden to govern.
Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.

Never trumpers did not vote for him the first time so he does not need them to win. The problem is the far left went 2 far n Democrats are leaving in high numbers . Biden won’t come out and let anybody interview him . Not sure he can handle the job no matter how much u hate trump
Ok about that, does it seem like ,Biden, Obama, Hilary have all aged a lot in the last 6months? There was someone else too that all of a sudden looked drastically older.
We can’t be too far off from Romney endorsing Biden?
If Biden wins the popular vote by 9% there's no way he's losing the electoral college, Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%, if she won by 3% she'd be president
HOW ABOUT BIDEN VOODOO DOLLS?
Nice try Eric.  17 seconds of Biden is going to bring out 17 hours of Trump trying to speak.  Did you think this out?  Don't you see how trump talks (tries to)?  Has he ever made any thought develop for more than 5 seconds while not reading off a teleprompter?

Barrack Obama and Joe Biden rescued our economy once, Joe Biden, and a woman in charge, can do it again.
Are you talking about when Trump acted unilaterally before any recommendations from CDC and shut down travel from China? You know, when Joe Biden called him xenophobic for putting a travel ban in place? Or, perhaps you’re talking about the 32,000+ dead in New York?
Just on the off chance some poor soul needs to hear it. BIDEN has not been able to fix anything in nearly 5 decades in public office, except maybe his personal networth. Let that sink in.  Curious, I wonder how much of govt payoffs for sexual harassment were Biden’s?
8 years was #Obama and #Biden in power: we became number one oil producer in the world; totally independent from the energetic point of view.  Subsidies? That’s a socialist thing and Republicans don’t like socialism?   I am surprised you are talking about this
The media really needs to start asking the hard questions about Biden’s competency to lead. This is scary how he is being handled. Why isn’t he allowed to talk.

It was important for me to state why, even though I remain a Republican, I’m voting for Joe Biden in November.  My thoughts are summarized in this article.
Joe Biden would need a handler to help him find the helicopter and navigate the stairs.
The Kennedy’s are iconic, I’d love to see him win. If he doesn’t, and Biden chooses Warren to VP, the super majority in Massachusetts will force Baker to appoint a Democratic Senator. If that’s the case, it should be him. It would all work out.

Who is the radical left? I mean, I lived 16 years of Democratic Administration (Clinton and Obama): never saw any “radical left” or “communist” or “socialist” thing happening  Biden was a very successful VP with #Obama, he knows the job, they handled the crisis they had very well
My guess is cloned &amp; contolled! Her eyes are the tell but she also looks like she’s had work done. That will prob be her cover story like HRC. Biden is a clone &amp; controlled but they didn’t work on him till too late dementia had already set in. I don’t think he’ll make it long.
As States Take Pandemic Lead, Biden Is Said To Weigh At Least 2 Governors For VP
Stuff like that is why I don't see Biden winning Texas. They are crazy. #LRT
I will say I'm leaning towards Biden winning Wisconsin. It's looking good for him so far.
Biden doesn’t have a campaign or a voice, he’s an empty suit unable to take ?s. He’s weak.
Joe Biden will get the coronavirus under control and protect our health.
Hillary dominated Trump in the burbs in PA too but she failed to match Obama's turnout there, and hence why she lost. Biden would have to not only best Hillary but match Obama's turnout. That's where enthusiasm comes into play.
I don't think Biden is winning PA. Just looking at voter registration data and enthusiasm. I got Trump winning that.
Yet he’ll still have 2-1/2 months to wreak havoc before President-elect Biden is sworn in (knock on wood).
Never thought he would win the first time. So yes. If he gets a live debate yes. If they keep Biden in the basement then... if that happens the media will be an accomplice to a coup.
I have yet to see any Warren supporters say this. 100% of the ones I know of are voting for Biden even if Warren isn’t the VP.
I've been predicted Biden would win Michigan.
That’s can’t be right... the DNC’s plan from the beginning was to be “virtual”. They never scheduled a convention. Trump did, not Biden.
Biden will do and say whatever his "handlers" tell him to.  "Ignore the man behind the curtain"!
And you’re a Russian, pupppet.  At lease Biden is American.
If .exe Biden wins, how long before no one cares about the virus?
I’m not going to even touch name calling. Do you know who the president is? Come on now.....  Lol of course Biden would’ve done better since he actually knows how government is supposed to function. He also would’ve shut the fuck up and got the fuck out of the way and let....
I was a supporter of Trump but no more. However I don’t think Biden is the answer.
"Republicans raise concerns about the cost of the Biden Recovery Plan: Too much too fast? Up next on CNN"
Lol Biden is the number one racist. "You aint black, slight Indian accent" he's got quite a few phrases.
I suspect part of the problem is the LP attracts many leftists who agree with ending drug prohibition, but are not consistently pro-liberty.  Also, they may be pandering to the left because they know Biden has no chance of winning and are hoping to attract some of his voters.
Religious but makin fun of #Biden? Ephesians 5:4 Matthew 6:1 Ephesians 4:29 u should read what those Bible verses say about mocking people.
Do you think Biden is mentally fit?
The presumptive Democratic nominee says he wants to reverse crucial pieces of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and extract more money from corporations.
Is she going to debate for Biden??
My whole family will vote Joe Biden if you don’t take down the CCP before October.
Its taken me awhile 2 come around 2  but watching him In recent days facing #MAGAExtremists &amp; inviting them to hug &amp; talk it out in private knowing  invokes violence has proved 2 me he deserves my vote, not that Trump WOULD EVER get it but BIDEN I GOT YOU
This is not Biden country. Have you seen Trump Rally's in Florida? This is a joke. I would rather vote for Trump than vote for a baby sniffer and a supporter of pedophiles.
Omg he is infecting my state. Nasty. Get rid of this nasty pedo!!!  Biden was on the Lolita express 3 times.
Why are you so scared of people voting in person, huh Biden?
Forget all the Kamala tea-leaf reading. I'm just intrigued by the idea of a president who has cohesive thoughts that he takes time to write down in organized fashion before speaking aloud, TBH.
Who knows gregg. Bumbling Biden doesn’t realize he even said that. You can see them already setting this thing up for claims of voter suppression . They call someone having to show a picture ID to vote , a form of voter suppression. Yep; suppression of an illegal vote!!!
He really is sleepy joe...so boring to watch. It’s like a nascar race; people go to see the wrecks. I just watch bumbling Biden to catch the next gaff ...!!!
Make it a successful VoteBlue2020 ticket. Biden &amp; Obama. Vote #VeryBlue2020.  AOC as Speaker of House.  She is the only one that can herd those cats.
Biden went on the Charlemagne and tried to land a joke, immediately accepted responsibility, and apologized.  Donald tweeted a white power video to the entire world and tried to make an excuse.
so Joe Biden is comparable to... Carrie Lam?

How in the world was that your takeaway from that Biden quote? That's not remotely what he said.

Biden leads in Texas by 2
why should they not protect federal property? If the protestors want to reshape the justice system to make it more equitable, it’s def ok. But they should take their concerns to the ballot box. Biden (if elected) will always nominate judges that will further the protestors’ cause
He has taken steps but until we clean the house and retain the senate... I won’t hold my breath. Hell still waiting for justice on the Clintons. Biden. Etc.
Chances are, when Joe Biden went to school, they had calligraphy (handwriting, penmanship, etc) classes. I took 1 semester of it in high school back in the old country, but it didn't help. The books and ink pens were not left-handed friendly.
You know what?.. I’m not even gonna debate this, I’m glad you came around and decided to vote for biden!
Biden’s Notes on Harris Caught by Photographer: Campaign Update

Jo Jorgensen has generated way more excitement for the Libertarian Party than Gary Johnson did in 2016. She is an eloquent woman with a fantastic Libertrian background dating back to the 80’s. She has made a couple small mistakes but small potatoes compared to Biden and Trump
I can't wait till you're our FLOTUS. We really need one that does important work like this. Thank you Dr. Biden.
Biden &amp; Nadler 2020. Two demented idiots - what a joke.
Imo she’s a milquetoast Democrat that won’t fight for true progressive ideals. I didn’t expect Biden to get Bernie or Nina Turner or anything, but I hoped he would have done better than Harris.  I wanted someone to fight for the things Biden wouldn’t. An olive branch to the left.

Maybe don't be a biden endorser if you don't want to be called out over it.
Gotcha. Will do my research, as I haven't heard this.   I recall Biden had a pretty horrible record until recent with LGBT issues. Defense of marriage act and cutting off federal funds if they teach the acceptance of homosexuality.  2020 election must extra suck as a gay man 😅
Trump looks like a bad ass chad while biden looks like the pedo from family guy.

My money is on a true believer like Stephen Miller. But yes, Biden = Hindenburg.
Wait.  What happened to the “summer of love”? How do people with a mental IQ of 50 get elected?  How is a sub zero IQ man Biden the Democratic nominee? Where are the real democrats? Cowering in the corner with the GOP? If we don’t fight we lose America.Equation: DEM=GOP.  No dif.
...who?  Never heard of any of these people. And voting for Joe Biden regardless of who’s on the ticket with him.
Biden/Harris ticket. The worst card the #DNC could ever come up with. Horrible that I have to vote for this fucking option because of trump. We are screwed regardless.
I don't actually. Biden knows actual policy. He knows HOW things work, not just that they work.
I'd love to see an interview with Biden's personal trainer. (He talked about his workouts in a call with Buttigieg).  Someone should ask Trump about Fauci's record selling limited edition Topps baseball card...🤣Joe Biden and a enthusiastic woman running mate. GO JOE 2020
Did I miss something? Is California in play for the repubs now? Why would Bass being more popular in California matter? Harris is the only real nationally known and respected option. God I hope Biden and the Dems don’t fuck this up. Pick Harris and move forward!
A rock could beat Biden!
You mentioned Daniel Cameron and his hesitancy to press charges while also pointing out his support of Trump but it's not Cameron's job to do so. It is the district attorney's role. The district attorney is a Democrat and a Biden supporter. I was making a similar observation.
Biden has to be the most racist presidential candidate as he worked with Southern Democrats during the 70's, yeah. 197Oz. Joe Blow can't walk up the stairs, let alone run a country! Trump is the energizing rabbit that never quits, never stays down n counterpunches are world class
Trump is his buddy. Biden is his friend. The only candidate who won't block a prosecutor from bringing him down is
Ever move the Democrats stagetegics have puttered out into doom and gloom, as their race ploy did not being out the federal intervention they prayed for  Excuse me, they don't pray, They had hoped for that result! Game, Set, Match is over; Where is Biden anyway! Dems want do-over
I personally don't care if Harris is not the VP selection. Just like you are surrounded by people you can work with to accomplish your goals, Biden has a right to select a WOMAN as he promised. It is people like you who want to change the VP requirements after such a promise.
This relief is non-negotiable. Put  House bill up for a vote as we need to protect our citizens, the  and state/local governments and services.   Mitch is holding out for more Trump poll #’s and will let our country collapse if he thinks Biden will win.

It would have to be private security, since they want to defund police departments. Not a dime until we see THREE debates between Trump &amp; Biden.

When you don't check your social media message requests for a while, &amp; when you do, you find heartwarming notes from Biden fans. Like this one, from someone named "Skyy", that was sent to me in March. (Gotta love that voter outreach, Joe—this stuff brings *everyone* on board!
I don’t care who thinks what and you shouldn’t either. Joe Biden ***will not win*** with anyone but  ESPECIALLY if he needs to introduce the world to one of his fringe picks. This is silly.
Joe Biden is even too creepy in a pedo to be invited to Epstein Island.
This situation is very common. The crises of couples &amp; families affected not just by COVID but by means-testing meanness--burning through savings to cover rent/mortgage &amp; all the copays/deductibles/bills thanks to employer-based healthcare that Biden et. al. insist is best. NOPE.

Biden thinks she’s fixing his zipper! Poor Joe 😂
I told him that if Assange is extradited while Biden’s President that Glenn would probably be right behind him. Then he tried to flip it around on me that I wanted him jailed simply because I disagree with him. I was like F you, I think you may have committed crimes.
Silver alert, someone tell Joe Biden where he is...
Biden has already shown he’s tougher on China than trump. In January, Biden called for us to be tough on China &amp; demand transparency from Xi on coronavirus...at the same time trump was (checks notes) doing nothing but calling it a hoax &amp; praising Xi for doing a great job.
Please keep pounding the all of your points, we are all going crazy, kid transmission, mask, no mask, goggles, riots, reverse law enforcement, my God, the country is upside down, Biden, left extremists, I take back my time, Obama grandstanding..
Donald Trump lies.  He’s a liar.   The Republican Party is lying.  It’s all they have left.   Biden speaks to a child here.

What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?

Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
Hunter Biden is an American citizen and as such has no place on your agenda.

Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.
I find it astounding that Biden does not go over 47% in any of these matches. This is why we can't count Trump out yet.
So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?
What are you guys talking about? Is Biden POTUS? Does he have powers of executive orders? Is he a senator? Biden doesn’t know where he’s at. He will do what his owners tell him to do. Nothing is more clear than the Democrat party is now openly a communist party.
If Biden wins it’s AOC’s party.
Kamala Harris lost my confidence in her when she used a bussing issue to paint Biden as if he was complicit with that issue. SHE HAD TSHIRTS ALREADY MADE AFTER THAT DEBATE. That's was cruel and inconsiderate of those who fought and died dealing with that  #WarrenorRice
If you think Joe Biden...if he wins will be running the show you are delusional. You will get your wish if as Ilhan, AOC and the rest of socialist/jihadist/communist freaks will be running the show. But hey don’t worry #socialism will work out this time...lol

Vote for Joe Biden. He won't accuse your mother of being a violent anarchist and teargas her, or shoot her with a rubber bullet and leave her with brain damage. All for the crime of exerting her First Amendment rights.
These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won’t be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?

Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  🤣😂😅
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.
Am the only white woman I know in Fla for Biden
Interesting thought but I don’t think that that would cause republicans and independents who were already voting for Biden to not do so.
Strikingly similar article to the one written in April about   the mad libs version of the VP whisper game.  'Joe Biden allies quietly working against (insert woman's name), claiming she is too (insert an otherwise complimentary adjective).'
Followed all
Who seriously thinks Biden is going to even [cognitively] make it through his first term?
The VP pick isn't going to debate Trump for Biden ? No doubt every mind is made up.  I'm 'VOTING AGAINST' Biden and 'FOR TRUMP' this election.  Unlike before, I 'VOTED AGAINST' HRClinton and had NO OPTION but Trump.  Most Dems are not VOTING FOR Biden, just VOTING AGAINST Trump.

Dems tied themselves up in the bad messaging of the protestors* and are going to have to try hard to distance them from it.  Biden currently feeling that pain, imo.   *I agree w/protestors on police brutality and systemic racism.  Just saying their messaging/solutions are wrong.
Yes, they've been ongoing, that's my point.  They are now dragging out with no purpose, and people who were (rightly) outraged about police brutality are now wondering what the point is.  Meanwhile, the left bought into "defund the police" slogan, whether Biden onboard or not.
Let's also not forget that he once said certain de-segregation policies would lead to his children growing up "in a racial jungle".
Joe Biden is touted as a candidate that stands up for racial justice, BLM, etc. but people seem to forget about the 1994 crime law he helped write that lead to the injustices we see today against black and brown communities.
Apropos of criticizing partisanship in our City Hall:  If you vote for Biden, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Democrat.  If you vote for Trump, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Republican.  Mud-flinging can be fun, but it isn't reality

What they are doing is Joe Biden is a elderly abuse.
Joe Biden will select the most intelligent, the most ethical and the most judicial people for his cabinet. He will not surround himself with felons. Your cabinet members and your shadow people are always on a conveyor belt, in and then out the door.
This should be a CAKEWALK. Biden, whom the Democratic Party chose over all others because they believed him to be the best, should have double-digit leads in every mfing state. I mean, over the single most incompetent, ignorant, &amp; corrupt president in US history. Why doesn't he?
imho we need to get the party to the place where Biden, Pelosi, Clinton, etc not only are *not* making policy anymore, but are afraid to appear in public.
Trump winning is the path to the reformation of the Dem Party into something useful.   Biden winning means that the left gets locked out of Dem leadership and policy for at least another generation.

It's understandable because the police fate rest in the hands of Trump, If Biden wins the police agencies across the country will see their power diminished so much they will become nothing more than a investigation agency.
I hope it does, Biden's caretakers pose a bigger threat.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.

Joe Biden Says Arrest Criminals &amp; Lefty Communists Turn On Him! - YouTube
U are so left wing not even in the middle .. Biden HAS not denounced defunding the police.. u just hate trump &amp; all ur words are slanted .. learn journalism again please
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
“People want to know they’re invited to the table,” Jones said, saying  has said “everybody come to the table and let’s reason together, like we say in church.”
they may be!! Try Eleven Million of us Tax Payers Dollars to buy a House with? I'm not very nice when I work "Hard So They Don't Have To!" Share the Love as said! This never happened. Biden is a Black Obomba as stated in his so-what-thought!I I refuse to be taken again!
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!
#DefundThePolice combined  #YouAintBlack #youainthispanic will reap 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #democratsfortrump  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  But dont tell #woodywoodpecker #biden to stop making gaffes...
You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
We should let you guys do the negative spots while Biden does spots about how he's gonna fix what Trump broke.
“Several additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered”
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November

Brain Dead Biden

Joe Biden kissing a 14 year old student on the lips....Is this the action of a man that should be President if tge United States?
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‘Delay the Election’ Tweet, Even Though He Can’t Do It
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Joe Biden robs black people
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

This is not a #coronavirus press conference.  This is a campaign speech!  The major news networks are going to owe the #Biden campaign an awful lot of time!  #CNN  #MSNBC  #FoxNews
I would like to know the same thing. Everyone voting Obama and Biden are predators
Obama is a predator so is joe Biden
Latest information from Lancet regarding the risk factors for DEMENTIA . I wonder which ones contributed to Joe Biden’s mental condition?
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn’t have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis’ funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
Untrue! What really concerns Ms. Greenhouse is that there are any Conservatives on the Supreme Court! That said she looks forward to Joe Biden “fixing” that by packing the court!
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
Let’s say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
If it wasn't for 2016-2018 id probably be a Biden supporter 🤭😂
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
The same you as the lazy deserve a lazy president like Biden, you will see what he is going to convert to the USA.  TRUMP2020
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
Must be a Joe Biden supporter
They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Biden visibly a sick fellow wake up voters
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Latinos are a major force to elect VP Biden President. Register and vote. Let’s get this done.
And you’re said I’m the one disrespecting Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️
The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.
I’ve got news for you, Joe: you have just been added to Joe Biden’s VP shortlist! 👍😃
The “Lincoln Project” an attempt to remove all traces of Lincoln from America and replace them with a Joe Biden Puppet! The only question is who on the Left will pull the strings!

If your family worked so hard to be able to afford a middle class home wouldn’t you be pissed if someone moving in next to you doesn’t have to pay at all? This is what you want from Biden though. Btw, keep calling black/brown people “low income” when in reality it’s all races.
I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

Joe Biden’s plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.
It quotes Biden.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock’s head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It’s fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I’d pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Get your head around this! Biden’s clueless!
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says “make your voice heard”. They’re very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks—from 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I’d be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory—that Biden’s heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers—Amy Klobuchar
👏#blacknotDemocrat! I don’t like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can’t speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain’t about Trump
Voters are worried that Joe Biden might win!
Joe Biden never fails to make himself look worse! The lights are on and no one’s home!
If Joe Biden is President it will look exactly like Munich in 1938! Joe will trade everything for “peace in his time”!

PBS’ ‘The Choice’ Promises New Insight And Revelations About Joe Biden And Donald Trump, Filmmaker Says
Joe Biden announces he is pro cop and against the left because he can’t stand Republicans accusing him of being soft on crime.
You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you’re the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it’s plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he’s doesn’t know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he’s really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he’s done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I’m sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
ignorant response. You’ve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don’t think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It’s people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying “Law and Order”, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? 🤔
Is this Biden??
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.

If Joe Biden is President it will look exactly like Munich in 1938! Joe will trade everything for “peace in his time”!
I hope that between now and the beginning of August Biden's senile dementia has not progressed and that he says that he will be the vice-president of so-and-so, because every day he looks more disoriented and the radical Communist Democrats say nothing about it.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
Sure.  Most countries stopped it ?  And you think Biden will make it better.  The Lincoln Project is ALL ANGER

48 minus 3.4 is 45. 45 plus 3.4 is 45 almost in the margin of error.  Due to passion intensity and trump last minute surge as the economy recovers and America stops fearing covid 19.  Then by September trump gain 2 pts and biden loses 1 pt making it a thriller Trump 44 Biden 47

One of the main differences between President Trump and Joe Biden if he was to win, Trump Makes his own decisions while Biden will have to be told what to do.
Biden thanks you.
Since she’s moving out soon, she should consult with Dr. Biden about this.
America will be destroyed completely if Biden the crazy 😜 man became President. God bless Donald Trump. 🙏🙏🙏
This is the USA.  Not China or another communist country that can close down.  I assume you are taking advantage of the government because of your senseless statements.  Shut down.  So easy for you.  Keep on tweeting and supporting Biden.  😂😂
He’s not assaulting peaceful protestors sweetie he sent his gang in to arrest antifa rioters that George soros paid them 15 an hour to do such thing in Portland 😑 Democrats are killing black people but want them to vote for Biden? Lol

Biden is neither rich nor a child predator. He is  not a criminal nor did the Obama/Biden administration   commit treason or were impeached. Trump has, since in office, defecated on the Constitution, defied the rule of law and it's still doing it. Also is a vile human being.

Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.

We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.

“Several additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered”
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.

We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn’t have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis’ funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!

It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.

Is Joe Biden capable of fulfilling his duties of President? If he wins,, will the Democrats exercise the 25th Ammendment immediately after the elections? Are they trying to cheat?
They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.

If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Biden visibly a sick fellow wake up voters
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I don’t know for the same reason the dems and Biden never trash China
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️

So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.

If your family worked so hard to be able to afford a middle class home wouldn’t you be pissed if someone moving in next to you doesn’t have to pay at all? This is what you want from Biden though. Btw, keep calling black/brown people “low income” when in reality it’s all races.
I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.
Because unlike Kamala, Susan Rice will not mention Joe Biden's voting record

I'm begging Biden to make Kamala Harris his VP. I might die laughing
Joe Biden’s plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.
It quotes Biden.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock’s head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It’s fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
‘Biden/Harris 2020?’ A snapshot of  note pad shows Senator  name with notes &amp; talking points about her. Lots of speculation she’ll be on the democratic ticket. Biden says he’ll announce his running mate choice next week.
Why does the MSM are not asking for Joe Biden to be more public and present the DNC platform? Why is he hiding? Oh by the way, he's a racist. Listen to his past speeches for proof.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I’d pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Get your head around this! Biden’s clueless!
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says “make your voice heard”. They’re very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks—from 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I’d be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory—that Biden’s heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers—Amy Klobuchar
Landslide for Biden, Trump will be forced to leave like a child who won’t go to bed!
👏#blacknotDemocrat! I don’t like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can’t speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain’t about Trump
Voters are worried that Joe Biden might win!
Joe Biden never fails to make himself look worse! The lights are on and no one’s home!
If Joe Biden is President it will look exactly like Munich in 1938! Joe will trade everything for “peace in his time”!

Barack Obama And George Clooney Trade A Few Jokes And Talk Of Defeating Donald Trump At Virtual Fundraiser For Joe Biden
Two choices in 2020. Trump v Biden. That's what we got. If you're anti Biden, then you're pro Trump. It's plain as that.
We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
I hope that between now and the beginning of August Biden's senile dementia has not progressed and that he says that he will be the vice-president of so-and-so, because every day he looks more disoriented and the radical Communist Democrats say nothing about it.
Democrat Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
And if you don't believe that, critically investigate Barrack Obama's record. He didn't embarrass us on Twitter everyday but he expanded the Patriot Act and killed thousands of people in drone warfare. Now the Dems want me to vote for Biden, a integral part of that admin. Ha

PBS’ ‘The Choice’ Promises New Insight And Revelations About Joe Biden And Donald Trump, Filmmaker Says
Joe Biden announces he is pro cop and against the left because he can’t stand Republicans accusing him of being soft on crime.
You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you’re the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it’s plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he’s doesn’t know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he’s really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he’s done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I’m sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.
Why switch from #Barr to this jackass #biden!?!? #FoxNews #billhemmer  lol lol 😂 JoeBiden is using Trumps agenda as his agenda!!!! WTF #kag2020
Wasn't a big Biden fan but he's crushing right now. Tune in! Important shit.  #BuildBackBetter
Biden giving a speech right now in Wilmington, Delaware. He said, "Crimate clisis." Going to have a very entertaining political campaign (both sides) this cycle.
This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
ignorant response. You’ve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don’t think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It’s people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying “Law and Order”, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? 🤔
Is this Biden??
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (🙏🙏🙏) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
Sure.  Most countries stopped it ?  And you think Biden will make it better.  The Lincoln Project is ALL ANGER
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
If Biden wins (🙏🙏🙏) it will be 1st female VP.
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.
I wont accept biden I’ll take a president that pays for pussy before one that fucks kids so lets fuckin go with the draft cards

Biden should start every debate with this line.
You have to be a fair and thinking Liberal to decide Voting for Trump. Biden political platform is not his at all. He is not &amp; has never been that extremist liberal. Never! His Platform has been dictated to him by Sanders, AOC, Warren. He is now the Puppet from the Far Dem Left.
No epidemic, no President Biden “Puppet”!
A far better question is will the NYT fire it’s editorial staff and option writers if Joe Biden looses too? They should consider doing that!
I feel like most people whenever her name is mentioned gets happy. I know I do. Im voting for Biden anyway but I’d be happier with Rice on the ticket!
The idea is that Biden gets the "25th," allowing his VP to come in, unelected, as President.  But yeah, very likely wouldn't be a socialist president and would be an establishment candidate.
Why hasn’t Biden announced his VP pick yet?

Then he will refuse to be president because we all know Biden can’t beat him.

read your article on secret MAGA. I’ve heard a diff plan that is not about being afraid but deliberately skewering polls to Biden to create false narrative. Heard it from a friend who knows a trumper who is part of the secret plan so to speak.

If you all thought this was about supporting Joe Biden and not saying a peep, I have news for you.
Biden thought the veepstakes were free press for him, he didn’t care about all the attacks on Democratic women he’s been enabling by his waffling.
If Biden doesn’t know better than to not put a Senator who resigned under scandal known for sexual harassment in charge of selecting perhaps the first woman VP, what else does he not have a clue about 99 days before the election?
Yes, it’s a trash  piece, but where do they keep getting ammunition from? Biden lost control his own VP nomination process. It looks like he repeatedly floated trail balloon articles as a strategy. Then they just kept talking regardless of
Why can’t Team Biden keep its staff on the same page instead of letting them vent to Politico? This has been going since March, Biden associates complaining about Kamala challenging Biden in the first debate, it starts to look like it comes from Biden.
You have fucked up so bad,  and you're pretending this is all going away. What a sad preview of what a Biden Administration would look like. Silently protecting the old white man club that thinks a woman doesn't know her place.
Joe Biden is going to Reform the police. Not Defund them.    Pass it on.
The Biden campaign really hasn’t had any self-inflicted fuck-ups yet, so I don’t expect them to react or even acknowledge how weak Chris Dodd made  look. They’ll probably just keep tweeting empty wishes about women doing well.
Oh look at right-wing nutrag Daily Caller bragging on Nina Turner.   'Bernie’s Campaign Co-Chair Says Voting For Biden Is Like Eating ‘A Bowl Of S***’'.

YES this points directly to the wisdom and judgement of  and  to even associate with a guy who had to resign from the US Senate under a cloud of corruption. COME THE FUCK ON BIDEN CAMPAIGN
At bidens last event, (internet world wide) he only got 19 viewers...  Given how many people work in Media and polictics, That's unreal.  Not even any of them give a shit what he has to say.  So bottom line: Biden is not clickbait.
It’s been airing since March as Biden made appearances with every different name that was floated.
Unfortunately, the  campaign is in fact a shit show that got this far on nostalgia and hatred of Trump. I am starting to see how Kamala would work her ass off while Biden’s buddies would just bitch to Politico about her. And Biden would just grin.
The Biden campaign’s decision to turn the VP process into a reality show has been disastrous. What would have brought the party together has been dragged out and dangled and manipulated and by now is undesirable, considering the creeps  apparently keeps as friends.
George Clooney To Have “Virtual Conversation” With Barack Obama As Part of Joe Biden Fundraiser
I am stupefied that the  campaign was ever connected to Chris Dodd. Firing him isn’t enough, this is seriously questionable judgement that makes me doubt who I thought Joe Biden was.
We knew this wasn’t a layup. We knew Trump didn’t really win last time. But if the  campaign is really going to abide these kinds of sexist, racist attacks on FELLOW DEMOCRATS LOYAL TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN...if Joe can’t lead better than that, he never had a shot.
The thing is, the  campaign has to act fast on this Chris Dodd fuckup, because this close to the election, it’s inevitable that the Black voters that got Joe Biden the nomination are expecting to be screwed over by old white men, again. Enter Chris Dodd.  act.
99 days till the campaign and  advisors shoot themselves in the foot. Classic Democrat move, let an angry failed white guy speak for the campaign.  this is 911. Chris Dodd is a bigot looking to sink the Biden campaign with his bitterness at being passed over.
48 minus 3.4 is 45. 45 plus 3.4 is 45 almost in the margin of error.  Due to passion intensity and trump last minute surge as the economy recovers and America stops fearing covid 19.  Then by September trump gain 2 pts and biden loses 1 pt making it a thriller Trump 44 Biden 47

Just How Far Will Joe Biden Go?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Leslie kean saw u cash in on youtube peddling garbage so shes trying to scam a quick buck too now!  I bet biden can pick the lion quicker than u Joe!I'm talking about innocent future potential deaths. not past ones. so it's ok if they die bec you want to hold Biden accountable?
Sure, but when the alternative is Donald Trump, not voting for Joe Biden is basically like breaking a leg instead of breaking a finger.  I hate it, but it's true :/
If you're willing to admit that not taking the L and voting for Biden will likely result in more harm to vulnerable communities for a shot at some benefit in the long run, that's fine, but it's intellectually dishonest to not admit that this is the case
Sure, just like Trump. Agreed. It needs to stop.  But there are some good things that Biden will do that Trump won't.  Now do you want to take the Dixie cup and drink water or do you want to dehydrate and die because you don't want to take water from a man that punched you?
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
because that's your argument here. if we're really in a crisis (which we are), we need to get whatever the fuck we can.  trump won't do anything, and he'll actually make it worse.  biden will at least do *something*, even if it is the bare minimum.
you're honestly right tbh  i have many a criticism of joe biden but i know that he wouldn't have botched the pandemic response as badly as trump has and i know that there's at least *a few things* that will be safe guarantees under a biden administration
Yep, and you're right. We had several candidates who were objectively better than Joe Biden.   In order to change the system we live in, we've gotta start from the ground up. No use crying over spilled milk. It sucks. I hate it. I don't have confidence or faith in Joe Biden.
I'm no Joe Biden cheerleader - I'm a very, very reluctant Biden voter.  4 more years are not an option. If you think we can just flip the table and walk out and not pay for it dearly, you're mistaken. I wish you were right, but you're not, IMO.
so if Biden wins you'd more probably die more so than if Trump is elected? if Trump gets elected we're looking at decades possibly of rep POTUS's. So any possible shift to the left, def won't come to fruition with that impediment.
Biden is not my candidate. Phone bank? I fucking hate him. But logic and math identify that he's the most likely, viable, and probable candidate to defeat Trump. like you mentioned that you'll need to move. My entire life hinges on if Trump wins or loses. I can't move on my own.

I'm completely frustrated with Joe Biden too, I get it. He's shown himself to be totally not receptive to what young Americans want and need to be successful.  Difference is that I'm not willing to risk further harm for a symbolic win. I'm not gonna flip the table and walk out.
I worked alongside her to help Andrew Yang in the primaries.  A Biden presidency is very much not "getting her way".

Wear a mask. Vote by mail. And vote for Joe Biden.
Usually presidential candidates have staffers or assistants escorting them around while campaigning. Seems Biden has a nurse or maybe his “Visiting Angel” from home is tagging along. Regardless, he looks confused. 👩🏼‍⚕️👼🏼😂
Um ... why should Biden apologize for what allegedly "some of his allies" are telling him?
Joe Biden isn’t making any decisions
Great new top that came out a huge plus to wear to the debate oh that's right Joe Biden will never show up unless he has Bernie Sanders talks for him..One hand moisturizes the other hand that's how Biden works..💦💦💦💦💥💥
Is that the new name for Joe Biden, cute.  Especially cute since Beijing is extremely friendly to US citizens, and a wonderful place.  Oh, and did I mention they make 80% of everything you touch each day.  Clean out your own house first.  Ask Jack Ma
Yeah. The Right is counting on the debates to change the tide. And when Biden performs well without a hint of “dimentia” what will they do then? That will likely be the moment they know it’s over.
This is a rare time where it doesn’t matter. This election will be a referendum on Trump. Win or lose it’s coming down to that. Trump controls this election. Not Biden. It’s up to him. But some of his mistakes aren’t recoverable. Some are.

Barack Obama and Joe Biden they have been Traitors to the American people for 8 years and people still believe that they did a great job.Trump is the only President in my opinion that's been doing a great job no matter what the globalist the lefties and the Democrats throw at him
wtf? when have I ever implied that  bullshit that you're talkin about?  all I'm saying is that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know. and what we do know is that  it'll probably be better under Biden. want we don't know is how bad that could get under Trump.
but would it be less under Biden vs. Trump?
that may be, but at least Biden has his reasons to uphold the ACA (as sucky as it is), instead of trying to continuously defund it. in the middle of a pandemic. what viable alternative to him is there? in November somebody will be elected. do you want it to be Trump?
if you look at my comment history, I absolutely call Biden f*cking shit all the time. I'm making a rational logical appeal.
I never said that. Trump will appoint different ppl than Biden. why is that hard to understand?
exactly. and Biden would't just magically appoint the same ppl.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
when did I say Biden was a 'good' choice?
Can someone please ask Joe Biden in person if he even knows what Twitter is?
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
Again what would've been done? Seriously bro? I mean take the bs politics out of it......clearly we were taken advantage of, and don't forget Biden thought banning travel from China was a Xenophobe move &amp; nothing more, so clearly no one knew what to do with this shit.....
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
you don't need to convince me about Medicare for all. I don't need facts and need to be convinced of it. Biden won't do it though.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
You sound worried. #Biden
The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 —- how’d that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn’t even know he’s running.
I love it, finally big mouth Biden will face Justice. &amp;  i hope they throw the book at him. I'm so glad
Like the ones he wore at the Nationals Home opener, right!.  Oh, that's right it was the mask he wasn't wearing or social distancing he didn't adhere too.  Fauci starting to sound more and more like Biden.  Can't make up his mind what's good for us. Time for retirement.
So, u want to change the date of election do u?! I'm with you 100%! I say we move it up to September 1st and Inauguration Day up to November 3rd. That sounds much better to me since no one can really go out and campaign. We know all we need to know! You're a lunatic, Biden wins!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins. The fastest way to become a Marxist country is to vote for Biden. #DemsAreTheEnemyWithin #DemsAreTheDomesticTerrorists #WakeUpAmerica #VoteRed2020
Setting us up for a landslide victory from Biden as well as contesting the election results. Cry baby bitch of a President isn’t he.
The only way Joe Biden will be president is at GITMO and he can make his idiot son Vice president because they will be there together until death do you part.. I'm sure they will look very pretty wearing mop wigs and lipstick for the guy's..😘
You SERIOUSLY THINK BIDEN is the answer? Please tell me what you are smoking so I can be delusional too!🙄
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.
Twitters are asking each other if anyone voting for you. SO many are saying no. I'm voting for Biden. Start packing.
You first Dr. Fauci.  You were caught at Nationals opener not even following your own counsel.  No social distancing and not wearing a mask.  I think Dr. Fauci has become confused liked Biden, or that he has watched Contagion once too many times.
You are a blinking idiot! Biden didn’t even know where he was, and you have the audacity to say he was coherent. You are as dumb as a rock, if you think America buys your crap!
#AreYouBetterOff now then we were four years ago, my answer is no. We’re worse than I could have ever imagined, this is why I’m amending my 2016 Trump vote by getting many people including myself to vote for Joe Biden so we can get back on the right track.
Pelosi should be Biden’s VP choice. Ticket slogan DUMB AND DUMBER
Not on my death bed would I vote for this empty VESSEL Joe Biden!                                    TRUMP 2020.                                     MAGA 🇺🇸
Appears Judge N following Biden on the D Train.
I'm fat af, but hate Trump.... And Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
As Biden’s wife knows... Biden be Bitin
Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
John Solomon: ‘Joe Biden Was the Architect’ of U.S.-Funded ‘Military Espionage Outpost’ in Russia
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Bernie Sanders co-chair: Voting for Joe Biden like eating 'half a bowl of s--t'  via  If she is part of Bidens campaign, get rid of her, fire her.  Biden is doing what he thinks is good for the country, not like Socialist Bernie.
And still learning, plus being excited to vote for Joe Biden.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I say...just let him keep talking!  😏 Biden's political ads are just writing themselves at this point
After Trump, no one could do much more than get the shit back to shoe level in 4 years. All we’re gonna get here is a return to status quo and protect any open supreme court seats. I don’t expect Biden to even want more than 1 term.
It’s between Biden and someone who promotes conspiracy theories and medicine which is dangerous then Biden is the clear choice.
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Joe Biden = Lost soul feeding on poor peoples feelings. Not building them up, but keeping them down.
No. I’d like to see 60/35 Biden win
Thank you, Vice President Biden.  Can't wait until you're President!  RIP John Lewis.
Biden just said that Trump has to have a plan for distributing the vaccine when it comes out and needs to put someone in charge of the effort.  I guess General Perna is surprised.
If Biden starts changing his tune and starts promoting Medicare for all as a policy he’ll lose and lose hard. I understand there’s some people who won’t vote for him because he won’t. Who you gonna vote for? Trump? Is he gonna give you Medicare for all?
My only thing is, I feel like our best way forward in the short term is honestly with the American left.  I don't want to support Biden too hard or we'll lose credibility.
I’m scrolling through YouTube and  new video pops up and I’m sorry to say I haven’t watched it yet because I’m still laughing way harder than I should be at the pun in the title and fact that he photoshopped Trump and Biden onto ‘80s era Formula 1 cars
Biden supporters 🤷‍♂️
Joe Biden for President is the ultimate proof that Democrats want America to fail.
If Biden is a fascist, Donald Trump is Hitler reincarnate.  The choices are fucking awful. I know. I hate it. But one does more harm than the other, and it ain't Joe Biden.
And no, I won't "forget how awful Joe Biden is". He reminds me of his mediocrity every time he opens his mouth and every time he refuses to concede anything to the American left.  I'm not just going to develop amnesia and forget the times he let us down during the primary.
i'm no Biden cheerleader, he's consistently disappointed me at every step along the way to the nomination. But at least with Joe in office we can be sure that *some* things we've achieved will stay in place, i.e. gay rights, planned parenthood, basic environmental protections
the choice is between center-right bullshit or fascism-lite  that's the reality  i know i'm choosing to keep the harm to a minimum.  as much has been made of Joe Biden's unwillingness to reach out to the American left, he still shares far more values with us than Trump ever will
I get it bro, you have a different of opinion, I respect that, but don't sleep on Trump.....there will be a few more surprises before November......but it's Biden to lose.....if he does lose, it's bc he's been hiding and reading a teleprompter, that's only going to go so far
Yup.  Instead of actually doing something . He’s going to lose to the main character from Weekend At Bernie’s lol.... great job by Biden’s advisors
Does any seriously believe that Biden has the nick nacks to debate Trump?
Life is too short for this drama, I've been unfollowed and blocked by MAGA and Resisters, who cares?
I don't blame Chloe, your friend blocked me because he thinks I unfollowed him.
It's funny, I usually don't have a conversation in these threads except saying thank you, and the one time I do wow.
Thank you.
Only time I would go off or block a person if my kids were brought into this. I will make sure that person will get suspended, that's happened to a few MAGA accounts already, but I am very laid back until that line is crossed.
You are good.
If he had responded politely, I would have followed him. Honestly I don't even believe I followed him previously.
Thank you Nancy.
I don't even know who you are, obviously you weren't kidding and quite frankly I don't have time for drama.
Chloe was just fine, apparently someone had a problem that I didn't follow them.
Thank you Chloe, how's everyone doing that's tagged on this list?
Does Joe Biden prefer tea over coffee?
Biden shut down testing in 2009 during swine flu and his   top advisor acknowledged  didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic!  How about some interviews  #trumplandslide2020
Geneva County Alabama and Melbourne Florida. My goal is to get 10 votes for Biden and keep those around me safe from virus.
I can agree with that, it's not a one way or the highway mentality.     I think that is what pissed me off about Biden, to say "you ain't black if you don't vote for him".....  You got a choice either way, but to be that balantant about it is ridiculous imo.
Don’t get complacent, vote for Biden.
If I, a former Trump supporter can see that Biden is the clear choice in this election, so should the never Biden progressives. I will not take holding grudges as an excuse. Thank you for coming to my #TedTalk.
Difference between Trump and Biden, Trump rants all day in his tweets, Biden is coming up with plans to fix our country.
Trump is losing support everyday. Former Trump supporters &amp; Dems  who say they will vote for Biden should be lifted up. The choice is clear, Biden is a pathway to progressivsm &amp; positive change, Trump is a pathway to tyranny. If you can't see that then you're part of the problem.
Honestly, I don't think we need the never Biden people. If they want to sit this one out that's on them. Quite frankly my opinion as an American, if you want your voice heard you vote. Sitting an election out, I will not give you the time of day.
you forget that Biden will not serve 2 terms
Where is Joe Biden?  Why can't he take questions from reporters? Why are they hiding him???
Nothing pisses me off like these stupid trump ads that say Joe Biden is defunding the police
Except he didn't wreck the economy, he didn't "lose control" of a deadly epidemic and he didn't get caught extorting a foreign government. Biden was named in a Ukrainian criminal investigation for corruption and bribery, however.
Biden: foreign policy=Quid pro quo, how low can I go? I’ll be kind to you if you be kind to Hunter.  What a joke! #defundnpr
Biden: *suggests picking a literal Republican for VP*  mainstream Dems: *crickets*  rando on Twitter: "hey, Tulsi should be Biden's VP pick, IMO."  mainstream Dems: "UGH NO SHE'S JUST A REPUBLICAN IN DISGUISE"
His intimidation is only noise and that’s why one of many reasons Joe Biden will bear Trump. The American people are sick and tired of the bullying from him and MAGA.
Literally shows Trump's America &amp; calls it Biden's America. Well to be fair it will probably take a little time to clean up after you. At least 6 years if you manage to spark a violent revolution.
Damn right I'll be up for as long as it takes to name Biden our new &amp; deserving president!
I had the honor to be interviewed by a Brazilian News outlet named  &amp; share my story of how I became a former Trump supporter &amp; now a Biden supporter. We also now know how to say former Trump supporter in Portuguese. “ex-apoiador de Trump.”
They were making a statement about themselves and of their ilk, not Joe Biden. I bet a certain leader would call them "very fine people" and "patriots". I guess their MAGA masks were dirty. #GOVOTE #GTFOH #weneedgrownups
We won't be safe in Joe Biden's America? Why are you showing commercials of your America, Donny?!

Trump may be losing right now in the polls, but if there is a presidential debate it’ll be over for Joe Biden. #FactCheck #Trump2020
I live in Melbourne there are quite a few beachside. But starting to see a lot more Biden. Been seeing a lot of these
It seems to me joe Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. He has been quoted by himself that he’s racist and he’s a prolific liar. 100 days till you lose the election
Biden is as useless as tits on a bull....🤔actually he’s worse
I can't believe that you used this picture as part of your campaign advertisement. So, if you are voted in we will have four more years of this?! Screw that, I'm riding with Biden!
I'm voting for  because he has a pandemic playbook, will expand ACA. Joe Biden cares about the rule of law, the Constitution, Military &amp; Veterans. I no longer believe &amp; trust right wing propaganda, &amp; I now know who Trump is &amp; won't be fooled again.#ResistanceTaskForce
No doubt, it is what Trump wants. Biden can use it too, though. It's "Trump's America." "Never Trumpers" will probably use it by the end of the day. Too risky as a campaign choice, but it's a criminal act that no one but the perpetrator can control, anyway.
I'm voting for Joe Biden, because he is a caring, compassionate man and actually cares about our country and the people.  He is smart and can get us out of this mess.
For the 1,000th time, Joe Biden does not want to defend the police. Trump and his ads are, as is his brand, LYING to America!
Everyone PLEASE  read the truth and listen to Biden, he is not and will not DEFUND the police.  Trump is LYING and trying to cause chaos.  We need to vote blue all the way come November to get our country back on track.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The same could be said for Biden....
I live 30 min away. Lmao! Biden isn't winning shit.😂😂😂😂
I have, that's why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden, Warren aides say the two talk about every 10 days  I think Warren would do better doing as economic advisor because she gets things done..something in consumer advocacy.  Condelisa Rice Secretary of State or Vice President.  Kamala Harris as AG.....
He could beat Covid and Joe Biden. But he’s too stupid, stubborn and narcissistic to even see that path. It was always there for him to take and still is.

. when I voted for you, I really thought you meant you would actually a law an order president. But attacking peaceful protesters isn’t law and order, it’s tyranny and unconstitutional which is 1 of many reasons why I’m voting for Biden. #GestapoTrump
Biden is just as bad as Trump anyway if not worse.
Glad to see the end of these. Bring on Biden!
Trump says Biden will destroy our country. As usual your projecting, we will all help President Biden put it back together. Your a destroyer l. #NotVotingForTrump
Trump 4 president bc if Biden wins there will be no 911 2 call for help as he wants to take away police.The same police that enforce laws bc without law in this country there will be anarchy and chaos everywhere.I will be shot to kill anyone trolling to harm my family and friends
Biden and Obama stopped testing for H1N1 mid pandemic. These clowns have zero credibility
I know so why does the left keep supporting Biden???
Joe Biden election!
Don't lose hope, there are a lot of former Trump supporters out there I am confident Joe Biden will win.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be taking a month or so off from Twitter and go on vacation.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I won't stop until Biden is elected, when that happens I will go on a vacation for a month.
You,  and many others were right about him. I didn't listen in 2016 but I am listening now which is why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
I do like calling #COVID19 the Trump virus instead. It's more fitting because just think if Trump didn't toss Obama's and Biden's Pandemic playbook  aside, just think if Trump acted sooner than 70 days, just think if Trump wore a mask and encourage mask wearing sooner.
They do a lot of work for the Biden campaign, you are welcome.
Adopt all of Andrew Yangs policies &amp; he’d have my vote if he actually implemented them and was positive and would actually put humanity first. But he’s failed on that avenue on all ends. So Biden 2020 to get to Yang 2024 &amp; Yang 2028 🧢
Why does the right continue to blame Biden for problems that’s happening under Trump’s Presidency?
You can say all you want dude now that the virus hit, you couldn't say that in January, Clinton lost for a reason dude, many independents went for Trump, he wins again hands down without this virus.....now? Biden should win by a landslide, we shall see, I don't trust the polls
I remember the day my dad paid 80% in CA. Under Brown senior and Carter as president. Biden will do worse.
What was the last live event you watch featuring Biden?
I’d like to think Biden/Rice/Harris is going to sanction Putin into a mob hit, work with Iran, and be firm with China.
i can beat Biden off
Then Biden will win by an even larger margin. No certified results in red States mean no electoral votes from those states.

My husband is ex-republican and will be voting for Biden. We have a sign on our front lawn for that. He may go back to the party eventually, but doesn't like the way it is right now. Doesn't want to be associated with it.
Right. Vote biden. Hire the liar. He's better at it.
Ask Biden. He has a copy.
I wouldn’t have chosen someone so old. I wouldn’t have chosen someone so prone to gaffes - but the other option is a homicidal psychopath who has caused the death of 140+ &amp; counting. BIDEN 2020 - because freedom requires it! Mom &amp; teacher FOR democracy!

I'm counting on the secret Republican Biden voter's, who refuse to admit they are voting for him.
Trump mentioning five words gets extra credit proves he's  lying about the whole f****** 5 word question. Trump's  childish attempt to bait Biden to take a test.
Biden will win in 2020.
hence why i will vote for Joe Biden. I will not donate. I will not volunteer. I will not tell others to do so.
I'm not allowed to have an issue with Biden's milquetoast VP picks?
Can't believe people still think this. She literally endorsed Joe Biden. Everyone said she'd run third party because she's "a Russian op." She didn't. She's not a russian op. Let it go. She just has different views.
Biden is one of the main factors for the police brutality that exists today, which is what started the BLM movements
Why'd she endorse Joe Biden, then?
None of Biden's VP picks excite me or anyone else that actually wants to see substantial societal change.  The only one that I'm not completely lukewarm or outright ice-cold towards is  She's alright.
my point is that we shouldn't just say "oh yeah, we need a woman just because she's a woman"  we should pick whoever is best for the job, and right now nobody on Biden's shortlist jumps out at me other than  perhaps.
She endorsed Joe Biden, didn't she?  Doesn't seem like a very Putin-y thing to do.
This is how you unite, thank you President Biden.
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden  #SmartNews
If you don’t support Trump then why do you care if people are gonna vote for Biden?YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE allows you to do that to not care enough to vote. That’s why your allowed to not care because you’ll be FINE regardless. Trump is letting people get taken away in unmarked vans
Do you not realize the 4 years of tension built up is already built up? That’s not the future Matthew. NO ONE thinks Biden is gonna make things the way we want. That’s literally where this all started by saying we’re not voting for him bc we want to but HES THE LAST RESORT.
I don’t support him i NEVER said I did. And I never said there isn’t tension because of him.  I’m just saying you saying “but he won’t have 4 years of satanic tension built up next term” is you seeing the future. Idk why you think Biden is gonna make things the way you want
“I’ll take women who made millions singing about the poor choices in men she made, and now supports Joe Biden for 200.00, Alex”
I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden. Pass it on.
So you admit Biden can’t fix America? 😂
So why are you saying anyone who votes for Biden is stupid? But your smart for not voting ? Makes sense 😂 Voting is the only way change will come and it starts in each community into each state. We elect those who represent us. Maybe YOU should do some research on the importance
Remember when Obama, Biden gave a stimulus to American's $200.00 LOL.  While Biden's son was making himself a millionaire .
Like you gotta read the whole tweet and understand why I’m saying what I am. Not just see something and yell that the other person also has money. While he still doesn’t have half the platform the Pos Potus does. Biden hasn’t had a chance to prove himself. Trump has and he failed
Kenz you just said “go off about multi millionaire” referring to trump. I was referring that Biden is a multi millionaire as well. And him being in politics since the 1970s kinda suggests that the laws and bills that are in place now were passed by people like him. He’s racist af
You realize Biden is multi millionaire as well...? And has been in POLITICS FOR OVER 40 YEARS KENZIE!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO UR REASEARCH
Biden hasn’t even been able to compare to what Trump has done yet and still some how he’s still worse. Interesting
Biden has net worth of 9 million and has been in politics for 40 years. You think they care about us?? Trumps response to a lot of things isn’t the right response, again I’m not saying he’s the chosen one. I am saying Biden is much worse then him, you just choose not to see it.
Before corona virus America wasn’t the way it is. I’m not hyping up trump by any means but at least the man knows how to make money and get the economy going we had strongest economy in the world before corona hit. Just do your actual research on Biden before you vote for him
It blows my mind that you think I support Biden?? 😂
It blows my mind you support Biden Kenzie it really does 🤦🏼‍♂️
blows my mind people think Biden is capable of running a country, or the fact that they ignore he’s a extreme pedofile and think he’s not racist. Also voting for somebody just because you don’t want to vote for the other isn’t a good solution. Reasearch bout Biden before you vote
Cliff you were told what to do by Joe Biden....that's your "ya'll" you are referring too, it's not anyone else saying that, stay focused.
I truly believe this &amp; i also believe joe Biden will destroy our military like Obama did, Joe Biden is a  Crooked politician &amp; has proven that with his devotion to China.
You are doing what the Whiteman Biden told you to do.....so your tweet makes no sense actually, nice try.
I'm sure Biden knows what all the options are, and is smart enough not to discuss them publicly and tip his hand. I'm focusing on voter registration, mail voting, and GOTV in the meantime.
Person, man, woman, it wasn’t Biden that said that.
Biden and Obama praising each other and bashing Trump is exactly what we need these days.
Ads like these from the     and others are what needs to be on TV. Joe Biden’s ads are unifying but they’re too nice. Most Americans are not on social media. We need to fight fire with fire.
Why would Biden debate a known liar, propaganda race hating machine like Donald. He gains nothing from the debate. Donald is calling the Election rigged before we have one Why give him and open form to continue to use his propaganda to hurt America. He doe not deserve itI'm talking about innocent future potential deaths. not past ones. so it's ok if they die bec you want to hold Biden accountable?
Sure, but when the alternative is Donald Trump, not voting for Joe Biden is basically like breaking a leg instead of breaking a finger.  I hate it, but it's true :/
If you're willing to admit that not taking the L and voting for Biden will likely result in more harm to vulnerable communities for a shot at some benefit in the long run, that's fine, but it's intellectually dishonest to not admit that this is the case
Sure, just like Trump. Agreed. It needs to stop.  But there are some good things that Biden will do that Trump won't.  Now do you want to take the Dixie cup and drink water or do you want to dehydrate and die because you don't want to take water from a man that punched you?
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
because that's your argument here. if we're really in a crisis (which we are), we need to get whatever the fuck we can.  trump won't do anything, and he'll actually make it worse.  biden will at least do *something*, even if it is the bare minimum.
you're honestly right tbh  i have many a criticism of joe biden but i know that he wouldn't have botched the pandemic response as badly as trump has and i know that there's at least *a few things* that will be safe guarantees under a biden administration
Yep, and you're right. We had several candidates who were objectively better than Joe Biden.   In order to change the system we live in, we've gotta start from the ground up. No use crying over spilled milk. It sucks. I hate it. I don't have confidence or faith in Joe Biden.
I'm no Joe Biden cheerleader - I'm a very, very reluctant Biden voter.  4 more years are not an option. If you think we can just flip the table and walk out and not pay for it dearly, you're mistaken. I wish you were right, but you're not, IMO.
so if Biden wins you'd more probably die more so than if Trump is elected? if Trump gets elected we're looking at decades possibly of rep POTUS's. So any possible shift to the left, def won't come to fruition with that impediment.
Biden is not my candidate. Phone bank? I fucking hate him. But logic and math identify that he's the most likely, viable, and probable candidate to defeat Trump. like you mentioned that you'll need to move. My entire life hinges on if Trump wins or loses. I can't move on my own.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  via
I'm completely frustrated with Joe Biden too, I get it. He's shown himself to be totally not receptive to what young Americans want and need to be successful.  Difference is that I'm not willing to risk further harm for a symbolic win. I'm not gonna flip the table and walk out.
I worked alongside her to help Andrew Yang in the primaries.  A Biden presidency is very much not "getting her way".
Lord and hope so and rightfully so. We just need to remehow stupid and dangerous he is and vite Biden in November.
Wear a mask. Vote by mail. And vote for Joe Biden.
Usually presidential candidates have staffers or assistants escorting them around while campaigning. Seems Biden has a nurse or maybe his “Visiting Angel” from home is tagging along. Regardless, he looks confused. 👩🏼‍⚕️👼🏼😂
Um ... why should Biden apologize for what allegedly "some of his allies" are telling him?
Joe Biden isn’t making any decisions

Yeah. The Right is counting on the debates to change the tide. And when Biden performs well without a hint of “dimentia” what will they do then? That will likely be the moment they know it’s over.
This is a rare time where it doesn’t matter. This election will be a referendum on Trump. Win or lose it’s coming down to that. Trump controls this election. Not Biden. It’s up to him. But some of his mistakes aren’t recoverable. Some are.

is there no end to those you’d shame?  Doubt Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer know Twitch.  Also doubt you, Omar, Tlaib, Presley know the Constitution. Just a little more context...
Barack Obama and Joe Biden they have been Traitors to the American people for 8 years and people still believe that they did a great job.Trump is the only President in my opinion that's been doing a great job no matter what the globalist the lefties and the Democrats throw at him
wtf? when have I ever implied that  bullshit that you're talkin about?  all I'm saying is that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know. and what we do know is that  it'll probably be better under Biden. want we don't know is how bad that could get under Trump.
but would it be less under Biden vs. Trump?
that may be, but at least Biden has his reasons to uphold the ACA (as sucky as it is), instead of trying to continuously defund it. in the middle of a pandemic. what viable alternative to him is there? in November somebody will be elected. do you want it to be Trump?
if you look at my comment history, I absolutely call Biden f*cking shit all the time. I'm making a rational logical appeal.
I never said that. Trump will appoint different ppl than Biden. why is that hard to understand?
exactly. and Biden would't just magically appoint the same ppl.
my original point was that in order to defeat Trump, one must vote for Biden; especially in red or swing states.
when did I say Biden was a 'good' choice?
Can someone please ask Joe Biden in person if he even knows what Twitter is?
true, it is, but with the astronomical chance would you rather Trump handle it or Biden?
Biden may want to arrest you, but Trump wants you dead.
Again what would've been done? Seriously bro? I mean take the bs politics out of it......clearly we were taken advantage of, and don't forget Biden thought banning travel from China was a Xenophobe move &amp; nothing more, so clearly no one knew what to do with this shit.....
There is no chance in hell they will let Biden debate Trump. It would be a mental massacre.
on the surface maybe. like a let's look at the Supreme Court: would you rather Trump appoint 1-2 judges for a lifetime appointment or Biden?
you don't need to convince me about Medicare for all. I don't need facts and need to be convinced of it. Biden won't do it though.
the most logical way to beat Trump is to consolidate votes behind one single candidate to win. it's just a matter of fact. so if you don't want Trump to potentially handle a covid-22, then one would have to unfortunately vote for Biden to prevent that.
You sound worried. #Biden
The biggest landslide in history: Same prediction the entire MSM made in 2016 —- how’d that work out for you. And to think, there was actually a candidate running against Trump in 2016. This year Biden doesn’t even know he’s running.
I love it, finally big mouth Biden will face Justice. &amp;  i hope they throw the book at him. I'm so glad
Like the ones he wore at the Nationals Home opener, right!.  Oh, that's right it was the mask he wasn't wearing or social distancing he didn't adhere too.  Fauci starting to sound more and more like Biden.  Can't make up his mind what's good for us. Time for retirement.
So, u want to change the date of election do u?! I'm with you 100%! I say we move it up to September 1st and Inauguration Day up to November 3rd. That sounds much better to me since no one can really go out and campaign. We know all we need to know! You're a lunatic, Biden wins!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins. The fastest way to become a Marxist country is to vote for Biden. #DemsAreTheEnemyWithin #DemsAreTheDomesticTerrorists #WakeUpAmerica #VoteRed2020
Setting us up for a landslide victory from Biden as well as contesting the election results. Cry baby bitch of a President isn’t he.
Don’t let pride and ego stop you from making the right choice in this presidential election, vote for Joe Biden.
The only way Joe Biden will be president is at GITMO and he can make his idiot son Vice president because they will be there together until death do you part.. I'm sure they will look very pretty wearing mop wigs and lipstick for the guy's..😘
You SERIOUSLY THINK BIDEN is the answer? Please tell me what you are smoking so I can be delusional too!🙄
Joe Biden is hiring somebody else to debate Donald Trump because he doesn't have the mental capability and he knows he's on his way to  Gitmo for treason and crimes against humanity, October 2020 will be a Biblical day.. they made the prison bigger to fit your treasonous friends.
Twitters are asking each other if anyone voting for you. SO many are saying no. I'm voting for Biden. Start packing.
You first Dr. Fauci.  You were caught at Nationals opener not even following your own counsel.  No social distancing and not wearing a mask.  I think Dr. Fauci has become confused liked Biden, or that he has watched Contagion once too many times.
#AreYouBetterOff now then we were four years ago, my answer is no. We’re worse than I could have ever imagined, this is why I’m amending my 2016 Trump vote by getting many people including myself to vote for Joe Biden so we can get back on the right track.
Pelosi should be Biden’s VP choice. Ticket slogan DUMB AND DUMBER
We have 150,000 dead from #COVID19 &amp; Trump is trying to manipulate the American people into thinking that mail in voting is wrong so he could prevent people from voting for Biden. He knows his supporters would be stupid enough to go to the booths during the pandemic.
Not on my death bed would I vote for this empty VESSEL Joe Biden!                                    TRUMP 2020.                                     MAGA 🇺🇸
Let’s recap today’s Republican talking points. #LouieGohmert blames wearing a mask for catching the #coronaviru, and #LauraIngraham didn’t know Berlin was in Germany. I think Biden should win in a landslide.
Appears Judge N following Biden on the D Train.
I'm fat af, but hate Trump.... And Biden.
My point is this, learn from our mistake because a no vote is a vote for Trump who is no where near like Biden.
I understand never Biden "progressives" may have trouble trusting us former Trump supporters, but If we could break free from cult MAGA &amp; regret that our vote has put our country in the state of where it's at, then maybe listen to us voting for Biden would save our Democracy.
Hillary Clinton was right about Trump, she is right about Joe Biden, that is the tweet.
As Biden’s wife knows... Biden be Bitin
Last point, if you think Biden is the same as Trump, you are in a cult.
John Solomon: ‘Joe Biden Was the Architect’ of U.S.-Funded ‘Military Espionage Outpost’ in Russia
I believe Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Trump than Sanders. A Joe Biden presidency is a realistic pathway to progressivsim. Joe Biden's policies are a great first step for our country to move in the right direction.
Bernie Sanders co-chair: Voting for Joe Biden like eating 'half a bowl of s--t'  via  If she is part of Bidens campaign, get rid of her, fire her.  Biden is doing what he thinks is good for the country, not like Socialist Bernie.
And still learning, plus being excited to vote for Joe Biden.
I’ve learned my lesson from voting for Trump, Joe Biden has my vote.
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I say...just let him keep talking!  😏 Biden's political ads are just writing themselves at this point
After Trump, no one could do much more than get the shit back to shoe level in 4 years. All we’re gonna get here is a return to status quo and protect any open supreme court seats. I don’t expect Biden to even want more than 1 term.
It’s between Biden and someone who promotes conspiracy theories and medicine which is dangerous then Biden is the clear choice.
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Oh wow is this the real Biden bus?
Joe Biden = Lost soul feeding on poor peoples feelings. Not building them up, but keeping them down.
No. I’d like to see 60/35 Biden win
Thank you, Vice President Biden.  Can't wait until you're President!  RIP John Lewis.
Biden just said that Trump has to have a plan for distributing the vaccine when it comes out and needs to put someone in charge of the effort.  I guess General Perna is surprised.
If Biden starts changing his tune and starts promoting Medicare for all as a policy he’ll lose and lose hard. I understand there’s some people who won’t vote for him because he won’t. Who you gonna vote for? Trump? Is he gonna give you Medicare for all?
My only thing is, I feel like our best way forward in the short term is honestly with the American left.  I don't want to support Biden too hard or we'll lose credibility.
I’m scrolling through YouTube and  new video pops up and I’m sorry to say I haven’t watched it yet because I’m still laughing way harder than I should be at the pun in the title and fact that he photoshopped Trump and Biden onto ‘80s era Formula 1 cars
Biden supporters 🤷‍♂️
Trump lied about throwing opening day pitch at Yankee stadium, he’s also lied about Obama and Biden, you have absolutely no credibility and I’m far from being the only former Trump supporter.
Only way to do that is vote for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden for President is the ultimate proof that Democrats want America to fail.
If Biden is a fascist, Donald Trump is Hitler reincarnate.  The choices are fucking awful. I know. I hate it. But one does more harm than the other, and it ain't Joe Biden.
And no, I won't "forget how awful Joe Biden is". He reminds me of his mediocrity every time he opens his mouth and every time he refuses to concede anything to the American left.  I'm not just going to develop amnesia and forget the times he let us down during the primary.
i'm no Biden cheerleader, he's consistently disappointed me at every step along the way to the nomination. But at least with Joe in office we can be sure that *some* things we've achieved will stay in place, i.e. gay rights, planned parenthood, basic environmental protections
the choice is between center-right bullshit or fascism-lite  that's the reality  i know i'm choosing to keep the harm to a minimum.  as much has been made of Joe Biden's unwillingness to reach out to the American left, he still shares far more values with us than Trump ever will
I get it bro, you have a different of opinion, I respect that, but don't sleep on Trump.....there will be a few more surprises before November......but it's Biden to lose.....if he does lose, it's bc he's been hiding and reading a teleprompter, that's only going to go so far
Yup.  Instead of actually doing something . He’s going to lose to the main character from Weekend At Bernie’s lol.... great job by Biden’s advisors
Does any seriously believe that Biden has the nick nacks to debate Trump?
Life is too short for this drama, I've been unfollowed and blocked by MAGA and Resisters, who cares?
I don't blame Chloe, your friend blocked me because he thinks I unfollowed him.
It's funny, I usually don't have a conversation in these threads except saying thank you, and the one time I do wow.
Really? Over me supposedly unfollowing him?
Thank you.
He *might* have lost a step from the Great Malarkey Debate, but mano-á-mano against Trump is perhaps the easiest challenge Biden’s ever had
Only time I would go off or block a person if my kids were brought into this. I will make sure that person will get suspended, that's happened to a few MAGA accounts already, but I am very laid back until that line is crossed.
You are good.
If he had responded politely, I would have followed him. Honestly I don't even believe I followed him previously.
Thank you Nancy.
I don't even know who you are, obviously you weren't kidding and quite frankly I don't have time for drama.
Chloe was just fine, apparently someone had a problem that I didn't follow them.
Thank you Chloe, how's everyone doing that's tagged on this list?
Does Joe Biden prefer tea over coffee?
Biden shut down testing in 2009 during swine flu and his   top advisor acknowledged  didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic!  How about some interviews  #trumplandslide2020
Geneva County Alabama and Melbourne Florida. My goal is to get 10 votes for Biden and keep those around me safe from virus.
I can agree with that, it's not a one way or the highway mentality.     I think that is what pissed me off about Biden, to say "you ain't black if you don't vote for him".....  You got a choice either way, but to be that balantant about it is ridiculous imo.
Don’t get complacent, vote for Biden.
If I, a former Trump supporter can see that Biden is the clear choice in this election, so should the never Biden progressives. I will not take holding grudges as an excuse. Thank you for coming to my #TedTalk.
Difference between Trump and Biden, Trump rants all day in his tweets, Biden is coming up with plans to fix our country.
Trump is losing support everyday. Former Trump supporters &amp; Dems  who say they will vote for Biden should be lifted up. The choice is clear, Biden is a pathway to progressivsm &amp; positive change, Trump is a pathway to tyranny. If you can't see that then you're part of the problem.
Honestly, I don't think we need the never Biden people. If they want to sit this one out that's on them. Quite frankly my opinion as an American, if you want your voice heard you vote. Sitting an election out, I will not give you the time of day.
you forget that Biden will not serve 2 terms
Where is Joe Biden?  Why can't he take questions from reporters? Why are they hiding him???
Besides it being quite a while after Super Tuesday, the fact that Tulsi only endorsed Biden after having burned through all residual goodwill &amp; after months of appearing on the White Power Hour with Trucknuts Carlton…more evidence that most grifters just aren’t very bright
Nothing pisses me off like these stupid trump ads that say Joe Biden is defunding the police
Except he didn't wreck the economy, he didn't "lose control" of a deadly epidemic and he didn't get caught extorting a foreign government. Biden was named in a Ukrainian criminal investigation for corruption and bribery, however.
Biden: *suggests picking a literal Republican for VP*  mainstream Dems: *crickets*  rando on Twitter: "hey, Tulsi should be Biden's VP pick, IMO."  mainstream Dems: "UGH NO SHE'S JUST A REPUBLICAN IN DISGUISE"
His intimidation is only noise and that’s why one of many reasons Joe Biden will bear Trump. The American people are sick and tired of the bullying from him and MAGA.
Literally shows Trump's America &amp; calls it Biden's America. Well to be fair it will probably take a little time to clean up after you. At least 6 years if you manage to spark a violent revolution.
Damn right I'll be up for as long as it takes to name Biden our new &amp; deserving president!
I had the honor to be interviewed by a Brazilian News outlet named  &amp; share my story of how I became a former Trump supporter &amp; now a Biden supporter. We also now know how to say former Trump supporter in Portuguese. “ex-apoiador de Trump.”
They were making a statement about themselves and of their ilk, not Joe Biden. I bet a certain leader would call them "very fine people" and "patriots". I guess their MAGA masks were dirty. #GOVOTE #GTFOH #weneedgrownups

We have the worst now that we’ve ever had! my money is on Joe Biden! I know him I trust him!
I live in Melbourne there are quite a few beachside. But starting to see a lot more Biden. Been seeing a lot of these
It seems to me joe Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. He has been quoted by himself that he’s racist and he’s a prolific liar. 100 days till you lose the election
Biden is as useless as tits on a bull....🤔actually he’s worse
I can't believe that you used this picture as part of your campaign advertisement. So, if you are voted in we will have four more years of this?! Screw that, I'm riding with Biden!
I'm voting for  because he has a pandemic playbook, will expand ACA. Joe Biden cares about the rule of law, the Constitution, Military &amp; Veterans. I no longer believe &amp; trust right wing propaganda, &amp; I now know who Trump is &amp; won't be fooled again.#ResistanceTaskForce
No doubt, it is what Trump wants. Biden can use it too, though. It's "Trump's America." "Never Trumpers" will probably use it by the end of the day. Too risky as a campaign choice, but it's a criminal act that no one but the perpetrator can control, anyway.
I'm voting for Joe Biden, because he is a caring, compassionate man and actually cares about our country and the people.  He is smart and can get us out of this mess.
For the 1,000th time, Joe Biden does not want to defend the police. Trump and his ads are, as is his brand, LYING to America!
Everyone PLEASE  read the truth and listen to Biden, he is not and will not DEFUND the police.  Trump is LYING and trying to cause chaos.  We need to vote blue all the way come November to get our country back on track.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The same could be said for Biden....
I live 30 min away. Lmao! Biden isn't winning shit.😂😂😂😂
I have, that's why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
I have only really been seeing “the Democrats have got this” in the past two weeks, as Biden maintains both an above-water approval rating and a double-digit lead. Which is still accompanied by heavy apprehension about USPS’ defunding, the possibility of a stolen election…
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden, Warren aides say the two talk about every 10 days  I think Warren would do better doing as economic advisor because she gets things done..something in consumer advocacy.  Condelisa Rice Secretary of State or Vice President.  Kamala Harris as AG.....
He could beat Covid and Joe Biden. But he’s too stupid, stubborn and narcissistic to even see that path. It was always there for him to take and still is.

. when I voted for you, I really thought you meant you would actually a law an order president. But attacking peaceful protesters isn’t law and order, it’s tyranny and unconstitutional which is 1 of many reasons why I’m voting for Biden. #GestapoTrump
Biden is just as bad as Trump anyway if not worse.
Glad to see the end of these. Bring on Biden!
Trump says Biden will destroy our country. As usual your projecting, we will all help President Biden put it back together. Your a destroyer l. #NotVotingForTrump
Trump 4 president bc if Biden wins there will be no 911 2 call for help as he wants to take away police.The same police that enforce laws bc without law in this country there will be anarchy and chaos everywhere.I will be shot to kill anyone trolling to harm my family and friends
Biden and Obama stopped testing for H1N1 mid pandemic. These clowns have zero credibility
I know so why does the left keep supporting Biden???
Joe Biden election!
Don't lose hope, there are a lot of former Trump supporters out there I am confident Joe Biden will win.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be taking a month or so off from Twitter and go on vacation.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I won't stop until Biden is elected, when that happens I will go on a vacation for a month.
You,  and many others were right about him. I didn't listen in 2016 but I am listening now which is why I will be voting for Joe Biden.
I do like calling #COVID19 the Trump virus instead. It's more fitting because just think if Trump didn't toss Obama's and Biden's Pandemic playbook  aside, just think if Trump acted sooner than 70 days, just think if Trump wore a mask and encourage mask wearing sooner.
They do a lot of work for the Biden campaign, you are welcome.
It is probably not coincidental that Kanye’s initial (abortive?) statement about suspending his campaign was made after polls showed he pulled more support from Trumpists than prospective Biden supporters…
Adopt all of Andrew Yangs policies &amp; he’d have my vote if he actually implemented them and was positive and would actually put humanity first. But he’s failed on that avenue on all ends. So Biden 2020 to get to Yang 2024 &amp; Yang 2028 🧢
Why does the right continue to blame Biden for problems that’s happening under Trump’s Presidency?
You can say all you want dude now that the virus hit, you couldn't say that in January, Clinton lost for a reason dude, many independents went for Trump, he wins again hands down without this virus.....now? Biden should win by a landslide, we shall see, I don't trust the polls
I remember the day my dad paid 80% in CA. Under Brown senior and Carter as president. Biden will do worse.
What was the last live event you watch featuring Biden?
I’d like to think Biden/Rice/Harris is going to sanction Putin into a mob hit, work with Iran, and be firm with China.
i can beat Biden off
Then Biden will win by an even larger margin. No certified results in red States mean no electoral votes from those states.
Hey  If you're serious about spending 1billion to defeat trump, you couldn't do better than joining this. Take Florida, and a Biden/Democratic win is all but guaranteed!⬇️⬇️⬇️

Right. Vote biden. Hire the liar. He's better at it.
Ask Biden. He has a copy.
I wouldn’t have chosen someone so old. I wouldn’t have chosen someone so prone to gaffes - but the other option is a homicidal psychopath who has caused the death of 140+ &amp; counting. BIDEN 2020 - because freedom requires it! Mom &amp; teacher FOR democracy!

Biden will win in 2020.
hence why i will vote for Joe Biden. I will not donate. I will not volunteer. I will not tell others to do so.
I'm not allowed to have an issue with Biden's milquetoast VP picks?
Can't believe people still think this. She literally endorsed Joe Biden. Everyone said she'd run third party because she's "a Russian op." She didn't. She's not a russian op. Let it go. She just has different views.
Biden is one of the main factors for the police brutality that exists today, which is what started the BLM movements
Why'd she endorse Joe Biden, then?
None of Biden's VP picks excite me or anyone else that actually wants to see substantial societal change.  The only one that I'm not completely lukewarm or outright ice-cold towards is  She's alright.
my point is that we shouldn't just say "oh yeah, we need a woman just because she's a woman"  we should pick whoever is best for the job, and right now nobody on Biden's shortlist jumps out at me other than  perhaps.
She endorsed Joe Biden, didn't she?  Doesn't seem like a very Putin-y thing to do.
This is how you unite, thank you President Biden.
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden  #SmartNews
If you don’t support Trump then why do you care if people are gonna vote for Biden?YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE allows you to do that to not care enough to vote. That’s why your allowed to not care because you’ll be FINE regardless. Trump is letting people get taken away in unmarked vans
Do you not realize the 4 years of tension built up is already built up? That’s not the future Matthew. NO ONE thinks Biden is gonna make things the way we want. That’s literally where this all started by saying we’re not voting for him bc we want to but HES THE LAST RESORT.
I don’t support him i NEVER said I did. And I never said there isn’t tension because of him.  I’m just saying you saying “but he won’t have 4 years of satanic tension built up next term” is you seeing the future. Idk why you think Biden is gonna make things the way you want
“I’ll take women who made millions singing about the poor choices in men she made, and now supports Joe Biden for 200.00, Alex”
I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden. Pass it on.
So you admit Biden can’t fix America? 😂
So why are you saying anyone who votes for Biden is stupid? But your smart for not voting ? Makes sense 😂 Voting is the only way change will come and it starts in each community into each state. We elect those who represent us. Maybe YOU should do some research on the importance
Remember when Obama, Biden gave a stimulus to American's $200.00 LOL.  While Biden's son was making himself a millionaire .
Like you gotta read the whole tweet and understand why I’m saying what I am. Not just see something and yell that the other person also has money. While he still doesn’t have half the platform the Pos Potus does. Biden hasn’t had a chance to prove himself. Trump has and he failed
Kenz you just said “go off about multi millionaire” referring to trump. I was referring that Biden is a multi millionaire as well. And him being in politics since the 1970s kinda suggests that the laws and bills that are in place now were passed by people like him. He’s racist af
You realize Biden is multi millionaire as well...? And has been in POLITICS FOR OVER 40 YEARS KENZIE!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO UR REASEARCH
Biden hasn’t even been able to compare to what Trump has done yet and still some how he’s still worse. Interesting
Biden has net worth of 9 million and has been in politics for 40 years. You think they care about us?? Trumps response to a lot of things isn’t the right response, again I’m not saying he’s the chosen one. I am saying Biden is much worse then him, you just choose not to see it.
Before corona virus America wasn’t the way it is. I’m not hyping up trump by any means but at least the man knows how to make money and get the economy going we had strongest economy in the world before corona hit. Just do your actual research on Biden before you vote for him
It blows my mind that you think I support Biden?? 😂
It blows my mind you support Biden Kenzie it really does 🤦🏼‍♂️
blows my mind people think Biden is capable of running a country, or the fact that they ignore he’s a extreme pedofile and think he’s not racist. Also voting for somebody just because you don’t want to vote for the other isn’t a good solution. Reasearch bout Biden before you vote
Cliff you were told what to do by Joe Biden....that's your "ya'll" you are referring too, it's not anyone else saying that, stay focused.
I truly believe this &amp; i also believe joe Biden will destroy our military like Obama did, Joe Biden is a  Crooked politician &amp; has proven that with his devotion to China.
You are doing what the Whiteman Biden told you to do.....so your tweet makes no sense actually, nice try.
I'm sure Biden knows what all the options are, and is smart enough not to discuss them publicly and tip his hand. I'm focusing on voter registration, mail voting, and GOTV in the meantime.
Person, man, woman, it wasn’t Biden that said that.
Biden and Obama praising each other and bashing Trump is exactly what we need these days.
Ads like these from the     and others are what needs to be on TV. Joe Biden’s ads are unifying but they’re too nice. Most Americans are not on social media. We need to fight fire with fire.
Why would Biden debate a known liar, propaganda race hating machine like Donald. He gains nothing from the debate. Donald is calling the Election rigged before we have one Why give him and open form to continue to use his propaganda to hurt America. He doe not deserve it

To you, yes it seems all about race every four years, the Democratic Party stirs up the race every four years to remind the Black Voter where there vote should go, as Biden so eloquently said that you weren't Black if you didn't support him for President....

Who is "y'all"...if you are referring to Biden? Then yes he specifically told you that your not black if you don't vote for him.......those are facts, I do agree it makes no sense he would say such a racist thing, but he did......
There are suppose to be zero remember? You were specifically told you were not black if you don't support Biden.......there are some Black Americans I know can think for themselves and don't have to do as they are told

Trump Gains Among Black Voters, Biden Trails Hillary in 2016
Now Biden is doing the samething, avoiding press conferences, shuffles up to the teleprompter reads it and shuffles away from it without taking any tough questions......I am not sure how this is going to work out for him, I guess we will just have to wait and see.
I said it was interesting.....I am sure Biden is going to win hands down, you got nothing to worry about.....I am sure you were on Twitter in 2016 like I was, I remember how much Trump was getting destroyed at this point, I remember HRC not doing press conferences....
Because Joe Biden can’t brag about a test he can’t pass, Hillary.
Honestly, I wouldn’t care if Biden was embalmed. He still gets my vote.
To be clear he's not getting more black votes then Biden, it was saying Clinton had a better lead with Black Voters at this point then Biden does, it was showing Trump gained +5 with the Black Vote
Nevermind, yes the numbers say the same thing they did in 2016, HRC had the numbers clearly in her favor, Just as Biden has numbers clearly in his favor today.....you can't dispute that is what my point is......Nov.3rd is what countsBut if you can't decide between Biden or Trump?

New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Why is Jill Biden doing an interview for Dana Perino on Fox? Is she the candidate running for President? Joe can’t do an interview!!!  #HidenBiden

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
95 days to go! 17.3M+ cases &amp; 673k+ deaths globally, 4.4M+ cases &amp; 152k+ deaths in US, Herman Cain dies of Covid, Nunes refuses to admit if he got dirt on Biden, Kelly leads McSally, Obama’s powerful eulogy, Trump campaign pauses ads, Biden to hopefully pick VP soon. #ResistOn🇺🇸
⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Hi. Mom for Biden here. I attended the launch party last night with  and it was refreshing to hear positive and informed ideas. I can’t wait to vote for a candidate who will value and protect the lives of children, teachers, and staff. #MomsForBiden
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.

I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

Barack Obama forgets he is no longer President! How inappropriate to use a funeral to make a political statement! Biden is the one running. Tell him to come out of the basement and start facing the public! #ObamaIsNotRunning
Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a “fraudulent vote”. I’m happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
We will make #GoodTrouble to elect Joe Biden! #WeWillVote
We definitely need debates. Have you seen Biden?  He’s not all there.
Obama and Biden promised they will do that next time 🤦🏿‍♂️
Are you his personal doctor? Why r u sticking to the same talking points like #DoNothingDemocrats ?  Why aren’t you saying same about sleeping job Biden? A lil racist ha?? #vision2020
..re: for profit, I guess Obama can profit, trump, Biden but now Kanye? U think Kanye need more profits in addition gap, adidas, producer, designer,etc
Biden should too.
How many things Biden said about blacks? Or trump about blacks? Stop 🛑 want fair coverage of Kanye? Sign my petition
I'm old enough to remember this.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
She’s senile along with Biden
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn’t answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left 😂
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
They asked Biden what flavor jello he had for lunch.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)
“The language very closely echoes recommendations released earlier this month by criminal justice reform task force that Biden and former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) organized.”
Agree!  We’ll deserved and we should make sure President Biden does it!
Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden  #FoxNews
Vote for Biden and give him the Senate and those pulling his strings will have us as East Germany in a year.  You will wake up too late and not be happy.  But, too late.  How do you not see this?

Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I’m Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
should you take reporter questions like Biden from friends who are taken quietly in order with scripted questions? What is this crap?
Then do it and stop procrastinating! Vote trump! No commie nadler Schiff warren s Biden’s et al .
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020
...whatever "progressive" is supposed to mean now.  Bernie Sanders is not a "progressive". Joe Biden is not a "progressive".

I think he googled "fake name that's not Biden"
He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
You want to fix the problems of America &amp; Foreign affairs. Joe Biden needs an all women cabinet!!! Kamala Harris Stacy Abrams AOC Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren Val Demings Keisha Lance Bottoms Muriel Bowser Lori Lightfoot Veronica Escobar Jenny Durkan  Gretchen Whitmer Karen Bass
Its like the Trump v Biden debates.. I wouldn’t be surprised.
Sorry, i might have used the wrong word. Delayed for now. But this smells like the Biden debates, if you ask me.
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
You already had your opportunity. We saw the Obama-Biden Administration! What’s different now?
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.

Joe biden." Do I get dessert with that?".
Biden - you will suck up to anything in order to appease the needy so that you can get elected and then you’ll do NOTHING
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let’s not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn’t get into office? Let’s not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
What a crock with the blaming Kor Biden and saying he will defund the police. scare tactics.  In Georgia watching horrible political ads by #trump and the disgusting radical right extremist  #kellyloeffler, troll extraordinaire: DONT do it Georgia! Don’t vote in evil
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.

Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
We don’t need to see Biden being interviewed. It’s more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
Kudos to  for not trying pressure Biden into picking a Black woman as VP. She’s got great political future &amp; is good for USA
- this lady speaking about Biden is so wet behind the ears - She is right about 1 thing - BUDEN is going to need a smart VP because he is totally incompetent- Senile to the MAX
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. 🤔
Great!  is going to have Stacey Abraham’s on #reidout so they can pressure Biden into tapping SA as VP. Keep it up  Paint Biden bad if his pick isn’t Black. Because color is critical to qualifications, right?!?  is better VP pick but must be next AG
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
Please stop talking about how hot Joe Biden is and focus on his policy
What? Must think Biden going to win will lose everything in taxes!
Biden would HATE if you retweeted
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies

More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Hey, didn’t they have a fiery exchange about busing or done legislation Biden authored??
I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I’m not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai

Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
What a waste. Joe Biden will take it down.🌊

Thanks Stacy
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

At least to about the middle of next year. If it is still raging on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will institute a national "wear a mask" program that will FINALLY get it under control.

Bottom line, guys, if Biden gets elected, we lose our country. That's not hyperbole. As much as you hate Trump, you should hate even more the premise of our country falling to the very powers that we have been fighting for decades. And they won't have to lift a finger.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Pretty sure Biden’s pick will be Kamala Harris, but the truth is Stacy Abrams, Val Demmings, and Keisha Bottoms would all be ground breaking. But if Biden wanted to rock the world,and win hands down, he should try to get a woman named Michelle Obama to say yes instead.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No, Daniel. You have been poisoned by the educational system and MSM to believe Biden would actually be the president. I, for one, will never see my great country fall to the Marxist/Socialist ideals these couch potatoes espouse. Which is why we have the #2A
Yes because Joe Biden wants to abolish the suburbs

can you beat my friend off after you finish with biden? is there a line for YE handjobs somewhere?
Biden was there too??
Believe me, Biden and the rest of the Country would rather he not attend the Inauguration. I hope I never have to see his orange face again and especially his family of grifters.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.
But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. 🌊😀☮️🌹
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you’re part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
Hey, everybody! I'm honored to be a Fellow for the Biden Campaign. If you want to help Joe Biden become the next POTUS, the first step is clicking that link below and joining us this Monday for a phone bank! #FlipFLBlue #votefldems #Biden2020
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote 🗳  Senate to become Dem majority 🗳
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
We did not see this violence during the Obama/Biden years, we are seeing dystopian America under  .
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‘conspiracy theories’ about Biden
Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. 🙂
Great. Let’s bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that—just until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.

The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.
"We’ve seen huge transformation in Biden’s climate plan,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
“People want to know they’re invited to the table,” Jones said, saying  has said “everybody come to the table and let’s reason together, like we say in church.”

No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?

Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
95 days until the election and I’m organizing for Joe Biden because he has a 4-point plan to give essential workers the long-term support they deserve   ⬆️wages, quality/affordable healthcare, free tuition for public higher education, encouraging unionization + more

Answer to If both Biden and Trump contracted and died from Coronavirus before November what would happen to the 2020 Presidential Election? (I’m not being political in this question, just curious how the American system would deal such … by Channing Taylo
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.”
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
"U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by BY MARK LANDLER via NYT New York Times

Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
Brain Dead Biden
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!

That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.

Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.

What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.

Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

You mean a Fake Ad about Joe Biden
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don’t do anything without talking to each other.

Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.

Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.

It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don’t think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.

I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.

NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.
Trump, Biden and the Little Sisters of the Poor  via
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna 🇺🇲 🏛 🇺🇲
That woman is tough as nails! She's going to hang in there til Biden wins, no matter what! She deserves flowers every week.
#Trump2020 #MAGA2020Landslide  Btw I hear Joe Biden wears a diaper
Biden has the same chances of winning as the Patriots of winning next Superbowl!
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
I’m a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Can’t wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She’s senile along with Biden
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real questionBut if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. 🌊😀☮️🌹
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you’re part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote 🗳  Senate to become Dem majority 🗳
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‘conspiracy theories’ about Biden
"We’ve seen huge transformation in Biden’s climate plan,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
As long as you vote. Personally, I am dragging my disabled veteran ass to the polls with mask, gloves, sanitizer and garlic around my neck. No one will mess with my right to vote. I served this country for that right!   #Biden2020 #Biden #VeteransAgainstTrump
I’m just a big Honeymooners fan and love me some Jackie Gleason so if I got a chance to take a shot at this empty vessel Biden and get a laugh with Jackie I’m all in  TRUMP 2020 HOW SWEET IT IS !!!!
"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.”
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it’s insanity... and you’ve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden 🤪🤪
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy’s portrait in? I’m suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.
#SpecialReport Clinton is younger than Biden; who would want Clinton to be POTUS at this age. Nobody.
There IS a god.  #Biden for Florida and for the win!!
I do too.  I am NOT #DyingForTrump   I’m voting for #Biden
Please Lincoln project, can you come up with a better slogan for the Biden campaign? “Build back better” is kinda weak. You guys are smart. You can come up with something better?
Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Will your president ever condemn Biden for his racist comments ?
Progressive Coalition Urges Biden to Curb 'Excesses of Corporate Power' by Ending White House Revolving Door -  via
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
You are definitely voting for Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂
95 percent of liberals said they plan to vote for Biden and 86 percent of conservatives said they plan to vote for Trump. Among moderates, Biden leads Trump 63 to 22 percent.
This is what the Democrats- Pelosi and Biden and Nadler call a myth 😂😂😂
Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
I'm old enough to remember this.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️"A Biden presidency would be steered by radical left-wing extremists &amp; the end of our country as we know it." Sean Hannity
and i'm not gone lie ima call it rn if biden becomes president he may die and the black woman vp he has will become president

The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It’s whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he’s doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden’s victory, not actually delay an election.
Joe Biden told us this in April.
Vote Biden.........said no sane person ever. war.
You must be kidding. Landslide victory for Biden . All he needs is to do is let you talk. losing votes by the minute with idiotic tweets!!
Yes and it will be for Biden
I'm a liberal and I DON'T WANT HIM TO QUIT! I want to run his ass out of office by voting for Biden. I want him to be humiliated beyond humiliation. I want him to lick his wounds from defeat until he has ulcers on his lying tongue!
Lol. Thank you for the compliment. For the record, I am fairly non-partisan. I loathe Biden too.
Deleted Biden video sets off a crisis at Voice of America  via
Well, Donald J Trump did get impeached because he was scared that Joe Biden would win the Presidency in 2020.🤣
Damn. Never thought I’d hear this from Obama.  Though I guess Biden did hint at support for this just a few days ago.
Obama compares segregationist Jim Crow America to Trump's America – live
Does he mean by voting for Biden?
Yes Bernie Bro , but now Riden with Biden. So bite me!
Nancy has to go. She’s just a Senile as Biden.  OPEN THE POLLS!!  well good thing we don’t need to be in any state of emergency for a 99% survival rate!!
Biden’s open to ending the filibuster, and he’s proposed a LOT that I never thoguht he’d get on board with, so I do think Democrats are set up to do a lot legislatively.  But will we actually END the filibuster? Will we fix all of the institutional problems the GOP has exposed?
#WeWillVote I will wear a space suit if necessary. Biden 2020
#WeWillVote I would come in a full space suit if I have to. Biden 2020.
We are all human. I don't know what the answer is. But I definitely don't think Biden answer of a complete lockdown is the correct thing either.
I don't know your idea of a real leader. But I'll tell you one thing if Biden were president the whole country would be locked down. We would be living in a police state. Maybe that's your wet dream though LOL.
You think Biden has a huge following? How many people do you think trust the MSM at this point? You think those Bernie/Warren voters are lining up for Biden after the DNC's shady behavior behind closed doors? Democrat cities are in ruins now. The silent majority will prevail 👍🇺🇸
Where is Joe Biden's apology Henry Olsen?
You're not just voting for Biden, you're voting for a competent VP and cabinet.
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
I think Biden should be practical and choose a VP who can help deliver a battleground state. There's an old saying which kind of applies -- "If you want to finish first, you first have to finish."  Most important is that Biden win, and his VP choice should further that.
Biden actual was a friend to the KKK
Can't imagine how stupid Bernie must feel having lost to Biden
I LOVE WHEN THE EVIL DEMONS EAT EACH OTHER.   allies move to stop  Harris from becoming vice president
You mean the guy who’s the unnamed co defendant in Michael Cohen’ felony conviction or the guy who was found guilty of misusing funds from his charity and has been barred  from being on any charitable boards or the guy that held up aid to Ukraine for dirt on Biden/yea real lawful
Biden has no fracking clue
Wow, if Biden could pull that off (I mean by 2:30 tmr) that would be something ...... 😁
Biden represents exactly how we got here, and why people flung so far the the other side to put Trump in lol  Trump is a symptom and his failures&amp; successes just point out all the failings and lack of efficiency in the system we were trying to keep from crumbling/taking advantage
If Biden wins, DNC and corporate establishment Dems are even more validated, and use the administration to strengthen the ties that have on democratic/blue party. They are out in position to even further silence progressive voices and coalesce around moderate platforms.
And choosing Biden is snoozing lol or alarm continues to go off and we figure out a way to wake up. Or we could snooze, and wait for a louder and more abrasive alarm to come around
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He’s been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but “she might want to run for president” seriously isn’t one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he’s only a one-term president.
Definitely, and everybody in my house will vote for Joe Biden.
🤚 I am so ready for President Joe Biden
If Joe Biden wins Florida, then he's President. I believe he can win my home state.
Trump was the alarm.. Biden is the snooze.(someone else said that, I forget) Enjoy the rest of ur sleep, a louder alarm coming right around the corner. Or Biden gets in and everything swept behind the curtain again, then it's back to the yellow brick road for us. 🤓🤪

Need a Dumb and Dumber meme with Brain-Dead Biden and Brain-Dead Nadler.
I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all.  He will take some of Biden’s votes lol let him on the ballot 😂👍
I just want to know how and why Biden doesn’t have his running mate yet, and why haven’t any debates been scheduled? They(he) hiding something? Lol.
And we also heard ( from another journalist, real not fake) that his October Surprise, by a man named Durham, is going to be a doj indictment of President Obama and Vice President Biden (?)  What say your sources?
Because Biden is worse in all ways 40 plus years of nothing nafta crime bill
Biden isn't taking healthcare away a  Pandemic or abusing peaceful protestors. False equivalency doesn't wash with those who practice logic
At this point, we need to unite behind Biden.  I do not agree with all his policies but if I continue on your route.. Trump will win re-election.  Please rethink your position
Yep, exactly. Biden’s financial support only comes from the fact that he’s corrupt as hell.
He would never drop out of the race. It's not in his DNA. He would rather occupy the White House after the Biden inauguration, be dragged out kicking and screaming and cry about how poorly he was treated.
Maybe Biden should add Jayapal to the VP short list. 🤔
Just because Joe Biden is mentally unfit to hold office doesnt mean Trump isn’t as well. Can we have a 3rd option? Lol
Liars?  How funny are you..Biden is just that. Good luck.
Good strategy I don't think Trump can read  Kamala Harris topped Joe Biden's list of handwritten notes alongside talking points like 'do not hold grudges' and 'great help to campaign'
Maybe it's because I'm old. But Health care has really went to shit. Everything was covered and it was cheap. Now nothing  ‘This is health care moonshot time’: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left
They say past presidents are just puppets. Nothing new with Brain-Dead Biden. Back to normalcy and corruption. Speaking of which, your dad needs to move faster on censorship and the fake virus panic, including masks, and a full open up of the economy, Friggen NOW. No vaccines.
Clearly we know Biden chose kamala. He may as well just drop the ad.
Iran is really working hard for Joe Biden to become President.  They will go back to killing American military all around the world with JoeBiden help.
Like the ear buds biden wears so his handlers can tell him when to run when his 20 minutes of taking questions are up. Priceless...
Biden is picking for VP who is the best VP for
Trying to win what? Earn your vote? Why? Vote for whomever you want.   You have two choices - Trump or Biden or a passive vote for the winner. This election will have huge consequences for the future of the US, so throwing away one's vote in 2020 would be pretty irresponsible.
It’s like he’s preparing to hole up there and not accept Joe Biden’s win November 3rd or worse he’s preparing for marshal law.
It is alarming.  He’s preparing to not recognize Joe Biden. As the winner November 3rd or worse he’s preparing to declare marshal law.
Does the model bake in regression or diminishing returns when a candidate is quite far ahead? Would it have Biden by 10.2 on Election Day as likely as Biden by 6.2?
How can dems say they can fix things when: A:  They're the ones breaking them  B:  Biden is the best they can do for a presidential candidate

I am praying that he does not pick Susan Rice. She is simply very unpopular with a lot of Dems. It would be a huge mistake. I know Obama and Holder like her, but it would hurt Biden's chances.

Leave the decorating to Dr. Biden, the First Lady come January.
The only direction Biden will bring is politeness but I can here him now the economy is fragil to reverse trump tax cuts let alone bush’s tax cuts and of course your public option will be just as crappy as private Ins so it doesn’t hurt them
I would like to see him somewhere and Biden's cabinet. I think he has a lot to offer and he would be able to hone his craft, in the political Arena at the same time.
suggests banning masks with political messages on it. So maybe Trump &amp; Biden masks will be banned after all.
Me either. I don't want people thinking Biden has it in the bag. I have no doubt that we will have record turnout. I have no doubt that the orange Menace will contested election. And I have no doubt whatsoever, that Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, will steal the election for him.
The prevailing opinion is that DJT pushed West to declare on the theory that younger voters and people of color would desert Joe Biden for Kanye West?  Are we all really that stupid?
. students who attend campuses will be required to wear face coverings, but don't try to bring a Trump or Biden mask. Or even a Gators or Seminoles mask.  General Counsel Barbara Myrick said no markings will be allowed on the masks.

Swing Voters In Michigan Focus Group Say They Are Voting For Trump, Call Biden A ‘Puppet’: Axios Report  via
Love how  can step up to a microphone and speak extemporaneously for an hour on a variety of topics while being clear and concise.  Biden on the other hand relies on a team of operatives to prepare him for a 30 second sound bite.
So can we do one real women vote for Biden? I’m nauseous after watching 2 seconds of that!
I’m just waiting for liberals to grow a backbone and stand up to the leftists that are abusing them. But, I won’t hold my breath. Doesn’t look like it’s going to happen at this point. And that’s why Biden is so damn dangerous.
You know someone is not playing with a full deck when they endorse Biden for President
If you would actually educate yourself on the matter you would know that Biden actually wants to give 300 mill more to the police... so yeah I don’t think that means defunding. It’s all on his website
This is happening under YOUR watch. When Joe Biden Is president we will have PEACE
Agree, I'm not voting for Biden, but I am voting against the sick fascist currently in office.
Sounds like 2 people are voting Biden. Anybody else? We need about 33M people. Mary Trump, niece of the president, says she’ll do ‘everything in my power’ to elect Joe Biden
DUH how long should the shortlist be? Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
Well, in the 90s, Dems veered to the right in the aftermath of the Clinton era, so that was certainly true for a time. But these days I’d say that isn’t really accurate anymore. The party has been drifting leftward for years now, and that’s evident in recent Biden policies.
On Election Night 2016  couldn't even come out  and accept the results of the election.   What will Biden do?
It’s a weird answer, but she’s not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so “I just want to get rid of Trump” is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I’d be surprised if she loses.
99 days??? That's too long to wait for Biden, but I will!!!
Biden-Elizabeth Warren is my dream ticket but I think a woman of color is the odds-on favorite by a country mile, and I’m here for either.
VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN
Not voting for Biden.  I had a little hope that they could address a critical issue for America going forward.
President Biden and First lady Jill BIDEN will do the right thing
Your right. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  WILL BUILD IT BACK BETTER
I wonder how trump and his minions would feel if Biden played dirty and backed a commercial showing people dying on ventilators and said if you don't vote for me you will all die. #ResignNowTrump. Donnie should stop backing slimy, untruthful commercials.
We will on a November 3rd when we elect Joe Biden in a landslide! Resign now and save yourself public humiliation .
Think we all need Biden's nonsensical blurbs translated on a reg basis🤡
This is probably the easiest debate for Biden to win in his career and the way Trump has attacked Joe’s cognitive ability, he’ll have the luxury of low expectations. Turning it down is turning down the opportunity for checkmate
VOTE JOE BIDEN!
THANK YOU DR. JILL BIDEN...OUR NEXT 1ST LADY!!!
I don't envy, V.P. Biden.Dictator Trump,will leave him. A bankrupted county,like all his businesses.He always ran into the ground. We don't know, if their will be a revolution by then. How many more thousands, dead from COVID. Crime,&amp; homelessness quadrupled. Marshall law imposed
Don't forget,  Biden's covid plan includes EVERYTHING Pres Trump has already done..👍👏👏👏🇺🇸

You see why you can't trust Joe Biden and the rest of the Democraps
I recently saw where journalists said he had info on the infamous October surprise. He said look at someone name Dunbar. He apparently has a report of laws that Obama and Biden, have presumably broken. McConnell is delaying the release of it, so this journalist said.
Kerry was a very weak candidate. And we're talking about VP here. Kerry would not have won, swift boat or no Swift boat  The GOP is already planning on the garbage they're going to spew against Harris if she's chosen. And Biden needs a strong Midwest candidate.
I have been a Biden Harris girl since before either of them got in the race. That said, I think the only candidate with an unimpeachable character, is Tammy Duckworth. The GOP will eviscerate Harris. If they tried that with Senator Duckworth, they would be burned alive
Brain-dead Biden will ensure the shooting war portion of the next civil war begins.
And you wonder why Biden won't debate him?
Her son knows that she’s completely full of shit. That’s probably the only obstacle that may block her from being Biden’s running mate.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.
Maybe the democratic party should start acting like the democratic party and not a center-right party?  Why does Joe Biden object to:  Banning fracking? Student debt forgiveness? Medicare for all? Universal Basic Income? Defunding police (he wants to increase funding)?
Can’t wait for Biden to tear down that wall!
Sadly you are right on the money...but if Biden wins the anarchy continues but it will be democrats fighting back the extreme left, BLM and ANTIFA to protect THEIR communist states...
And again you keep lying... Biden wants to fund the police more than you do.
How many Americans are tired of the fake news telling our  Joe Biden is winning in the polls from his basement. He refuses  to take interviews. All he does is make a video and tell lies.
I thought my friends in Ohio loved me? Biden leads in Michigan and Trump has one-point edge in Ohio
And when do they turn into actual, deadly explosives?  People have already been arrested with pipe bombs on them.  Civil war IS upon us. Only one man can stop this.  It's  Biden is not the answer.
REALLY hard voting for BIDEN when you haven't heard much from him. I don't agree w all things Trump but I love how he's putting pedofiles away like a fat kid eats cake!
PROBLEM OR OVERDOSING ITS FENTANYL &amp; CARTELS! TRUMP OR BIDEN, WALL OR NO WALL! IF PEOPLE CREATE A DEMAND FOR IT ITS GONNA GET HERE SOMEWAY SOMEHOW! WE NEED TO OFFER PLACES YOU CAN THINK OF GETTING HELP &amp; GET IT IN LESS THAN A HOUR, IN DAYS PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MIND OR OD! THIS
F*UCK Fox News! Good for Biden! They will just make him look bad. They are State Run Propaganda. They will be liable soon, for accomplice. To brainwashing millions. To think the pandemic, was a hoax!
Hey David is it true what they're saying that Biden is suppressing the Hispanic votes here in Florida because me and my family are voting for him and we're Hispanic
Have you actually been in a hurricane during the day?
Tammy Duckworth is not a white woman. All Biden did was indicate that it would be, a woman. I would love to see Harris in that position, but they will make chopped liver out of her time as an AG. What are they going to say about Duckworth?
Biden should sprint to Fox for interview with Chris
Warren is Biden's worst choice, she is a back stabbing hypocrite,
That’s because Biden is pathetic
Biden I want to know if it's true that you're trying to suppress the Hispanic vote here in Florida because me and my family are voting for you and we're Hispanics
If Biden debates it will be better than a broadway show
Another thing for Biden to reverse
Maybe you should have thought about that but don’t worry if Bernie was running against trump Pelosi Biden and Schumer would vote for trump
Not one Biden flag on the inter-coastal  from Jupiter to Ft Lauderdale, thousands of trump flags.
I'm more interested in finding out WHY anyone would vote for Biden?
All the things that #Trump accomplished for almost 4 years and needless to say while he was attacked by the media for the last four years nobody especially #Biden would be able to do what he’s done.  #Trump2020 #Republican  (keep #America great)
Besides all the things that Trump accomplished for almost 4 years and needless to say while he was attacked by the media for the last four years nobody especially Biden would be able to do what he’s done.
They will be happy to provide you with a tape of a well prepared, well rehearsed speech, read word for word from the top Democrat writers.  If you expect Joe Biden to go on TV extemporaneously, regardless of the network..... forget it.
What does someone state have anything to do with views. Wow.. your the real liberal one here.  Do you and Biden suffer from the same issues ?
Wait till Biden has to debate with Trump.  He’s going to be soooo lost!! Sadly.. Biden can’t even form a proper sentence at his age.
Ridin with Biden...
Let Biden start talking.  Lots of his fans will go RED real fast!!
I have an idea. Biden only has 7.2 million followers. What if everyone told all their followers to follow  right now? And shared everything on his feed. I bet we can make him louder than Donald on Twitter. You in? #ResistanceTaskForce
No it's not about ego like it is with the big orange idiot. I like Biden and will vote for him. But I don't need to follow him to keep up to date. I check his page often. I never check Trump page.
No just like most politicians. If they don't follow back do they really care. I have had a few follow me. But you don't have to follow Biden to see his tweets.
Trump runs anti Biden ad saying how it will look in Biden’s America. Doesn’t he realize this is trumps America?? Trump=shmuck!!
I know more people who are voting for Biden than Trump. Actually I only know 1 person who would vote for Trump.

What about trump? Or did you just admit you're running to beat Biden for the very low polling trump?

Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's

May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.

"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.”
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....

It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it’s insanity... and you’ve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden 🤪🤪
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy’s portrait in? I’m suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.
#SpecialReport Clinton is younger than Biden; who would want Clinton to be POTUS at this age. Nobody.
There IS a god.  #Biden for Florida and for the win!!
I do too.  I am NOT #DyingForTrump   I’m voting for #Biden
Please Lincoln project, can you come up with a better slogan for the Biden campaign? “Build back better” is kinda weak. You guys are smart. You can come up with something better?
Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don’t do anything without talking to each other.
Will your president ever condemn Biden for his racist comments ?
Progressive Coalition Urges Biden to Curb 'Excesses of Corporate Power' by Ending White House Revolving Door -  via
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
A lot of NIMBY’s are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY’s, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.
You are definitely voting for Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂
95 percent of liberals said they plan to vote for Biden and 86 percent of conservatives said they plan to vote for Trump. Among moderates, Biden leads Trump 63 to 22 percent.
Twitter account: “Oh yea! What’s Biden’s plan on Coronavirus, All he does is hide!” Me: *Posts Coronavirus Plan from Joe’s website* Twitter account: “Well there is a single thing I disagree with in there, so I’m not voting for him!” Me: 🤦‍♂️
This is what the Democrats- Pelosi and Biden and Nadler call a myth 😂😂😂
Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Clinton Sistah Souljah: “I‘m a Clinton Democrat!” Biden fundraiser comments: “Fuck Joe Biden” Lmao Absolute 🤡
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
I don’t think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there’s a “red wave” in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden’s choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
No one’s voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, “Stupid” too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.
i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna 🇺🇲 🏛 🇺🇲
Biden has the same chances of winning as the Patriots of winning next Superbowl!
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
I’m a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She’s senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Where are all their masks.??
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn’t want him as vp
Someone’s having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States 😂
I thought It was rice, but now I think it’s Harris. U don’t leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
Dude, I think she’s the pick. Why would they leak if she’s not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden “smells” children? C’mon... look at our country today!! We couldn’t take much more of all this winning!
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....
As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you’ve just been well behaved for Bernie’s sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch
is sick mentally and thinks he can beat  .  Mr Trump has done more for Americans in 3 years than Biden has in 40 or more.   Biden has no clue on how to deal with COVID 19 or 9 as he calls it.  #FourMoreYears
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Worst possible scenario for this great country. Heard about Venezuela lately?
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Dude really, “Biden has outspent trump since July 7th”.

Smh at this rate Biden gets to 65% with college educated whites.
Biden seems like the only person to get close. Anyways focus on FL and NC in my opinion.
Pretty interesting that Covid-Don names a bunch of states he obviously thinks he is losing to Biden: NV, OH, PA, FL, AR.  Looking forward to the grants to TX, GA, KY and SC.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
Georgia Tossup 🤔. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.
Thoughts on Biden number?
I don’t understand. It seems like u want Biden to be president so he can do stuff. He’s running for President and doesn’t hold any office, he doesn’t have any power.
To my friends who follow politics, did you watch the Joe Biden press conference yesterday? Did you listen to the questions by the #MSM (or whoever these people were)?  Were the questions tough?  This was journalistic malpractice and if you don’t agree with, #ReclaimingMyTime
Joe Biden would’ve had a heart attack yesterday in AG bar’s seat
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Many dumbocruts are silently worried about Biden’s mental health.  He cannot form a sentence any longer.  Why has his constant cognitive test results not issued?  Any presidential candidate had to release their health records from Walter reed hospital.  Where is it?????
Joe Biden's Notes Suggest Kamala Harris May Be His VP PickThere is no other answer this election.  You either support Biden or Trump, reality is a bitch.
Bro, you spread an unvetted accusation about Joe Biden. How does any of this surprise you?
It would be easy to over throw Biden and friends. They would run faster than little girls and cry.
Yeah, because Trump is free from nepotism. All Biden has to do at a debate is say he is reasonable on guns and abortion and the evangelical crowd will abandon Trump in droves. Neither of these geriatric fools wants an actual debate.
Biden and Trump are basically the same. Only difference is that Biden won’t embarrass himself at cocktail parties.
Biden has California, Bass loses Florida. 50 state strategy. You guys have all the political instincts of this guy. Life long Dem, Cuban life long Floridian. I can see the ads now.
“easily debunked”  Her. Own. Words.   She’s a dumpster fire.   If Biden is determined to make his choice based upon race/sex, there are better candidates than this buffoon.

Yes I lived in Europe. You haven't.  Also, no one cares about what Europe thinks. They want Free everything too. Just like you. Make sure you tell everyone how much you like the Riots, Biden, Partial Birth abortions, and illegals.
Biden is killing America as we know her just so he can cash in on the job he always wanted(&amp; was promised) so Biden will sell us out &amp; is also very easily controlled to do as he’s told-not realizing he’d be the scapegoat in the end.. Ruining America at all costs!😱
Never said that. Looking at your retweets you stand for nothing.  Biden is your guy. No values, and Partial Birth Abortions. Good luck, but Don't tell your kids or grandkids you have morals. Sure no one is perfect, but Biden LMAO. Might as well vote AOC.
😂😂 are you wondering (as I am) who exactly thinks these things up against our President? I first thought it was AOC but now am thinking it must be Biden... who else is dumb enough to get people to believe?... of course there are some dumb bunnies out there..🤭
I believe Katie Johnson
Biden is such a jerk.
You want your facts are they are all written out for you Trump supporters come to our side do not be Fooled Again he's killing you one by one vote Biden🌊🌊🌊🇺🇸

It's not 60% deaths are Dem states, **it's the top 10 states (Dem) carry over 60% of USA's deaths and they are Dem**, that's not including the rest. To say other countries won't come here, assumes poor leadership. Biden and the Dems would do better?
And Biden would have done better? We won't know how Dems would have handled it. Hillary lost..
The Future of American Liberalism
Oh and since biden is such an amazing man . Why didn't he offer up to help . 🤷‍♂️
Your not black if you don't vote Democrat . Sleepy joes words not mine 😂 and biden has a picture of him holding Sen. Robert Byrd hand . You realize he lead a chapter of kkk in the 1940s . You need a history lesson. .TRUMP BY A LANDSLIDE ONCE AGAIN
So since Biden will be able to glorify the united States and fix racism and all that bullshit that comes out his mouth . Why didn't he pass this knowledge down to Obama 🤷‍♂️ . Democrats are clowns . Remember your not black if you don't vote Democrat . "Sleepy joe"
Biden being a bad candidate does not absolve Trump of his buffoonery.
Come on now guys! We all know Biden would have done so much 'better' with the "amount of CV9 body bags"... 🤔 👇😂 Fact!
You act like I just fell off of the turnip truck. What used to be our Democratic Party no longer exists, it’s been high jacked by AOC, and her ilk, Pelosi, Schumer, and Schiff. Your party hates everything our country stands for and for some weird reason people are voting 4 Biden
I listen to  while driving and find it funny that they almost never air Biden talking...
All races have the opportunity to vote. All races shop at Home Depot, Lowes, grocery stores , go to Doctors and more taking safety issues so they can go vote. It is about ALL races Mr. Obama. Your VP, Biden led charge keeping black students from White. !!!!!
What we need to watch for is tRump stuffing the ballots with "random" bogus ballots...fake ballots for tRump and Biden....enough that the election can be declared invalid for both parties. tRump wants chaos, he declares martial law to "make sure the next election is fair + just"
Are we supposed to believe this is actually Joe Biden tweeting this? It's a confirmed account, just like our current POTUS! Anyone else conflicted by all this?
Why aren’t Americans focusing on this aspect of Biden? The man is sick.
Doesn’t matter, Trump and Biden are basically the same person. Would be nice not to have to hear about Trump’s tweets all the time.
Does anyone remember the  article condemning Democrat politicians wanting to eliminate the Electoral college, including Hillary and Biden?
There's no evidence of that. Biden doesn't carry the baggage of Clinton. There's no evidence Trump has expanded his base at all. The polls in the states Trump won by ~ 1% or less, which is why he won, are polling much stronger for Biden than they were in 2016 for Clinton.
...  you mean the crimes orchestrated by Obama, Comey, and Biden in the Oval office?  You know...  Where even AFTER the FBI spent 5 months investigating Flynn and found NOTHING, yet Obama directed Comey to get the "right" people on the job of "finding" a crime?
If we bothered to investigate most of congress and their staffs..I bet most of them have some hinky kind of issues in their personal business and taxes.  Lets talk about Hunter Biden.  That not a bit hinky?  Point is...Trump no worse than a lot of them.
Biden Releases His Proposal to Advance Racial Equity in the U.S.

Dear Texas:  Take the blue pill.   #Trump #Biden #Democrats
Opinion | If Biden wants to double down on a ‘third Obama term,’ he should pick Susan Rice  Why would anyone want to be a "third Obama term." Obama simply was not that great.
You sound stressed, you’re terrified Biden is going to lose aren’t you?
😂😂😂 but Biden isn't
Ok come on, you don't seriously think Biden has the mental capability to run this country do you? Aren't you a bit concerned who they really have planned to run it? What if its a horrible person. You don't really know who you are voting for. Trump is 4 yrs Communism is forever.
I mean from this exchange, Biden's always had questions on Barr's view of executive power.
Biden, Crooked Hillary
Yes...Biden and Killary!
I’ve thought this from the beginning regarding Biden: he’s their throwaway. Now, I believe the purpose of the extreme radical swing is to desensitize and normalize it for 4 years to prep the country for 2024.
Biden would say “ That’s nice”.
Biden is getting ready to take a big fall.
Let's see, Kamala got into politics on her knees, has a horrific record as CA AG, and called Biden a Racist. Rice is complicant in lying about Bengahzi, unmasking Gen Flynn &amp; complicant in an attempt to rig an election and overthrow an elected President. Hmmmm choices choices...
Yea, Biden being escorted out of a convince store kills his presidency for me.
It is simply beyond comprehension how anyone could pull the lever for 'Plugs' Biden. His elevator no longer makes it to the top floor.
Is LeBron James buying votes for Joe Biden????
Biden has been in politics for 50 years and has ZILCH to show for it and blames the world’s problems on Trump. That’s pathetic.
Just wait until after Nov 3,  There will be no more covid, nor testing positive.  We will have miracles of trillions of negatives and Biden will go into a rest home along with Hillary.
50 years in politics and Biden has ZERO to show for it.  Bu bu but 🗣TRUMP🥴

Opinion | Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0
Ah yes when you can't debate, because Google won't tell you what to say, then call someone stupid. You clearly have no idea what you're saying, or Why. Just like Biden. Please vote for Him.
How is the President Responsible for the dead? Is Obama Biden Responsible for H1 N1? Even with a vaccine 1000's die. Maybe we should Still hold them accountable? President Trump closed flights to China in Jan. Dems were briefed before that. Who, China, Fauchi said No worries.
This is Another example of UV light. I know what My President was talking about. He did too. Especially since he just got briefed by that Physician. You clearly are a Biden supporter.  Your dumb points don't fly with Medical people.
Biden's Releases "Agenda for Women" Unveiling his Plan to Make Sure All Women Get Equal Participation in the Economy and Country
Analysis | Trump’s sweeping claim that Biden wants to ‘abolish all charter schools’  I doubt that. But good riddance. They are not worth the taxpayer funds.
Opinion | Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0  Not really. The GOP has to be burned down to the waterline. The authoritarian, racist, anti-system party needs to be destroyed.
Biden said yesterday he’s never been tested.
Hopefully, he'll be in it when he does. Biden will rebuild!
When does 'Plugs' Biden announce Kamala Harris is his VP selection?
Harris displayed her lack of character during the Kavanaugh hearings. No surprise, Biden’s potential pick is an insufferable, sewer, pond scum sycophant.
Ha ha ha ha   And Biden is ahead according to polls. He sounds like a car that  won’t start, he turns over but just doesn’t catch. I guess that he is flooded.
Sure he does. With that rationale Biden and Obama still own the Cases and Deaths of H1 N1. Tick tok Obama and Biden on the Clock even with a vaccine. TDS at its finest.
Please do. Biden is going to be an abysmal failure
Biden’s “public option” means government subsidy for the insurance industry. Also, I guess you never heard of FDR...
Oh yeah, Biden is gonna save us for sure
The man has dementia/Alzheimer’s! Shameful the way he is very being used! Mrs. Biden, why????
That’s why they want electronic currency, “that shit gets heavy” Biden gets exhausted changing his manpon!
This past week has haunted me because I’ve seen so. fucking. many. of them.   I see more and more every day.   I haven’t seen a single one with Biden’s name on it.   If you truly want this monster out of office, please, go out and fucking vote this year.
I don’t see the president at that protest I see a bunch of people taking advantage of a situation being paid by the Democratic Party to make the president look bad if Biden wins it’s gonna be worse then what happened when Obama won
Please watch every single word you say every single thing you do the idiots are watching if Biden wins I’m gonna blame you and only you we must win 2020 Please don’t let us down please don’t let that loser win please American need you
Why do you think neoliberals like Biden, Obama, Clinton, Schumer, Durbin, and Pelosi favor government supported insurance companies vs a federally funded system? Don’t forget, they may say they want to raise corporate taxes, but decades of power say otherwise. #lipservice
Awwwwww. Give Biden a chance. Lol
He will you estimating Biden's inaugural crowd? *hic* AIR HIGH FIVE BRUH!
Biden thinks he's going to have a compliant Republican Congress if by chance he's elected. 😂
She could be in Trump’s administration given her history of law and order as CA AG. Locking up POC for smoking weed while you admit to the same yourself is pure hypocrisy. However, you’re right that she would be a perfect fit for Biden’s puppet presidency.
That’s not going to happen, the reason Biden was picked to run was his ability to deliver on the status quo continuance of the healthcare insurance industry. In fact, he will likely attempt to increase insurance revenues with tax dollars under the guise of “enhancing” the ACA.
Pretty bad when Biden is the sensible choice. At least the military industry and insurance lobby will happy over this geriatric, neoliberal, coronation.
Because. handlers hand pick the reporters he is allowed to answer, and they have the questions ahead of time. Biden confirmed that one of the past times when he actually said he was only calling on certain reporters from a list. Lol
Don't count on it with Biden. He wants to make friends not do the right thing. Still better than Trump.  *hic*  AIR HIGH FIVE BRUH!
Being police chief powered Val Demings’s political rise but could complicate her hopes of becoming Biden’s running mate  I suspect for the overwhelming percentage of Black women, Val Demming's being a police chief ain't gonna be a complicating factor.

Opinion | Why Biden may follow through on a bolder agenda  We will have to keep up the pressure.
Do you think that Biden knows that he is being used?
Jimmy Kimmel,Jimmy  Fallon is no Johnny Carson! Big difference in yesteryears’ talk shows than today! If today’s shows talked negatively towards Biden today, it would end there career!
What's your solution? Biden steps down and Bernie takes over?  If your support of Bernie is blinding you to the person Reade is you're a cultist and don't really care about victims, you care about an agenda.
Former National Security Advisor Susan Rice is absolutely qualified to be the next VP. Her strengths are in Foreign Affairs, while Joe Biden can take on the tasks of repairing things domestically. Excellent choice!
Biden isn't in yet? He has told some beauties though.  Would you like a list, or can you find them yourself?
Love it! We should all wear Biden hats to vote.
They just reported on this.
You just reported on this.
Biden has a plan to decriminalize.
Biden lies.
I don’t think so. As bad as it seems, I think we need to prepare for President Biden I.e Sanders/Cortez.
Good luck with that! I didn't think the Dems could possibly produce a worse candidate than Hillary, but y'all never cease to amaze me. I mean Joe Biden?? lmao.
I can see why you may help Biden with speeches. He does not know where he is half the time and you and others choose to ignore it.
who are you to make these remarks about Trump and the covid epidemic? Your Biden can't even come out of the basement . He said he is going to take care of this epidemic and the 6 things mentioned have been done by Trump already.
Before I take a break I want to express my apprehension over something that is incomprehensible. How could anyone who had the ability to reason pull the lever for the demented, dotard, 'Plugs' Biden this November?
The last thing the corrupt, criminal DNC wants is Biden out on the stump bloviating his stupid nonsense. They want him to stay in his basement with his mouth taped over with duct tape. They believe he can do very little and their defamation of Trump will get 'Plugs' elected.
Ditto. Biden is pandering, as usual. Without gender or race cards, Dems have nothing.
Oh good grief. Is Biden really considering Susan Rice? Finally got ppl to STFU about Benghazi &amp; he’s gonna bring it all back? Arrrrgggghhh. Yes, I know it’s BS &amp; isn’t fair, but come the fuck on. There are _lots_ of other good picks who’re also women of color.
Trump has more female senior advisors than the Obama/Biden regime did in 8 years
Maybe Biden is rethinking . Does he really want to be President
I mean, "That's a clean African American" didn't stop Joe Biden from getting picked.
The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He’s a Man
Women don’t need Joe Biden to succeed. We are not pawns.
lol, Biden aint black
The same people still think Trump colluded with Russia and Biden doesn’t have dementia
Bc they’re drinking the kool-aid &amp; want to go back the way it was... being under the thumbs of an old white man who was in the kkk(Biden) all the $ goes to elect the party that kept them in chains-must like it ..right?
😂😂😂😂to bad the rioters weren’t in Biden’s neighborhood.....😁
If all he watches is CNN then he probably believes Trump colluded with Russia, Biden doesn’t have dementia, and it was Trump not Clinton who rode on Epstein’s plane 27 times on his way to Pedo island too
Picked up my Biden sign to go next to my Dosev sign. Might rig up a streaming camera next to them so I can see the cognitive dissonance explode my neighbors’ heads in real time.
Biden still refuses to emerge from his bunker and answer policy  questions. His supporters aren’t voting FOR Dementia Joe they’re voting against Trump.
The people burning, looting and resorting to violence are really trying to destroy American democracy. They surely don’t help Biden. They give Hitler, sorry I mean Trump, an excuse to bring in his storm troopers.
Biden needs a strong running mate and color has nothing to do with it. The man doesn’t know what day it is or the difference between a city and a state. He is not fit to serve.
Same for me. I voted Trump hoping he would become presidential and govern wisely and fairly. What a mistake! In November I plan to correct that mistake by voting for Biden. I believe there are many others in the same boat.
If we play stupid games we get stupid prizes. Why is nobody continuing this narrative?
Everyone needs to pay attention to this.  They are coming for the suburbs if Biden gets elected.  I recommend you watch the full episode of Life Liberty and Levin aired 07/26/20.
There it is. No one is pro Biden. Ricky has been lying to you sir.
I was thinking Biden and his son?    You throughing poop on the wall with that one.
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
He’s the poster child for the typical Biden supporter
What would you do to a Creepy Joe Biden, if he ever put his hands on you?
He stopped flights from China a WHOLE MONTH before Nancy said “Come to China Town (San Francisco)” and Biden was still calling Trump’s response xenophobic.  Please look this up to see this truth.
I wouldn’t let my daughters in the same state that Biden was in. I call him Chester the Molester.
🤣 Trump has 84 million followers to Biden's 7 million . Tell me who's going to win again . Silent majority will rise once again
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown | Fox News  what are you hiding from ⁦
Since the Left, The radical Left, many Independents, and many Republicans will also be voting for Biden, Biden has plenty of enthusiasm.
I'm not Republican, and I see democrats destroying cities, blm and Antifa killing people, Dems locking us down (employment stats), and Biden who can't even say simple CV19.If he was president the whole country would be open for CV19&amp;illegals. SleepWell
There has been no arrests, or mention of children being rescued. Feeling like a game being ran... I'm voting for potus' 4 more years, but I'm not buying the narrative any more. Too many holes, and resurrected Celebrities speaking gibberish. Q may help Biden win!
Pics lie, videos don't , you can see clearly she doesn't want the wood from Biden?! She is sooo scared.. Meisje:  "Ik heb hulp nodig!!!"
I don't see any pictures of Biden or Nancy P among those protesters. So don't say we r with u.
Biden is Really Vile.
Unless God has dirt on Joe Biden or insight on how to get Obama arrested before he gets arrested, Trump has no use for him. God is the author of peace not confusion. Trump thrives on confusion and division. He CHOSE to fight protesters rather than listen. WAKE TF UP. Biden 2020
Biden v Trump chatter...but who's your local and state officials?
Listen to what Biden has to say!
I agree, Basement Biden needs to tell his supporters to quit burning and looting our cities
#ResistanceTaskForce  Biden2020 all the way!!  Hopefully when Biden wins he'll push for stricter protocols by which one can run for president. With Trump's background he couldn't get a job as a high school principal! He should never have been allowed to run for office.
A sequence of words remembered in the proper order some time after first seeing them. I would love to see 'Plugs' Biden take that test. Well, he might get his name right if it was on the teleprompter.
Just keep bloviating your nonsense right up until the time Trump stomps "Plugs" Biden into a nursing home where the dotard belongs. BTW, when will he entertain more than 'fluff ball' questions from the media? Or will you continue to hide him in his home basement?
I have to wonder if it's the Demtards plan to hide 'Plugs' Biden until they take him to the precinct where he votes on November 3rd. Have his staff explained that he isn't running against himself as he so adroitly said a couple of weeks ago? What a demented, old dotard.
This is how Joe Biden’s supporters behave so this is what a Joe Biden America would look like
No no sweetie fact check your facts I'm not upset about you Republican you're the biggest roasts of them all but we get it😉 you keep believing and you have the right to Biden going to win hands down no argument God Bless America and freedom of speech

"Attempted to chastise"? I'd argue he went way, way past attempted. Basically called Biden traitorous in his opinion piece. After today's article, I'd say he needs to write a retraction and apology to Biden for at least that part of that op piece.
This is what will cause us to lose in November: Biden didn’t offer enough...etc  You don’t realize: do ANYTHING necessary to beat Trump! Including the retweet - which costs you nothing. Except your purity.
Mail in voting is more hazardous than doing a high wire act over the Grand Canyon. Joe Biden has been proven to be a Communist/Fascist tool of the Progressive Left, a drug kingpin and a child molester. Does that about cover it for you?

Find out who's padding Biden's wife and sons wallets! She should be utterly disgraced making her husband keep campaigning in his condition. It only has to do with 'money' and 'position' would a wife do such a thing. Remember she's a school teacher. Money money money!

Joe Biden doesn't want my vote but also thinks I should be in jail for protesting the cops, if you were wondering why I refuse to vote for or defend that dude
I don't mean to be rude here but Why?  Biden promoted and helped seat Scalia AND Thomas. Why would he pick any sort of progressive "Justice" when RBG dies.   Even she is often problematic, and always seems to side with Corporate interests.
That would probably be a best case scenario with Biden.  Honestly I expect, as he has said, "Nothing will fundamentally change." and that includes continuing Trumps legacy of authoritarianism.
Obama is still corrupt and if you can’t see it then you are as senile as Joe Biden
If Biden comes in, any progress made anywhere goes right out the window.

I have a very easy question for you. Why hasn't your boy Biden acknowledged all of the rioting, murders, burning of the the Democratic states? Anxiously awaiting for a non bullshit comment from you.
Donald Trump's odds of winning in November are trending in the wrong the direction.  Joe Biden -177 (implied probability 63.9%) Donald Trump +160 (implied probability 38.5%)  👉
Biden's speaking style is verbal stenography, why pronounce every syllable to convey the message? "Black kids are as talon as White kids."
It will need to be thoroughly fumigated and swept for electronic devices before Biden moves in

Yes, from behind the Resolute Desk with his desk chair chained to the back bumper of the Presidential limo. Wouldn’t it be great if Biden was driving?
Stop saying defund &amp; start with reform. If you haven’t noticed trump is using this phrase to run bs ads &amp; instill fear into his base who may vote blue but are undecided. Biden already said he would NOT defund police. If trump gets re-elected because of this we’re ALL SCREWED!!
I hope joe Biden hires all of you
Trump used protest footage in Ukraine of assault on police officer in latest campaign ad to portray it as US. Biden already said he would NOT defund police but they keep pushing bs in ads A Harvard psych. who studies crime patterns said a small spike in crime, but 2006 was worse
I've been seeing the results of this blitz - AND these ads!  I live in 55+ community in FL &amp; WOW, are people's minds changing - fast!  I see more &amp; more Biden signs going up &amp; more &amp; more Trump flags come OFF of people's golf carts!  That's a serious signal - flags on golf carts!

knows he doesn't have what it takes to be President.
Indeed, I know many that will not vote for Biden if she’s VP. Atleast choose someone that’s a smidge likeable.
Biden fails to determine the difference between text &amp; test
Enough said.
No one... Here me again, No one is going to defund your/our police. Especially Biden.  Reorganization where they have less of a load, having specialized people for domestic cases and paying police a better wage.
Could Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter?,” Wallace said. “We asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available.” He added, “We’ll keep asking every week.”  Fox News expects Biden is able to work 1 day a week

Barack Obama and Joe Biden: A Socially Distanced Conversation  via
I'm happy voting for Biden whether Senator Harris is the VP pick or any of the highly competent women being considered but I'd honestly rather she be the AG after the absolute sh*t-show Barr &amp; Trump have been serving up -
Who is smearing a good man cause I'm not. Biden is playing part of a caring man to get votes since the current Pres is the opposite and a clown. Look at his political record show me how good of a man he is. Just bc represents your party does not make him automatically a good man
No he didn’t. You can repeat the lie as much as you want but it won’t make it true. Trump inherited a strong economy from Obama/Biden, rode it up for awhile, gave billionaires a massive tax cut, increased our deficit &amp; then crashed our economy by his failure on the Coronavirus
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You think signs indicate who will win? My #Biden sign lasted one week in my yard in Florida. Seems that’s part of the Trump campaign strategy...steal and cheat
The train is going to run over you Steve.   Drove for 4 hours today in Florida.  Trump signs and flags EVERYWHERE.   Did not see a single sign, billboard, flag or any mention of Biden anywhere
Lol... ur a poor Biden girl! Poor thing.. do u want to blow up his nostrils or rub his hairy legs?? 😂😂😂
Biden will not win Florida
Commander in Cheese General Bonespurs is having a #trumpmeltdown  because he has finally been told by someone he is losing big in every way. Biden is not only way up in the polls he is likable. #BidenForPresident2020
This is just anecdotal, but the vibe here in Tampa Bay is that these riots are all Democrat operations, people are sick of it, and enthusiasm for Trump is rising quickly.   Still no Biden yard signs.
Any investment prospectus will include caveats, and there are a couple to consider when handicapping political stocks and horses.
Biden is obviously cognitively impaired, he’s morphed into a Bernie Sanders lefty and he’s been making wrong decisions about race and foreign policy for half a century in Washington.
Trump is showing his desperation. #TrumpMeltdown “If you don't believe the polls, just look at the body language. Trump's campaign has been asking for more debates than the already-allocated three with Biden, his campaign manager was demoted, and now there's this reboot effort.”
Just months ago Bernie Sanders was winning the Democrat primary. Then came S. Carolina and Biden cruised to victory. But Joe had to embrace the AOC green deal and the left agenda; so it turns out Bernie's platform has captured the Party.
He's onto his next misinformation project , Scaring old ladies in the suberbs , making them think mobs are going to break into their houses and Biden defunded the police , so no one will save her ...
I really hope Biden &amp; Kamala realize they're gonna have to clean house with all the federal agencies REALLY REALLY fast once they get elected.  Pretty sure they do realize this...but I'm a bit scared of what will happen until the new order filters down.
Corrupt Obama, Crooked Hillary, Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, and Loonie Bernie  Sanders... common thread? Democratic Party! #WalkAway
Yeah but Biden will!
Joe Biden is a racist!

Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House
Me too! Because I’m voting for Biden.
Biden supports murders, you support Biden so therefore you also support murders. Numbnuts.😈
That’s quite literally the nicest way to put such a horrific bill that Biden has yet to apologize for.  It threw Black men in prison for decades for ridiculously LOW drug offenses.
What? Did Joe Biden write this tweet?
Eric, I take it you are spending a lot of time with Biden??  How else would you know so much about him??  It's not from listening to him or reading his site, obviously.  Or are you a mind reader?
Exactly! Trump is in office bc of people like Biden, Clinton &amp; Obama. Biden literally wrote the 1994 Crime Bill and people are trying to say Trump is worse... 😭😭
President Joe Biden, can hardly wait!
The Trump ad falsely accusing Biden of defunding the police is super easy to fact check. Biden strongly stated he was opposed to “defunding” immediately after media tried to make this a thing.

I knew the answer already though; The riots are Biden's campaign. If the people of this country dare to re-elect Trump, these people will try to burn the nation down.  It is domestic terrorism.
My wife and I just had this same conversation today.  We never see Biden signs but Trump everywhere
like i get why y’all don’t like trump but you really think biden’s gonna do a good job??? he was part of the 8 YEAR obama admin which DOUBLED the national debt and performed a record number of deportations and presidential pardons
Absolutely. Was concerned for friends but our state in general. And, they’ll spin it, but it’s another setback for Trump. They just got the poll news 51% Biden, 38% Trump in FLORIDA!

Nothing makes sense anymore, and Biden is way up?
Obama endorsed Biden because you made another false claim...... REMEMBER? The doctor that gave you "THE TEST" should had used all your false statements to see how good your mind really is.
Biden doesn't agree with Bernie at all. He won't even legalize weed. No one believes Biden is far left.
Joe Biden, a racist, does not see himself as a racist, thereby informing his opinion that former presidents who share his ideas on race were not racists.
Biden is on wife 2 because his first wife died--not because he was trading his wife in for a younger model!!!
He is absorbing the life essence of these women. Biden is actually 262 years old.   Little known history fact.....he once sniffed Maimi Eisenhower's hair like this and got punched in the D by her husband, Dwight D......irony
Under Biden it will be allowed
Even though Biden was a used of sexual misconduct when the lady hired an attorney the attorney fired her for lying to them. On the other hand trumps accusers who have filed suits in court trump has paid them off so it doesn’t come out

I was recently able to obtain, up to date, portraits of DeBlazio, lightfoot, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Young and Wheeler.What if, hypothetically, we were to find out that Joe Biden had threatened to hold up $1 billion worth of funding to Ukraine, if the prosecutor going after his son wasn’t fired? If only we have some solid evidence of a real quid pro quo like that.
One of the reasons I'm still deeply unenthusiastic about Biden is all these Dinosaurs he has surrounding him. And yes, I'm still voting for him.
How many money did he get to take the fall? Come on friend, that guy has access to the DMs of all the people he posted at, you tellin me he didn't snoop in whatever Obama or Biden or Elon musk had there.  He is just a patsy that's gonna take the fall,
The Warren erasure continues. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.  Despite a myriad of positive polls, multiple appearances for &amp; with Biden &amp; Biden adopting Warren's policies &amp; tone, the media continues to pretend that Warren doesn't exist.
So Biden will tell the American people, most of whom have no idea who Bass is, that she's ready to be POTUS on day one? Because that's his own stated requirement.
I actually believe that he should go, to stop all of this bullshit, but do you actually think I want to vote for Biden or Hillary. You all have enabled him with these ridiculously corrupt people that are nominated.
It's up to all of us to put up the good fight! Vote and make it happen.....Biden for President!
Joe Biden.  I can’t even imagine the weight he is carrying on his shoulders knowing the future of our country’s Democracy, stopping Covid19 19, our economy, etc...etc...are depending on him...
Yes, the former POTUS is "America's future". Like he wasn't already in office for 8 years. What a moron. I would also be offended by this if I was running Biden's campaign.
she was such a precious looking young lady.  I'm so sorry for your loss and I have such respect for your persistence in keeping her memory and the cause to enact gun control alive and up front.    And yes, Biden is the obvious choice in this election.
Everybody's clammering for indictments. Biden is such a weak candidate, surely best tactics would be to wait until after elections. God forbid trump should lose, he can then use it as ammunition in favour of illegitimate biden presidency
A vote for Biden is a vote for China.
Yes ugh  Biden here  is your vote
When are you going to congratulate Joe Biden for his now brilliant prediction that Trump was going to try to postpone the election?
I’m voting for Joe Biden for President.
Teachers Unions were never about the students only politians like Biden who wants to partner with them to push their Liberal agenda.
Huh?? The fuck is “too ambitious”? Is politics not ambition? Oh wait it’s a black woman with power and influence who could very likely become the president considering Joe Biden is a walking corpse. Save us the trouble and just say you hate black women.    you’re a joke.
THE VICTORY:Seattle, the negotiations is continuing. Pres TRUMPS firm stand and the carnage publicity happing to the socialists ,Biden, BLM, is telling For over 2 months in Seattle, BLM, anarchrists have rioted, looted, burned, assaulted,  murdered.THE SOCIALISTS  HATE PUBLICITY
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Seniors for Biden Kickoff Meeting” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
The “you all” are the people who seem to be relishing the chance to automatically take potshots at the Biden campaign about whether there are reservations about Harris. We are too close to the finish line to throw any monkey wrenches. Don’t take your eyes off the prize.
Delegates vote overwhelmingly to endorse Biden for president and to reimagine society
1. there should be an age limit. I don't want 70 yr olds dictating my life choices when they suck on butterscotch candies. 2. they're rich already so why do they care 3. Joe Biden for president! lol
That's fine. Biden should promise one and done anyway.
The only thing Biden knew how to do was hook his family up with government contracts and finding Hunter jobs with foreign entities.
Biden is a joke!

THE BIDEN PLAN FOR STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZING, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, AND UNIONS – Joe Biden for President
Very well...thanks again....Biden is surely loved by the Mullahs after Obama and Biden sent them all that money and made the crooked nuke deal....😀😀
Another example of that is what the Biden's did in Ukraine and China with aid and corrupt business dealings
Nope, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. Biden still has to earn every vote no matter how terrible trump has been. Trump + Johnson actually defeated Clinton + Stein in the popular vote.
I'm all for Biden and you, don't get me wrong, but double check who is getting the unemployment. I'm disgusted seeing people whose jobs are open and sit back while others have been working this whole time.
Will, have you read any articles by Matt Taibbi?  The hatred of Trump has unfortunately changed the media.  They only care about one thing- electing Biden.
Exactly. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are about the only polls I look at.  Michigan looks safely blue.  If Pennsylvania slips there are probably big problems going on in other "swing states" (Florida, NC) as well. I think it comes down  simply to if Biden takes Wisconsin, he wins.
This reminds me of the anecdote from Nancy Reagan when she said Ronald couldn't remember the right words for simple things. She said he would ask her for a book but he called it a tree. Biden really seems to be in the early stages of the same thing.
I for one remember President Trump taking early and decisive action  against Covid-19  by blocking travel to and from China.  And the Democrats in general and Joe Biden in particular called him a Xenophobe and tried to keep travel open.  That tells you what they wanted .
“I always put women ahead of me. Then I bury my face in their hair and breathe in deeply through my nose.” — Joe Biden
If pedo Biden wins which I doubt
Womp womp. Cry me a river. When kamala and the Dems nominated biden they knew who he was. Shouldn't be a surprised at who is in charge. Counting down the days until the khive implodes and turns on their beloved uncle joe.
I'm sorry but what did you expect from the party that nominated Biden?
I prefer someone younger.  Karen Bass will be 67 in October.  That means she will be 71 for the 2024 election.  Given that Biden will most likely only serve one term the VP would normally be the next elections candidate...
Actually it's due to Biden's Dementia.....and We all know it....The Fighting Irish have turned into the Pandering Leprechauns....
As someone who likes and respects Bass I still need someone to tell me how she's qualified to be POTUS - and I mean in a time of unprecedented challenges not as compared to Trump. Biden has said that's a necessary quality so I'm not being capricious here.
Why would Biden be in the meeting?
And what does it say that Biden is taking any advice from him?
Biden drools in his oatmeal. He's the best they could do?
the mayors/governors of the blue states figure if they can help Biden get elected, he will make them whole.
And I have a son in his 20s who has promised to vote for Biden ( he loved Bernie), UNLESS he picks Harris. The way she locked up young people and minorities for pot as AG of CA is a line in the sand for him.
1/2 I have been on Team Biden since day 1. My first choice for VP is  closely followed by  and  None were his opponents in the primary, hence there are no ugly debate moments to have to explain away that would be a gift to the GOP.
Lol, not seen a single Biden flag here in N PBC..every house and every boat/yacht are flying Trump flags off their wheelhouses
This Biden team is going to blow it with progressives and young voters with all these dinosaurs surrounding Joe.
Joe Biden around small children.
Rachel, I strongly disagree with your analysis. The polling on Michelle Obama is and her popularity is strong up until the moment she’s announced as Biden’s VP. At that point the polling gets weaker and she starts getting trashed. Michelle knows that, too bad you don’t.
All these centrist &amp; GOP takes are driving me nuts.  Biden needs to stop taking the progressives for granted &amp; give us something to be enthusiastic about. Because I'm frankly still not happy that the primary gave us this old white guy as our nominee.
Good for Biden. It's not really the issue of her attacking him. That's fair. The issue is she pretended to be hurt by Biden's stance when it was all just a ruse.  Harris is a sociopath and if it takes a pervert like Dodd to keep her away from the WH that's fine by me.
Biden Bottoms lmao 🤣
I’ll for sure pre-order vinyl, but no US tour 😭 Any chance of that in 2021? I promise it will get better here once Biden is president 😜
Clear they are setting Harris up to be president. Like biden, harris can only win if every element of the process is rigged on their behalf.
Moms will vote for Biden
Literally trump is fighting to oppress you, actively, and the world is watching the fight against his actions. Biden, while not perfect, would not do this. So yeah, just vote. We need to not purity test ourselves into another four years of this horrorshow.
Bidens H1N1 response was disastrous we already know what's going to happen with Biden
I live in red Florida and a very red neighborhood. Late in the evening when Biden is announced as winner, I’m going to light off the mother lode of fireworks. Got wife approval “no matter how late.” She also said “we’ll blast patriotic songs out into the street. Can’t wait.”
But they won't say anything about it until Biden is sworn in
Once again if you are actually reading, I’ve said multiple times i don’t support Trump or ANY of the candidates. But if we are comparing, i can list at least 4 policies from 1984-94 that locked us up unjustly with Biden’s name on it. List some of the policies Trump introduced.
What isn’t true brother lol? Biden and the crime Bill or Trump pardoning black people? It’s Sunday so i have some time
That’s the point they’re ALL villains. Biden created Policy to destroy black families and lock us up unjustly, research it. Do you want to go back to that? Show me the policy Trump created to lock up black people. He’s actually freed some of us. Look that up
I run an African Drum and Dance Company that’s heavily in the school system, i also own a farm that provides Organic Produce to underprivileged communities. All documented. Those are just a few things. Now what are YOU doing? Promoting Biden is actually hurting us. 94 crime Bill?
At what point in history has an American President truly assisted in the liberation of black people in this country? Shouldnt take mental gymnastics to answer that. Trump won’t, Biden won’t, Hilary won’t, Obama didn’t. Doing the same thing expecting different results is insanity
💕 Waiting on  to announce  as his running mate, so I can buy an official Biden/Harris shirt!! #KHive
It’s not just about Biden. It’s about the Congress and Senate as well.
Y’all really supporting Joe Biden and it’s sad
I’m so tired of your rhetoric. If Obama and Biden committed a crime, why is fat boy Barr not conducting an investigation and looking to prosecute them?! Bro, have you ever taken Baron fishing, golfing, bowling, anything? Go golf LOSER.
Just look at how Biden leads off his answer about his running mate the other day with “iiiii’m looking for a black ahhh person of color oh yeah &amp; also woman for my VP pick. He doesn’t believe in it &amp; it shows but he knows that could get him a few extra votes. He’s using everyone
I'd for the red squirrel I feed named Daisy Mable at this point...or a bag of nacho cheese Doritos or a cockroach in a condemned apartment over Trump. So yeah...gotta go with Biden lol

Where's the Democratic Leadership?  Not only PRESIDENT BIDEN but all the other leaders like Senators and Representatives!  The nation is SICK!  We need you!
tRump has divided our nation to put through his own personal agenda.  We need to throw him out of the WH and put President Biden in!!!!
Also, please don't tell a woman who is 52 to 'do your research', as I have voted in more elections than you can imagine, and in similarly dark times. We don't vote for purity, we vote for best fit. Biden, right now, is best fit.    p.s. If you are into trump, just say so. Ok?

Biden is the only choice unless you want more trump.
Bro, you won because of Hillary, your opponent, not Obama and Biden.
SILENCE:   BLM’s leaders, using the Floyed homicide, (waiting for a jury finding), to stoke up violence, burning, looting.  Antifa, seeing a opening, joined in. We all see it in Democratic run cities, yet no word of condemnation comes from SHUMER Or POLOSI.  But where is BIDEN.
Anyone not voting for Biden needs to never ever claim to care about America  or democracy.
Can't. Wait. To. Vote. Biden.
Nope, Biden will have an earpiece with someone feeding him answers.

Biden is so conflicted and confused he political roadmap looks like a rats maze.
The UK and Canada have been paying their citizens $2000 a month since March and don’t complain. 😞 we have worked for our unemployment and we deserve it 😞 I’m voting for Biden 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Voting for Biden.
Biden's pulling out his dick? His biggest weapon .,.....  Go get your coffee edward. Capt yes Ma'am No AngieBiden said he was planning to choose a woman so no.
Precisely right but I know God n Trump will make it happen We have 2 We got Snakes trying to Rig Election 4 Biden right now DS 🐍 on TV lying
This is a brilliant torching of Fox hosts regarding Biden .
Kimberly, a President Biden is inevitable.
I don’t watch Fox News 😉 what have they done? List the things they have done besides donating money to BLM that goes directly to the DNC.besides telling people to vote as this is Trump’s fault. Obama &amp; Biden didn’t do anything for Black people or to help with police brutality
Dude you’re so lost, it’s not even worth replying to you. Trump has been the toughest president on China. Biden and Obama worshiped China and allowed them to get away with everything and guess what? They profited from it. You need to educate yourself before commenting
Bc they’re trying to put the fear in people until November 4 and is Biden wins you’ll be the great savior and this virus will magically disappear

Biden will not pick anyone! Kamala or otherwise. He will announce his VP, not choose one. What would be funny is that if the choice was A and he announced B. He has no clue what’s happening.
Records proving Amb Yovanovitch perjured herself at least twice Doc’s showing she was denying visas to witnesses who could prove Biden &amp; Dem corruption.
Clear doc proof of money laundering by Burisma &amp; Biden’s. How about that … it looks like this whole thing is about to blow up in their faces. Watch for Cyprus to become a huge hub and part of this story so far we have only scratched the tip of the iceberg
Lunatic but thank goodness can you imagine her running this Country yeah she’d run it into ground sell out country n Biden will do the SAME
What's going on with Biden? Is this a sure sign of Dementia? One of the signs is impaired reasoning according to the medical definition. If he wins in Nov he'll have the nuke codes. Scary thought.

“Joe Biden’s Silence On Portland is Terrifying.” by
So you don’t want Kamala because a white man can’t keep his mouth shut?! lol You make no sense. Just be honest about it, you don’t want Kamala. Biden is to blame for ALL of this. He should have announced his VP pick already. Dragging this out is not benefiting him.
As a former Delawarean I had thought I was done with Biden given his age and many failings. But he’s back  And if there is a person in politics with a more irritating voice than Kamala Harris I cannot imagine who that might be.
November 3rd, I am voting for Biden, to do just that.
A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden’s people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can’t even take questions at his pressers.
They just want to give President Biden an even BIGGER mess to clean up----like he won't have enough already!  Do everything possible to make sure we have a DEMOCRATIC Senate AND House after November; start by getting rid of McConnell, Graham and Collins!!
Pathetic, still desperately hanging on by your fingernails to #FakeNarrative of Trump/Russia,   "collusion." Left has been proven wrong for 4 yrs w/mult investigations, incl one using the full force of intl, DOJ, &amp; FBI. Obama/Biden were the Russian ass kissers. Nice try though...

I hate politics but, he isn’t wrong. It’s better to be safe than sorry. As a registered Democrat  has been in two branches of the country CD. I won’t void for him.  has done more in 3 1/2 years than Biden has done in his long career.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Looks like all the Biden supporters came out.

Joe Biden is already in bed with China if he gets elected all they have to do is fluff his pillow. He's been taking bribes out of China in the Millions of $ for years.  He has put China ahead of his own country. People are so brainwashed that they would vote for this Criminal.
Joe Biden’s America.   #RememberInNovember
Of course. If you don’t vote Biden, you’re voting for trump.
Biden on Obama...the first clean black guy  I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,” he said. “I mean, that’s a storybook, man.”
Yes! It makes no sense. If they are not happy with Trump, it is till a vote for him if they don’t vote for Biden.
Can't wait for POTUS Joe Biden
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.
I try to make fun of these ridiculous people and things. These subjects are very serious to me. If Joe Biden was selected it would scare me. They would pull him like a marionette to pass every socialist bill they could.
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
I live 57 years and up until I never heard of anybody saying nasty comments about somebody having a political bumper sticker. I w never to somebody with a Biden sticker. I personally deplore him. I guess you can't have free speech unless you agree with them.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.
I agree! I've been a Democrat my whole life, but wasnt happy voting for Hilary the same way I'm not happy voting for Biden. But, how else are we going to get Trump out? Any viable ideas? It is the time to unite against a horrible evil in the WH.
I figured out what Joe Biden's platform is. He's going for their ignorant, uninformed, CNN and brainwashed audience. He hasn't said one thing that a normal American would want to hear in a presidential candidate. He should run as a Socialist Communist at least that is honest.
The scary part is that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what a disgusting individual Joe Biden is.
POS the ones that did ridiculous why didn’t this get done when the traitor BHO/Biden in office it’s now so important total BS RINO
Not even close to accurate here in Florida. I see Trump signs everywhere and never see Biden signs.
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ one more person Joe Biden can pick for VP!! She’s gangster ! #RSMS
You know what I was thinking, Joe Biden is a broken down politician. I can't understand how anybody in their right mind could vote for him. Just because you hate Trump isn't a illegitimate reason. Hating is no reason to vote. Some people don't even know why they hate Trump.
That's better than endangering those who did not vote for democrats, elections have consequences. I can't wait for Biden to win and keep the feds out and see what happens when shit really hits the fan.
You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier - Joe Biden
I heard show Biden made a mistake the other day he said a nurse was blowing up his nose. He meant he was snorting blow up his nose.
this shit got me moving slow like joe biden 😦
Very true, but I'm predicting Biden's handlers won't allow him to debate.
I live in Central Florida, the I-4 corridor. Biden is BIG here!
Ever wonder why so many big brand names back Beijing's favorite candidate for POTUS Joe Biden? Same reason #SleepyCreepyBasementDwellerQuidProDementiaJoe opposes America First. Follow the money.
I believe that President BIDEN (God I love the sound of that!) may have to call in the National Guard to BODILY remove FORMER President Trump from the W.H.;  if that happens, I hope that EVERY 🌎 news outlet carries it LIVE!
Do you understand that the government is trying to defund our police officers which the democrat governments  will do you’ll see if you vote for Joe Biden
2 things I noticed in watching this video.Biden likes to say the Obama Biden administration but three different times Obama said in my administration.Obama gives him nothing. Secondly, 90% of the time Obama is talking and when Biden does talk he rambles and doesn’t stay on topic
One of my best friends was a fireman. He was killed inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. And Joe Biden says he wants to teach Islam in our Public Schools. That's one of the most disgraceful things I ever heard. They don't even want to do the Pledge of Allegiance.
Do not  be confused by the media, the stock market or politicians about your choice this fall.  Only totalitarian regimes erase history because their goal is to erase your mind &amp; deny your observations. Pelosi and Biden are types of “Manchurian Candidates”.
Yes. But a lot of those people needed to actually SEE her and HEAR her. They won’t listen to her speeches most of the time. Biden makes so few it’s ridiculous and we know why. He will be forced to show his incapacity in a debate.
On Covid-19, Biden doesn’t have any new ideas. On climate and the economy, his ideas are liabilities, writes  We must re-elect ⁦ !  But that’s not enough. Help me give ⁦ a House he can work with!
Speaking of  slandering  as a "racist", such a desperate move suggests the Biden campaign's internal polling must be showing them that #SleepyCreepyBasementDwellerQuidProDementiaJoe isn't running away with the election as they'd like you to believe.
will not debate  yesterday by declaring the President racist he laid the foundation to refuse. Biden's handlers know he hasn't the mental acuity to debate POTUS. The excuse will be some variation of not legitimizing racism; the truth will be cowardice.
How can people call this Biden’s America? Like it’s happening right now in Portland, and it’s starting in several other cities. We might be on different ends of the political spectrum, but if you stand up for your rights then this shouldn’t sit right with you.
The point of the debate is to see how your candidate holds up. Biden will not hold up. And no. They aren’t “19th century”. They’ve decided many Presidential elections over the years.There was a CNN story today that the Biden aides said the VP announcement was pushed back till appx the 10th now, when they had said around the 1st for a while now.   Is this why?  Were they leaning to Bass?

Trump has a 42.8% approval rating. He trails Biden by 8.4% on average in the polls nationally. Finally Trump trails Biden by 7.2% on average in Florida. I'm surprised that given 150,000 deaths so far due to Trump's mishandling of the pandemic his numbers aren't lower.
Joe Biden will rescue us from trump. You've done jack shit for America and even less for Florida.

The best ad you could air is a compilation of all of the gaffes of Biden in just the last months. The country needs to see what fake media refuses to let the people of this country see so they can understand how sadly his mental capacity has deteriorated.
Never ever i a million years would I vote for. Racist, rapist, pervert who is so senile that they won’t even let him do a real interview on tv. Anyone who would vote for Biden has a few screws loose. Trump has done an amazing job with our country. #Trump2020
Before Obama paid to have this virus brought to this country we had the best unemployment numbers in history and will again as soon as Trump is re-elected. This country is gone if Biden were elected...but the people of this country will not let that happen.
Oh shut up...your husband should be in jail for spying on Trump’s campaign. The evidence is very clear that Obama &amp; Biden was running the show. They BOTH had and have no business being in our government. The people are tired of your lies and corruption.
The silent majority are the Republicans who are voting for Biden

So...the [locally] elected officials is the “change” you’re referring to? We FINALLY have a wave of progressive politics becoming more mainstream, but Biden  isn’t a part of that. Biden is a STILL all about maintaining the status quo and i KNOW you’re smart enough to KNOW this.
They're losing just about everybody except for the Biden voters that are trashing our cities. But there's plenty of fraud votes combining illegals and dead people to make up the loss.

4. Joe Biden’s entire campaign has pretty much been  A. Obama’s buddy B. Im not Trump  What the FUCK kinda marketing ploy is that??? THE AVERAGE AMERICAN VOTER DOESNT KNOW ANY OF BIDENS POLICIES because OF JUST THAT. He’s STILL an old fashioned establishment Democrat!!
Ok, lets go:  1. The two party system will FOREVER be bullshit if we continue for ANY REASONS other than proposed POLICIES  2. YOU cannot frame yourself as a “responsible voter” by supporting someone with an such an anti-progressive track record as Joe Biden

AND...in case msm has not told you yet...the facts are coming out and Obama &amp; Biden were dead inthe middle of spying on Trump's campaign using phony documents, they altered docs. and fyi...what Nixon did pales in comparison to what they did.
You don't know what hell is...just let Biden win and let the Far Left Socialist/Communists take over. The lack of common sense in those on the Left is mind boggling. You will reap waht you sow. Trump had this country with the best economy &amp; employment numbers ever pre-virus.
You can beat Biden off? I’m sure.

They keep telling Biden but he forgets by the time he gets to the podium.
Vote Trump in 2020  Be careful who you vote for in 2020 because remember Biden is 77 yrs old that's too old &amp; he won't be in office long before he hands it to Pelosi &amp; she'll hand it over to the worst criminal in…
There is also no chemistry.  Warren attacked Obama and Biden constantly and she said he was running in the wrong primary, etc.  Long bad history.  They do not have common ground.
I'm going down to Democratic headquarters tomorrow to try to buy a Biden yard sign to go with my Dump Trump yard sign.I think asswipe may have trouble in Florida. Yay, about time the old farts woke up.
I don't see her happening.    She is 74 years old for starters and Biden made comments about bridges to the future generations.
I feel ya,  I just told one of my needy friends that if they’re not planning to vote for Biden, I wasn’t planning on listening to their problems any longer. Haven’t heard from her in 3 days.  Adios!
Dan, Please tell me how america can vote Joe Biden as president of the United States? Do they not understand that if he is elected this country is done! Please tell me I am not to worry?
I truly think that is going to move closer for us.   Kasich for Biden at the convention.  Lincoln Project and RVAT have split the state between them to put boots on the ground and ads targeting trumpers.  It is a state that is going to be heavily targeted by NeverTrumpers...

Ok. I am convinced..All Democrats are Jackasses..well if he is gonna place a label of untruth upon an opponent, maybe I can place a label of truth to counterpoint his bullyboy tactics..Biden is a Pedophile..there, it is..own it, cuz the video evidence supports this conclusion
Biden is so far ahead many Democrats don’t even need to get out of bed and Vote!
LP has: produced viral ads, fast response to news. trolled trump/got under his skin. supported Biden and downtickets. TV ads + boots on the ground. Social media/Books/Print. Venomous, talented. Burned boats, bridges. Humor helps! NeverTrump since 2015. Smart and inside knowledge
The LP's stated goal is to burn the GOP to the ground.  That is something they want now, and I have wanted for decades.  I am thankful for them, they are true allies in our goals this year - defeat trump, elect Biden and take our country back from racist idiotic lunatics.

Love Donald Trump. Thank God someone can take control of this country. He's done a great job and has been scrutinized and dishonored as our President every step of the way. He will win in 2020 because he's the only one who knows what's going on in the world. Biden is a puppet

Joe Biden and a enthusiastic woman running mate. GO JOE 2020
My bigger concern about Warren is what happens to her Senate seat if Biden wins. MA has a GOP governor and seems highly likely he would appoint another Republican to fill Warrens seat if she became VP and if Dems take the Senate back this year, it's not going to be a huge margin.
Honestly, my bigger concern about Warren as VP is her empty Senate seat if Biden wins. Massachusetts has a Republican governor and you know he'll appoint a Republican to fill her vacancy and if the Dems retake the majority this year, it's not going to be a huge majority.
Did I miss something? Is California in play for the repubs now? Why would Bass being more popular in California matter? Harris is the only real nationally known and respected option. God I hope Biden and the Dems don’t fuck this up. Pick Harris and move forward!
A rock could beat Biden!
You mentioned Daniel Cameron and his hesitancy to press charges while also pointing out his support of Trump but it's not Cameron's job to do so. It is the district attorney's role. The district attorney is a Democrat and a Biden supporter. I was making a similar observation.
Biden has to be the most racist presidential candidate as he worked with Southern Democrats during the 70's, yeah. 197Oz. Joe Blow can't walk up the stairs, let alone run a country! Trump is the energizing rabbit that never quits, never stays down n counterpunches are world class
Trump is his buddy. Biden is his friend. The only candidate who won't block a prosecutor from bringing him down is
Ever move the Democrats stagetegics have puttered out into doom and gloom, as their race ploy did not being out the federal intervention they prayed for  Excuse me, they don't pray, They had hoped for that result! Game, Set, Match is over; Where is Biden anyway! Dems want do-over
I personally don't care if Harris is not the VP selection. Just like you are surrounded by people you can work with to accomplish your goals, Biden has a right to select a WOMAN as he promised. It is people like you who want to change the VP requirements after such a promise.
This relief is non-negotiable. Put  House bill up for a vote as we need to protect our citizens, the  and state/local governments and services.   Mitch is holding out for more Trump poll #’s and will let our country collapse if he thinks Biden will win.
So what if Biden isn’t “exciting”?  Living under Trump has been the old Chinese curse “May you live in interesting times”.  I just want a boring, competent president who just works.

Mark my words; if Biden wins in November you will see all the Covid-19 panic and violent protests suddenly and "mysteriously" go away, but if Trump wins there will "intentionally" be 4 more years of this mess!!

Biden sucks. Vote for Biden.
Who cares what Nunes has on Biden . Joe Biden could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and still not lose votes. He could be in pictures with pedophiles Epstein and Maxwell and no one would care.Biden could extort an ally to gather dirt on Donald Trump, Congress would say It's OK.

Biden may be unfit for the Presidency. trump is unfit for humanity.
What is most interesting is her association to the U.N. and a growing speculation that Biden's mental health is worsening.  Though the Democrat leadership sees it as not an issue now, within 8 months if elected they will decide it is an issue.  If Biden steps down who becomes VP?
So you think Joe Biden is better deal ? I hope he remembers he's running for president that's the best candidate that the Democrats could come up with. I want somebody who is not in cognitive decline to be the president of the United States. #TRUMP2020

Is the press in the United States aware that hey free and unbiased press is not tolerated in socialist countries. That means the idiots in the media that are pushing people to vote for Biden which means a vote for socialism will very shortly after the election will not exist!
In fact, even if Biden wins in November, MOST of his support is likely to be a combination of working class and minorities. College educated whites will not make up a majority of the Dem coalition anytime soon. 2/2
The Black and Latino working class will still overwhelmingly back Biden, though. Those groups are critical to the Dem coalition and Biden wouldn’t come close to winning without them.  Either way, current polling is showing a shift toward Biden in the WWC as well. 1/2
You and about a million other people have done it too. But it can be done with Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Know why? Because politics is all the same game just different players.
Are you going to apologize to Joe Biden, now?
They call our president unwell and crazy yet Joe Biden is in the basement with a bib.
That's a lie. Biden has committed to 3 debates. Also, tRump stumbles every time he speaks in public. His grammar is atrocious. You must not pay too much attention to him when he speaks.
And he will run ( or one of his devil spawn) again in 2024 and blame Biden for not solving all the issues he created
Hunter Biden is an American citizen and as such has no place on your agenda.
Make that two. I wanted Warren to run in 2016 and I supported her in 2020. I voted for Hillary and I'll be voting for Biden.
You're right. It's divisive. I'm a lifelong Democrat. In 2016 I voted for Bernie and then Hillary in the general. I voted for Warren in the recent primary, and I'll vote Biden in November.

Some reports have named Chris Dodd as the ringleader of this obnoxious campaign against Harris.  Biden needs to get rid of him as an advisor on VP if he wants to win in 2020.

So wait, Biden supports expunging marijuana arrest records but doesn't support legalization?    I guess we'll just keep arresting people and then expunging the arrest records?

Yeah Biden might not be the most exciting candidate, but that's not what it's about. It's about electing a candidate that has experience and policies that can effect our lives in a positive way. A lot of people don't vote for candidates with their best interests in mind.
Didn't Biden apologize for all that, and not supporting the gay marriage thing ?  🤣😂😅
Well, not to be morbid, but Joe Biden is 77, and Donald Trump is 74, so maybe their vice presidential picks are more important than usual for a reason.

. How's this?
Followed all
Who seriously thinks Biden is going to even [cognitively] make it through his first term?
Sounds like she's the best candidate if she's the only one getting smeared. Reminds me of all the Biden smear attempts that have tried &amp; failed.  Dodd's bs about Karen Bass also smacks of racist tone policing, of wanting a less assertive BIPOC woman. #fuckthatshit
I doubt people would be trying to malign her if the GOP weren't scared of her - kinda like all the attempts at smearing Biden 🤔
The VP pick isn't going to debate Trump for Biden ? No doubt every mind is made up.  I'm 'VOTING AGAINST' Biden and 'FOR TRUMP' this election.  Unlike before, I 'VOTED AGAINST' HRClinton and had NO OPTION but Trump.  Most Dems are not VOTING FOR Biden, just VOTING AGAINST Trump.

Don't like Biden. Don't like Kamala. But I really don't like the orange.
That's just one poll. Others have Biden up by more. Regardless, I'm sure as hell submitting my vote if I have to crawl across a mile of broken glass.

I can’t imagine with a drop fossil fuel platform that Biden will even be competitive in PA/OH/MI/WI/MN and so on. You are talking millions and millions of jobs. Wow.
I'd say it sounds like he is reaching out to Biden supporters.
We know she’s very fond of willies so maybe she’s after Biden willie?
Sounds like a sub human who would vote for Biden.
If former vice-president Biden isn't guilty of influence peddling, nobody is!
We’re coming for you next, Senator.  A Biden DOJ will indict you, hopefully.
Dems tied themselves up in the bad messaging of the protestors* and are going to have to try hard to distance them from it.  Biden currently feeling that pain, imo.   *I agree w/protestors on police brutality and systemic racism.  Just saying their messaging/solutions are wrong.
Yes, they've been ongoing, that's my point.  They are now dragging out with no purpose, and people who were (rightly) outraged about police brutality are now wondering what the point is.  Meanwhile, the left bought into "defund the police" slogan, whether Biden onboard or not.
Let's also not forget that he once said certain de-segregation policies would lead to his children growing up "in a racial jungle".
Joe Biden is touted as a candidate that stands up for racial justice, BLM, etc. but people seem to forget about the 1994 crime law he helped write that lead to the injustices we see today against black and brown communities.
Apropos of criticizing partisanship in our City Hall:  If you vote for Biden, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Democrat.  If you vote for Trump, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're probably a Republican.  Mud-flinging can be fun, but it isn't reality
The democratic biased presidential polls have a very significant purpose. When the Dems do their voter fraud scheme they will point at these bias fake polls and say that Biden was always in the lead that there is no fraud.#WeKnowBetter #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
People are acting like Biden is going to somberly start the hard work of unification and repair lolololol  the Democrats are going to treat this like America unanimously decided that Rahm Emanuel's austerity regime is what we demanded
who cares, all this is will be who is going to loose along side  Creepy Sleepy Joke Biden
While drug prices are an issue everyone should be concerned with, please explain how they will magically quadruple when Biden wins. Because I’m pretty sure you are completely full of shit and just typed what you thought would scare people.
Jeri’s mom is polling ahead of Biden in Texas as of right now.
People are like "what are they gonna do when the evictions happen and homelessness skyrockets?"  Buddy they are gonna be celebrating Biden's big win and not caring at all about people that are sleeping on the street, because after November 3rd you will cease to exist to Democrats
So Biden isn’t a racist now
Joe Biden's sanity
Hey Hunter Biden.....
John Edwards revealed how you're just handled people just hold your hand coddle you feed your ego give you what to say that is Joe Biden right now but it's worse.
You mean besides Biden saying poor kids can do as well as white kids?  If America today was like America in 1960 "maybe" I could understand some of the outrage except they won the debate by peace.  Today the debate is over lesser issues than then and they expect to win by war.
Wonder if she’ll be Biden’s pick.
Why Biden’s V.P. Pick Could Cinch the 2020 Race  via
What they are doing is Joe Biden is a elderly abuse.
Joe Biden will select the most intelligent, the most ethical and the most judicial people for his cabinet. He will not surround himself with felons. Your cabinet members and your shadow people are always on a conveyor belt, in and then out the door.
This should be a CAKEWALK. Biden, whom the Democratic Party chose over all others because they believed him to be the best, should have double-digit leads in every mfing state. I mean, over the single most incompetent, ignorant, &amp; corrupt president in US history. Why doesn't he?
imho we need to get the party to the place where Biden, Pelosi, Clinton, etc not only are *not* making policy anymore, but are afraid to appear in public.
Trump winning is the path to the reformation of the Dem Party into something useful.   Biden winning means that the left gets locked out of Dem leadership and policy for at least another generation.
Crime surges on Trump's watch as he warns of Biden's America
Dem-onics, Why clam to be God loving when your support the devil? What about the children? Biden would sacrifice any one of you. Trump fights for you, and fight against him. Feel sorry for you and all of us.
Are you an American voter? If not your opinion is worthless. If you are, then go vote. I’ll be voting for Biden. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Let them strike and fire them all. Fox13 Tampa and these teachers know that going back to school is as safe as any year! What’s not safe, is leaving kids at home! Hyper biased Ch13 Tampa is bad for your health! HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WORKS! Report the truth! Biden has dementia 🇺🇸
No not Harris, Val Demings because she could help Biden win Florida, Harris gives him nothing because he will win California anyway and Cali won't account in the election.
We are in the greatest turmoil of our time due to trump's lack of knowledge and experience. Joe Biden will clean this mess up and restore America to the country it once was before trump ruined it.
Joe Biden is woke, not sleepy We are not Radical We are Americans who want a Decent upstanding person for president and that sure isnt you!!
Millions of people don’t pay to watch football or any other sport because of players political views. It’s their talent on the field that pays them millions of dollars. They get payed millions to play sports they love.Not bad. Now STFU about Trump or Biden we hear enough of that
Yo, Biden is basically a sane Republican.
It's understandable because the police fate rest in the hands of Trump, If Biden wins the police agencies across the country will see their power diminished so much they will become nothing more than a investigation agency.
I hope it does, Biden's caretakers pose a bigger threat.
Premature alien invasion
Social Security wouldn't survive a Biden administration, at least not in a useful form.
People wouldn't have even a simple air election much less power under Biden's tyranny... If DemoncRats win, Americans won't have power to change their minds, use them now.!!!
Joe Biden’s notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris via   #FlaPol
I'm not a Democrat (#QuitTheParties), but I was hoping for Warren in the primary.  With Biden winning, however, it seemed important that a woman of color be good VP. And that was before Arbery and Floyd brought America's racism problems into such very sharp relief.
Just imagine she will be president in three months if Biden is elected. The world will go to hell if this happens.
On most days Biden doesn’t even know what day of the week it is let alone that he is running for president. Somebody has to keep reminding him of what he is doing

Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
At least Biden speaks English.  We still don't know what the hell Trump was talking about with "covefe."
Me too! A fellow Warren supporter in the neighborhood encouraged me to keep both my Warren and Biden signs up until a VP was named (she can’t have a sign, she’s a cop).
Biden spoked with civil rights icon John Lewis on his death bed. Lewis told him to “stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation."  via
Biden won’t know what to do when Trump debates him.
Every time Trump opens his mouth Biden gets another vote.
perfectly said about Biden....at least he has a plan!!!!!
I still have yet to hear either the left media or Biden point blank answer or even ask the question - do you condone “protestors” setting fire to a Federal building and destroying private and public property?   Why is that not a huge question?
How many cops do they really need to guard Joe Biden's basement anyway?
Managed Joe Biden
Dang. That was quick.
2/2 any crack in “our” veneer of unity is a opening to slam Biden. MSNBC needs to learn from 2016.
I already sent them to my 13 year old skater daughter. She's acting all cool like she already knows about painting Vans, but the first thing she said was "noice."
Yeah! Pretty awesome
I agree that Biden is not a socialist.
Joe Biden was just a face to save the the house.
HATERS GOTTA HATE- Fact Check: Joe Biden Falsely Claims Trump Held Bible Upside Down  via
Biden and Fauci are at the top of my list... Followed by Pelosi and Schumer
Joe Biden would never get the beautiful woman for a prom.
Biden isn't exactly a progressive. It's why it took the southern states to save his candidacy. But yes - centrists are typically left behind. Sad that the Republican party can't evolve; this feels like some kind of last stand.
He donates his whole check! He’s only been in office 4 3 1/2 yrs he could stay n office 4 40 yrs&amp; still wouldn’t be as corrupt as Biden
ngl bro I am having a REAL hard time trying to like Biden but by all the fucking cells in my body, Trump has gotta get out 😭 peer pressuring the fuck outta people to vote in Florida
I will vote Biden
That why I an will to work with Biden. I am not looking for a messiah
Like you Paula, Kaitlin Collins is a biased reporter with a narrative. John Roberts is not. Also, Pres Trump does not have a list of reporters approved by his handlers to call on like Joe Biden does.
The democrats had8 years under Biden and Obama,  4 years after that,  but impeaching was more important than Daca recipients. Guess they served their purpose.
Believe it or not I've heard the claim that wanting more of your tax money back is racist.  Why?  Because it takes freebies away from those who don't pay taxes.  Reminds me of a Biden quote but I won't go there.
It's about time  cut off the rude White House press pool and left when they become rabid! Notice they licked Biden's a$$ during his Q&amp;A!
Rice is infinitely more qualified than anyone else under consideration. At least as qualified as Biden.
Maybe Biden will ride a white horse naked down the streets of Portland, er I mean #CHAZ.  And you thought the riot footage was sickening.  LMAO
Joe Biden is giving out false hope. When loses people will realize the broken and corrupt man he is and will be happy we have the legend.
RESPOND TO BIDEN WITHOUT REPEATING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE PAST...ONLY WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO IN THE FUTURE, BUT ANSWER HIS LIES AND THE PABLUM QUESTIONS FROM THE HAND PICKED MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
What are the odds joe Biden picks HRC for VP.
We need a major ad campaign  to encourage  votes by mail to be sent in early!! Dont want this getting hung up waiting  for all those Biden votes to get delivered!!!  get on it!
Trump doesn't know his ass from his elbow.... Biden will win!!
I have a similar view, but a bit different in scope. My take is that anything that meaningfully bids election vol should be carried through Q4.  Market doesn't care about Trump/Biden per se, imo. Risk is "contested" election or escalating violence/unrest.  1/2
Why? Is he going to tell lies and we can catch him? Yes. Will that lead to consequences? No, not at all. The House hearings are always just a waste of time. Enough with the football scam, Lucy. They have made it all very tiresome. At least watching Biden keeps hope alive.
What wonderful planted Pablum questions from the mainstream media to Joe Biden who, it appears, was being fed answers either through his telepromter or other electronic means on his podium.  Probably, like with Hillary, he was fed the questions in advance.
UPDATE: Biden doesn't know next week is the first week of August.
Day 1..Biden needs to use executive order power requiring Jim Jordan to wear his fucking jacket!
Joe Biden had a press conference today. Joe Biden did not call on one single conservative journalist for a question. Not one. I’m assuming that he didn’t want to have to answer a question that wasn’t a softball like the liberal journos asked him.
How far is your network going to go in covering Biden when his campaign tries to get out of a live debate?  Will you gaslight Americans with DNC-approved excuses? (While avoiding the obvious?)
Managed Joe Biden, he’s such a pathetic joke
You know what you got, indeed.  And you're literally signifying that you KNOW Biden is too mentally diminished to debate and come out ahead.
WTF  ! I watch five hours and you turn away to show Joe Biden! Disgraceful to show the hearing all day and turn away at the end..  You are becoming no better than CNN
Biden touting his foreign policy...LMFAO!
What’s your point? At least Biden has a list.
I’m ready for Biden to announce his VP pick so I can buy merch!! Give the people (me) what they want!
I'm actually relieved Fox cut to Biden ...actually "answering" questions...🤡🤡🤡🤣🤣🤣  #BidenPressConference
Biden Seeks to Win Senior Vote in New Ad Criticizing Trump's Handling of COVID-19  #ChristianNews
LMAO! Same format for Biden, like Hussein! All pre selected reporters and therefore studied questions! What a joke#
Biden is finally doing some easy softball questions that he obviously got ahead of time. What a joke!!
It is crap like this that will let Trump win. If BLM why would anyone of color, anyone with brains, anyone who loves this country, fall for this "Bernie bowl of shit". Biden is better than Trump. #VoteForOurLives #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 🇺🇸🌊
Biden's most underrated potential flip is ME-2. Everyone keeps assuming Trump will hold on to it but 2018 saw Dems win there, and the Dem Rep is IMO favored to keep the seat. Biden has lead the very scant polling we've had from the CD
While Biden is speaking, I wonder who the Democrats will run for President?
Biden doesn't just make sure you're clean and healthy, he'll sniff your hair for confirmation!
No, it isn't. So what justified PolitiFact in translating Biden's reference to home health into the different category of direct care workers?
Keep the eye on the prize, if she turns out voters for Biden, that is all that matters
Joe Biden plans to call for the Fed to play a bigger role in addressing racial economic inequality, demanding it look beyond its current economic focus  via
Big talk from Beijing Biden
Probably nobody cares that PolitiFact is giving a "True" to Biden based on cherry-picking a segment of the lowest-paid home health care workers.  "In the ballpark," therefore "True."  "Fact-checking."
A vote for Biden is a vote for an intelligent thoughtful administration and the healing of America.
Biden will make up his own mind. He was going to talk to Bass anyway bc she was there.  People have opinions and are free to share them. This is the American way
bs news, Polls don't mean jack.  LMAO Joke Biden has to come out of the basement sometime.  What a shocker coming from another bias msm outlet
Another good sign of where the race is? Mainstream forecasters snapping at each other on whether Biden is an 87% or 92% likely winner
Even more new polls today and I still see the same pattern. We're not having a discussion on whether Biden can flip back MI/PA/WI or even if he can win AZ/FL, we're instead debating his odds in GA/IA/OH/NC/TX thanks to tight polls there. Speaks volumes on where the race is rn
This is so frustrating. Bc this country will absolutely dissolve and take a lot more of us with it if he remains in office. But Dems provide zero inspiration or tangible policy to entice voters. Marketing Biden as simply anti-Trump &amp; heralding votership is going to end us all.
Comparing the Trump and Biden Tax Plans  -
🤣🤣🤣 so sounds like trump making his plays well lmao $1200 Defly gone get him that vote unfortunately. If ppl had to choose take $1200 and vote trump or take nothing and vote Biden... guess what 😩
What's the o/u on Biden's popular vote margin?
Mushroom stamped. 😂
Biden isn't perfect but he cares and we don't have 2 prop up his ego. Trump is a 4yr disaster that will not do anything help the economy or stop the virus.
Yep. It’s like that shitty Trump ad saying Biden’s America won’t be safe. These are dangerous propagandists.
Serious question, if tRump dies during Biden’s presidency, would he give him a state funeral ? I think he would because of his character
that's right please, Make America Great Again after Trump destroyed it, so please vote for Biden and SAVE AMERICA
not endorsing Biden is about the dumbest fking thing you can do. congratulations on being a total zero of a representative of the Democratic Party.
It's doesn't matter, Trump's support base is small relative to Biden's as most are older, suburban or rural white boomers who have a pill calendar dispensers. We outnumber them and in November we'll outvote them too.
Of course did anyone expect differently.  Biden will have to survive sometime.
Everything you stated is true and if Biden is elected the American people except this reality, to some in the country this will be unacceptable but remember other Americans had to live for centuries under an intolerable situation that wasn't suitable for an animal.
Both Mike Pence and Joe Biden are expected to visit the late congressman as he lies in state.  via
That footage is totally your America.  Biden has zero in it
Joe Biden is the coach from Bad News Bears that the kids used as a fake chaperone as you recall before going to Houston Texas for a game.
Sounds like a prime opportunity to reach out to  and her campaign. Why keep asking Biden every week? No sense beating a dead horse
And you are maybe more mentally challenged than Biden
We will, by voting for Biden!   #TrumpleThinSkin
Not hot Biden supporters
New York, Seattle, Portland Chicago,  how is that Democrat Mayor and Governor treating you?? Think Biden and more Democrats will fix it?? Or make it worse? You KNOW it will be worse...so I can give you and your crime spree city no sympathy!!
Nothing is going to anger me to the point that I will not be voting for Biden. My soul purpose on November 3 is to vote against Trump. I might not agree with many things in life, but I choose to control my thoughts and remain at peace.
No Biden will pick a VP that can win him an important State, like Florida.
Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
Joe Biden will never be President of the United states #MAGA   Never.
Idiot, so CV19 makes that distinction... Just bc you "say good day" doesn't change hypocrisy of #Biden and the powerful... You're accepting that CV19 is not dangerous enuf to cancel a funeral and you don't mind diff rules for them... Good evening to you sir!
Biden/Marxist needs trouncing. So you want taxes raised (he promised that), you want more people  unemployed due to a un-green new deal, live in fear due to support of criminals.. Got it...
We've gotten so focused on whether Biden could pull off  states like GA/IA/NC/OH/TX that it feels like we don't talk much about what a nice lead he has in the three states that made Trump Prez
Weird MN numbers but other than that nothing but shifts towards Biden in every other state here and look they found him ahead in GA and TX, not to mention really nice leads in MI/PA/WI
if it seems like a new person is in the top running for Biden’s VP every other day that’s because the campaign is using the news stories to gauge public opinion
The person who Biden needs to dump is Chris Dodd.  Just an old white man bent out of shape that a woman might be in a position of power that he was never able to achieve.  How did he even get on the vetting committee with his shady past?  Dump Dodd!
Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  It's probably best. We don't need anymore needless photo ops. Using the flag and Bible were two to many.
When Joe Biden becomes President, I will be going on vacation and taking a month off from Twitter.
Nothing against Bass but she is not on the national radar.  Biden needs a strong, well-known woman VP, preferably a black woman.  Harris fits the bill.
It’s hilarious that you portray what Biden’s America will be and it’s actually your america now.  Wow your followers are weak minded
Please God, stop all of this and punish the wicked. The good people deserve peace and happiness. Amen PS, please get rid of these idiots for starts...  Nancy Pelosi, chuck Schumer,  Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Ocasio Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren
She is getting it ready for the Biden’s........by putting poison ivy in there.
No in fact Nadler is on tape saying  Antifa is a myth He should be put away with Biden they could babble at each other all day and night
I just watched the huge event for Biden at the Villages.  The Biden team in Tampa Bay is out everyday at corners waving and getting lots of honks
And Biden is competent? Rotflmao
Trump 2020, that's what I am telling people. If you want socialism and contr over American people then Biden is your guy. You want what is happening in pie and, New York and Chicago...then Biden is your guy.
Voting for Biden. Gonna crawl over glass to do it
Uh biden the oldest whitest man ever in politics is your standard bearer.  And that chart shows how democrats perpetually afraid of everything.  Now I would love to see a category called easily butt hurt.  Dems would win that one.
We could Daydream the Joe Biden will be president it'll never happen your dreams will be crushed the member 4th big Daddy will be your president for another four more years baby.!
No it isn't, that is exactly what biden has said. You democrats like all the rioting and looting. No one cares what you Hollywood elites say because you have guards and protection so y'all let the young liberal crybabies carry on.
Hey Nancy, did Joe Biden sniff you while you were in the Capitol Rotunda.
I think you got Biden and Boris mixed up

Three years ago today, Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare and throw millions off of health insurance. Thank god it didn’t pass. Now we have the opportunity to elect Joe Biden, flip the Senate, and expand the house, so we can strengthen the Affordable Care Act. #100DaysToGo
If you don’t vote for Biden, “you ain’t black” -Joe Biden
hahaha like Biden could pull that off.
It’s so obvious, yet for some reason Biden is seriously considering Rice. Duckworth is far and away the best choice and I’ve thought this from the start. I’m losing hope at this point, though.
Because Biden got the nomination. There were so many more progressive candidates and we ended up with Biden. Perhaps he can help unite the party and move it left in increments.
#TheFive ...as being an excellent choice. Attention: USA , right and left, whoever this candidate may very well be the next President , especially if 78  yr old Joe Biden keels over with a heart attack after giving up his 5 minutes too many times during his debates with Trump.. .
Biden leads. Biden is sane. Biden knows what suffering is.
What's amazing about Joe Biden is, in almost every story about him and his dealings with other people his profound sense of decency and humanity always shines through.
Great  news Stay safe your state his high covid cases repug  governors  guess Lmao charlie baker is voting biden . So is  bush family tons repugs colin powell, James  comey, robert mueller
Don't believe any POLLS....just keep going forward...I'm in Fla and the old white folks here are scared to death of Biden and the black rioters the watch FOX all day
I knew it was coming but I'm still pretty fucking devastated...my second wish for 2020 was a Trump/Biden debate 😭
Biden doesn’t need to debate. Just let the moron give his daily coronavirus screed. He’ll get Biden elected
I think Joe wins without debates. Trump has to have debates to have any chance. Biden should insist no tax returns no debates! #taxreturns
Is Joe Biden still alive?
You can trust the guy whos been in government for 40+ years (8 of them as vice) and basically did nothing to improve it...  -Biden 2020

hi am blue in Fla...don't know any women for Biden...argh
WHEN Biden wins and is declared the winner on thec4th of November the secret service and military need to be ready to haul #TraitorTrump out and install Pence until January. tRUMP needs to be lockedxaway until charges from NY let him be jailed.
should not feel remorse. Politicians don't have to be perfect. They have to be able to answer for what they have and will do.
They actually we're saying that Trump never has laid out a plan,   WTF world do these cartoon character s live in, as the alternate reality of Biden speaking about all the programs, and big plans he would change to save his Version of USA!  OMG!  One Debate would destroy Biden!
Did anybody really listen to "Meet the Press" yesterday!  What reality do these people live in!  Where do they find them!  Who writes their talking points!  This is the craziest thing that they are even talking about a Candidate( Biden) that we never see! Homecare?
How can anybody talk about Biden with a straight face!  This pandemic would be the only way the "Network" movie board could stay in power, with one Earthly Lord that is "Greed" in the Flesh! Joe Biden hides, with no policy! None! Biden talks about real problems "Homecare"?Loser
All the Warren stans (me) and khive people fighting each other about who should be vp while Biden picks Susan Rice❤️
It s a set up , fir steakhouse Ng the election, so they can say that Biden was ahead the whole time! Reagan and Clinton won their second terms from start to finish, and listening to these *Meet the Press" liars and deceivers makes me want to p...s on journalists!
Who believes that Biden is up by 12 points in the many, many polls!  Barf!  Anyone that doesn't know that the scam us in, and anyone voting for the stumbling, rumbling Biden, make me sick in my stomach by the bullcrap News Polling showing Biden with sizable lead
I believe his intentions on China are very clear. He wants to finish the work Obama was doing which is why China made Biden their runner. The rest tho.... 😂
On November 3, 2020, I will be a BIDEN voting ”liberal leftist.” #VoteTrumpOut
In hindsight, the biggest problem with HRC in 2016 was that the Republicans against trump could not get behind her to defeat him. Biden doesn't share that weakness.
Well, it is nice of her to get it ready for the Biden’s. 😂🤣
Joe Biden agreed to a woman VP. Now, it's a black woman. Everyone need to leave Biden alone and allow him to select the person he will be able to work with to restore America.
John McLaughlin being Trump's most trusted pollster makes me wanna congratulate Biden already
A step up from a flaming hot asshole still means you get burned.  In addition to legalization &amp; releasing nonviolent prisoners, Biden must redirect a lot of that police war chest to rehab ctrs, halfway houses, &amp; community officers trained in de-escalation. #CriminalJusticeReform
I know, it’s so sad to see Biden making shit up like when he said the NAACP has always endorsed him.
People I love have died of treatable medical conditions for lack of ability to pay exorbitant sums of money, which is a situation that Biden and Biden voters are fine with perpetuating.
Biden's a few points ahead, but that chart is scary, after 3 years of probably a hundred crimes, abuses, and graft by Trump to be only a few points ahead of him I am utterly amazed PLEASE VOTE!!!!!!! OUR COUNTRY COULD NOT STAND ANOTHER 4 YEARS
Really?  Joe Biden was asked what HE would have done differently from  with regards to #covid19.  The six things he mentioned were ALL done by President Trump and his Administration over the last few months.  EVERY ONE OF THEM!  Eat your failure!  Blame #GOVERNORS
He definitely has a chance. Anyone who would vote for a diminished Biden will vote for anything
Biden can RUN but he cant hide...  Oh wait CARL GIVES him a pass  WHY? because Carl us a sore loser
Will there be a provision fir Biden’s team to take over the COVID19 response immediately after the election due to the extraordinary circumstances? It would also signal to trump he needs to vacate.
Is that a picture of one of Biden's policy advisors? He would fit right in with Larry Summers, Jamie Dimon, and Rahm Emanuel.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Biden and his cronies can't afford to display his utter incompetence on that show. People thought Trump was bad? If they put Biden on, the whole country will lose faith in the two-party system.
and to make it worse a lot of people actually think that Biden supports M4A, just like they think he will close the child prisons
Biden needs to be in a nursing home and you will never be president mrs Clinton
We want Biden to win. Warren would be a mistake.
Don’t you think the republicans are cringing as Joe Biden has virtually every halftime Super Bowl, Academy Award winner, scientists and Pulitzer Prize winners humping for him
Biden is you great white hope!  enough said. bye losers
Biden is the biggest criminal ever &amp; a sexual predator. He apologized on tv 4 invading woman’s spaces, said times hv changed, no they haven’t MF, it’s just woman r talking about it! The stupid idiot was even going to prosecute a 3 star General 4 the “Logan Act”! He’s a f-ing cree
Would Stephen King, Obama, Biden, Schumer, Clinton, the Cuomo twins, de Blasio, Newsome, Schiff, and Lightfoot (I know she’s a women, but she’s oh so butch) be dead also?
People like you that spread lies about innocent men should be prosecuted, that’s very dangerous! Now why don’t u talk about Tera Reade who Biden sexually assaulted, she reported to Congress, but they said they won’t release the papers! Her mother even called Into Larry king
yeah, vote fort racist Biden, you must be black enough
Biden isn't going to close the child prisons. You should research your candidate.
Biden opposes an eviction moratorium.
I see no reason to believe that Biden's administration will be any different than Biden's campaign or his career; it will focus on defeating any and all leftist goals.  That's why Biden has to lose.
How do we know Ronna is lying? Her lips are moving!
They also need to be better at getting the message out. I hear more about Biden moving left from conservatives pushing red scare tactics than I do from left &amp; liberal spaces.
That is because Biden is Obsequious, the Dems. Are raising money for the lobotomy, or doesn't obama care pay for that.
If #Biden/#Marxists win election, we will never have fair-ish elections again. The leaders of the left are now VERY RADICALIZED.💔  💖 You're a nice person, we need people like you to recognize the danger of a recycled "National Socialist Party." This is NOT old #Democrat party.!
Same. Once again, we have no choice. Once again, we're informed we must "fall in line", and then we'll be allowed to "push Biden left", as if that's ever going to happen--he himself has said it won't! You can see why people lose hope.
Just Google "Occupy protests". Google "Ferguson protests" &amp; "Black Lives Matter protests".  All took place when Biden was VP.  That's how a Biden admin *did* respond, then. He has said nothing to indicate he'd do things differently.
He'll try. He already claimed that Obama and Biden stopped testing too soon.
Wow, more ammo for the Biden campaign.

Although it is a waste of money now I’m sure when Jill Biden is First Lady she can undo whatever Melania did
You are a hero. I hope you get your friends and family back at some point after they are deprogrammed. 😔 I have MAGA family too and it is heartbreaking to see them like this. I hope after Biden is elected things settle down.
Me when I remember Joe Biden is gonna announce his VP pick this week
I always found it suspect that Biden was pushed as the frontrunner before he even announced.  Biden was the one Trump already knew he'd be facing--hence his whole Ukraine scheme long before Biden announced.  Hard not to regard the whole Dem primary process as bullish*t theatre.
Lol he didn't appreciate me calling him illiterate one time when he was going on an...well...an illiterate rant against Soledad O'Brien. Dude is a nut case. And I happen to know from lots of professional contacts that he's always been a world class prick at work.
Why he is supporting Biden. He should stay with Cali. The land of the lost
1.  is repeating a zombie lie here. An easily disproven one.  2. Bernie more than held up his end. What more does she--or anyone--expect him to do when BIDEN HIMSELF will not commit to any policies that are important to young voters?  They already know "Orange Man Bad".
They did not make a statement about Biden; they made it clear that they are as cruel and evil as the original nazi murderers.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It’s called AFFH Affirnatively Further Fair Housing. Obama and Biden thought this up and put in practice. President Trump jus wiped it out but if Biden wins he’ll reinstate it. If you love living in the suburbs think twice before you vote Blue.

Can we get that in writing coz I’m looking for a reason to vote for biden.
you are a dangerous politician! Someone that spreads lies only because you don’t like  Talking  about a playboy past! But u don’t talk about Biden raping Tera Reade! She reported, release the papers from congress! The truth is there! U r a hypocrite! #sad

From a person, people &amp; newspaper to mk a big deal about changing their mind! I’ve seen Biden change his stance several times, just like defunding the PO! So this isn’t something I care to even bate Over, so silly
Easy one. Joe Biden. Only because in his senile state there’s a decent chance he randomly yells at someone that they’re not a real libertarian.

I'm in St. Petersburg FL., and I have not seen one of anything Biden = no t-shirt, no bumpersticker, no sign of any kind !!! And we have a worthless Democratic Mayor.  I'm pretty sure we have a lot of GOP voters here.
I agree Joe if biden wins America is screwed
The GOP has become a number of factions each with their own priorities but in general the establishment gets the final say.  But the Dem party has overwhelmingly gone far left with prominent members saying if you don't go along you are out in the cold.  Need I list Biden quotes?
Oh you mean like how you liberals worship biden
Even in a best case scenario where Biden is the 1st Prez since Dubya in 02 to come into a midterm popular, the Economy is rocking, and Dems don't see a bad midterm (Basically 98 all over again) its hard to see how a guy who does well w/ Trump hating Latinos in the state loses

No, he is thinking that when he refuses to leave the White House after he loses the election nobody will be able to come in and get him. Biden said he would use the military if need be to get him out so that fence is useless.

Why, Biden is raising money of Obummer.
Question Claire.. How can Trump run an obviously misleading ad that says Biden is for defunding police and get away with it?  Isn’t it illegal to do that and say you approve this message?
Barack Obama was The worst presidents this country ever had criminal spying on an opposition campaign by Obama and Biden they should be prosecuted

Biden hat brain surgery TWICE in 1988. At the time his neurosurgeon gave him 50% chance of full recovery!
Just a thought, can you remember at any time a presidential candidate not going on TV or major speaking engagements before an election? Why is Joe Biden hiding so much?
I think you might want to retake that test or test your campaign advisors. No one believes flipping Joe Biden is a radical left anything. lol

I’m still pissed that Joe Biden had the audacity to say that Trump is the first racist president. Just so he knows, if any of us vote for him it’s because we we loathe Donald Trump but we have our eyes on him. 🤦🏾‍♀️
If you’re a so-called media expert, then you would know that the minute Biden names her to the ticket, Trumps people put out a flood of commercials with her questioning Biden’s mental capacity during the Democratic primary debates. She cannot be the choice for VP. period.
Anti trump Republicans taking over the Dem party is a good thing...if they help Biden win, we get rid of trump AND destroy the establishment Dem party at the  same time...then in 2024 we elect AOC president  😊

Well if it’s true so what. I’d really like to vote for Bernie, but since I hate trump with every molecule 🧬 of my being, I’m voting for Biden. Get that monster out of the office first, then find better candidates next.
Most of the arguments against Biden are arguments against the system.  So change the system.  If you burn it down you have NO IDEA what could rise up to replace it.  And looking at the #fascist state of the #gop these days I've got a good idea what's rising up. And it's WORSE

Biden has to have questions in advance so his writers can give him answers.  Same with debates. He will not debate Trump normally will use Covid as excuse
"We have enough tests IF we use them in the right way". In other words there isn't enough testing capacity. Why is the rest of the world getting back to normal, yet we can't we mitigate the spread, so we CAN get back to normal. If Biden gets elected that's on you

Bernie had his shot. There are a handful of AOCs. Slow progress is coming. This election is a chance for real chance to change. And for the change to come, you have to get much of the dirty$$$ we have now in politics. Biden and a Dem congress can do that. Then we have a chance

So what? That is a state level deal. Beat Trump first. Restore the rule of law, corruption, corrupt judges, first. Then get piddling issues like that. NO ONE has had a more progressive platform than he does. Bernie signed good agreements with him. Beat Trump. Biden is key.
And don't lose sight this is a moderate country overall. Biden got twice as many votes as Bernie.
I disagree. If push comes to shove, they'll gladly give up their seats to run for President if it means stopping Biden and the radical Left from taking power.

It is a false dichotomy to assume opposing Trump is support of Biden. A legitimate answer is “neither”.There was a CNN story today that the Biden aides said the VP announcement was pushed back till appx the 10th now, when they had said around the 1st for a while now.   Is this why?  Were they leaning to Bass?

Trump has a 42.8% approval rating. He trails Biden by 8.4% on average in the polls nationally. Finally Trump trails Biden by 7.2% on average in Florida. I'm surprised that given 150,000 deaths so far due to Trump's mishandling of the pandemic his numbers aren't lower.
Showing your power? Hell you are just showing that you’re an idiot. You will make Humpy Dumpy a dictator if you don’t vote for Biden. And the worst part is that you will never be able to vote in a presidential election again. THERE WON’T BE A NEED FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION!

Actually Biden has a long history of being a nudist.  He always went swimming in the buff in the pool at the VP residence (despite female SS agents being "assigned").  With his dementia, I can see it now.  He'd wander out of the private quarters in the WH to greet child tourists.

i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
She’s senile along with Biden
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left 😂
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)
“The language very closely echoes recommendations released earlier this month by criminal justice reform task force that Biden and former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) organized.”
Agree!  We’ll deserved and we should make sure President Biden does it!
Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden  #FoxNews
Vote for Biden and give him the Senate and those pulling his strings will have us as East Germany in a year.  You will wake up too late and not be happy.  But, too late.  How do you not see this?
Rep. Bass: Hoping U.S. can hang on until Biden wins presidency  via
Betting Odds for Presidency   Jan 29: Trump -150 / Biden +543  Today: Biden -175 / Trump +151
He’s soo Weak - just like Biden and the Worthless Democrats
Biden did have a boat parade.
Biden is going to win. Republicans are going to make it happen let's not forget the majority of the people who voted for him in 2016 are never Trumpers and people who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters focus on Biden and the American people focus on Trump
If Biden wins, he will be the 3rd Democratic President in a row that has had to go in and clean up a huge Republican economic mess.
Went to the beach 3 years ago n still got sand on my nuts lol I hate Joe Biden
Posted some "pedophilia bad" on my story, now the liberals gon swipe up talmbout "yeah but still vote biden" Bitch ain't noone said his name But fuck that nigga tho
Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Trump supporters stay attacking Biden and this is why Trump is going to lose the election. it's the  people vs Trump, not Biden it's the millions of people who voted for Trump at the last minute, who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton Biden is going to win
Y’all stay attacking Biden this is why Trump is going to lose the election. its the millions of people who voted trump in 2016 who won't vote for him again. It's the millions of Republicans who are sick and tired of trump lies and what he's doing to this country Biden is wining
Then do it and stop procrastinating! Vote trump! No commie nadler Schiff warren s Biden’s et al .
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020
...whatever "progressive" is supposed to mean now.  Bernie Sanders is not a "progressive". Joe Biden is not a "progressive".
98 days to go! 16.5M+ cases &amp; 655k+ deaths globally, 4.3M+ cases &amp; 148k+ deaths in US, Don Jr’s twitter limited over misinformation, AG Barr testifying before Judiciary Cmte, 20 Days till DNC &amp; 27 till RNC, Biden rumored you pick VP soon SC Senate race tied. #ResistOn🇺🇸
I think he googled "fake name that's not Biden"
He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.
If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I’m sure your going to talk about Biden. What the hell do you know about this man. This is only your opinions and you have some nerve disparaging him with your bowl of sh- - remark.  No class lady.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!
You want to fix the problems of America &amp; Foreign affairs. Joe Biden needs an all women cabinet!!! Kamala Harris Stacy Abrams AOC Susan Rice Elizabeth Warren Val Demings Keisha Lance Bottoms Muriel Bowser Lori Lightfoot Veronica Escobar Jenny Durkan  Gretchen Whitmer Karen Bass
Poll this AM shows Biden up only Three Points in Florida! Come on people! What do you need? He and his sycophant Governor and Senators are killing your friends and family, they want to reduce your social security and Medicare, etc. etc.  use your heads!
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.
Biden - you will suck up to anything in order to appease the needy so that you can get elected and then you’ll do NOTHING
Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let’s not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn’t get into office? Let’s not have that again. Time to rally people!
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.
Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
Call it the Joe Biden “enthusiasm gap.”  And this is from someone getting paid by Biden.  Polls? Right.  Wait until TRUMP clobbers him. 😬
We don’t need to see Biden being interviewed. It’s more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
- this lady speaking about Biden is so wet behind the ears - She is right about 1 thing - BUDEN is going to need a smart VP because he is totally incompetent- Senile to the MAX
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. 🤔
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020
I am about to make a prediction and you saw it here first. IF Biden picks Harris he will lose to Trump because as open minded as the dems think they are will NOT put another black person anywhere near the presidency.
Joe Biden....this is yo boy. Bad look....
And I'm proud to endorse you for Biden's SECRETARY of STATE! We need to clean up the mess Trump &amp; Pompeo have made of our international relations, which is just as critical as our domestic affairs.
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there
Why bother?  Leave it for Jill Biden!
Of course not. Biden is Lambchop. The only question is to find out who is playing the political role of Sherry Lewis.
we'll ask president biden to look into it...
Trump special, West special, Biden ordinary #vision2020

“Trump is weak, Trump is not conservative,” Barkhuff said. “But he’s the most easily fixable problem in America today. A vote for Joe Biden in this election is a vote for our Constitution.”
Biden found time to coach his late  son Beau's baseball team when he was a commuting senator!! Can you imagine Trump doing that??!!
Biden can't talk his way out of a paper bag! I'm terrified that Biden is going to possibly get another chance to implement Osama Obama's failed, self serving, America destroying policies! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Been asking that since you became President. I guess we will have to wait until Biden takes over and the real investigations of your corruption begin.
Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS

Omg.  As Biden would say, that’s a bunch of malarkey.  🙄
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can’t let Biden win
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.

Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live

Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar

Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. 🙂
Great. Let’s bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that—just until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.

The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.

No, it was 47-43 Biden.
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
they may be!! Try Eleven Million of us Tax Payers Dollars to buy a House with? I'm not very nice when I work "Hard So They Don't Have To!" Share the Love as said! This never happened. Biden is a Black Obomba as stated in his so-what-thought!I I refuse to be taken again!

Answer to If both Biden and Trump contracted and died from Coronavirus before November what would happen to the 2020 Presidential Election? (I’m not being political in this question, just curious how the American system would deal such … by Channing Taylo
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.”
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.

#DefundThePolice combined  #YouAintBlack #youainthispanic will reap 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #democratsfortrump  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  But dont tell #woodywoodpecker #biden to stop making gaffes...
You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
We should let you guys do the negative spots while Biden does spots about how he's gonna fix what Trump broke.
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done

Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
Brain Dead Biden
Joe Biden kissing a 14 year old student on the lips....Is this the action of a man that should be President if the  United States?

most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‘Delay the Election’ Tweet, Even Though He Can’t Do It
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.

Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy’s portrait in? I’m suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.

Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.

Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.

Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don’t think that is really Biden.
If there’s a “red wave” in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters

I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.

I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
Must be a Joe Biden supporter

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden’s choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!

A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, “Stupid” too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.

Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
I'm not buying this... Biden won't run for a second term so the VP is the de facto 2024 candidate. You're gaslighting.
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn’t want him as vp
Someone’s having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States 😂
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I thought It was rice, but now I think it’s Harris. U don’t leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.

Dude, I think she’s the pick. Why would they leak if she’s not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden “smells” children? C’mon... look at our country today!! We couldn’t take much more of all this winning!
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn’t happen under Obama/Biden. It won’t happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
I'm HOPING she will!  Biden is a corporate toady - but so is she, so....

To my friends who follow politics, did you watch the Joe Biden press conference yesterday? Did you listen to the questions by the #MSM (or whoever these people were)?  Were the questions tough?  This was journalistic malpractice and if you don’t agree with, #ReclaimingMyTime
Joe Biden’s plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
Biden is an ordinary professional politician, and Donald Trump's Presidency has seemed to last so long that his ordinariness seems exotic.
Joe Biden would’ve had a heart attack yesterday in AG bar’s seat
It quotes Biden.
Many dumbocruts are silently worried about Biden’s mental health.  He cannot form a sentence any longer.  Why has his constant cognitive test results not issued?  Any presidential candidate had to release their health records from Walter reed hospital.  Where is it?????
Joe Biden's Notes Suggest Kamala Harris May Be His VP Pick
Not a prayer.  Ruthie has what, 90 days? We need a CONSERVATIVE Justice to offset Roberts. Lifetime appt. 6-3 for 30 years.  Gonna get THAT w Senile Joe Biden?
I have 2 daughters. Trust me, there is a difference between the innocent actions of Trump in these pictures and creepy Joe Biden. I'd let Trump around my daughters. Not Biden... Not ever!
I can see Biden/Ocasio
😂I was just mocking the people who call Biden that.
You are  president only for your base! You don’t care about the majority of this country! And Joe Biden does.
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows
Funny Democrats forget China allowed it to leave their country with the WHO’ s help.. funny Biden won’t say a bad word about China doing so, funny Bill Gates met w/ Xi several days before his Ted talk about Covid - Democrats aren’t Funny they are killers!
Biden continues to spend in the six core battleground states.
So you support Biden now. Cool
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock’s head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It’s fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
We need to reclaim these past 4 years. Biden 2020!
It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
I’m not even sure of a virtual debate at this point. I didn’t realize how bad Biden is it’s embarrasing that this was the best Dems could do after 4 years.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
I absolutely believe this... I worry what Trump &amp; Barr will do the days after he loses (if we vote)&amp; Biden takes office! Trump will sabotage the country &amp; no telling what else.... but regardless, Trump &amp; his Administration will pay for every crime committed &amp; ever dime grifted!!
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
With Kamala Harris making media rounds, I think we have our VP-I’m excited! if so, she’s intelligent, tough &amp; capable!! She &amp; Rice were my top two..... 'Do not hold grudges': Biden's notes reveal several talking points about Kamala Harris  via
Seriously, DT went on TV and endorsed the Houston Dr that believes the answer to COVID lies in the aliens that descend on us during the night and have sex with us for DNA?  And you dont think its time to invoke the 25th?  His mind is gone. We need YOU, VP Biden. BIDEN / HARRIS !!
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I’d pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Get your head around this! Biden’s clueless!
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says “make your voice heard”. They’re very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Looking for BIG help to get this piece auctioned off so I can donate all of the money to the Biden Campaign!        WHO CAN HELP Me? #VoteHimOut2020
“Private militia.” Lol! Joe Biden is literally using Antifa lexicon.
Biden wants to kill an economic gold mine
Yo, Biden against violence!
Mad at Biden for holding a grudge when  anything you are the one holding a grudge over some comments that don’t even matter anymore lol.
Lmao like dog whistles matter when Biden has one of the most advanced racial equality plans of any democratic nominee ever. Biden is not a racist.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)Biden said he was planning to choose a woman so no.
Biden plan $2 trillion into green infrastructure and energy $775 Billion Plan to Help Working Parents and Caregivers $700 billion manufacturing&amp; research trump's plan mail in ballots a hoax storm troopers , keep POC from the burbs  hate,division and whining like a baby sad Ronna
Kimberly, a President Biden is inevitable.
Senator Feinstein, I do not understand what you mean when you say "China is growing into a Respectable Nation." China is stealing everything they can from us. In return they give us the Wuhan virus. I fail to call that "Respectable!" Are you tracking Biden? I sure hope not.
And Biden hasn’t been arrested once yet!
A vote for one who cannot win is a wasted vote. I prefer the lesser of two evils. Not saying Biden could possibly be worse than the thing in there now.
Tucker Carlson exposing Biden VP choices.  via
Just vote out all the old guard republicans. After many many elections you learn how it all works. There are hundreds of millions of opinions and ours are each only one. There are 2 real choices as of now. For Biden or for Trump, against Biden is for Trump. Help stop madness.
Bernie can't win. I wish he or another candidate could but again a vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. Plain and simple. I have wasted votes before, not this time. It is imperative we get this one gone from the office.  Your freedom and future depend on it.
A vote against Biden is a vote for Trump. That is the sad fuc-- ng truth we have to face. I am not wasting a vote on one who cannot win. It is what it it is.
Biden all the way!
Biden will not pick anyone! Kamala or otherwise. He will announce his VP, not choose one. What would be funny is that if the choice was A and he announced B. He has no clue what’s happening.
Unfortunately he'll vote for Biden in November.
Records proving Amb Yovanovitch perjured herself at least twice Doc’s showing she was denying visas to witnesses who could prove Biden &amp; Dem corruption.
Clear doc proof of money laundering by Burisma &amp; Biden’s. How about that … it looks like this whole thing is about to blow up in their faces. Watch for Cyprus to become a huge hub and part of this story so far we have only scratched the tip of the iceberg
What's going on with Biden? Is this a sure sign of Dementia? One of the signs is impaired reasoning according to the medical definition. If he wins in Nov he'll have the nuke codes. Scary thought.
The harder thing than the hearing is watching Biden try to answer softball questions from reporters. Sad
I hope that next year President Biden presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Dr. Fauci &amp; a LONG-OVERDUE one to Gary Sinise for all of the excellent work he does with/for our veterans!
Save your energy, Malaria, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE THAT MUCH LONGER;  let Jill Biden exhibit HER genuine good taste &amp; class throughout the White House &amp; the grounds instead!
Those in power are scared that this would scare potential voters, even though the statistics support cannabis law change. We will see what happens, I heard Biden supports the medical use. De scheduling Federally and giving the medical legitimacy back is a start.
Democrats show him the play book  that Barack Obama and Joe Biden leaves show the American people the truth Barack Obama Leave the American people with enough supplies Donald Trump sold them to his Allied countries Democrats need to show proof I’m sick of lies
Nahh. Gym Jordan’s video clinched it for Biden.
Sad to say I haven’t voted in many years but having to deal with trump I will NEVER miss another opportunity. Biden 2020
So you don’t want Kamala because a white man can’t keep his mouth shut?! lol You make no sense. Just be honest about it, you don’t want Kamala. Biden is to blame for ALL of this. He should have announced his VP pick already. Dragging this out is not benefiting him.
November 3rd, I am voting for Biden, to do just that.
A safe bet, Miss SEC. There is no way on earth Biden’s people will let him go on stage to debate Trump or take part in another unscripted interview, regardless of how friendly the interviewer would be.  He can’t even take questions at his pressers.
Yeah, voting for Biden would be a good start.
They just want to give President Biden an even BIGGER mess to clean up----like he won't have enough already!  Do everything possible to make sure we have a DEMOCRATIC Senate AND House after November; start by getting rid of McConnell, Graham and Collins!!
Top CEOs ramp up GOP donations as Biden threatens to scale back corporate tax cuts
Sharpton: ‘If they (Biden campaign) are enticed by the polls it could be to their detriment’
Biden would be sniffing and groping the women and children.
One.  But does that really matter?  We should all know that Biden is a placeholder only.  We should also all know that they will do anything to get power back including stuffing ballot boxes and using machines that only mark votes for one candidate no matter who you picked.
She had better do it quickly,  because in January Dr. Jill Biden will be moving in &amp; she may have different plans!
Biden is a COWARD!
Biden is a COWARD!
Biden is a COWARD!
Imagine their behaviour into the morning hours of 11/4/2020, when Biden makes his concession speech!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.                                                                                    DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No. As much as I trust Trump, what would your answer be if Biden or Obama was the President?
Looks like all the Biden supporters came out.
Joe Biden said he can’t be black
However in the world of Old Sleepy Joe Biden, “We like truth over facts”… Detective Friday in the old Dragnet TV Show, ” Just the facts Mam, just the facts”…
Joe Biden is already in bed with China if he gets elected all they have to do is fluff his pillow. He's been taking bribes out of China in the Millions of $ for years.  He has put China ahead of his own country. People are so brainwashed that they would vote for this Criminal.
Of course. If you don’t vote Biden, you’re voting for trump.
Biden on Obama...the first clean black guy  I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,” he said. “I mean, that’s a storybook, man.”
Look at what the alternative is (I mean philosophy - not Biden).
...and you think Biden could have done a better job controlling COVID-19? He called Trump all sorts of bad names when he shut the Chinese planes bringing more Chinese into America. Yeah, he would do great . . . or maybe you could have done better - NOT.
Can't wait for POTUS Joe Biden
Biden should ease up on that Trump is a racist stuff. Has shown a number of instances of being a racist. At some point Trump is going to throw that in his face. Then you know what he'll do, he'll lie. That's what liberal Democrats do they lie.
I try to make fun of these ridiculous people and things. These subjects are very serious to me. If Joe Biden was selected it would scare me. They would pull him like a marionette to pass every socialist bill they could.
Hogwash! The reason they are dragging their feet is in itself political, to help Joe Biden. They can't make a political criminal investigation a non political indictment. These is an excuse that every America must reject. We want Justice #Durham #AGBarr
You know what people are calling Trump a racist a white supremacist. They haven't shown One Clip with him saying anything racist. There is plenty with Joe Biden showing his racism though. If Trump said those things, they'd be screaming it from the rafters.
I live 57 years and up until I never heard of anybody saying nasty comments about somebody having a political bumper sticker. I w never to somebody with a Biden sticker. I personally deplore him. I guess you can't have free speech unless you agree with them.
I'm a diabetic and I take insulin. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, some points in my life I had to choose not to eat or take insulin an live. What Donald Trump did today I was so choked up I almost cried. Obama and Joe Biden got rich off these drug companies. Their garbage.
I figured out what Joe Biden's platform is. He's going for their ignorant, uninformed, CNN and brainwashed audience. He hasn't said one thing that a normal American would want to hear in a presidential candidate. He should run as a Socialist Communist at least that is honest.
The scary part is that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what a disgusting individual Joe Biden is.
CORRUPTION...OBAMA-BIDEN era Beat all Time Records The Hell you Talking About Fool!
Not even close to accurate here in Florida. I see Trump signs everywhere and never see Biden signs.
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ one more person Joe Biden can pick for VP!! She’s gangster ! #RSMS
You know what I was thinking, Joe Biden is a broken down politician. I can't understand how anybody in their right mind could vote for him. Just because you hate Trump isn't a illegitimate reason. Hating is no reason to vote. Some people don't even know why they hate Trump.
I heard show Biden made a mistake the other day he said a nurse was blowing up his nose. He meant he was snorting blow up his nose.
8 yrs Obama and Biden worked tirelessly but were blocked often by republican obstructionism. They have a good relationship. You cant keep staff. You have so many leaks. They talk behind your back at how nuts you are. The petulant tantrum thrower. Obama/Biden zero scandals.
Safe R to Likely R... Nice. Expect more changes between now and November 3rd! #Thripp2020 #FL6 #FL06 #RidinWithBiden2020
I live in Central Florida, the I-4 corridor. Biden is BIG here!
I will not vote for Biden either, unless I die between now and November, of course. But I anyways have a choice. God gives it to me.
Is she mentally sick like Biden? What is scary is that if anything happened to both Trump and Pence, Pelosi is next in line for the Presidency. VERY SCARY!
I believe that President BIDEN (God I love the sound of that!) may have to call in the National Guard to BODILY remove FORMER President Trump from the W.H.;  if that happens, I hope that EVERY 🌎 news outlet carries it LIVE!
Do you understand that the government is trying to defund our police officers which the democrat governments  will do you’ll see if you vote for Joe Biden
3rd. Third in line. Not second. She's been talking to Biden too much.
You’re no better than Biden. I can’t believe you voted to take the statues down in the Capitol. You’re a real piece of work and I hope Texans give you the boot.
You know it Jimmy you wuss. Something has to be done, Biden wont do it. Just in case it needs to be done in a hurry. Whine and cry, cry and whine, you are at your best when you do.
One of my best friends was a fireman. He was killed inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. And Joe Biden says he wants to teach Islam in our Public Schools. That's one of the most disgraceful things I ever heard. They don't even want to do the Pledge of Allegiance.
I wish you thought about our National Health Crisis even half as much as you think about Obama &amp; Biden. My Lord you’re insufferable. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trumps America feeds on hate and division as well as fear. Don't be scared, before this leader America was never intimidated by their president. Joe Biden will ease the angst created by Trump, who failed the citizens and allowed many to die before their time. Vote Trump out.
How can people call this Biden’s America? Like it’s happening right now in Portland, and it’s starting in several other cities. We might be on different ends of the political spectrum, but if you stand up for your rights then this shouldn’t sit right with you.
You must be referring to Biden.
Ya Hiden Biden would do so much better..You sir are a fool.Biden’s ‘Gun Violence Epidemic’ Plan is a Blueprint for Civilian Disarmament - The Truth About Guns
Yea, #Biden everything you &amp; Obama did you wouldn't want #Americans to know abt. Hillary selling uranium; Iran being given cash; your son using ur position for personal gain, etc. etc., etc  #ThePeoplesPresident keeps us informed daily.
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‘conspiracy theories’ about Biden   ELIOT! Phone home. What a total POS liar democrats are.
sounds like she just had an epiphany. This is why thousands hv #WalkAwayFromDemocrats bc they hv woken up to his "Change" agenda to mk #America communist, and #Biden will let him complete his Soros agenda.
Biden’s ‘Gun Violence Epidemic’ Plan is a Blueprint for Civilian Disarmament - The Truth About Guns   America will NOT allow democrats to destroy the US Constitution. Especially not communist democrats. NEVER!!!
Who does he think will pardon him? Joe Biden certainly has made it clear he will not be involved in a pardon. All trumps cronies will be gone and he can’t pardon himself. Quite a mess he’s gotten himself into. And he deserves every moment of anxiety.
No I subscribe to Dr. Emmanuel who #Biden said was a "crazy woman" bc she's healed many with #hydroxychloriquineworks
Learned this morn that the eye drops the dr just gave me were Made In China.  #WakeUpAmerica China is not our friend &amp; neither is #Biden.
CLOWARD PIVENS Strategy - #Biden supporters need #wakeupcall
The WH and West Wing will be renovated by the new president. Biden certainly wants to get rid of all the gold plated fixtures, gold drapes, etc. That money needs to go to help the homeless, the hungry, the sick and more important things than remodeling.
Biden just locked up California. Clever selection.
#MAGA #KAG2020 #Patriots Biden's plan to "transform #America"put in place by Obama to destroy suburbs. AFFH Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (view Life, Liberty &amp; Levin fm 7/26 w/Stanley Kurtz) This Rule in Fair Housing Act must be cancelled. #VoteRed2020
You are kiddin right? If any #American who believes in  #1A and #2A doesn't vote for Trump, this country is forever lost as we know it. Hope you listened to Mark Levin this week &amp; what Biden meant when he said "transform America" attacking local rights in suburbs.
Nadler only says that because he wants to undermine our President. He'd be marching to a different tune if Biden was in the White house.
The republicans are busy postering for positions in the event Biden wins. They are underestimating the American people. We know who they are and we can’t vote them out along with the Pelosi puppet parade.
A person with a narcissistic personality, like trump, cannot be humiliated. When it gets to that point, he will say he didn’t want to win anyway. He rigged the election for a Biden win, so his base will never accept Biden as legitimate on his own.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause  #Russia, #China and #Iran are already #interfering in #Election2020, hoping that #Biden and the #RadicalLeft win.  Probably #NorthKorea and maybe even #Andorra. And I want the #USA to be just like those countries.  #FakeNews #JK   Is that what YOU want?
I hope they ask Joe Biden. He looks way cooler.
Is Joe Biden a myth?
Impeachment witness urges Burisma probe, testifies to concern of Hunter Biden ‘conflict’
One of the petty things of trump is refusing to hang the portrait of President Obama. I read where it was placed in a small room. This pisses me off. I hope Biden takes Trump’s portrait out to the dumpster. But Joe isn’t petty.
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   Democrats killed the seniors.
Joe Biden said: if you vote for Trump, you ain't black, so IF YOU DON'T  RESPECT THE FLAG AND THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU AIN'T AMERICAN. RIGHT UNCLE JOE.?
You damn right they met their match. Our president is NOT owned by anyone. Not China not Russia. That’s a lot more than you can say for Biden, Pelosi, Schumer DNC they have all been in bed w/ China/Russia for years &amp; sold the USA To the highest bidder.
Biden's statement... Could he have meant "Trance" Form the Nation? Feels like were in the midst of it right now by the #Democrats.
I beg to differ Amy, 4 people standing on a street corner holding biden flags does NOT represent Florida 🤦‍♀️   ❤️🇺🇸👮‍♀️💯  #Trump2020
#Fauci's #FirstPitch:    #Pelosi, #Schiff, #Schumer, #Biden, #AOC, #Warren, #Kamala, #Brennan, #Clapper and the rest of their #ilk all called it a #strike.
Of course she is.. she’s from Chicago and has probably been promised a cushy job if Biden wins.
Is a vote for Biden a vote for a shadow government ?
Sad to see a man who served his party for 44 years thrown to the dogs without a care for him or his family. Biden is incapable of the job President of the United States. Democrats should be ashamed!
Biden: Burisma: Flynn: ObamaGate. The dirty dem corruptions never discussed on MSM
And where is the leadershio from Biden, he is incoherent after 2 minutes at the mike. Then tells us that was not the order of questions to be asked. You call that leadership? 130 million deaths from Covit-another fact no one seemed to dispute. Face it you have  a sad, old man.
The last time they spoke Biden forgot Wallace's name. In order to get through this "interview " Wallace will have to go real easy on Joe. If he doesn't Biden will implode and I'm sure that's not what Wallace wants.
I think we haven’t seen Hunter Biden, because he’s in the midst of a cognitive test and he’s forgotten where he is. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree 😂
Civil rights attorney blasts Biden for 'insulting' African Americans: 'I'm Black and I'm not voting for him'
Use $$$ to reveal to #America how corrupt a Communist puppet Biden is...  oh, and did I mention pathological liar. #Joementia
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver donated maximum amount to Biden campaign | Fox Business And anyone thinks this is a surprise?
That's a lame excuse to give up on #America and all it stands for. Exactly what the socialists using Biden are hoping for. If you love this country you have to love it enough to stand strong &amp; #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Sorry, I don’t believe these polls. Who is actually going to vote for Biden?
Please let him out of the basement - every time Biden opens his mouth another idiotic statement falls
It shouldn’t surprise me the things that come out of Biden’s month.  Every day Biden and the rest of the Socialist Goons continue to spew their ignorance and hatred for our GREAT COUNTRY!Biden sucks.
Um Biden’s vp pick won’t excite me in the least.  He can pick gw bush, Gerald Ford, I don’t care. Biden has no excitement
What happens when u know u don’t want trump but realize joe Biden is no different??
Dem voter, “I can’t name any joe Biden policy except that he will try to fix Obamacare.  He hasn’t explained how.  But it’s imperative we vote for joe.  🤔
Wonder why no one ever asks if there will be violence if Biden were to win?
Do u care that Joe Biden (even with his mental lapses) always represents corporate America’s position instead of a populous position?
Does anyone have a favorite Biden policy?
Name your favorite Joe Biden legislation over the last 30 years.
The problem with Biden, he has a 30 year career of 💩 decisions.  Does anyone believe for 1 second, Biden will make a good vp pick?   Joe will disappoint again.
🤚🤚🤚🌊🌊🌊Blue Wave Vote Biden 2020
Vote Biden in 2020
Are you excited for joe biden?
Joe Biden is a liar.
You need to ask Juan Williams what Joe Biden would do different concerning the Corona virus
Biden’s candidacy has me fu🤬ing defending Hillary.
I never thought Hillary was stupid, or mentally deficient in any way. I disliked her because she was openly corrupt.  She was still a much better candidate than Joe Biden.
Trump destroyed Hillary in their debates.  I’m sure he’ll do the same with Biden.   Biden is not functioning with half of Hillary’s brain power.
Would u have voted  for biden in ‘88 or 2008?
I watched some of Biden today and the cable lost its feed.  I’m not sure this was not deliberate.
This election is not about voting for Joe Biden.  He makes 💩 decisions.   Vote green.
It’s funny GW tried hard to accentuate his “dumbed down” Everyman persona.  Joe Biden tries hard to just appear legitimate.  Maybe joe should just use gw’s style.  🤷‍♂️
Do u think the Biden campaign pays cable news to shill for him?
Your cable network has reduced your channels to two. On one channel is biden, the other trump. Which one do u watch?
I don’t want a trump 2nd term.  But the dnc is forcing it on us with their quack candidate joe biden
You forgot rule 3.  No woman with long hair in the audience or on the tv staff.  We don’t need Biden distracted and only thinking about sniffing hair.
I don’t think Biden can save us.  Given his record.
I have a confession— I want to believe shahid because I dislike Nancy pelosi.  I  want to believe Tara reade because I hate joe Biden.    I absolutely believe dr Ford. I don’t care who the accused is.  I watched her testimony   She’s believable.
Biden and the dnc cheated.
This is a passive aggressive question trying to drum up support for Biden.  By making him look like a victim, even tho he cheated with the dnc.
Are people asking this question because they know the dnc used fraud to elevate joe, and he is illegitimate anyway??  So even if trump loses to Biden, the results are meaningless.  Joe is a fake candidate
Joe Biden just backed out of an interview on Fox with the most fair journalist on that network.  Joe Biden is in trouble.
Name 3 things from Biden’s political career that served the masses.
This is ridiculous!!! Biden should be having debates with President Trump by now... less than 100 days.... get debating show us what you boys have! Biden has Dementia and Trumps got the Presidency.... let’s go 😂😂😂
If joe Biden as president leads a regime change in Venezuela his reasoning will be
If joe Biden wins presidency he will not- Raise taxes on rich Fix healthcare  Fix student loan problem Help Palestine  Implement green new deal Sanction the saudis Get $$ out of politics   Why do we want joe?  So he can sit in his assisted living facility, quietly?
How is biden different than trump?  What would biden change?  Be specific.
To all identity politics dems— feminism is on the ballot in 2020.  If you vote for joe you are doing your part to kill feminism.  Joe Biden is equivalent to Hillary. Only he’s a man.  And unhealthy.  And his mind is shot. And his record is worse than Hillary.
If trump is a bad leader that automatically means joe Biden would be a good leader.   (— is this statement true?
Do watch Scarborough.  He and Mika shill all morning long for Biden.  It’s terrible.
My area sucks.  Totally red.  All this pro Biden polling doesn’t make sense.
If you are a feminist will u be voting for:  A. Biden B. Trump
"I can beat Biden off.." Alrighty, then!
#BidenForFL Florida will not go for Biden.  I live in a very trumpy area.  These trumpers don’t care about trumps response to coronavirus. They hate democrats.
The same journalists who trashed Bernie the entire primary, trash trump daily, and constantly elevate Biden.  If u are a voter msm wants u to vote joe.  Just in case you can’t read between the lines.
Why does msm keep reporting polling 100 days out?  Are they trying to generate Biden voters?  Polling doesn’t mean 💩 this far out.  Joe Biden hasn’t selected a vp.  Biden hasn’t debated yet.
I’ll admit trump is bad, terrible even.  I will also admit that Biden is equally if not worse than trump.
Does anyone think they can move Biden left?
We gave money to Biden what we could afford.  🥰
Do i have a choice? It’s either dementia dictator or Biden
A stutter😂.  I’ve been watching Biden for years.  Way back to his senate days.  Joe is not struggling with a stutter.  Nothing against u bro.  U probably don’t pay attention that closely.
Joe Biden is trying to get republican voters by using a rick scott slogan.
Every time I read a joe Biden twitter post I deconstruct whatever he’s saying to mean, “hi I’m joe, remember me.  I’m tweeting something completely innocuous because I’m not really a front runner”
Is Pete writing all your twitter posts.  Say something meaningless but harmless.  That tells me joe biden is not bold, is no leader.
Uh excuse me they are blaming Biden for this, uh no trump is president
Biden’s live-streams should be on fire.  He farts and tries to pretend no one heard it.
It is a big step but candidate Biden was sending some strong signals about having Pete in his administration.  Now, what President-Elect Biden will do....that is an entirely different question.
Biden said he talks wth Drs 3x a week  1hr abt the virus. I would like 2 know the Drs namesIf it isn’t bloody then it isn’t a revolution. Also, If you think for one second Biden won’t also be a war criminal and kill people with the powers of the office then you are sadly naive.
Was Biden there?
Ok...  Biden wasn't there...  Maybe he forgot it was today...
Outside of the status quo career politician like Biden, Pelosi,  Grassley and Don Young.  Trump doesn't care what people think of him.  That's what pisses people off the most in my opinion.  He'll say it like it is without sugar coating anything.
Biden can barely remember his name...
This the best you got? Trumps campaign strategy is to mock Biden’s speech? Go right ahead, you’re hurting, not helping trumps cause but too ignorant to even know it.
Pretending Joe Biden will fix this corrupt system is beyond hilarious. He built this system. Should've voted for Bernie Sanders, boomers.
Biden should be too
tell us, how many republicans do you know that are voting for VP Biden. Is it a big number?
This is odd if you know Biden promised he would reign in his own ambition and consider being VP the end of his political career and not run for prez, when Obama was vetting him. But here we are. His ambition is ok though. Stop holding women to double standards.
How come no one is talking about Biden's Ukraine deals anymore?
Ha or he’s cold because he’s old! Haha prob more true
It’s just an address. Shut off the electricity and water, no supplies, lots of Ted Nugent played at pants shitting decibels. Biden can work from a card table at the capitol rotunda. He’ll be fine.
Bullshit only because is election year. Thru Puertorricans will vote for Biden we haven’t forgot the way Trump put us as second class American citizens after Hurricane Maria. After sacrificing the life of our men and women since WWI.  Did you know that Puerto Rico have more men
All of the polling for Joe Biden shows he's ahead of Trump way more than Hillary ever was against him.
No. free market does work. But i would ask your fellow dems about that. You think we will have z free market under the leadership of Biden?
So then can we add a tweet about joe Biden being the most corrupt VP in history too?! #ObamaBidenGate
I couldn’t agree more. Trump would rip  Biden a new one.
That question is why I find the polls interesting. If they are representative it seems like the naysayers are fewer, even if very vocal. If Biden is at the top, why not EW or KH? He’s not my choice, but he’s what we got. They
This is why electing Joe Biden, though necessary I believe, will be pointless because the democrats will NOT do a single thing to prevent the next Trump. We must take over the Democratic party.
Biden with have free rein, then work with #GOP remaining to balance and heal the Nation.  will be counseled by Bo.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I’ll give you my answer.
It’s all a script that all of these mayors are reciting. It’s all a way to try to hide their involvement with the pedophile ring. If Biden wins they can hide it. If Trump wins we will be in a civil war.
Looks like a Biden rally 😂
If only Joe Biden would support Medicare for all. 35,000 people die every year because they don't have access to health care.
I wondered how much this was going to be held against her. It also explains why some others are still on the list. We are going to learn a lot about what Biden thinks about women’s leadership. Does he want a peer who can challenge him? Or someone he thinks will be deferential?
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
Did you see the tweet I tagged you in this morning? With Biden scary stuff
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims
They will not win. And Biden is their CINO. candidate in name only.
I feel like I’ve been on an ACID trip since 1894. We need Thorzine Biden.
This should be more alarming to you than anything else. Joe Biden effectively has one of the easiest presidential runs and US history. Because people are so discontent with Trump that all he has to do is sit back and do nothing and he will blow out Trump.
To visit Biden?
Lmao you think Barack Obama or Joe Biden is "our guy"?
still need to know who chose Biden over Bernie
Wannabe fascist president? A. He's president  B. Biden is the wannabe C. The FASCISTS are ANTIFA who BULLY when their target is defenseless  ://youtu.be/fLgKN1ij8eM E. Portland=Beautiful? Fun?
☀️Join Florida Democrats for our virtual event in the Keys on Saturday July 25th to discuss how Joe Biden’s plan to build America back better fits into our community and how you can get involved!
Why wouldn't he say that...Biden is corrupt and evil to his core. He is the one that shows racism.
This is your wake up call America.  Get out and vote for Joe Biden.
Why would the black people vote for. Joe. Biden ? He has made more Racist remsrks over the media then. David. Duke ! He didn’t want his kids going to school with black kids and on and on with remarks afout blacks !
I just help a friend who new voted register in Florida and is voting Biden. I Have another friend I converted. There are many stories like this.
Joe Biden is unintelligent and should be replaced with Bernie Sanders.52 % of republicans polled say they will not accept the election results if Joe Biden wins. Trump will end up causing a civil war in America. Every American should be ready!
Yet, the real question that ponders us all is:  "Where's Basement Biden?"
You really need to research Biden's History more, it's truly horrible.  You're ignoring the lives he's destroyed in Latin/South America with his love of Regime change.  Look at Honduras for example, or what's going on in Yemen.🤷‍♂️  Crime Bill?  Patriot Act?  NDAA? #NeverBiden
Joe Biden sounds alot like a certain Bloody Socialist Cuban Dictator that murdered over 100,000 Cubans in 58 years of Absolute Power.
Well, for starters it's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands than Trump &amp; has left more destroyed lives in his wake.  The biggest reason I think Biden will be worse is all the "Resistance" will go back to brunch &amp; ignore his evil, just like they did with Obama.
Oh u mean like the witness of Biden rape victim...? I mean that one definitely has witnesses n all democrats by the way... trump in the other hand was always a pretty boy that could have hit anything he wanted... 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Indeed, Biden is absolutely the worst candidate the DNC could have rigged it for, with the possible exception of Bloomberg.  The Democratic Party has been closet Republican for decades.  I don't vote for conservative Warmongering Segregationist sex pests regardless of party.🤷‍♂️
He said in the begining that LatinX votes weren't part of his strategy making it obvious that he has zero intention of doing anything that benefits those of us that fall into that group.  Biden is only going to help his real constituents, which none of us on here are a part of.
The most unprofessional assembly I have witnessed since the Bork hearings chaired by Biden.
The SC isn't the argument for Biden you seem to think it is.. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Projections are that more than 250K small businesses are going under and  want to give then $0 in aid while giving states $1.1 trillion in aid.   This is a microcosm of how Democrats intend to treat businesses in a Joe Biden presidency.
Oh hell no!
Florida supports Joe Biden by 4 points.
Biden attracts 247 people to watch him read from a teleprompter, but he is ahead of the President in the polls? If you believe that I have a bridge for sale.
American citizens are dissatisfied with your lethal policy. I will vote for Joe Biden.
Along with Biden, nothing f but grandstanding for 125 years.  #TakeBackTheHouse  #WakeUpAmerica
If by "getting pulled farther left," means Joe Biden wants to make sure everyone has healthcare, and make sure that the Police get more funding, then I guess you are right.
Rasmussen's polls have been proven to be inaccurate over and over again.  Literally 99% of the other polls have your approval rating at least underwater by 8 points.  If you want to talk about polls, how about admitting that 99% of polls have you getting clobbered by Biden?
Trump advertising in Florida in Spanish that Biden doesn’t have a Latin VP candidate. Only Blacks. That’s a disgrace and I hope Latino citizens don’t fall for it.
Tampa teenager accused of hacking Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden and more  via NBC2
151,000 dead 💀 under your leadership. That’s a disgrace and I will vote for Joe Biden.
Hopefully Latinos are smarter than racist whites to fall for this. We’re electing Joe Biden for President, not his VP.
You always have been and continue to be exhibit number 1, entered into evidence as being the absolute dumbest president in history. You are also exhibit number one in making Biden look like a rocket scientist. Enjoy golf this weekend, it requires zero IQ, perfect for you.
Curious to know Mr. Biden plan.
I'm Joe um er um What? Oh yeah, KJoe Bi Biden and I've forgotten this message
Is screaming “rigged election” 3 1/2 months before even one vote is cast He's admitting “JOE #BIDEN IS GONNA WIN BIG AND HE'S TERRIFIED, DESPERATE AND PANICKED”
Wow! Joe Biden and the DNC are sure starting off on their Campaign Propaganda really early this year.
You just have to worry about the President touching little kids if Biden wins #Trump2020
The difference betweeh Joe Biden and Oprah Winfrey. Oprah was smart to not run for President. Joe Biden will lose, any way.
For those who don't believe me, please see this article.  Biden wants to give $300 million in additional funding to the COPS program, the same program that Trump wanted to cut.
Joe Biden is literally proposing to give police more funding than Trump wants to give them.  So keep purveying your ignorant lies.  It's not working.
should just STFU &amp; let us here from #Fauci about what is really going on.  armed Magats swarmed Fed buildings to open their states &amp; look at them now. When  has 0 answers they blame every1 else? China, Biden, Obama etc. #GOPComplicitTraitors
I think she is too ignorant to be embarrassed. It’s a ludicrous assertion, as anyone with even a rudimentary commitment to facts and knowledge of Biden’s career would know.
Do you think JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SAGE TO SMUDGE THE WHITEHOUSE?? THERE HAS TO BE SOME BAD BAD JUJU
Joe Biden's (Obama) Administration saw the longest continual job growth in history. Yesterday the GDP hit an all-time low.  who do you think you're fooling with your b*******.   don't listen to me listen to Donald.
Anti- Trumpers continually accuse him of criminal conduct absent any proof. They need to look no further than their candidate Biden who is the poster boy off ill-gotten gains.
America, everything we supposedly “hear” from Joe Biden is not coming from Joe Biden.  He is unable to think clearly enough to come up with even a fraction of what we are hearing.  There are other people behind him steering him to do and say what they want. Biden is a front man.
There is a poll indicating 62% of Americans won't reveal who they are voting for..   This statistic alone explains the so-called Biden lead..  How many Dems fear retribution.  Zero  Trumper's don't fear retribution.. they absolutely KNOW there would be retribution
So you're telling me Joe Biden you're worried about his dementia which he doesn't have... Without mentioning Trump's complete batshit crazy behavior bipolar schizophrenic
I'm a mom and a teacher, and I'm riding with Biden! #Biden2020
"We choose truth over facts."  —Joe Biden
a 19 point swing to biden if true.
#letsmakeadeal. From a reliable source. Biden negotiations with trump went well. Biden/Trump Ticket. Joe the first year and Trump has the next 7 years. #SLAMDUNK    Let the mailin ballots commence!
Stop this stupid talk Cher.   You have no clue what BLM is .  You have lived in fantasy land .   Sonny slap you down.  Your not in real world.   You let Biden in and keep this crap your saying up .this will be the end of life as you know it. Lot harder to fall when rich! Venuzala
Obama &amp; Biden have always been about division &amp; racism.
Yeah, because that was a totally unrigged primary...🙄  Better get dialing those suburban moderate Repubs your party is always running to the right after.  You're gonna be them if your party is running Biden.  You gotta replace the indie, prog and youth votes y'all alienated.🤷‍♂️
Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  Quite an improvement over the day he had 19 people watch his event. That was the day that President Trump raised $20 million online.
Im worried about the  election. People will decide that there will be lots to vote for Biden, so they won't vote at all. Everyone who can, plan to vote.
Sure seems to be a lot of real conservatives coming out against Trump.  When I heard that George Will would be voting for Joe Biden I thought I had stepped into bizarro land. Another prominent conservative ws calling for impeachment because of the change election day tweet by djt
If Biden doesn’t win, you fucks at the  will have to file bankruptcy.
Just look at this creep.... Tell me he isn't eye balling this young girl. JOE BIDEN WAS KNOWN IN THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN CIRCLE AS  "PEDO JOE"
Like butter.  The Brits are following the polls and making lunch money bets on Biden. The real money accounts, fresh off scraping the table of the Remainer's rent money, and most of the Yanks (including me) are taking the odds... hard
Where's Basement Biden?
Joe Biden doesn't need to Tweet . When hes President he really won't have the Time. I only wish a Representative of his keeps the feed alive.
Becuase Joe Biden is a child sniffer
Think about Susan Rice. I did like Warren for President though. Biden needs to go with smart strong experienced color.
Interesting who's the authoritarian...Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists  via
Vote for Biden to save our country #DumpTrump #lovetrumpshate
Trump claims that the 2020 election is “rigged,” hours before he claims he will win the election “big.”  Doesn’t that mean that Trump is rigging the election in his favor? Just asking for a friend, named Joe Biden.
Short and he's got at great point.  Is Kamala Harris Biden's VP?!  via
Keep fooling yourself, your epic failure continues. Just keep doing what you're doing, it's helping Biden. #TrumpIsARacist
Biden is a mess.
I think you owe  an apology for this article on 4/24.  It hasn’t aged well.
This is a Southwest Florida thing: Trump and American flags hanging from the back of pickups. Along with the occasional Confederate flag. Moral of the story: Make sure you vote for Biden so truck guy will be even more unhappy.
Ow the left has gotten to the teacher unions to say they don’t wanna go back to the class to teach.  They are trying to stop the re openning of everything at this point. Watch on Nov 3 with a Biden win how we hear the very next day how schools need to open and people back 2 work
My account havked by the Biden’s, just saying. Trump 2021.
Joe Biden is our Abraham Lincoln and then the second Civil War Jefferson Davis is in the White House... Trump is Jefferson Davis, the ""house that Jeff built"" is also Trump Tower.  In America Up Is down, left is right, and everybody right-wing Confederacy down the rabbit hole ..
We became China the moment Democrats sold America out. Its clear with Hunter Biden's 1.5B deal with the Chi-Coms, Dems became beholden to the Communist regime. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
It's because they have no other rebuttal for choosing such a problematic candidate like Biden...  They are such shallow, two dimensional thinkers. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
You sound hysterical. Get that TDS treated.🤔  There's an argument to be made that Biden isn't even the lesser evil, that's how low your party has sunk.  Might want to hit up your Superdelegates to use their power for good for a change &amp; for what it was intended. #ReplaceBiden
Yes, I’m sure Joe Biden does have a ton of Chinese bots deceiving you into believing a false popularity.  Which is also similar to the election.
As expected...🙄  Same response I get when I ask #JoeBots to name Progressive policies that Biden has championed during his 50+ years as a Democrat...
That's a strawman argument, I never said Trump wasn't garbage, I'm saying Biden is also garbage with more blood on his hands &amp; more ruined lives in his wake than the talking Cheeto.🤷‍♂️  It's sad that you can't argue any positives for your preferred sex pest other than,"But Trump!"
Public announcements from both sides continue and sow confusion in the electorate. Many Trump voters stay home and GOP heavy election locations do not open. Dems show up in force on Election Day and in mail in ballots to give Biden decisive landslide. Trump won’t concede.
C’mon Mark, he’s on their payroll and the Biden campaign committee.
Biden right Turley a traitor,  your all going down.
In April, Biden said, “I think Trump is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.”  Trump's campaign called his comments "incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate"  Today Trump suggested we delay the election
Lmao Scott finds one poll that has Biden with a double digit lead and he praises it like it’s gospel. He must be embarrassed.
The President of the United States, really just said, "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote"  Remember when Joe Biden said he believes Trump will try and delay the election and Republicans attacked him for it?
You got to ask yourself this question. Why the hell would project Veritas put out a video like this? I think it's some kind of a setup.
LOL. Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. You're one of my Representatives here in Florida? no wonder we are fucked.
Joe Biden is the poster boy for term limits. A record of more than four decades of service that is devoid of accomplishment yet boasts anti desegregation rhetoric.
I live in the suburbs.  There are plenty of people living in low-income housing.  Most of them voted for Trump in 2016.  Most of them would be homeless if not for “low-income housing.”  Most of them will now be voting Biden in 2020. #SuburbsForBiden
According to Gallup Americans think if you contract covid there's a 9% chance you will die..  Gallup also says that Biden is leading in the polls  Is that a function of how ignorant we are or a function of our media leading us over a cliff.. like lemmings.
There’s disgruntled people everywhere. It wasn’t Biden. His note said “doesn’t hold grudges”. Which tells me he’ll make the choice. Don’t forget he’s got some pretty impressive advisors. The guy that used to be his boss. Have faith.
Did the media EVER make any attempt to root out the Biden corruption..?
Gallup has a poll that finds Americans think 9% of people will die if they contract Covid..  Is it any wonder Gallup shows Biden ahead in the polls..?
LMAO. If you think Joe Biden is a socialist you are dumber than I thought. Democrat or not Joe Biden is further to the right than Ronald Reagan. Please to avoid embarrassing yourself further don't use words that end in -ist or -ism.
LMAO he CANNOT complete sentences better than trump. Go watch for yourself. Trump will dominate Joe just like he did to Clinton in head to head. Joe Biden has also been seen biting little girls hair. He asked a 9 year old girl if she was 18. Give it up.
I didn't say Trump was good, I said Biden is shit.  He absolutely has more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does though, so there's that...🤷‍♂️ .#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Lol, you're one to be taken seriously. 🙄  RussiaGate is Q-Anon for Centrists...😅  You also apparently don't know Biden's History very well. 🤷‍♂️
You're making my point, of course Biden appeals to conservatives, because he is one.🤷‍♂️
Yes Biden and Rice
Absolutely Judge. No one in their right mind would vote for Biden. Didn't I see, an amber alert for him. #gofigure
Biden is a senile old fool.
Again...I don’t often agree with Biden (or Trump) &amp; we may have varying visions of what succes ahead looks like...but this is still true! Many will tell you we are doomed specifically BECAUSE of our “heart” &amp; history. Ignore them.
#NobodyLikesTrump This thread was developed by malcontent Biden losers. Biden, a mentally deficient man, is an embarrassment. It is hundreds of times worse to know that there are really stupid people that would vote for him.
JG.   Stick it pal.   These aren’t peaceful protestors.  They are tying to gain access to a federal bldg and burn it to the ground.  Tell me and the millions on here why they are allowed to do this ?    Plz tell us.  Your a joke to say this isn’t happening.  Take the Biden 🤓 off
i live in florida (a MASSIVE swing state) so im 100% voting for biden tbh
It has to be Harris; Rice is obviously qualified, but she has no constituency. Warren's constituency knows she's out &amp; are voting for Biden. Aabrams &amp; Duckworth would be fine choices, but again, Biden would be trading a guaranteed bloc of voters, demographically diverse for...
More racism from our Putin puppet. Biden will fix this ridiculous move of yours when we throw your a$$ out in November. You killed Americans with your negligence in dealing with the pandemic, you allow Putin to kill our troops, you are a racist and expect to be re-elected? Nope!
Well anyone who's Biden pick as VP will become president. Somehow in this case ambition is irrelevent. Unless they want a weak president who would be nothing more than a figure head.
There goes Texas, Pennsyvania...
Texas loves Biden!
Tied? Biden &amp; Trump are only tied in Georgia polls??  That settles it, then. Georgia is the most ignorant of the sister states (Georgia &amp; Florida) on a % basis.
biden too
Name one thing he has done to help Veterans.....and don’t say choice cause that was in place by Obama/Biden
I am a Republican who will be voting for Joe Biden. 150,000 dead 💀.
We might be, but Biden sure isn't.  He still thinks the Devil's Lettuce is a gateway drug...🤦‍♂️  Well, at least that's his public position, the real reason is that his pharma backers don't want people to have access to a medication they can provide for themselves for free. 🤔
Who would you rather see as Joe Biden’s running mate?
Biden stated that “the police have become the enemy.” No wonder they all pulled out of the DNC
exactly so go do some research. I have. Facts don’t lie. Trump has helped minorities more than any other president “sugar”. He’s not racist, Joe Biden is super racist but you won’t admit that. Joe Biden has called a former kkk member a mentor &amp; he’s put MANY minorities in Jail!
In some ways he's worse.  It's undisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.😖  The Democratic Party has become a mockery of everything it's ever claimed to stand for.  I'm #DoneWithDems.
My man, they're dragging Biden around by the arm like he's Ray Charles in a crowded mall, I'm pretty sure incontinence has made an appearance and he cant make a sentence.   What are you doing?
Texas is still a “Red State,” but the people of Texas also know a crook when they see him.  Joe Biden may not be as Red as they prefer, but he’s a good, honest, hard working man who cares about all of the people in Texas.  That’s why Biden will win Texas.
The Great State of Texas supports Joe Biden.
Biden and Obama tried to do this but Republicans called it “Socialist price controls.”  Nancy Pelosi tried again in 2019 and McConnell blocked the attempt.
Keep talking. You’re Biden’s best reason for voting for him. Keep on talking.
Trump’s just mad because Joe Biden took press questions and Fox News covered it.  BTW Biden looked awesome!
Not right now.  It would be too much of a distraction.  We need to concentrate all of our attention on the election of Joe Biden.
Great point! Ethics of sharing that w Biden an issue?
Watching Biden’s performance at his “news conference “ yesterday reminded of a movie.  Peter Sellers as Chauncy Gardener in “Being There”. Character had no intelligence jusr like Biden. He couldn’t call reporter with answer on teleprompter. Idiot
Great TShirt idea. "If you vote for Biden, you ain't a cop!"
Biden and the Democrats will pander to anyone for a vote, but this is beyond frightening for Capitalism and American freedoms.
You are aware that VP Biden has never been “president” so your prognosis is very inaccurate.
It’s hard to believe but the best TV ads against Trump are not from Biden’s team but from other true conservative Republicans. They will be a force to be reckoned with when this is all over.
Donald Trump was all ready to campaign against Bernie Sanders with his bogus attacks of “socialism” and “radical left.”  Then Joe Biden won and now he still thinks that his strategy can work.  Biden has been in office for 40 years. We all know he’s not “radical.”
Joe Biden won the Primary.  He is far from being “Radical.”  If anything you are the “radical” one.
I don't even think that's a given.  When they can't hide Biden in his basement anymore and he actually has to debate and give long form interviews his cognitive decline will be impossible to hide anymore. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Your TDS is showing.  Biden isn't the lesser evil...🤷‍♂️ #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden  2020. SW Flor
So biden answer questions today but if you noticed it was pre meditated he read off a paper of what reporters to call on completely set up pre-planned questions and answers did anybody else realize that Trump doesn't read off a list for what reporters to call on. Complete sham
14 weeks. We'll have 14 weeks of Joe Biden
Never seen anything like it. They attacked Barr like rabid dogs; they never let him answer or respond, they insulted him, called him names; pathetic human behavior, by Democrats. We saw evil today; we saw &amp; heard raw racism, we saw our future if Biden is elected.  God help us...
The fact that you think Biden is far left outs you as an incredibly low info voter.😅  Go read a book Sunshine...🤦‍♂️
If you took every time Joe Biden misspoke his entire life, it would not even equal a single Donald Trump press conference. We are supposed to applaud Trump when he lifts a bottle to his lips and can repeat 5 words.
As for the worse?  There's a strong argument to be made that Trump is in fact the lesser of the two evils.  It's indisputable that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives under his belt than the Oompah Loompah in Chief does.🤔#NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
I don't remember supporting Jordan, but I do support Barr's protecting federal property. I think the media is a disgraceful and dishonest bunch (both sides).  Biden is in early onset dementia in my view. Thanks for responding  Anyway, without snark, enjoy the football games!
I think Biden should pick Susan Rice as his VP. She is smart, charismatic, and capable. They also worked together during the Obama admin. Warren is my second choice. She should definitely be in his cabinet.
I don't know why #ShitLibs can't figure out why we won't vote for their candidate.  They'd lose their minds if a generic Repub was running with Biden's record.  #JoeBots are low info, VBNMW cultists that only think what they are programmed to.😖  #BlueMAGA or Red?  I'll pass.
So very true.. Trump likes grown women. Pedophile Obiden likes little girls and children....
He's destroyed so many lives at home &amp; abroad between his Warmongering love of Regime change &amp; his authoritarian, racist crime bill alone.  Biden is hot garbage in a restaurant dumpster during the second month of a sanitation workers strike.  In August.  He'd stink on ice...🤮
I do not. In fact I go out of my way to have flag on dashboard &amp; display Biden bumper stickers, I wear flag scarf at luncheons &amp; use small flag on table for group lunch.  I have been approached re flags meaning. Always say it’s a good identifier of American citizens.
A vote for Biden gets you the AFFH.  What is the AFFH, you ask?  LISTEN TO THIS!!  Stanley Kurtz on Democrats' push for a fundamental transformation of America's suburbs |
Wow a #Biden deadhead #Absurd af
When Biden picks Kamala as his VP, we’d better get #KamalaIsACop trending again.
Which, actually, is like a modern day share cropping proposition by a Bigoted Joe Biden and his Democrat Plantation.  Remember this November folks.  Don't vote for Racist DemoKKKrats.
Starting to see Biden commercials here in SW Florida. They are positive and I find it refreshing after hearing Trump’s ugly, lying negative ones.
If Biden wins the Presidency, I would demand that each vote be investigated for fraudulent voters. It is a fact that many of the 42 million non citizens, many illegal, are registered to vote and many will break the law and vote. Voting is reserved for citizens only.
Biden has the questions before the press conference
Yet, Delusional Dems &amp; the Fake News Mainstream Media fails to question Basement Biden on his acts of corruption.
Biden knew the questions before getting them!
Is it me or is Joe Biden in a 7 second delay and in an alternate universe?
My money is on Biden knew the questions today!!!!!
So Biden is now saying we need to stop sending ourjobs out if thecountry. It is a great idea. However President Trump has been doing the job of bringing back our jobs since day 1. Biden is too busy plagiarising Trump’s ideas to know what he should do
They own it now.   They do t tell them to stop.   If you cute for Biden in Nov then you support this crap.  Trump on Nov 3 and it’s not even close !  🇺🇸
Since neither party will give any of them any support now is the best time to help get a 3rd party to 15%.  I'm not voting for the lesser of two sex pest conservatives.  Biden is hot garbage and so is your party.  If you have to silence the truth to win you don't deserve to. 🤔🤷‍♂️
As I understand it, hearing was delayed an hour Because of Nadler’s accident. It was supposed to be over at 2 PM ET, and Biden’s talk was scheduled accordingly.
Bunker Biden, laying low.
Val Demings appears to be a solid pick for Biden's VP role in this hearing. Her comments around police are woke enough to appease AntiFa and moderate enough to appease real Democrats.
Lets see, Comey lied, McCabe lied, Brennan lied, Clapper lied, Strzok lied. Obama lied. Biden lied. Susan Rice lied...the whole Administration lied...NOT a single 1001 violation charged. 🤔🤔🤔 WHY???
Another campaign slogan for Joe Biden, Vote for me or you will be killed
Just saw a Joe Biden commercial I know that he can’t talk that smooth what a faker
Joe Biden's new campaign slogan,  Vote for me or we will burn your city down.
Trump could have saved the lives of hundreds of Texans while also taking action to make sure their economy would thrive.  Instead he chose to ignore the spread of COVID, leading to mass death and economic turmoil. Texas loves Joe Biden!  #TrumpKillsTexas
He's  too Bernie,  I agree with him on Trump.  Don't like his views on Biden.
Complain about Biden and the Democrats on Twitter.
Not given a chance to put HER facts out? You mean MORE LIES. Face it, Obama/Biden are CORRUPT TO THE CORE! They spied and got caught. They MUST be charged with TREASON!
I mean I'm no Bernie Sanders supporter but I think he's not senile.. and not corrupt.  He's totally wrong.. but I think he means what he says and believes it..  Biden on the other hand is just a whore.. doing or saying anything to get elected.
I'm absolutely serious. Is there even one good reason to vote for Biden?  One?..  Help me here. I really don't get it.
Biden will never face Trump. His campaign will keep him hidden away allowing him out in only the most scripted and friendly environments. Now the VP pick will go toe to toe with Trump. She will be destroyed but at least her cognitive faculties will not be in question. #Trump2020
Yes to Biden and FL
Imagine if President Trump started to talk and act like Biden. Would the MSM and the Dems demand that the 25th amendment be in play?
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'
Did you check with Biden to see if you are? 🤔 #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden rallied votes for it under they pretext only to later admit he knew it was bogus from the start.  That's what you're owning a little piece of with your vote.🙄  The man is a soulless, evil Ghoul...😖 #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Biden still supports Fracking, TPP, and throwing people in cages over a plant and is already Sabre rattling over Venezuela.🤦‍♂️  I'm not owning the small piece of those actions that my vote would represent. #NoMore will I let the DNC hold the Lesser evil gun to my head. #NeverBiden

But she's right.  "...Sen. Chris Dodd...asked...Harris about her ambush on Biden in the first Democratic debate, Dodd was stunned by her response.  "'She laughed and said, "that’s politics." She had no remorse,'...."  —N. Korecki, C. Cadelago &amp; M. Caputo
VOTE FOR BIDEN - he will make America great again!
Joe Biden can’t even speak coherently, much less tweet anything.  Who tweets for Biden??!!
When will Biden speak about being a criminal suspect in the Ukraine?
Since when is it good bragging about being a fossil?! Not to mention Trump has done more in less than four years than those 8 POTUS combined, all of whom dirty Joe Biden says he knew “intimately.” Biden cannot even speak coherently.  Wake up America.
BLM donations go to Act Blue which gives the money to dem campaigns including Biden. It is on their websites.
Fair enough, tho I'm not convinced it was Team Biden, it strikes me as Dodd &amp; the shitheels at Politico stirring the pot. Still, I'm waiting to see what Joe does about it, officially. We absolutely do not need campaign surrogates going off on their own stick like this...
Karen Bass will not be Biden’s runningmate.  Take it to the bank.
same for biden with african americans**
he won latinos in texas by more than 15% in a fractured feild. he was clearly the candidate they perfered, something that would drastically improve his chances at winning the state on a general election. it’s the same for biden in a state like georgia, for example.
yet biden “won”
The  unafraid to pick  as his VP is also the Biden who would be my first choice, which is why I know he won’t do it. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Anyone think Biden Dies ironically in October ?
We will starting Nov 3 with President elect  Biden.
Stumblin bumbling Biden!
I got to laugh when they call Joe Biden a radical Lefty. He's further to the right than Ronald Reagan.
Biden still wants everyone to feel like victim. What a liar!
Focus your unsought, inadequate advice elsewhere. I donate monthly to Biden &amp; 13 other candidates. Progress &amp; change can happen rapidly, in steps, or not at all. Temper your idealism with some realism. Democracy implies compromise &amp; shd be as inclusive as possible. #DontBeAMaga
Could you make any more of a stupid statement?  Joe Biden was part of the administration that killed Osama Bin Laden.
... but elect Biden and you'll find out how fast our country can end up with a real dictator. Not Biden, but the Communists using him as a Trojan Horse.
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message
Steve Schmidt is a true patriot. As a lifelong Republican I am now an Independent. I will not vote for Trump. I and all my Republican friends in Florida have committed to support Joe Biden.
So you will be going with the baby killing, mob rule, anarchist Joe Biden and his ANTI-CHRISTIAN party that allows RIOTS, ANARCHY but not CHURCH.  Great REV you are.
My interpretation was give in to the narrative that Dems &amp; GOP/ Magas &amp; Biden supporters are the same. Telling liberals not to vote for Biden is Trump-affirming &amp; as regressive as it gets.
That’s ridiculous. Biden was VP for eight years and is a great American.
I’m asking Ryan as respectfully as I know how. I haven’t forgotten his inspiring effort to remove Trump &amp; GOP from office, prior to Biden winning S.Carolina. Now that no longer matters.
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
I like the idea of Medicare for All.  Also think Biden’s plan below is excellent &amp; more appealing to a majority of Americans. Also more  progressive than any ideas I’ve seen from you for months now.  I miss the Blue no matter who Ryan.
Ryan, will you please tell us specifically what’s problematic about Biden’s environmental plan? He has moved considerably left in order to be more inclusive for ALL liberals on the spectrum.
Do you even know what you're becoming part owner of by voting Biden?🤦‍♂️  Do you have any principles that you won't sacrifice on the altar of political expediency? #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
Trump defines suburban women as “housewives.”  Just Biden defines them as equals to men.  That’s why we support Joe Biden.
Then you may want to start lobbying your super Delegates to use their power for good for a change at the convention.  Biden &amp; the DNC are dividing your party. 🤷‍♂️ #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
That’s ridiculous. No one believes that. Biden was VP for eight years.

So your saying ones history and voting record doesn't matter?  It's not indicative of how they will act in the future?  Do you have anything in that head of yours besides pudding?  Biden is, was and always will be a conservative...🤦‍♂️  You people live in a fantasy world. 🙄
Joe Biden should make a speech in front of wall, that he as President will tear down.

My personal opinion is that Joe Biden needs to get out on social media much more whether it's having a town hall on MSNBC or NBC or any of the channels and to reach out more to the Latino and black communities they are waiting to hear from him. This is how we have to do it¡
Lol Joe Biden doesn't have anything to do with the protests. Most of the protesters don't even want to vote for him. These protests are literally Trump's protests. Righties love to say that this is what it'll be like under Biden, but it's literally like that now under Trump??
Well apparently his visual acuity is right up there with Biden's mental acuity.
America is safer with Biden in the basement. He is just another  empty suit that the Dems can control. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism.
And still, where's Basement Biden?
Remember when Trump was campaigning for Bernie Sanders to beat Joe Biden so that he could incorrectly claim that Democrats are "Socialists?"  He failed, but that doesn't mean he won't gaslight Americans into believing that Joe Biden is the Trojan Horse Candidate for Socialism.
Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash author, has a new book,  "Fallout".  This book describes the corruption of Biden, Obama, Clinton with Russia and China. Claims Biden is even more corrupt than Clinton .  Remember, Dems always accuse you of that which they are guilty of
New book 'Fallout' examines swampy dealings of Obama-Biden administration
Yeah you sure don't want make it a Trump or Biden choice. Trouble for you is that is the election we have and sooner or later Biden is going to have to prove he can be president.
Liz Peek: Biden-Democrat sweep in November would destroy country. Here's their plan
What gets lost in all of this analysis is that neither Biden or Democrats are fit to govern.  You trusted Pelosi and the Demicrats in 2018.. and look what happened.
If you think voting for Biden will bring back your father's Democrat party.. think again.  They have crossed over to the dark side..
There's no American Dream, there's no white picket fence and there's no good neighborhood for you to raise your children. Is this your future? Then vote for Biden. #BidenIsARacist   #KAG #TRUMP2020 #WomenForTrump #VoterID
Who'd have thought that Biden's choice on VP running mate (eg, E Warren etc) could have bearing on Facebook's (=Zuckerberg) influence on 2020 election? DJT is chummying up w/Mr Z, and in 2016 GOP was integrated into FB platform to max, while Dems declined.
As Bill Maher said to Joe Biden, “Grow a pair.”
Obviously you haven’t read a single plan on Biden’s website.  He literally is calling for more police and more border protection.
AOC and Biden can go fly a kite somewhere else. Scary to think these people are trying to destroy what we have worked so hard to build. Get out and vote people!
Funny how everyone on here calling trump out for making excuses yet if Biden were to turn down the first pitch for being busy.. y’all would applaud and say he’s doing a fine job.  but don’t forget Biden said “i don’t want t kids growing up in a evil jungle”
wish Biden would decide on a VP! It won’t change my mind to get that other guy out, but we wanna know!

Trump has literally built a wall around himself.  You can’t even see the White House from the street anymore. Don’t forget that this isn’t his house! It’s the People’s House!  Elect Joe Biden and he will tear down that wall!
You are the most anti decking in the process &amp; against to all republicans including all the Americans that make the country greater than you, Schumer, Biden &amp; all 232 left wingers that vote against the Trump. You are forced by Obama, Hilary &amp; the left wingers to work for them.

Why is Trump too cowardly to go on any news network other than Fox News?  Don’t attack Biden for something Trump does too.
CNN and MSNBC ask Trump to come on like Biden does all the time too and Trump always refuses.
Another lie. Biden gets into your brain. Mary Trump told me.

Joe Biden knows Pennsylvania and the working class much better than you.  That’s why Pennsylvania will be voting for him on Election Day.

OK, Biden's best Veep pick is Sen. Kamala Harris. Yeah, I said it. I was a Warren guy in the primaries, but that's not where the voters were at, so OK cool. Joe is gonna need an Enforcer in the Senate, Schumer is a lost cause. Warren would be perfect as Senate Majority Leader.
Biden you have any thoughts with teeth. Your mindless platitudes are mush.
Hell no, I'm not a conservative nor a member of either corrupt CorpriCrat party.  Biden is against everything I believe in.  I'm voting for my parties candidate, #HowieHawkins.  Their policies are in line with my principles. #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15

In December this year we will have Joe Biden as president. What is going to happen to all those crazy Trumpers?
This whole thing has just become a typical white leftist  movement meant to leverage energy into the presidential election. Then all the white libs in masks will go home to celebrate their win...for Joe Biden. Same ole same ole.
Are you forgetting him asking people to go to the polls for him in the middle of pandemic?  I could never vote for Biden, I don't want to own even a tiny piece of the evil he'll spread &amp; I refuse to reward the DNC for it's primary shinannigans.  I'm #DoneWithDems.  #NeverBiden
Unless you have already committed to Biden... you never will.  Unless youve  hated Trump since inauguration day there's absolutely no reason not to vote for him.
Not only that, were talking about the guy who wanted to allow states to have the authority to overturn Roe V Wade, which according to Biden, "Went Too far!".  He also believes, "Women don't have sole agency over their bodies."  Yeah, he sounds like a regular feminist.🤔🙄 #NoJoe.
Let’s fix this disaster by voting for Joe Biden in November.  Who’s onboard?
By your logic since I'm not voting for Trump I'm voting for Biden so we are all good.  Also, if we're going that route you gotta give all Johnson's votes to Trump.  Congratulations, under your rules he just won the '16 popular vote too.🤦‍♂️  Do you now understand 🤡? #NeverBiden
You've got to be kidding me, right?  That task force is such a joke, Biden won't even budge on descheduling cannabis despite it being legal in 2/3rds of states, some for more than 30+ years.  He's running to the right of frigging Trump on too many serious issues...🤦‍♂️#NeverBiden
Sorry your literacy skills must seriously be lacking, Biden has said “poor kids are just as smart as white kids” “if you don’t vote for me your not black” and many more racist things in JUST this campaign, not to mention is 40+ years of spewing utter bullshit out of his mouth
I thought the sole argument for Biden was his "Electability"?  Your party chose a strategy of running right chasing moderate suburban Republicans while snubbing the Left, so start calling 'em  Y'all kept saying Bernie wasn't a Dem, nor were we, &amp; that you didn't need our votes.

We'll hafta wait and see though. Trump could Pivot any day now, he could change his Tone and that might upend the Narrative. Momentum is a fickle thing; Biden might go windsurfing you never know...🤣
BREAKING:  The Reagan Foundation is threatening to sue Trump over his fund raising using Ronald Reagan's name.  In other words, Reagan Republicans are voting for Joe Biden.

Does he need one other than to try and push Biden left?  We all know it's a lost cause but I admire him for even trying.  I'm sure it would be a lot easier and less stressful for him to just sit back, shut up &amp; ignore it. 🤔  Maybe he's fighting for his principles?  Try it. 🙄
Please, this bogus task force is a joke since Biden rejected everything.  The idiot won't even move left on Cannabis for shits sake.🤦‍♂️  #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
He won't even budge on cannabis! A thing that's been legal in some states for 30 years now 🤦‍♂️  Biden can't be moved left...  #NeverBiden #DemExit #GetGreenTo15
We couldn't even get Cannabis legalization out of that so called "unity commission" PR stunt.  The party has moved so far right they're virtually indistinguishable, and there's solid arguments to be made that Biden really isn't the lesser evil.  He's just a polite one.   Usually.
I thought your whole sales pitch for Biden was electability?  Are you finally starting to realize the DNC lied to you?  It's not too late to start lobbying your Super Delegates to use their power for good for a change at the convention...  That is, unless you want Trump. 🤔#NoJoe

Gee, you're literally the first person to ever say this, completely changed my mind! I'm totally gonna vote for Biden now!🙄  Good job!  Now, will you please go away #BlueMAGA?
At least they are doing work for the USA. Biden allowed his son to take over 400 flights on AF2, used his office for gains.  Walked away from China with 1.5 Billion dollars and is rumorto now have been indicted in Ukraine for Burisma dealings.
To breathe in Joe biden's nostrils would be to blow essentially.  they apparently didn't like what they saw coming out of his nostrils and they wanted to make sure it stayed up and in there. Plenty of room cuz they blew whatever it was back into his skull, they heard ting!
You can't even have a civil conversation or debate without pointing a finger at a Trump supporter and name calling. Sounds like a lack of education on your behalf that used emotions ad a driving force. Haha. You really like Joe Biden as a leader? Ukraine is trying 2 arrest him rn
Your friend Biden doesn’t even know what day it is.   Stop with the msnbc talking points about the water bottle.  Old news.  Was clarified.
If Biden gets in you’ll need it.
accepted or not trump was endorsed. Biden was not.
I’m a Democrat and I can’t vote for Biden because of what he said about Black people. I would vote for Kanye over Trump.
Joe Biden is and always has been nothing but a puppet for Dem leaders like Pelosi. Biden can’t run a lemonade stand without someone leading the way, yet alone manage and defend a country.
You are representing the badly &amp; the restored democratic people: such as the majority of baseless &amp; poor, the drugs supplied &amp; leaving &amp; diying in the spans of CA and the rest of USA, the kids supported by Obama, Biden, Hilary, left wings, Schumer, literals &amp; corrupted like you.

I think President Biden will have to take the Secret staff with him to take office. Donald won't be a willing and accepting participant in the orderly exchange of power.

I guess your right, he's sightly less authoritarian than Trump but is far enough to the right that you couldn't shine a light between them.  One thing is indisputable is that Biden has far more blood on his hands and destroyed lives left in his wake than Trump, &amp; that's damn sad.

No worries, I'm voting for Biden at the voting booth. Although you'll still vote by mail I'm sure.
would you prefer a 'whole bowl of shit''? if you're not for Biden, you're for trump. not hard. at least he has a chance; Bernie had none maybe try to get over it.
These are the things Americans should know about Biden. Of course he won’t be in office long but his Vice President going to have the same ideas?
Such A Joke!!!  IF BIDEN KNEW HOW TO SAVE AMERICA, WHY DIDN'T HE TELL OBAMA!!!

Why NOT, you guys did when you voted for Trump's incompetent ass!! Biden is 100% BETTER than Trump is on Biden's WORSE day!!

Yes Biden is weak, very weak ! But that’s total bullshit that because of Biden being a dishrag only this will make Trump look strong! Dodo poop ! Not at all true !!!

I agree that Biden is not a socialist.
You could stand to drop the "women for Biden" shit  Donald Trump is a serial abuser but it's sad y'all drag everyone's feelings out for bs you don't mean
He voted absentee, big difference, but you know that because you are Joe Biden’s handler.
Read the tea leaves. Biden is going to get trounced
He donates his whole check! He’s only been in office 4 3 1/2 yrs he could stay n office 4 40 yrs&amp; still wouldn’t be as corrupt as Biden
As an aside, I'm not saying I'm happy. I'm not. But if this elects Biden and ousts the orange abomination, cool. We can always add to and tweak things as we go.
I understand why people are miffed that Medicare for All and legalization of marijuana are not on the DNC platform. I am, too.   It doesn't mean that they can't be after Biden is elected and the Senate flips. Seems like we're avoiding polarizing issues.
The news and support this treatment will come out the day AFTER the election. That is if Biden wins, then he’ll try to take full credit for it.
Like you Paula, Kaitlin Collins is a biased reporter with a narrative. John Roberts is not. Also, Pres Trump does not have a list of reporters approved by his handlers to call on like Joe Biden does.

Trump doesn't know his ass from his elbow.... Biden will win!!
Why? Is he going to tell lies and we can catch him? Yes. Will that lead to consequences? No, not at all. The House hearings are always just a waste of time. Enough with the football scam, Lucy. They have made it all very tiresome. At least watching Biden keeps hope alive.
What wonderful planted Pablum questions from the mainstream media to Joe Biden who, it appears, was being fed answers either through his telepromter or other electronic means on his podium.  Probably, like with Hillary, he was fed the questions in advance.
I truly feel Joe Biden and His choice for vp would bring in a healing and necessary breath of fresh air.

Ok...well...that should dump the Oregon vote over to Biden.
omg you just gave us everything about old donnie, you know we asked about Joe Biden
Did you know that whenever a President is ordered to go his bunker he is forced to do so by the secret service..Its not voluntarily. Biden on the other hand is not being forced. He just wants to avoid all the hard questions he will face if he campaigns the traditional way 😁 lol
The facts are plenty in regards to what Joe Biden has done compared to the dipshit in the WH.
not endorsing Biden is about the dumbest fking thing you can do. congratulations on being a total zero of a representative of the Democratic Party.
You must be talking about Biden. He is the one who has been hiding in his basement lately 😁
So  you know so much about this.. maybe you should be investigated on your back ground. Again Biden is not our President yet. He will take everything up once we get old donnie out of the White House.  Be patient and watch what a real President can do.
Of course did anyone expect differently.  Biden will have to survive sometime.
A lot of info on Trump's finances and taxes is now available. He has broken several laws for tax fraud on taxes and bank loans. He is a criminal and will be in prison hopefully soon. Biden avoiding the debates may be a good idea.
And you are maybe more mentally challenged than Biden
How sick are you like me of Republicans calling all Democrats, Socialist ITS A LIE, Joe Biden is a moderate leaning towards conservative as I am, the Republicans are so desperate as to go all the way RIGHT, embracing lies and creating hysteria in America
Oh God ! I can’t wait! Now the world will get to see for themselves how unfit Joe Biden is to be President!
I don't think history will record those in our government, MSM &amp; others that knew my verifiable story &amp; did nothing, will be judged well by their followers/constituents.   Imagine; 2x months before midterm elections America talking about Obama/Biden #ShadowNet; NOT impeachment?
Trump is just exhausting at this point. I wished I didn't hate Biden with a passion too.

Biden is the biggest criminal ever &amp; a sexual predator. He apologized on tv 4 invading woman’s spaces, said times hv changed, no they haven’t MF, it’s just woman r talking about it! The stupid idiot was even going to prosecute a 3 star General 4 the “Logan Act”! He’s a f-ing cree
Would Stephen King, Obama, Biden, Schumer, Clinton, the Cuomo twins, de Blasio, Newsome, Schiff, and Lightfoot (I know she’s a women, but she’s oh so butch) be dead also?
People like you that spread lies about innocent men should be prosecuted, that’s very dangerous! Now why don’t u talk about Tera Reade who Biden sexually assaulted, she reported to Congress, but they said they won’t release the papers! Her mother even called Into Larry king
If the Dems actually put on a candidate worth voting for most people would probably not vore for Trump. But it's starting to look like 2016 all over again. Biden might not be as bad as Hillary but the insane leftists tactics are pushing more voters toward Trump each day.
If you are 'dead' you will not only test positive as well, but also vote mush-brain biden in Nov.
That is because Biden is Obsequious, the Dems. Are raising money for the lobotomy, or doesn't obama care pay for that.
I am not voting Biden.
And just like magic, the day after election (if Biden won) all the violence will stop.

It’s called AFFH Affirnatively Further Fair Housing. Obama and Biden thought this up and put in practice. President Trump jus wiped it out but if Biden wins he’ll reinstate it. If you love living in the suburbs think twice before you vote Blue.

It's just like the myth that has Biden ahead of trump in the polls

Pretty sure Biden’s not president yet
Yes. it’s been a silent project. Are you pledging your billion dollars to Biden as the nominee?  Do you realize you could have gifted everyone in this country with a $1million for the money you spent on ads; now financial ruin for most Americans
I don't think Joe Biden is the best Democrats could find. I think there are many Democrats who have what it takes to be President. In fact, I have a list of 210 of them. Adam Schiff is one of them. Some are mayors. Some governors and LGs. There are so many.

I believe it was less secret voters than that there was a group of undecided which the posters had split 50-50 when they did their reports. Turns out they broke overwhelmingly 90-10 for Trump.  Today when asked undecideds overwhelmingly say they will go for Biden
Doesn’t say much for her integrity or her intellect. I would’ve thought she would’ve been better off waiting till 2024 either to replace Trump or come against Biden.  If she helps dump Pence and they lose where does that leave her?
And because he his one of the largest show people will listen to him. (Not me) That’s why it’s more important that he stops with his opinions! It’s either Trump or Biden!
If he is willing to make that statement give them something to consider! we have Trump or Biden. What is his point, to tell his followers not to vote for Biden. His statements and opinions dont make sense and again I have no respect for a grown man who arch his eyebrows
Since you have all these opinions about Biden and he should shut the ef up! Who between the two should we vote for! Since it appears you know everything about the politics. “Says the guy who has never held a political seat and also arches his eyebrows!  Do tell us “da non God”

BIDENS SECT OF STATE:  Yes folks, “where’s Biden in the basement, aka sleepy joe,has appointed this know it all, shake down artist, as sect of state. His action network
SILENCE:   BLM’s leaders, using the Floyed homicide, (waiting for a jury finding), to stoke up violence, burning, looting.  Antifa, seeing a opening, joined in. We all see it in Democratic run cities, yet no word of condemnation comes from SHUMER Or POLOSI.  But where is BIDEN.
Meghan is very weird always. Biden was a great friend to her father but she always challenges anyone who isn't a fan of hers.
Obama dropped Biden like a crack pipe
Saturday, July 25th from 2PM – 4PM EST, we are discussing how Joe Biden’s plan to build America back better fits into our community and how you can get involved. We’ll also make sure everyone is trained on how to make calls! I can’t wait to see you there!
Biden called for the basics of fighting a pandemic since Jan. Not sure what new ideas you’re looking for how about the old ones —getting a national strategy, invoking the defense act to have enough PPE, mandating things like masks and social distancing.  Your guy did zero zilch
Meanwhile Biden has been working for months on a viral virtual convention let’s hope he used the time well
Obama waited months to even get near Biden they were never seen together. The only reason Obama did it is because he knew it was the only way that they were going to get a democratic win in their opinion
Join  in Cen &amp; N PBC this Saturday, July 25 at 2 pm ET to discuss Joe Biden’s plan to build America back better &amp; how you can get involved. We’ll also make sure everyone is trained on how to make calls! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #Biden
Biden wishes schools taught more about Islam  via  But no teaching about Christianity???  Madelyn Murray OHare is twisting in her barrel I bet.
Biden is not the current president, maybe you need a cognitive test Ted.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.

Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar
We did not see this violence during the Obama/Biden years, we are seeing dystopian America under  .
Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. 🙂

Joe Biden Says Arrest Criminals &amp; Lefty Communists Turn On Him! - YouTube
U are so left wing not even in the middle .. Biden HAS not denounced defunding the police.. u just hate trump &amp; all ur words are slanted .. learn journalism again please
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
“People want to know they’re invited to the table,” Jones said, saying  has said “everybody come to the table and let’s reason together, like we say in church.”
they may be!! Try Eleven Million of us Tax Payers Dollars to buy a House with? I'm not very nice when I work "Hard So They Don't Have To!" Share the Love as said! This never happened. Biden is a Black Obomba as stated in his so-what-thought!I I refuse to be taken again!
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!
#DefundThePolice combined  #YouAintBlack #youainthispanic will reap 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #democratsfortrump  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  But dont tell #woodywoodpecker #biden to stop making gaffes...
You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
Brain Dead Biden
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‘Delay the Election’ Tweet, Even Though He Can’t Do It
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna 🇺🇲 🏛 🇺🇲
Lin-Manuel Miranda Endorses Joe Biden: “Our Democracy Is At Stake”

Latest information from Lancet regarding the risk factors for DEMENTIA . I wonder which ones contributed to Joe Biden’s mental condition?
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
“My Statement on Donald Trump’s Shameless Repeal of DACA” by Joe Biden
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn’t have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis’ funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
is a clown and should retire along with Trump, Biden, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and all of the other politicians over 65!  And, we need term limits now!
Let’s say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
The same you as the lazy deserve a lazy president like Biden, you will see what he is going to convert to the USA.  TRUMP2020
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit
Must be a Joe Biden supporter
They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Can’t wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.
#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Latinos are a major force to elect VP Biden President. Register and vote. Let’s get this done.
And you’re said I’m the one disrespecting Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️
The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.
I’ve got news for you, Joe: you have just been added to Joe Biden’s VP shortlist! 👍😃
Nuh hear the man seh him don't want Biden to win
The first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will now take place in Cleveland instead of at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. #PresidentialDebate #Decision2020 #Cleveland  # via
If your family worked so hard to be able to afford a middle class home wouldn’t you be pissed if someone moving in next to you doesn’t have to pay at all? This is what you want from Biden though. Btw, keep calling black/brown people “low income” when in reality it’s all races.
I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

Joe Biden’s plan to fix the wage gap black women face is very good.
I can see Biden/Ocasio
Stuart I was living in England for the Kinnock/ Major election and remember the front page of the Sun. Kinnock’s head in a light bulb with the headline. Will the last person out please turn off the light. It’s fitting here if Biden wins. God help us.
It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I’d pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says “make your voice heard”. They’re very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
👏#blacknotDemocrat! I don’t like Biden..
Brother, I will never judge what side of the political spectrum you fall in line with, but defending that racist dimwit, who clearly can’t speak a full sentence is laughable. Biden has 40 yrs of complete and utter racist policies and now has lost his mind. This ain’t about Trump
And y’all “i dont like Biden” mfs better not fuck this up for us
Barack Obama And George Clooney Trade A Few Jokes And Talk Of Defeating Donald Trump At Virtual Fundraiser For Joe Biden
Two choices in 2020. Trump v Biden. That's what we got. If you're anti Biden, then you're pro Trump. It's plain as that.
We control the entire govt Biden gonna have to sign whatever we put on his desk. Or we gonna be in the streets.
My bet offer is open any time you want.Biden with a 14 point lead I saw today. Easy money for you. Wondering why you won’t though?
And if you don't believe that, critically investigate Barrack Obama's record. He didn't embarrass us on Twitter everyday but he expanded the Patriot Act and killed thousands of people in drone warfare. Now the Dems want me to vote for Biden, a integral part of that admin. Ha

PBS’ ‘The Choice’ Promises New Insight And Revelations About Joe Biden And Donald Trump, Filmmaker Says
Joe Biden announces he is pro cop and against the left because he can’t stand Republicans accusing him of being soft on crime.
You mean it is NOT OKAY to question the illegal activities of BIDEN and his abuse of power?  What is wrong with people in here?  I am GLAD he asked these questions. I don't want that pedo rat Biden in the White House.
Please you’re the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it’s plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he’s doesn’t know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he’s really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he’s done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I’m sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.
Why switch from #Barr to this jackass #biden!?!? #FoxNews #billhemmer  lol lol 😂 JoeBiden is using Trumps agenda as his agenda!!!! WTF #kag2020
Wasn't a big Biden fan but he's crushing right now. Tune in! Important shit.  #BuildBackBetter
ignorant response. You’ve missed the point totally. I suppose you also don’t think there should be an even playing field for African-Americans? Women need an equal playing field in the realm of power. It’s people like you who are keeping that from happening. Bravo Joe Biden!
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying “Law and Order”, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? 🤔
Is this Biden??
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (🙏🙏🙏) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
Ana,  Wants to stop riots. Biden calls them protests and Adler says those people do not exist.
If one of them points a finger at Obama and Biden, then what?
If Biden wins (🙏🙏🙏) it will be 1st female VP.
Anarchists love destrucion , they are our enemies and are frequently supported by the far left communists in the Congress and Senate. The puppet Biden without leadership will lead America  to chaos and division. President Trump is the only one prepared for stop them.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.
I wont accept biden I’ll take a president that pays for pussy before one that fucks kids so lets fuckin go with the draft cards

So Jellyfish Joe Biden Anything yet on violence and your Marxist agitators destroying the rule of law everywhere they go and riot? Not a word about the children being killed in inner cities? Nothing or is it one of your minions paying them for the mayhem? Joe you’re spineless.
Biden should start every debate with this line.
I feel like most people whenever her name is mentioned gets happy. I know I do. Im voting for Biden anyway but I’d be happier with Rice on the ticket!
The idea is that Biden gets the "25th," allowing his VP to come in, unelected, as President.  But yeah, very likely wouldn't be a socialist president and would be an establishment candidate.
Why hasn’t Biden announced his VP pick yet?
Put Biden In Office I BET Covid-19 Will Be Over 🤷🏾‍♂️
Biden seems more willing to die on a hill for Chris Dodd than any of his VP picks. Is  about to make Chris Dodd his running mate?
read your article on secret MAGA. I’ve heard a diff plan that is not about being afraid but deliberately skewering polls to Biden to create false narrative. Heard it from a friend who knows a trumper who is part of the secret plan so to speak.
You said multiple times Democrats are socialists in your tweet feed... heck you have gone as far as calling The NBA: Marxists .. The fact is... You either believe Biden will close the banking system or not. Period..on my side I do Believe Trump will send Feds to hurt civilians
Vote Biden, make America Honest again!
Release your tax returns. Admit that you have handled COVID-19 worse than Boris Johnson has when Obama and Biden has a set plan in place for their succuessor. Admit that you sent federal troops to worngfully and unconstitutionally arrest people.Unbelievable!Biden using Ms Martinez of Wisconsin who apparently lost her sick mom in April accusing Trump!The ad says Paid By Biden! Vile indeed using the pain of other &amp; paying for it!
Joe Biden Slams Trump Over Treatment of Latino Workers

Biden is supposedly considering someone named Bass as his VP.  Can you say fish face?
Agree. My only fear is that Biden may feel that he’ll be overshadowed by her, charismatic as Kamala is (which would be a shame).
Yeah that’s not entirely true - the entire dem platform is catered to republicans- they have zero leftist policies and nothing for independent voters - trump is even to the left of biden on foreign policy
What is your plan Mr Biden ??a lot of criticism but no plan ???

Not Donald Trump falsely attacking Joe Biden for not wanting to pick a Latino VP when HIS Vice President is   *checks notes*   Mike Pence
They’re already attacking Biden in Spanish TV ads for not picking a Latina VP. The ad is meant to turn brown people against black people. It isn’t going to work but it shows where they’re going.

Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‘law &amp; order’ campaign for a bit since it’s not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
🤣🤣🤣 more peopl votes for McCain against Obama than Bernie voters voted for trump. Stop putting shit candidates out there and you would get more votes. It doesn’t get more establishment than Clinton and Biden.
You're citing the Change Research poll. For what that's worth, it's rated poorly by 538. Other polls show a more sizable lead. Five days earlier, the better-rated pollster Fox had Biden far outside the MOE in each rust belt state

I’ve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What’s at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye 👋🏻
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.
And some want to vote for Biden so he can kiss Xi’s arse like did Putin !

You are wrong, the Castro stuff has PLENTY of teeth here in Florida. Trump has been running ads accusing Democrats of being "socialists" for weeks on Hispanic media, and it ABSOLUTELY moves the needle here. This would be a very bad choice for Biden if he wants to win Florida.
That’s kinda fair but I think the primary process turned out to be important and useful. Biden got better as it went on and Democratic bench got stronger.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via “grassroots movements” and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I’m seeing
Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I hate that we’ve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it’s needlessly ugly.
hearing people talk highly about Biden and obama is so cringey😖
Joe Biden trying to win black votes
I went ahead &amp; ordered a Biden/Warren 2020 t-shirt today. If she isn't selected, I'll have a T-shirt; if she is selected, the country will have a brilliant &amp; amazing VP next year.
with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget
The Biden campaign should be concerned about the secret $400,000 settlement  office paid to settle 'gender harassment' claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.
Trump and Biden are pretty equal on their terrible policies so yeah a vote for biden is a vote for trumps policies and a vote for trump is a vote for bidens policies
We did not see this violence during the Obama/Biden years, we are seeing dystopian America under  .

Biden is a Bubba, not Obama lite -
matter when they move to delay the election or otherwise spread chaos, what will matter is who has the actual firepower to enforce what they want, legal or not. It isn’t going to be Joe Biden. /4 - fin

I HATE everything about this VP vetting process: Biden narrows down his list, with Karen Bass emerging
Dodd &amp; Rendell are seen as easy targets. Would you honestly still be making this accusation of 'disgraceful deep misogyny,' though, if the old white man most worried that Harris is 'too ambitious' (but not Bass, Demings, Duckworth, or Rice) is...Joe Biden?
I think the decision is already made but the announcement was pushed back due to the John Lewis death and funeral. It would’ve been in bad taste to make a such positive announcement during a week of public mourning. DT likes to do things like that, not Joe Biden.
Biden never said that. I like Warren or Stacey Abrams. I strongly dislike Kamala Harris.
As Biden's VP decision nears, keep three categories in mind  via
So join us and vote green! True progressives will never vote for trump or Biden! We need to solve the problems not create more

Damn, she’s a communist? Now I’m definitely voting for Biden!
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden -
I hope Biden references this poll. The GOP should be the NOTA party! They voted for maga and we got nota.
They'll say it, but they won't land the punch like they would with Karen Bass. That's the difference. She went to Cuba to volunteer work camps when she was young, her condolences on the death of Fidel were WAY off the mark. She would be a terrible choice for Biden's chances in FL

Not even surprised at the Biden supporters.... they voted Kilary Clinton too 🤮🤮

At least in 2008 we had Obama lying to us to make us feel good. Now we got Biden saying he’ll do the bare minimum, if that.
Still comfortable in the rustbelt. If Biden wins Mi and Pa he got it.
Nobody is going to buy your propaganda’s sh*t! Good thing is, everyone knows Joe Biden! BUILD BACK BETTER. #BIDEN2020
U are so left wing not even in the middle .. Biden HAS not denounced defunding the police.. u just hate trump &amp; all ur words are slanted .. learn journalism again please
"With the safety concerns of voting in person due to COVID-19, a majority (58%) of voters still plan to vote in person, while 43% plan to vote by mail. Among those who plan to vote in person, Trump leads 65% to 32%; Biden leads with those who intend to vote by mail, 76% to 20%."
Because he knows his plan is going to back fire in his face he knows that Joe Biden is not a Hillary Clinton nor any one that he can dig dirt on he cannot sprinkled dirt on joe's name can you say # IntimidatedByTheJoe is clean and trump is a dirty dirty
I am hoping Biden surrounds himself with good people. Now the Republicans will block everything, make a big deal out of it all as it is now towards Trump.  It will be a tug of war but maybe we can gain back some int’l respect?  And not leave a hole in the int’l scene at least.
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
“People want to know they’re invited to the table,” Jones said, saying  has said “everybody come to the table and let’s reason together, like we say in church.”
It also would cost us FL. Old school party boss Democrats are this stupid. I trust Biden isn’t.

A 17 year old teenager from Tampa has been arrested for hacking into the Twitter accounts of Joe Biden, Barack Obama,  Elon Musk and others.  I believe that Jack Dorsey should spend less time censoring conservatives and more time securing his platform from 17 year old hackers.

Florida Hispanics are terrified of Biden already...
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
I frankly don’t know if the Dems can get us out of the hole frankly. With people like AOC complaining about anything that exists... not so sure.  We just need to at least gain back some calm and structure.  Biden won’t do much honestly. IMO
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
Bass seems like a no go and no one wants to hear about Benghazi and other shit* for the next 3 months, so Rice is out. This is assuming Biden's team is smart...
A bunch of old, formerly powerful and influential políticos want their last day in the path of the Democratic Party. All I have to say is there is a reason Biden is still around and they ain’t.

It’s clear Joe can’t form a sentence can’t write a sentence and Obama is stepping in with unprecedented black bashing of his predecessor and no manners Obama is why there will never be another gay black and first man in the White House it’s white for a reason
Wow he’s a creep like Joe Biden
Hahaha there are tons of biden bots they are dem cast troll accounts
You are blind. And obama biden and  crooked hillary, sold out the country
Hahaha no! His policy is complete garbage and he refuses to ban fracking! It’s a republican agenda - bernies green new deal was watered down from the greens plan and Biden has no plan and fossil fuel executives are hosting fundraisers for him
Defund not disband? That is literally everyone's intentions about "fixing" the police system. And when biden becomes president (very high doubts) the police would be eradicated

A Karen Bass nomination would SERIOUSLY imperil Joe Biden’s chances of winning Florida. Her Cuba ties would prove toxic to the large Hispanic voting block in this state. It would be an INCREDIBLY RISKY move as it pertains to a key swing state.
Tell Biden: Kamala Harris should be his candidate for Vicepresident | Hispanic L.A. ⁦ and campaign staffers please read this!!
Or they want to drop the entire mess on President Biden come January 20 and then obstruct every effort to fix the problem.
Joe Biden is a Democrat down to his bones, so I know how he thinks. It's how all of us think. We want our next FDR, and Joe would love nothing better. God bless that good man and keep him safe.
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
And Joe Biden the most corrupt Vice-President in US history
Is Biden’s VP “short-lister” Rep. Karen Bass–the Venceremos Brigade organizer and powerful Democrat with many positions on Congressional Committees–STILL linked to Cuba’s KGB-founded Intelligence Service? (We report, you decide.)
Reality star’s ban on OT for USPS is laying the groundwork for November election issues. He knows he can’t win against Biden and is doing everything he can to sabotage this country.
Don’t believe ANY republican that says they are going to vote for Biden. Don’t even believe ultra rich liberals. The money they are worried about losing is what will ultimately make them vote Trump. Think about how often people say one thing and do another in this country.
Newsom Cuomo Yang Gabbard Booker - all of them would have helped Biden win and govern. The choice now is simply woke posturing and foregone that it is a Women POC. Zero interest.
Exactly. I think most of us are not as excited with Biden himself.   The vote now is against Trump. We need to move on.
I think this can be like when McCain was with Palin.  She contributed tremendously to his loss.  I think Biden has to be smart but at this point we should all be so excited for Biden that it should not matter, yet here we are. Unexcited.
I myself don't even like Biden as a candidate and I would feel like I am voting for the pink panter if I were to have to vote for Kamala Harris but I think now it is clear what we have. My vote is not for Biden but it is against Trump.   At this point it's not  about the tkt
#Biden equals chaos!
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
🚨🚨🚨 If he doesn’t want to seriously  endanger his chances of winning Florida Joe Biden MUST steer clear of Bass as his choice for VP. She represents a MAJOR risk in a key swing state. Remember the cardinal rule for choosing a VP: “first, do no harm.” In Florida, she would.
Bruh. You don’t vote for Joe Biden, you ain’t black.
Can't wait to see who Biden's VP pick is...a man, or a woMAN 😏
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!
Bass would be a terrible choice if Biden wants to win Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro’s death will cause a huge backlash from Florida’s Hispanic community, imperiling his bid to win the state. Not worth the MAJOR RISK she represents in a key swing state.
Joe Biden has been doing the same thing for 47 years and you're expecting change.... You might be a fool

Black Conservative Launches Campaign To "Expose Racist Joe Biden"... DoG
I’m not exaggerating. I’d have to put my yard sign away if she was the nominee. Of course I’d still vote for Biden but saying so openly in my neck of the woods would not be good.
Karen Bass would SERIOUSLY imperil Biden’s chances of winning Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro’s death would cause a MAJOR backlash among Hispanic voters in the Sunshine State. Absolutely NOT WORTH the MAJOR risk she represents.
Duck Dynasty Star Says Joe Biden is a “Hypocrite” Who Claims to be Christian But Supports Abortion... DoG
in time of crisis, in an ideological age, it’s possible to get a lot done if you turn down the ideological temperature, if you evade the culture war, if you are willing to be positive, experimental. Thats the New Deal’s big lesson for ⁦⁦
Karen Bass would hugely hurt Joe BIden in Florida. Her statement of condolences after Fidel Castro’s death would cause a gigantic backlash among Hispanics here in Florida. She would be the wrong choice for him if he aspires to win this state. Not worth the MAJOR risk.
You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
I've been hearing Biden ads on Spanish-language radio in Miami for about 2 weeks now. Very encouraging.
We should let you guys do the negative spots while Biden does spots about how he's gonna fix what Trump broke.
What a Hypocrite! #Biden2020  #Biden  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #Biden2020Landslide
Even if she picked as VP election has to happen and she/Biden need to win. Bottom line, if election is delayed and it’s January 4th, she can go home eat ice cream.
Here are five reasons why the Democrats and Joe Biden should be deeply concerned about Black Voter turnout this coming November.
AFTER JOE BIDEN, AMERICA DEMANDS THAT WE CAUSE “BIG TROUBLE”💯 PROGRESSIVES WILL WIN
“Several additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered”
Voting Blue just Won’t Do💯 After Joe Biden, The People In The Streets are Demanding for Democratic Socialists Down the Ballot
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
Happy Friday #Resisters &amp; #Resistresses We are one day closer to a #Biden VP announcement &amp; the End of Trump Tell everyone you know, and tell THEM to tell someone to VOTE! #Vote #VoteByMail #Election2020 #Resist #Biden2020
I was talking Biden. But I don’t think he’s terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it’s not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don’t believe me look at Joe Biden’s draconian record on black issues.
All Polls are Heavily Influenced By Foreign Adversaries 💯 Everyone in the streets are Shouting for Democratic Socialists, After we Elect Joe Biden
Even During The Civil War, There Was Still VOTING 🗳 Facts! After Voting For Joe Biden, America must elect Progressives Down The Ballot
Elections have consequences, people voted for totally incompetent, stupid, criminals to RUN OUR NATION….our utter stupidity as citizens is whats going to harm us the most.  Our eduction system needs an overhaul.
Biden has become an error message (404 page not found)on Trump’s website🤪 try this
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
I can't wait for trump to be out and Biden to be in. Then we can start restoring what the United States is supposed to be, and all these idiots who try to twist things with disinformation and propaganda can go back to the fringes where they came from.
Clyburn is the guy who launched Biden's campaign in South Carolina.   Facts don't matter to him.

Joe Biden is apparently up 10% points in Florida... a state where he has zero visible support... meanwhile everywhere you go there are Trump flags, signs, and bumper stickers.  Ok.
if you don’t address these two issues you won’t win the election 1. How to pay your rent/mortgage specially if you loose your work to COVID19 2. Food on the table anything else will end backfiring and Biden doesn’t even need to speak
Biden and Trump aren’t the only two people running for office. There are other candidates with great ideas and motivation to help this country
. organized &amp; participated in Communist brigades that brutally assisted the Castro regime in repressing dissidents corralled in #Cuba's forced labor camps.  Joe Biden's VP pick is a brutal Communist who enjoyed repressing the Cuban people!
Joe Biden was too creepy for Epstein to bring on his island.
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.

The article is locked and I haven’t seen the polls. His Covid response aside, isn’t a huge question how much of a win Biden takes in this District? I know 2018 was closer than 2016 for the R, but 2016 HRC won by 16, can’t see Trump improving on that. Plus DMC beat Curbelo
We see you Biden 👀
We r getting non stop Trump scare ads full of lies saying Biden will defund 911 in #MiamiDade showing old lady being killed by an intruder as she gets no help from 911- laughable but we have some stupid ppl here     run a truthful psa

AMERICA VOTED THRU THE CIVIL WAR! VOTING BLUE (Back To Normal) IS WHY AMERICA IS PROTESTING💯AFTER JOE BIDEN, PROGRESSIVES DOWN THE BALLOT
Good one and true! Strawman Biden is owned by Xi
Wait until Biden steps down, she becomes President AND then she selects Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Will be a freaking nightmare.
Biden seems pretty committed to having a woman of color as his VP. It would be great if he chose Warren, but I'm not optimistic.
The edited video ads of a “senile” Joe Biden are hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣   your cult leader Trump has the communication skills of a preschooler not to mention he’s a liar and a cheat. He will go down as the most corrupt president of our times
Not as many times as Joe Biden has bent his knee to them... that is for sure...
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don’t go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it’s absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as “progress.” The only reason why Biden isn’t seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn’t? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn’t a single policy that Biden supports that I’m in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
The guy who supported Pete Buttigieg and now supports Biden says Elon Musk is “bad at politics” lmao.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn’t any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn’t either. It’s pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats
I liked Biden on this until I read it says “care jobs”-“primarily women”???  What about men in care jobs???

Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn’t care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
Brain Dead Biden
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.

At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn’t want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!

These people are delusional.  That’s why I’ve changed parties, voting RED this November.  They criticize like if there is a “Guideline to Combat a COVID Pandemic” and was not followed.  They cannot even say something good about Biden. So, they criticize.
I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.
Joe Biden is dead.

Wait if Biden got anywhere close to a new deal, that would be less desirable than the status quo? I respect everyone's opinion and embrace reasoned debate. You and I will not find common ground on this issue but I very much respect your opinion.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
Honestly, if you're looking for a president that's willing to do more for blacks, I'd recommend trumps since biden wants to imprision/incarcerate more blacks and not to mention that he's a segregationist
We hope that you fixed that.  Biden for President!

America sees Biden for what he is: a 50 year career politician who’s been a huckster and a liar.   Another effete charlatan, another bag of empty promises all aimed at keeping you parasites on the dole.
It’s literally our only hope, because unless high ranking generals come out and stand next to biden with a contingent of armed troops at his back, trump ain’t stepping down and he doesn’t care about laws or the constitution or anything else

I am outraged that a Trump is giving a campaign speech as opposed to a Presser. Biden should have equal time.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.

If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.

This article on voter enthusiasm spells DOOM for Biden in November and is being IGNORED by the #Media:
Remember what I was saying about Trump leading on voter enthusiasm?  It's actually 2:1 over Biden.  No wonder no one has polled this again since early June.
Yes let's vote for biden so he can imprision and segregate blacks. Let's vote for biden so he can get rid of the police completely. That sure sounds like a good president. Definitely sounds better than the orange man who's made black lives better and made drug prices low.

It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
He’s trying to open the economy but establishment dems want the country to burn in order get into power. Ps. Fuck Biden, I’m writing Bernie in!
Biden said in April: "Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.”

That's always the way to look at things. Biden has a strong law and order past. While very pro union, he seems to a believer in the war on drugs. If he picks Kamala Harris for VP her past on law and order and his would put then to the right of Trumpty Dumpty on law and order.
I think of Warren as secret conservative.  I think of Biden as a social conservative but also a union paternalist type, supporting more Gov spending for the poor and middle class, but pro drug war and law and order.

although tbh, it's still better than biden now that i think about it
My political post: Expect DJT to say weird things between now and the election. When the election comes, vote.   If Biden is elected, DJT will say more things until January. Then, he’ll leave. The media will cover what he says after January, but he would no longer be POTUS.
tbh i think we need to just fucking restart the entire primary because clearly neither trump nor biden gives a flying fuck about mitigating the damage COVID is causing
This tweet by Trump is pure, calculated fearmongering (surely written by someone other than him) to drive a news cycle.   Absentee voting IS Mail-in voting.   The election will not be postponed.   Vote Biden!  #Biden2020
I for one can't wait to see who he selects.  Joe Biden will announce his running mate soon. Here’s who’s on the list.
I’m really worried about what comes after Trump. So say he loses and Biden goes in and gets some big wins (like expanding ACA the right hates)… what will come about then. I’m fearful that Trump isn't the worse out there. Mail in voting allows you to drop off your ballet tho!
Harris is great; so are Rice, Duckworth, Demings, Warren &amp; most who’ve been considered. Biden should pick the person he can partner best with. Harris would be a perfect AG; Rice, Sec. St.; Duckworth, DOD; Demings, DHLS; Warren, Treasury. Lots of talent &amp; lots of hard work to do.
Half the time Joe Biden thinks he's running against Joe Biden.

This is literally the worst plan ever. So the plan is to elect Biden and hope for the best. If he doesn’t listen, keep protesting for 4 years? How about we hold our elected officials accountable before electing them? No...that would be too ~~RaDiCaL~~
Trump has been pulling on the “white supremacy” lever for 4 years and seeing wild success in his base. The people who voted for him 4 years ago love him more than ever now. Even if Biden is elected, you’re right in that his base will be even more radicalized in 4 years.
If you think not voting for Biden is supporting the GOP, you are the reason the DNC feels like they can win with tepid centrist policies that maintain the status quo.

No. It's not that we don't care...it's that Trump is destroying this country and Biden is all we have right now. I absolutely voted for Bernie. But not voting for Biden right now, as the candidate, is throwing your vote away.
Mr. Biden, each time you express a thought it becomes more and more concerning. Do you realize you are being used and abused?
Can Biden even get it up?
The problem is that if the truth doesn’t come out before the election, and if Biden somehow wins, then the truth will NEVER come out. The investigation will be shut down. It’s not about political points...it’s about truth, and the truth needs to come to light.

Please watch if you haven't already . President Obama and Soon 2 be President Biden . ✌💙🙏💯🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
For  Trump, this has been a week of retreat. Rather than bending others to his will, the "president" has been the one backing down from long-held positions in the face of resistance... scrambling to resurrect his reelection campaign. #Biden

OK Patriots', this vid did it for me. I'm voting Biden 2020.  Who compassions better than he.  Single dad. you complete me Joe. /S
I'm looking forward to once again having a President who doesn't embarrass us daily.  A president who spends his days working for the common good of the country; not watching 24/7 news coverage &amp; tweeting out grievances.  A president we can go days without thinking about.  #Biden

YOU need the help! The day after he shut down travel from China, Biden was calling him every name in the book for doing it and it continued until after Pelosi invited EVERYONE to  congregate in Asian areas.
The reams of proposals reflect Biden’s belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.
I thought you were talking about Biden and the Democratic party until I looked at your profile.
BANNER DAY for STATE POLLS: BIDEN UP in PA by 11%, by 13% in FL, by 13% in MN, 9% in MI, 4% in GA.
Yes I'm really disappointed too. I planned on going to that convention. I don't care about the long lines either, I'd happily wait.  If it were Joe Biden I would only have to wait in line with 3 other people, get free food and 50 bucks for listening to a 5 min incoherent speech.
Joe Biden endorses this tweet.
This is good news, but I guarantee Biden will not win by 13 points in FL. I live in FL. It will be very close.
We still need to register, educate and engage voters as if Biden was down by 20.

Brian huge fan. But if I was a former Vice President, why can’t Biden reflect on what he has achieved as VP?
Biden cares about the children.
Is Biden going to pick Obama for VP? We would be in worse shit than ever before.
Biden can't string two cogent sentences together. Biden is lucky to get even a dozen people at his town hall meetings while Trump has thousands at his rallies, yet Biden's leading in the polls?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I keep seeing poll after poll showing  up by 8, 10, 12, or even 15 points over    That's great.   Ignore ALL polls! Keep doing the work to elect Joe Biden this November! Register, educate, and motivate voters like there's no tomorrow.   #Biden2020
Just hope in the event of a Biden win, you’ll hold true to your name.

Currently, FL reg Dems have an unprecedented 470,631 lead over Reps in mail ballot requests, which are good thru the Nov election. Sure, some is shuffling around when/how people vote, but this should give the Biden campaign an advantage in banking votes
Biden with a +13 lead in FL according to    Okay, so that's a 👀 lead, but not so far out there with TX Biden +1  The terrible Gov. DeSantis polling on the pandemic and his mandates for opening schools likely what's dragging Republicans down
Fumigated. Scanned for listening equipment and spy cameras. Checked for bombs. Clean out all the used Depends. Remove all the extra mirrors. Probably be two weeks before Biden could move in.
A conservative socialist/Marxist? I don’t think so. A hubristic hissy fit? Maybe. A Biden clone? Unlikely. A mental meltdown? Close.  Probably...., a hyperinflation of a massive ego meeting an independent President Donald J. Trump! Thank you, Mr. President! Roman Candles,proceed!

Joe Biden Says Arrest Criminals &amp; Lefty Communists Turn On Him! - YouTube
U are so left wing not even in the middle .. Biden HAS not denounced defunding the police.. u just hate trump &amp; all ur words are slanted .. learn journalism again please
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
“People want to know they’re invited to the table,” Jones said, saying  has said “everybody come to the table and let’s reason together, like we say in church.”
they may be!! Try Eleven Million of us Tax Payers Dollars to buy a House with? I'm not very nice when I work "Hard So They Don't Have To!" Share the Love as said! This never happened. Biden is a Black Obomba as stated in his so-what-thought!I I refuse to be taken again!
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!
#DefundThePolice combined  #YouAintBlack #youainthispanic will reap 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #democratsfortrump  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  But dont tell #woodywoodpecker #biden to stop making gaffes...
You are absolutely correct!  Definitely run for President so you could show America how to be competent!   Biden might not be as smart as you!
“Several additional women have also gone through extensive examination by the Biden team, including.. Warren..Demings &amp;..Duckworth...Lance Bottoms..Whitmer &amp; Lujan Grisham have..received various levels of scrutiny by the vetting team..11 women are still formally being considered”
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
I bet Biden announces his VP on Monday.
Well said. Too bad we couldn’t have Biden/Obama.
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November

Brain Dead Biden
Yes many of the born again followers who are spreading that Mr Biden is a Marxist
How about making sure more of the GOP votes for Joe Biden. Trump should leave the WH to a jail.
Certainly, Biden will do less. By far.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Trump Defends ‘Delay the Election’ Tweet, Even Though He Can’t Do It
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Because hope will take away chance of Biden winning..
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.

Latest information from Lancet regarding the risk factors for DEMENTIA . I wonder which ones contributed to Joe Biden’s mental condition?
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
We will vote!! Biden 2020.
It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn’t have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis’ funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!

Let’s say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
You misspoke...you said Biden and you meant Trump...
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
No matter who Biden picks as VP, the GOP will pull her apart.
We will all miss Mr Cain! Great American! Patriot! Self-made MAN! Now, MSM/Democrats now use this tragic loss for talking points, gain political profit and against President Trump's rally. Why..to prevent Presidential debates, as they know Biden's blubbering will be a disaster!
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
The same you as the lazy deserve a lazy president like Biden, you will see what he is going to convert to the USA.  TRUMP2020
Send Biden to a nursing home, he's decrepit

They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.
She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.
Just Biden... no need for anyone else.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make excellent use of the newly modernized West Wing!
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
Biden visibly a sick fellow wake up voters
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Then Trump said he is rolling back certain fair housing standards and I decided, even if I have to stand in line, I’ll vote for Biden. (2/2)
Ok, ok. I was pretty adamant that I wasn’t going to vote for Biden. Then Trump has protesters forcibly removed in DC and I was like, “Maybe I’ll vote for Biden.” Then Trump sent federal troops to my home town and I was like, “Ok, I’ll vote absentee.” (1/2)
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.

#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
I really dislike Biden’s substanceless campaign. Every corporate Dem should be thanking God that Trump is so incompetent.  What does build back better even mean? You talkin bout our D grade infrastructure? Our stagnant wages? Our student loan crisis? WHAT?!
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
Vote Trump anyway!  Do you honestly believe Biden has any reasoning left?
Biden when this is all over remember who made u the most power man in the world !!!
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Latinos are a major force to elect VP Biden President. Register and vote. Let’s get this done.
And you’re said I’m the one disrespecting Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️
The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.
I’ve got news for you, Joe: you have just been added to Joe Biden’s VP shortlist! 👍😃

I am not sure if investors release that a Biden administration would have people's health as a top priority and while big pharma might not be their favorite constituency, there is no real reason to fear a Biden win.

It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris
If I was Joe Biden...(Who I am not) I would not pick Kamala Harris...I’d pick Barbara Lee from California who voted against Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Invasion or Nina Turner...Since he said woman of color....
Newsmax has commercials all over tv saying text should you would but for Trump(smiling) or Biden(grainy pic). Says “make your voice heard”. They’re very right winged supporter of Trump, makes Fox News look centrist. &amp; they get your phone number if you text them!!
Also worth noting that, according to Economist/YouGov polling, the % of Biden voters who think an African American should be selected to be his VP had dropped 12 percentage points in just the last three weeks—from 58% at the end of June to 46% last week.
911? Police?  What does that have to do with Biden and segregation and busing? You're borderline incoherent, and that makes you a waste of time. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to put the real info into this thread (which you couldn't respond logically to.)
Biden loves the cops crushing people as much as anyone. They all love it.
Admittedly unlikely now, but keep coming back to the one possible VP with whom Joe is most simpatico; who checks off the boxes he values.  So, I’d be remiss not to float my Everlasting Gobstopper theory—that Biden’s heir apparent could be the woman who returned hers—Amy Klobuchar
👏#blacknotDemocrat! I don’t like Biden..

Please you’re the party of corruption led by the likes of Clinton and Biden and their family slush (initiatives) funds.
And it increasingly seems like  only strategy to keep excitement is to prolong the VP announcement, when it’s plainly been causing more dischord than active speculation. Which makes Biden look weak, indecisive, uncaring about the shit posts his VP noms get continually.
Biden pretending he’s doesn’t know who his VP choice is already is like Logic pretending he’s really retiring. Do you understand my exasperation?
I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now with everything he’s done good or bad and after watching Joe Biden answer questions I’m sure he read a week ago so peoples he is working for can answer for him. I know me and mine will be voting for President Trump! Thank God for him.

Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? 🤔

The question is not whether we will have an election on November 3rd. It’s whether or not Trump is able to sow enough chaos to squeak out a win. At best, what he’s doing now is just him trying to delegitimize Biden’s victory, not actually delay an election.

You mean the guy who’s the unnamed co defendant in Michael Cohen’ felony conviction or the guy who was found guilty of misusing funds from his charity and has been barred  from being on any charitable boards or the guy that held up aid to Ukraine for dirt on Biden/yea real lawful
Mr President, I live in Delray Beach, Fl. Biden has constant commercials on TV. They are very emotional. Mostly about COVID-19 and jobs. Looking for you to show how you are better than Biden.
Biden has no fracking clue
Wow, if Biden could pull that off (I mean by 2:30 tmr) that would be something ...... 😁
Biden represents exactly how we got here, and why people flung so far the the other side to put Trump in lol  Trump is a symptom and his failures&amp; successes just point out all the failings and lack of efficiency in the system we were trying to keep from crumbling/taking advantage
If Biden wins, DNC and corporate establishment Dems are even more validated, and use the administration to strengthen the ties that have on democratic/blue party. They are out in position to even further silence progressive voices and coalesce around moderate platforms.
And choosing Biden is snoozing lol or alarm continues to go off and we figure out a way to wake up. Or we could snooze, and wait for a louder and more abrasive alarm to come around
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He’s been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but “she might want to run for president” seriously isn’t one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he’s only a one-term president.
Definitely, and everybody in my house will vote for Joe Biden.
🤚 I am so ready for President Joe Biden
If Joe Biden wins Florida, then he's President. I believe he can win my home state.
Trump was the alarm.. Biden is the snooze.(someone else said that, I forget) Enjoy the rest of ur sleep, a louder alarm coming right around the corner. Or Biden gets in and everything swept behind the curtain again, then it's back to the yellow brick road for us. 🤓🤪
Need a Dumb and Dumber meme with Brain-Dead Biden and Brain-Dead Nadler.
I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all.  He will take some of Biden’s votes lol let him on the ballot 😂👍
I just want to know how and why Biden doesn’t have his running mate yet, and why haven’t any debates been scheduled? They(he) hiding something? Lol.
And we also heard ( from another journalist, real not fake) that his October Surprise, by a man named Durham, is going to be a doj indictment of President Obama and Vice President Biden (?)  What say your sources?
Biden isn't taking healthcare away a  Pandemic or abusing peaceful protestors. False equivalency doesn't wash with those who practice logic
At this point, we need to unite behind Biden.  I do not agree with all his policies but if I continue on your route.. Trump will win re-election.  Please rethink your position
Maybe Biden should add Jayapal to the VP short list. 🤔
Just because Joe Biden is mentally unfit to hold office doesnt mean Trump isn’t as well. Can we have a 3rd option? Lol
Liars?  How funny are you..Biden is just that. Good luck.
They say past presidents are just puppets. Nothing new with Brain-Dead Biden. Back to normalcy and corruption. Speaking of which, your dad needs to move faster on censorship and the fake virus panic, including masks, and a full open up of the economy, Friggen NOW. No vaccines.
Iran is really working hard for Joe Biden to become President.  They will go back to killing American military all around the world with JoeBiden help.
Like the ear buds biden wears so his handlers can tell him when to run when his 20 minutes of taking questions are up. Priceless...
Biden is picking for VP who is the best VP for
Trying to win what? Earn your vote? Why? Vote for whomever you want.   You have two choices - Trump or Biden or a passive vote for the winner. This election will have huge consequences for the future of the US, so throwing away one's vote in 2020 would be pretty irresponsible.
Does the model bake in regression or diminishing returns when a candidate is quite far ahead? Would it have Biden by 10.2 on Election Day as likely as Biden by 6.2?

I am praying that he does not pick Susan Rice. She is simply very unpopular with a lot of Dems. It would be a huge mistake. I know Obama and Holder like her, but it would hurt Biden's chances.

Leave the decorating to Dr. Biden, the First Lady come January.
The only direction Biden will bring is politeness but I can here him now the economy is fragil to reverse trump tax cuts let alone bush’s tax cuts and of course your public option will be just as crappy as private Ins so it doesn’t hurt them
I would like to see him somewhere and Biden's cabinet. I think he has a lot to offer and he would be able to hone his craft, in the political Arena at the same time.
suggests banning masks with political messages on it. So maybe Trump &amp; Biden masks will be banned after all.
Me either. I don't want people thinking Biden has it in the bag. I have no doubt that we will have record turnout. I have no doubt that the orange Menace will contested election. And I have no doubt whatsoever, that Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, will steal the election for him.
The prevailing opinion is that DJT pushed West to declare on the theory that younger voters and people of color would desert Joe Biden for Kanye West?  Are we all really that stupid?
. students who attend campuses will be required to wear face coverings, but don't try to bring a Trump or Biden mask. Or even a Gators or Seminoles mask.  General Counsel Barbara Myrick said no markings will be allowed on the masks.

God forbid! The article posted was from 2016. I was referencing what I was told at that time. The people that stay mum, and they are the one's you can't calculate. Its a private decision 4 them. I would bet many of those same voters, are doing the same thing, as far as Biden goes

Swing Voters In Michigan Focus Group Say They Are Voting For Trump, Call Biden A ‘Puppet’: Axios Report  via
Love how  can step up to a microphone and speak extemporaneously for an hour on a variety of topics while being clear and concise.  Biden on the other hand relies on a team of operatives to prepare him for a 30 second sound bite.
So can we do one real women vote for Biden? I’m nauseous after watching 2 seconds of that!
If you would actually educate yourself on the matter you would know that Biden actually wants to give 300 mill more to the police... so yeah I don’t think that means defunding. It’s all on his website
Well, in the 90s, Dems veered to the right in the aftermath of the Clinton era, so that was certainly true for a time. But these days I’d say that isn’t really accurate anymore. The party has been drifting leftward for years now, and that’s evident in recent Biden policies.
On Election Night 2016  couldn't even come out  and accept the results of the election.   What will Biden do?
It’s a weird answer, but she’s not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so “I just want to get rid of Trump” is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I’d be surprised if she loses.
Biden-Elizabeth Warren is my dream ticket but I think a woman of color is the odds-on favorite by a country mile, and I’m here for either.
VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN
Not voting for Biden.  I had a little hope that they could address a critical issue for America going forward.
President Biden and First lady Jill BIDEN will do the right thing
Your right. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  WILL BUILD IT BACK BETTER
I wonder how trump and his minions would feel if Biden played dirty and backed a commercial showing people dying on ventilators and said if you don't vote for me you will all die. #ResignNowTrump. Donnie should stop backing slimy, untruthful commercials.
Think we all need Biden's nonsensical blurbs translated on a reg basis🤡
This is probably the easiest debate for Biden to win in his career and the way Trump has attacked Joe’s cognitive ability, he’ll have the luxury of low expectations. Turning it down is turning down the opportunity for checkmate
VOTE JOE BIDEN!
Knock knock... who’s there? Joe Biden. Joe Biden who? Joe Biden your time until President Trump wins HUGE in Nov!
check out this UTube video to know why Biden will NEVER be President:
I wonder just how well that dodo Biden would have done if the China Virus had hit us and he had been in power.
You see why you can't trust Joe Biden and the rest of the Democraps
I recently saw where journalists said he had info on the infamous October surprise. He said look at someone name Dunbar. He apparently has a report of laws that Obama and Biden, have presumably broken. McConnell is delaying the release of it, so this journalist said.
Nadler is lost looks crazy and out of it drinking same stuff as biden
Kerry was a very weak candidate. And we're talking about VP here. Kerry would not have won, swift boat or no Swift boat  The GOP is already planning on the garbage they're going to spew against Harris if she's chosen. And Biden needs a strong Midwest candidate.
I have been a Biden Harris girl since before either of them got in the race. That said, I think the only candidate with an unimpeachable character, is Tammy Duckworth. The GOP will eviscerate Harris. If they tried that with Senator Duckworth, they would be burned alive
Brain-dead Biden will ensure the shooting war portion of the next civil war begins.
And you wonder why Biden won't debate him?
Her son knows that she’s completely full of shit. That’s probably the only obstacle that may block her from being Biden’s running mate.
Sadly you are right on the money...but if Biden wins the anarchy continues but it will be democrats fighting back the extreme left, BLM and ANTIFA to protect THEIR communist states...
And again you keep lying... Biden wants to fund the police more than you do.
How many Americans are tired of the fake news telling our  Joe Biden is winning in the polls from his basement. He refuses  to take interviews. All he does is make a video and tell lies.
And when do they turn into actual, deadly explosives?  People have already been arrested with pipe bombs on them.  Civil war IS upon us. Only one man can stop this.  It's  Biden is not the answer.
REALLY hard voting for BIDEN when you haven't heard much from him. I don't agree w all things Trump but I love how he's putting pedofiles away like a fat kid eats cake!
PROBLEM OR OVERDOSING ITS FENTANYL &amp; CARTELS! TRUMP OR BIDEN, WALL OR NO WALL! IF PEOPLE CREATE A DEMAND FOR IT ITS GONNA GET HERE SOMEWAY SOMEHOW! WE NEED TO OFFER PLACES YOU CAN THINK OF GETTING HELP &amp; GET IT IN LESS THAN A HOUR, IN DAYS PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MIND OR OD! THIS
Hey David is it true what they're saying that Biden is suppressing the Hispanic votes here in Florida because me and my family are voting for him and we're Hispanic
Have you actually been in a hurricane during the day?
Tammy Duckworth is not a white woman. All Biden did was indicate that it would be, a woman. I would love to see Harris in that position, but they will make chopped liver out of her time as an AG. What are they going to say about Duckworth?
Biden should sprint to Fox for interview with Chris
That’s because Biden is pathetic
Biden I want to know if it's true that you're trying to suppress the Hispanic vote here in Florida because me and my family are voting for you and we're Hispanics
If Biden debates it will be better than a broadway show
Another thing for Biden to reverse
Maybe you should have thought about that but don’t worry if Bernie was running against trump Pelosi Biden and Schumer would vote for trump
Not one Biden flag on the inter-coastal  from Jupiter to Ft Lauderdale, thousands of trump flags.
I'm more interested in finding out WHY anyone would vote for Biden?
All the things that #Trump accomplished for almost 4 years and needless to say while he was attacked by the media for the last four years nobody especially #Biden would be able to do what he’s done.  #Trump2020 #Republican  (keep #America great)

They will be happy to provide you with a tape of a well prepared, well rehearsed speech, read word for word from the top Democrat writers.  If you expect Joe Biden to go on TV extemporaneously, regardless of the network..... forget it.
What does someone state have anything to do with views. Wow.. your the real liberal one here.  Do you and Biden suffer from the same issues ?
T hj eyes don't investigate Democrats You are clueless about Biden Burisma
Wait till Biden has to debate with Trump.  He’s going to be soooo lost!! Sadly.. Biden can’t even form a proper sentence at his age.
Let Biden start talking.  Lots of his fans will go RED real fast!!
I know more people who are voting for Biden than Trump. Actually I only know 1 person who would vote for Trump.

Agreed, but anyone who thinks this ends with the election is sadly mistaken..Trump wins it escalates and worsens, Biden wins the democrats become the aggressors as they try and put down the BLM/ANTIFA movement who will switch their focus to destroying Dems.  BIG GUNS NEEDED NOW

Yep he's smart as a basketball. Amazing! If Biden screws up its he's slow he's dumb.. BUT TRUMP screws up &amp; no biggie. I say we forget this year forget these idiots AND START FROM SCRATCH, at the end of the year we'll just redo 2020. MOST Trump supporters are either rich or slow!
Biden wasn't born w a silver spoon up his ass nor was he given millions of dollars from daddy! Trump supporters. Easy to get thru life born with money to burn why don't you get it he's NOT some great guy you don't mention him bankrupting a f**king casino! That takes stupidly!
I am seriously thinking that regardless of what happens between today and November 3rd, there will either be a Biden landslide or we will completely lose our Democracy.  People get ready.🕵️‍♂️
You are the best How come the silence on the Biden Poroshenko calls I heard them He should be in jail WHY THE SILENCE?
They will never stop.I heard the Biden Poroshenko phone calls If I did lots of people did .why I sr n't he in jail.Trump wo ui ld have been
shows how far FOX GOES TO MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD, HE WASNT EVEN CALLED OUT ON IT! YET IT HAPPENED MINS AFTER THEY SHOWED CLIPS OF BIDEN MAKING MISTAKES IE CALLING SUPER TUESDAY SUPER THURSDAY, AT LEAST HE CAUGHT &amp; FIXED IT.
Please share my post about Trump forgetting the Space Force he "created" It shows he's just as stupid as any of Biden's blunders ACTUALLY WORSE it's like building a house &amp; forgetting it's yours. I ASK THIS BECAUSE IT WAS ON FOX NEWS &amp; MOST F**K TRUMP PEOPLE DONT WATCH FOX &amp; it
Send Laura Loomer to Washington!   A must read
Let alone get called out like, Hey moron, you said space force TWICE you SPACE CADET! Yet if Biden said it TRUMP would rant about it till 2024!! I can remember EACH of our forces no matter how new I enlisted in 3 ONLY TURNED DOWN DUE TO CROHNS YET I DONT &amp; won't forget ANY OF YOU
"Created" you NOT LONG ago who smashes Biden for a brain fart CANT REMEMBER ITS ARMY, NAVY, AIR FORCE, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND NOW SPACE FORCE.. guess your AFTER the salvation army or something. TALK ABOUT DISRESPECTING OUR POWERFUL MILITARY. He doesn't (CANT) even say sorry!..
Looking forward to Biden's presidency. What are you going to be doing for a job next year?
Same here, Nikki.  Biden’s positive comparison to Trump’s fiasco will be remarkable.
Biden is a lost puppet....
I would also IF Chris Wallace had any journalistic integrity, and Joe Biden wasn’t the sleazeball candidate for Presidential Puppet with a 40+ year career of accomplishing nothing
Some people call COVID Trump’s Katrina, but in reality it was Maria. The only reason it wasn’t was because not enough people cared.  Biden needs to win in November, then Dems need to get PR the help it needs. This is ridiculous.
Isn't it amazing how the candidates bash each other about all kinds of things but NONE go near this stuff not a word. Biden's brother is in rehab right up the street from me right now &amp; Trumps kids have been in their fair share... Still nothing. SAD.
See. Trump has no spine and he’s being played. He’s allowingvthe terrorists to keep the nation in full depression while rioters burn it to the ground. Brain-dead Biden is a joke, but Trump is losing, not winning.
Are you okay  with  Pelosi, Cuomo, Deblasio and Biden telling the country early on that Trump was a xenophobe, and not to worry about the virus, to come on down to Chinatown, to walk around NYC, etc...?
Biden campaign “clarifies” let’s face it they withdrew the “racist” claim by demented  because the asshole doesn’t know history and never did a F’ing thing for Black Americans. Can’t wait for  to shred this basement dweller to ribbons.

The perfect poster image for the modern American dystopian science fictional hellscape we're in. Just shop in a shirtless Joe Biden holding two hand cannons wearing a surgical mask and you've got "Escape From America". It'll do well overseas, especially in China.
All evidence shows that you can get social justice from the Dems but no economic justice. Both parties have the same donors so no change in wars or Medicare 4all or anything else which will cost their donors  Biden not even restore all the trump tax cuts

It only matters if he votes for Biden and gets others to do the same.  A statement is just the first step.

Joe Biden Makes Racist Comments While Accusing Trump Of Being Racist

Breaking News! Biden plans on rushing the release of the new $20.00 hero Harriet Tubman bill. For trump supporters another new zero bill will be released. True value will be 0.0. 💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲
If Biden were to take and pass the test, which I’m sure he would, I doubt he would brag about it. It’s funny because Trump thinks it’s an accomplishment. For him it probably is his biggest accomplishment, so maybe we should say congrats.
You can call the guy a lot of things, and you do, but Trump definitely does not have dementia. Biden's memory and recall are gone.
Why are property taxes being used to pay for a public school education that is just programming a Lectist agenda into our children? Biden will want us to be taxed to pay for free college as well to ensure that everyone has a higher education in that programming.
I live in a pretty mixed area.  About equal Republicans and Democrats.  The adult democrats (people over 35) openly admit that they think Biden is suffering from dementia.  Also this guy and his 'Shooting up bleach' and  letting him get away with it is disgusting.

The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.

Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!

Re-Tweeted  Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.
Is Devin Nunes receiving secret election dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine?  It sure looks that way and the Dems literally have the receipts.
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
You mean a Fake Ad about Joe Biden
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don’t do anything without talking to each other.
While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
A lot of NIMBY’s are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY’s, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.
Twitter account: “Oh yea! What’s Biden’s plan on Coronavirus, All he does is hide!” Me: *Posts Coronavirus Plan from Joe’s website* Twitter account: “Well there is a single thing I disagree with in there, so I’m not voting for him!” Me: 🤦‍♂️
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
Clinton Sistah Souljah: “I‘m a Clinton Democrat!” Biden fundraiser comments: “Fuck Joe Biden” Lmao Absolute 🤡
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
I don’t think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there’s a “red wave” in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters

I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
No Biden all the way
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020

i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
That woman is tough as nails! She's going to hang in there til Biden wins, no matter what! She deserves flowers every week.
#Trump2020 #MAGA2020Landslide  Btw I hear Joe Biden wears a diaper
I’m a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
Hunter Biden looks 1000 times better, murderer
Someone’s having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States 😂
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
I thought It was rice, but now I think it’s Harris. U don’t leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
Dude, I think she’s the pick. Why would they leak if she’s not?
It didn’t happen under Obama/Biden. It won’t happen.  Trump is a liar.
Dude really, “Biden has outspent trump since July 7th”.
Biden has outspent trump since July 7th. What a misleading headline to make Biden seem incompetent.
97 days to go and I’m organizing/voting for Joe Biden because he listens to scientists and has a thorough plan to combat Covid-19 AND future global health threats 😷  #BidenforFL  #Biden2020
That’s ok Mr Bigot  All those votes will go to Biden After all Low Income folks VOTE
Smh at this rate Biden gets to 65% with college educated whites.
Biden seems like the only person to get close. Anyways focus on FL and NC in my opinion.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Georgia Tossup 🤔. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.
Thoughts on Biden number?
I don’t understand. It seems like u want Biden to be president so he can do stuff. He’s running for President and doesn’t hold any office, he doesn’t have any power.
To my friends who follow politics, did you watch the Joe Biden press conference yesterday? Did you listen to the questions by the #MSM (or whoever these people were)?  Were the questions tough?  This was journalistic malpractice and if you don’t agree with, #ReclaimingMyTime
😂I was just mocking the people who call Biden that.
Biden continues to spend in the six core battleground states.
Agree!  We’ll deserved and we should make sure President Biden does it!
Yo, Biden against violence!
Mad at Biden for holding a grudge when  anything you are the one holding a grudge over some comments that don’t even matter anymore lol.
Lmao like dog whistles matter when Biden has one of the most advanced racial equality plans of any democratic nominee ever. Biden is not a racist.
Biden is going to win. Republicans are going to make it happen let's not forget the majority of the people who voted for him in 2016 are never Trumpers and people who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters focus on Biden and the American people focus on Trump
Because a lot of voters agree with Biden’s side of things about Miami. Do u know how many voters (mainly on the older side) that didn’t like what occurred in Miami. My mom was incensed at Harris when she watched that.
Did people expect Biden to come out as pro-anarchist?
Hey that’s my friend Angela May she Rest In Peace, DONT use her for any reference please! Especially with those two idiots Biden and Harris!💋
Trump supporters stay attacking Biden and this is why Trump is going to lose the election. it's the  people vs Trump, not Biden it's the millions of people who voted for Trump at the last minute, who didn't wanna vote for Hillary Clinton Biden is going to win
Y’all stay attacking Biden this is why Trump is going to lose the election. its the millions of people who voted trump in 2016 who won't vote for him again. It's the millions of Republicans who are sick and tired of trump lies and what he's doing to this country Biden is wining
But I feel their digital strategy is highly focused on Facebook (reason he’s leading with seniors). I would also argue Snapchat, Instagram, and tik tok are much better at reaching younger voters (Where the Biden campaign has been engaging in).
He said he was picking a black woman, not a fake indian, so unless she puts on blackface and fools him, warren wont be the vp...also Biden wont win...probably wont even run, watch out for Killary to take his spot by october.
I’m sure your going to talk about Biden. What the hell do you know about this man. This is only your opinions and you have some nerve disparaging him with your bowl of sh- - remark.  No class lady.
Can’t wait for trump to blame Obama and Biden for this one
Did she ask Dr. Biden about this? I mean the Biden's will be living there soon.
You have to be a fair and thinking Liberal to decide Voting for Trump. Biden political platform is not his at all. He is not &amp; has never been that extremist liberal. Never! His Platform has been dictated to him by Sanders, AOC, Warren. He is now the Puppet from the Far Dem Left.
Don't tell me, you've been talking to Joe Biden...
Thoughts on Biden only +3 in Minnesota?
Fox had Biden +13 so I’m gonna wait for more polling before making any declaration.
This tells me Morning consult is shit. How is Biden +2 in Texas while only +3 in Minnesota.
Have u seen the Minnesota prez numbers from this poll. Biden only +3
Trump will win!!! Fake polls show Biden will win. Biden can speak!! 🤮
Call it the Joe Biden “enthusiasm gap.”  And this is from someone getting paid by Biden.  Polls? Right.  Wait until TRUMP clobbers him. 😬
I’ve telling people this isn’t Just about Biden. (Some of it is). But a lot of it is Obama. Biden don’t do anything without Obama’s approval.
Who gives a shit what u think of Biden. U can bash him all u want as long as u vote for him lol.
Why is this guy associated with the Joe Biden campaign? Straight up Corrupt.

Is Joe Biden in the meeting with Congressional leadership? Because u implied it.
Looks like the Biden camp wants to refute the article. Interesting...
Hmmm, looks like the Biden camp wants to shut down that Politico article from today. Interesting......
Helps us though because now the trump campaign will have a hard time calling Biden ”far left”.
Holy shit, I just told my brother this and he’s switching his vote fro Green to Biden. Let’s fucking go!
is kanye offering free hand jobs!! who else can beat off besides biden? will kim be there to watch? is that his election slogan. VOTE FOR KANYE, HE WILL BEAT YOU OFF 2020

Come on Eric, so is no one allowed to critique Harris now? Biden was 100% loyal to Obama, what’s wrong in making sure Harris is too?
Because you have hated Biden from day 1 and are trying to tank is campaign so trump can win. Oh wait, that’s not true, so maybe u shouldn’t make assertions u can’t back up.
Minnesota was polled recently by Fox. Biden +13
I think that’s the point. Running a repeat of 2016 against Biden makes no sense.
A Trumpless Future Is Hard to Get Your Head Around
Of course not. Biden is Lambchop. The only question is to find out who is playing the political role of Sherry Lewis.
“Trump is weak, Trump is not conservative,” Barkhuff said. “But he’s the most easily fixable problem in America today. A vote for Joe Biden in this election is a vote for our Constitution.”
Once again how is this trumps fault he close the borders to China, Biden called him a xenophobic he close the border to Europe people said that he was being a nationalist how is this trumps fault
Trump’s using the leverage of the office to pressure a country to manufacture dirt on Biden was pretty well covered, I think
When Joe Biden laughs u off, u have been buried. Ask Paul Ryan.
2/x Furthermore, I don't judge my candidates by who else is voting for them, but instead by their policies. There are actual violent Marxists who support Biden but I will only judge Biden on his political platform.
Didn’t Biden just give an interview to Joy reid. Also, why would he waste his time with an interview when he’s trying to pick a VP.
I will vote for Biden.   When he’s elected I will call all my friends and family tell them I love them.  I have not slept since he was elected‼️we will take back America stop being angry.  Feel save again🇺🇸🙏🏻👩‍🦰😷

This is a weird poll. The cross tabs indicate that Biden should have a larger lead in MI. Throw it into the average I guess.
Biden 61-31 with Hispanics in this poll. Nice.

Status quo is civil war. Biden gets us to pre-civil war status quo. But he’s one and done. He has to win in 20, then the 24 election becomes ginormous
I do think it’s significant Biden is hitting the 51 number in a lot of Florida polls. Maybe something like a 51-49 Biden number is in the works

I’m telling u the article is bullshit right now. They are just mad because the Biden campaign wants to put organizers in every single county. When it comes to Florida, don’t ever trust what “local” sources say....
I’m in Florida and I just can’t convince myself the polling data is accurate. At best Biden probably has only a 2 point lead.
just speculating here (no crystal ball), he would never go with a shutdown before the election, he would certainly lose in that case. He if loses, he'll do less than he's doing now. Then when Biden's in, he rant how Biden destroyed the economy.
can you beat my friend off after you finish with biden? is there a line for YE handjobs somewhere?
Why should the Biden campaign trust the local party when they have lost race after race?
He’s going to beat Biden off
I will cancel your vote for trump with my vote for Biden.
Joe Biden is not an idiot! He was a great Vice President and he has more experience than the dotard in the White House.
Another reason to crush Biden &amp; the Left.  (Westonites - release yourself from Leftist shackles, &amp; finally use common sense, or get ready - your hard work, money invested will be redistributed.  Only fair right?+ you can thank DWS - part of the MOB now.)
Once the election results look promising for Biden, trump will begin to doubt himself an he'll go into deep depression and if he doesn't find answers it will probably ruin him. Even if he did cure his narcissism (took me 9 months) there will be too much remorse for him to handle
Idgaf. Just can’t let trump back in. Anyways when Biden dies or retires we get a better one so ya. U seriously think any of us like Biden 💀
Biden ain’t getting into a tank during a pandemic and even if he did he would cool af with his aviator shades.
Good, I’m glad you’re learning.  (Learning we’re not going to play that red-herring game.) Instead, we’re focusing on crushing Biden &amp; the lunatic Left.  We’ll enjoy that more. #Trump2020Landslide 🇺🇸

No they gave 100m to joe Biden and friends thru bpm and actblue
Mr Biden he is an ignorant narcissist who only wants self praise. Can’t deal with him.  Keep hitting him hard, we are behind you
Joe Biden was anti-busing 4 over 4 decades. He touted accomplishments working with segregationalists. Biden said 'without orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'. The Media loves REWRITING and FORGETTING History. Trump's a counter-puncher not a racist
Also... no FBI investigation into Biden lol.
I think the Biden campaign capitalizing off all Trumps mistakes is the key. I highly doubt they will let trump debate.
Yes we need all the younger voters to vote for Joe Biden to get Gun control laws changed for our country! Climate change control laws changed for our environment! Equal rights for all Americans! BLM vote 🗳 get Trump out and his Robot Senate our! Get Bills passed Americans first
I’m absolutely done at this point. U know what, Biden should just pick Duckworth, Whitmer, or Rice and be done with. I want a VP without twitter stans.
No one from team Biden is talking, it’s fools on twitter getting melodramatic and taking it out on Biden, which at this point is unacceptable 🤬.
I am logging off of Twitter when the VP is announced. Way too many people are getting into their feelings about this topic, and they are turning it into talking shit about Biden which at this point is fucking unacceptable.
is PMS'ing again ... those of you who know who this is know what I mean.  Use it, my friends. ☝️🤨  If you believe that a Biden win, a fully blue legislature are disaster for this nation, use it as fuel to GotV, to turn out as never before.   USE. IT.  ~✈️~
Biden ads are really effective and no one can convince me otherwise.

Hmmm, signs that the articles about religious voters defecting to Biden may be true....
I see Doug Jones getting AG if Biden wins. Biden was the only national Dem allowed to campaign in his Senate race. They are close.
he’s got a point biden is pretty racist and probablematic. if you look into his past you’d find that , however he isn’t worse than trump. he is racist but, he is actually making an effort to pretend to not be racist and heal the country
Biden wouldn't wear that shit. He's not a fascist. Nice try though...
Peaceful protesting, while citizenry are terrorized, trapped, and watch the city get destroyed.  And DemocRat leaders do nothing.  Sounds like a Biden admin in action.  Oh my.
When you think about it, it will much better if President Biden hangs President Obama’s portrait and we can pretend that the four year Orange Interregnum never happened.
I honestly think Biden has somewhat of a connection.yep biden and trump nobody’s arguing with you i don’t support either
follows biden and aoc also what’s your point bruh 😂
he follows biden and aoc too what’s your point

OK, it's wrong to call Joe Biden a TOKIN.
HOWEVER, Democrats are forcing Biden to select a female running mate who is black.  That makes her name today and forever on:  TOKEN.  It's a toke to the Liberal Democrats who demanded a black female running mate.
What the hell is wrong with #Catholic (&amp; other) anti-Trumpers?  Do they prefer that believers be forced by law to violate their faith?  If not, then they should thank  who changed the Obama-Biden HHS mandate so employers could offer morally acceptable health plans
But everybody knows that Kamala had sex with Mayor Willie Brown to get a job, and Biden is hoping for the same.  You must HATE Women.
What's not "COOL?" TRUTH?  Biden has been TOLD he has to select a female black running mate by multiple people &amp; organizations. That make her name TOKEN.  Given the fact that Kamala has spread her legs to get jobs in the past (Mayor Willie Brown) &amp; #CreepyJoe is a creep. COOL!
Kamala spread her legs to Mayor Willie Brown to get her first job.  That's probably why she's on Biden's short list.
It's not a shadow campaign against Ms. Token Kamala, it's her own past of having sex with Mayor Willie Brown to get a job, hating on Catholic judges for their values, and sending people to prison for 420 while bragging she was getting stoned.  Kamala/Biden is like Palin/McCain
Kamala spread her legs for Mayor Willie Brown to get her first job, Biden is probably hopeful.
Biden calls to defund police as crime in #Democrat-run cities soars.  Of course.  What else do you expect from a party that withdraws all protection from children in the first nine months of their lives?  Promoting #abortion weakens our ability to protect life at other stages.
I agree.  The ones voting for Biden are the people who are tearing down our #Catholic statues, running #abortion facilities, or working in some Catholic chanceries &amp; Catholic media outlets.
This is the best and most honest Joe Biden commercial ever.

Biden confesses, one of many confessions of New World Order -
Joe Biden has for YEARS supported "The New World Order" AKA (UN Agenda 21), AKA (Globalism); this is a one-class society of socialism controlled by the political and wealthy elite and GHBush signed us up for this with UN Agenda 21. Neo-Liberals support Capitalism, that's not Joe
Karen, is it your Church's job to defend your Church? Do you know that Biden and the Democrats want to re-institute the mandate that would force many believers to violate their faith, and that various dioceses (and we) fought all the way to the Supreme Court? We can't be neutral.
No, Carlos, it is not shame on me. It is shame on Biden, on the entire Democrat party, and on all their supporters, like you.
And speaking of Jesus, Carlos, do you want his followers told by the government that they cannot live their faith without being fined? That’s Biden. Do you want them to be able to preach and live their faith and pray in school and openly on campus? That’s Trump.
What’s the matter, Carlos, do you want socialism? That’s Biden. Do you want a strong economy for you and your family? The strongest one ever was built by Trump.
Speak the hell up, Carlos.  Do you want the world’s leading terrorists still alive and well and plotting terrorism against you and your loved ones? That’s Biden. Do you want them dead? Like they are now? That’s Trump.
Speak up, Carlos. Do you want open borders so the criminals can come in and attack your community? That’s Biden. Do you want security at our nation‘s borders in at the same time warmly and safely welcoming immigrants? That’s Trump.
Do you want to start, Carlos? So let’s start. How many babies do you want to see dismembered and decapitated? That’s Biden Or how many babies do you want to see protected? That’s Trump

I suppose Biden will be much better. Disgraceful.
I rather have Tucker/ Martha interview Mr. Biden!🇺🇸💪..Hannity/Laura are my first choice..but REALLITY!😂
Can we talk about important things without lying?  1. Joe Biden's dementia is a very real problem and we should address now rather than with the 25th Amendment  2. The attempted overthrow of the Office of the POTUS  3. Why news agencies lie about Trump
Happy to let VP Biden take over our neighborhoods! We are voting for   to be the next President of the United States. See you on November 3rd, 2020.
I'll try to say it politely, too --- Biden does not belong in the White House.Joe Biden Slams Trump Over Treatment of Latino Workers
Biden is supposedly considering someone named Bass as his VP.  Can you say fish face?
Agree. My only fear is that Biden may feel that he’ll be overshadowed by her, charismatic as Kamala is (which would be a shame).
Yeah that’s not entirely true - the entire dem platform is catered to republicans- they have zero leftist policies and nothing for independent voters - trump is even to the left of biden on foreign policy
What is your plan Mr Biden ??a lot of criticism but no plan ???

I don't think there's been any change in awareness of Joe Biden's platform from July 24 to July 29.  I think it's a lot more likely Change Research was just a shitty poll.   Let's see how the polls change over the next few weeks when we get a clearer view ✌
Not Donald Trump falsely attacking Joe Biden for not wanting to pick a Latino VP when HIS Vice President is   *checks notes*   Mike Pence
They’re already attacking Biden in Spanish TV ads for not picking a Latina VP. The ad is meant to turn brown people against black people. It isn’t going to work but it shows where they’re going.
🤣🤣🤣 more peopl votes for McCain against Obama than Bernie voters voted for trump. Stop putting shit candidates out there and you would get more votes. It doesn’t get more establishment than Clinton and Biden.
You're citing the Change Research poll. For what that's worth, it's rated poorly by 538. Other polls show a more sizable lead. Five days earlier, the better-rated pollster Fox had Biden far outside the MOE in each rust belt state

I’ve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What’s at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye 👋🏻
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.
And some want to vote for Biden so he can kiss Xi’s arse like did Putin !
We know that along with Biden, she’s Cuba’s choice.

You are wrong, the Castro stuff has PLENTY of teeth here in Florida. Trump has been running ads accusing Democrats of being "socialists" for weeks on Hispanic media, and it ABSOLUTELY moves the needle here. This would be a very bad choice for Biden if he wants to win Florida.
That’s kinda fair but I think the primary process turned out to be important and useful. Biden got better as it went on and Democratic bench got stronger.

with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget
The Biden campaign should be concerned about the secret $400,000 settlement  office paid to settle 'gender harassment' claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.
Trump and Biden are pretty equal on their terrible policies so yeah a vote for biden is a vote for trumps policies and a vote for trump is a vote for bidens policies

I think the decision is already made but the announcement was pushed back due to the John Lewis death and funeral. It would’ve been in bad taste to make a such positive announcement during a week of public mourning. DT likes to do things like that, not Joe Biden.
Biden never said that. I like Warren or Stacey Abrams. I strongly dislike Kamala Harris.

Newsom Cuomo Yang Gabbard Booker - all of them would have helped Biden win and govern. The choice now is simply woke posturing and foregone that it is a Women POC. Zero interest.
Exactly. I think most of us are not as excited with Biden himself.   The vote now is against Trump. We need to move on.
I think this can be like when McCain was with Palin.  She contributed tremendously to his loss.  I think Biden has to be smart but at this point we should all be so excited for Biden that it should not matter, yet here we are. Unexcited.

#Biden equals chaos!
🚨🚨🚨 If he doesn’t want to seriously  endanger his chances of winning Florida Joe Biden MUST steer clear of Bass as his choice for VP. She represents a MAJOR risk in a key swing state. Remember the cardinal rule for choosing a VP: “first, do no harm.” In Florida, she would.
Bruh. You don’t vote for Joe Biden, you ain’t black.
Can't wait to see who Biden's VP pick is...a man, or a woMAN 😏
Bass would be a terrible choice if Biden wants to win Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro’s death will cause a huge backlash from Florida’s Hispanic community, imperiling his bid to win the state. Not worth the MAJOR RISK she represents in a key swing state.
Joe Biden has been doing the same thing for 47 years and you're expecting change.... You might be a fool

I was talking Biden. But I don’t think he’s terribly happy with Trump either. Collapsed his bonds market. Had real issues with his economy due to denial of dollars.
After 47 years in Washington you think Biden now knows how to fix America.  Yes you are a fool. He's been problem.
“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it’s not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don’t believe me look at Joe Biden’s draconian record on black issues.

I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don’t go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it’s absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as “progress.” The only reason why Biden isn’t seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn’t? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn’t a single policy that Biden supports that I’m in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.

Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn’t any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn’t either. It’s pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats

Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn’t care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.
At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn’t want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!

These people are delusional.  That’s why I’ve changed parties, voting RED this November.  They criticize like if there is a “Guideline to Combat a COVID Pandemic” and was not followed.  They cannot even say something good about Biden. So, they criticize.
I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.
Joe Biden is dead.
The real Joe Biden has been in bed since 5:30 pm.   Who is this Paki ghost writer pretending Joe Biden gives a shit about some death-cult who’s entire history is replete with slavery and religious intolerance?   Barack, is that you?!
Joe Biden's list of accomplishments during his 8 year vacation in the Whitehouse.
I can see both sides but she’s the most telegenic of all of them and I think she would have Biden’s back fiercely so he can focus on policy and not get dragged into pissing matches with Trump She’s fierce
Folks, I have it on Good Authority #KamalaHarris is the #Biden #VP choice  #BidenHarris2020
Biden can’t speak a coherent sentence

1 there is a week of early voting, at any poll, close to work or home, takes 5 min 2 Absantee ballot is different from mail-in. Mail-in is like BedBath&amp;Beyond coupon,comes to every name ever been at the address 3 USPS endorsed Biden Conflict of interest Do yr part  VOTE IN PERSON
And so will Biden.
And Biden was actually videotaped and photographed grabbing... kissing... being a pedophile and also has accusations.. do the math, if you can...
While trump has said that, SAY.... we all have seen Biden actually grabbing them and kissing their ears, sniffing around... but of course David is too blind to see it! He rather go by hearsay....
Joe Biden is the nightmare, and when these idiots elect him in..it then too late. Bye bye America
And just so you know Kamala Harris our president has been scared of s*** it's your little Joe Biden that scared and hides in the basement.🤣
joe biden probably doesn’t remember tweeting that.
Joe Biden robs black people

Thats sounds a lot like Biden.
List how Joe Biden has stopped the same when he was Vice President? I’m not even pro trump fuck that guy ten ways to hell. But to act that Joe Biden will cure us of the very deep rooted racism in this country is naive as fuck.
No one likes Biden and people don't vote hate as much as you'd think.
The bar probably isn’t that high tbh, 2018 was decided by 10k votes and Dade was 60-40, I doubt Biden needs 65-35 to win statewide
Jokes have meaning. Memes hold truth. This one happens to be a Ridin’ with Biden sloganed “joke”, so excuse me for assuming some depth to anything coming out of that shallow pond.
America needs leadership. Vote Biden 2020.
It was not a funeral. It was a political rally in disguise. They used Lewis' corpse like they are using Biden.

Don’t care. Biden will be President.
It will be known when all legally cast votes are counted. Could be that night. Biden in a landslide.
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
I was watching and thought, oh noo, he caught whatever Joe Biden has, he thinks he's running a campaign again. I was hoping someone would remind him he was doing a eulogy. 🥴
These are Biden rallies....10 days for Ginsburg ?
This was a eulogy?  More like a campaign speech for Biden.  Shameful.

I don’t 100% agree with that. And although them and Biden aren’t the answer it’s a fuck ton better than the Dictator we currently have. I feel like PL is Atleast dividing the GOO
Like Joe Biden?
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Threaten to suspend it and then see how fast this mail in voting stops. This corona is serious stuff. The Dumbacrats say you don’t take it seriously and don’t do enough . Biden is stuck in his basement. You can’t do rallies and cancelled the RNC. Suspend the election. !!!!
I’m not against NATO, but the other countries have to meet their obligations, or by their actions they are saying they don’t care about NATO. Reagan comparisons aren’t valid as the USSR doesn’t exist and no one sees that China is that new threat yet. Even ppl like Biden
There is nothing that they can “uncover” about  Biden or his son  that would make me vote for DJT. Nothing.

Your placard insinuated that Biden's supporters are killing cops, destroying property, looting, etc. I didn't put those words in your mouth, you posted them. Don't post statements like that if you don't mean it. Again I assume you aren't in favor of cops shooting unarmed people.
Obama Biden was pretty bad.
Oh please try something else we aren’t buying what your selling about Biden. Florida for Biden
Joe Biden would need a handler to help him find the helicopter and navigate the stairs.
Biden will do and say whatever his "handlers" tell him to.  "Ignore the man behind the curtain"!
If .exe Biden wins, how long before no one cares about the virus?
Who knows gregg. Bumbling Biden doesn’t realize he even said that. You can see them already setting this thing up for claims of voter suppression . They call someone having to show a picture ID to vote , a form of voter suppression. Yep; suppression of an illegal vote!!!
He really is sleepy joe...so boring to watch. It’s like a nascar race; people go to see the wrecks. I just watch bumbling Biden to catch the next gaff ...!!!
You know what?.. I’m not even gonna debate this, I’m glad you came around and decided to vote for biden!
I can't wait till you're our FLOTUS. We really need one that does important work like this. Thank you Dr. Biden.
Wait.  What happened to the “summer of love”? How do people with a mental IQ of 50 get elected?  How is a sub zero IQ man Biden the Democratic nominee? Where are the real democrats? Cowering in the corner with the GOP? If we don’t fight we lose America.Equation: DEM=GOP.  No dif.
Nadler and Swalwell are tied for this honor, but Biden definitely has them both beat !
Joe Biden IS A NOTHING !!!
Lets just buy minorities their own business, and have the Biden Family and the Chinese run it for them !
We will in Florida. Florida for Biden
Her voice is an important voice, but I don't know anything about her.
Biden?   jumped all over your Veep announcement
Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
Biden must win.
this is so pathetic to answer presubmitted questions by pre approved reporters. This is what North Korea and communist China do.  Biden is so feeble he cannot do a real press event with real questions without a teleprompter.  I'm embarrassed for you.
Ok... Biden believes whatever they tell him to believe. Gun sales are going through the roof. There are almost as many democrats buying them as republicans. I hate the two party system. I feel they are holding us hostage. Nobody feels safe right now.
... I’ve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it’s a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
....so he hasn’t always been in favor of Biden... imo it’s pretty sad that it took trump to openly show people like Kyle that he’s a fascist, it took fucking lay after park to change him mind smh
Florida for Biden
If you tell republicans Covid is a hoax, they will believe you, no evidence. If you tell republicans Biden wants to defund the police, they will believe you, again, no evidence. Independent thinking is not a strong republican trait and they are often exploited as a result.
Wait is he voting for biden now?
I find Wallace to be very fair and a great interviewer. He goes after the questions and the story, not favoritism. He looks for holes in the story regardless of which side of the isle it is coming from.  That showcases great weakness and trouble for Biden’s messaging.
WAYNE ROOT: BIDEN = “BIGGEST IDIOT DEMOCRATS EVER NOMINATED”
Look I get it, if Biden wins with a coalition with a lot of moderate support and some anti trump Republicans you're worried that you'll get left behind. I get it. But I feel like that's a less important issue that what's actually happening right now, which is causing death
Trump only started to care about the coronavirus in the last 2 weeks bc it's spreading in states he views as important to his reelection. And trump has built his entire persona on racial fears of white America. Like yeah Biden has issues, but if you think some bad bills=trump
Meanwhile trump won't even go there at all. But the people that won't bite or write in Bernie or some shit will keep saying there is no difference between Biden and Trump
Right now you see what a true President does when he respects our heroes. Biden is paying his respects for John Lewis

Come on Tapper, don't be a hater. Wallace's interview of trump was excellent. And, he was definitely tough on trump. I support Biden so don't think I'm one of those Fox News loving n..s. Wallace holds people accountable and doesn't let them get away with double talk. Always has.

Joe Biden will reform the police. Not de-fund them.  Spread the word.
As a candidate Biden is a normal human being, and shows humane qualities like empathy. Trump, in terms of personal qualities, is clearly one of the worst human beings in America.   So a friend said, 'But the Democrats are just as bad'
.....they try to put her in good favor grouping her comments with Obama and John Kerry. Don’t be fooled by her. Poor Biden doesn’t know which way is up and the socialists will lead him to her and others like her (AOC-the frauds not squad)
Saw a bumper sticker for Biden yesterday &amp; realized I can't safely put a Trump sticker on my car or wear my Trump 2020 hat because the left are violent and out of control. Pretty sad state of affairs when we have to live in fear of the opposing political party.
100 days until we can say President-Elect Joe Biden. This is not going to just magically happen, it will take hard work from us all. #BlueWave2020 #JoeBiden #Biden2020
No, dear. The Obama-Biden administration ended in 2017. We use the past tense for things that are no longer happening. Surely there’s a book somewhere in the White House you can consult?

Look, I'll say it, Biden is not my first choice for President, but I intend to vote for him.  Another 4 years of trump would be a disaster. We will barely survive this term. It's going to take years to undo the damage trump has done both domestically and globally.
remember, if you aren’t voting Biden, YOU ARE VOTING TRUMP. just remember that the next time you repost something on your story about BLM, abolishing ICE, wearing a mask, or anything else💙 #Biden2020 #FlipFLBlue #DumpTrump
Waste your vote 😆 biden and bernie socialist have already lost
Yeah bernie is busy figuring out a way to bankrupt America and biden will do the same and then forget he did it. Face it, your socialists have lost this fight due to incompetence.
Bernie is a joke...Biden is right there with him. One wants to bankrupt us and the other would bankrupt its but then forget he did it at all...maybe even forget he was president if he was in office. 😄 🤣 nor bernie or biden are fit or will ever be president in 2020

BIDEN CANT SPEAK A COHERENT SENTENCE IN ENGLISH! TRUMP 2020 LANDSLIDE!!!!
I like Tucker but dont watch fox much anymore. At&amp;t TV has OAN. Much better than Fox. I do watch Chris Wallace. I dont however think Biden could make it through one of his interviews. I would like to see it.
There is a really good series on OAN. One America News. Its called the Biden Bribe Tapes Investigation. There are parts 1&amp;2 but the investigation is ongoing so there may be more now.
And why is the Ukraine seeking criminal charges against Biden?
Why are you voting for Biden?
If you want complete sentences you are not voting for Biden right?
This is why I don’t believe the polls! Explain how Biden is ahead when he has less than 10% like/followers than Trump on Facebook?
Joe Biden can’t even form a coherent sentence. Biden is clearly facing some BAD cognitive decline. He wasn’t always this stupid!
Joe Biden can’t speak a coherent sentence
I really don't see John Roberts sitting out the swearing in ceremony. After Biden is sworn in, I think it would be fairly easy to have him removed. I actually look forward to that moment myself.

I voted for  in #Florida. Even though she'd dropped out before our primary (which is a ludicrous part of our current system btw). I think Biden is one of the worst candidates out of the final 8-10 in the race. But I'll still vote for him over a blatantly despicable Trump!

The Biden campaign is going to do everything they can to avoid the debates and run out the clock as long as the polling shows them with a lead. They’ll duck and dodge and keep the focus on COVID19 and protests and keep the clock running till November.
Unfortunately, that is EXACTLY why some people are going to vote for    They WANT this level of anarchy and know a Biden Administration is helpless to stop them. His election will be consent to continue to take the country apart.   My best, Sir.
Sute Biden is busy!! He could not make it through the interview! When are the Dems gonna stop playing with us and tell is who the real candidate is?❤🇺🇸
More Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in Donald Trump’s presidency, putting the incumbent in a perilous position as his reelection bid against Democrat Joe Biden enters a pivotal stretch.

If you’re one of the people on this threading seeking to defend this comment by Joe Biden, you’re probably as dim as he is. And that’s saying quite a bit. It’s condescending and insulting to American voters, all while kissing the CCP’s ass by parroting their talking points.
No, I am not easily fooled.  Do you believe everything you see on the internet? I believe in freedom and the only candidate that is for freedom in Trump.  Biden is for taking freedoms away. When you are free, you can achieve anything you desire.In case you wonder why Biden leads in the MSM polls, the answer is easy, you cannot steal an election when polls consistently have you down double digits. I have never seen a balanced poll of registered dems, indys, and repubs where Trump wasn’t ahead by at least 30 points.
IF YOU WANT A CROOKED LIAR IN THE WHITE HOUSE VOTE FOR BIDEN !!!

ITS THE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR LIBERAL COUNTERPARTS.THEY ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK BAD--BUT IT WON,T WORK. WE DO NOT NEED A LIAR CROOK LIKE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT !!!
Yes, of course. Biden and Democrats all down the ballot.
You mean like Biden is now?
Consider this, if the Lord wills it that Joe Biden becomes the next president and how that will affect the church.   Prepare now.
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate: THATS BS--HE SPOKE FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE. BIDEN IS A COMPLETE JERK THAT SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE WILL NOT SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE GOING ON. HE IS A RACIST-HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST BUSING
Joe Biden is talking, but he’s out of it. Rambling and eyes not focused?
I wouldn't vote for Biden if I found out he was a sexual preditor who separated children from their parents and locked them up and he planned on building a private army to attack peaceful protesters.
You need to help this go viral! The Obama and Biden administrative plan called AFFH will be implemented totally if Biden wins the election it becomes federal rule over local and state laws. Look it up. It’s destroys the subberbs ( single home zoning), police &amp; local Gov. control!
Joe puts bidet in Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I remember when President-Elect Clinton convened an economic conference in Dec 1992 prior to his inauguration so that his administration could better tackle the recession on Day 1. Biden will have so much on his plate Jan 2021, he needs nominees and policies ready in Nov 2020.
WHAT WOULD CROOKED JOE BIDEN DO IF IN OFFICE ? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING-THATS WHAT HIM AND OBAMA DID FOR 8 YEARS. AND THATS WHAT BIDEN WOULD DO IF ELECTED. HOW COULD HE ? HE CANNOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. HE IS NOT THE PERSON TO BE ELECTED. REMEMBER---HE LIES BIG TIME !!
He wants this country to be communist. His agenda has always been Marxist and now he and Biden have the corrupt democrats to support it because all they ever want is power over the people. Biden won’t be running this country. The evil Soros and Obama marxists will be in charge!This is funny. yet not very effective. Good try . i do not feel like voting Biden at all? Maybe Biden should actually speak? Run all the ads you want he still has to get on a debate stage

Who would you like to see as VP under Joe Biden? And do you think he is receptive to feminist changes to our government?  I've never considered him an ideal candidate but that's because I'm ready for a female president even if America is too misogynist to see the advantages.
What are you even talking about?? Biden has never said he doesn’t want schools open...he says he wants it done SAFELY. Which means that schools need money to make that happen. Not really hard to grasp if you have half a brain 🙄

No way! Every single day matters to Joe Biden.
Because in April he attacked Biden for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election and well, Trump just suggested to delay the election. Haha
Then Trump will forfeit the election by not taking the field which will award Biden the presidency by default. Trump will have to be removed by force.

We will when Biden is POTUS
You are not his paid shill. So why answer for him?  If you can, I can:  best campaign strategy is to hide and let  ‘govern’ and talk.
Biden will pardon them all. You? Nah...
You had every right to "school" Joe Biden about his prior viewpoints. You were firm but not over-the-top. You are objectively the most qualified to be both VP and POTUS. I am rooting for you.
Biden:  We need a President who will take responsibility instead of blaming others!  Me:  Does that mean we can stop blaming living white people for the actions of dead white people?

There have been pets in the White House for decades, I dare to say, except for the last 3 years.  Hmmmmmm  What is it they say about animals and their ability to sense that there is something "wrong" with a person?  Good Boy for Pres, Joe Biden Presidential Advisor ;)

Times are only tough because you Democrats are Deliberately making things tough with riots you refuse to control while you hide out from the people in hope's we won't see how inept and weak you are. PUPPET BIDEN.
I mean, those polls are always correct.  But here is what can't be faked...there are Trump sign s EVERYWHERE in Florida.  Biden may have a flag or two, but is DWARFED by Trump.  Stock up on tissues SNOWFLAKE :)

Which one? Wallace or Biden? Both have weak games; Biden’s is mental deficiency.  Wallace’s is moral deficiency; doesn’t even attempt objectivity anymore.  Maybe he’s just exhausted from resting on his laurels, family legacy.
Mr. Biden, tear down this wall!
Both parties have been selling out this country to china. Thats why they hate him some much. He does what he thinks is right not what the permanant Washington elites want. Just saying thats how we see it. I don't always agree with him but all in all Trump or biden. Trump all day!
Well im just wondering what he has done so wrong. I will admit i don't like his mouth but his policies have been fairly good. Joe Biden is just an old retread. The news make trump out to be a monster. He has a big ego and a big mouth, but he gets things done.

Hiden Biden said what? Nothing at all of course because he’s currently sniffing his own jeans thinking they are an 8 year olds hair.
The left only supports Biden so Trump won't win so a black woman can become president. Biden is too empty minded to realize his "friends" aren't really by his side for the long run. As well, him choosing a black woman as president, due to the reasoning, is sexist and racist.
You know if Biden wins, 200 days from now he won't be president anymore. The liberals know he will be a bad president. They are going to try to impeach him as soon as they can because he is not fit for the position just so a black woman can be president.
I hope Biden tears it down in his first month as President
Why the hell, would Biden even involve himself in how stupid that test was?? It’s a medical test to determine dementia/Alzheimer’s.  A freaking gorilla passed it.... obviously, nothing to do with IQ!
We shut down travel with China in January. Thank goodness we didn't listen to these leaders; Deblasio: "enjoy a night out in Chinatown" Pelosi: "The Chinese New Year's Parade is safe.' Biden: "This is xenophobic hysteria."
If Biden wins (and I pray that doesn’t happen), he will not be the one in the driver’s seat. He will be the figure head for the radical left. He will be a puppet president.

Think about this.  Biden is ahead by close to ten points nationally and leading in every swing state and he hasn't announced his VP candidate yet.  Look for a bounce this week.  Now the campaign needs to concentrate on getting out the vote.
Never happen Mr Biden

It is amazing how little self-awareness Trump has that he would call Biden a "buffoon". Biden is self-effacing, humble, humorous, riant, generous, spirited, fit, loving, a goofy grandpop, a kind (if not overly permissive) father, a supportive &amp; proud husband. His friendships are

That would be Obama and Biden.......
Still didn’t answer! Of course for Biden lol joke
Of course Biden has a lead in South Florida. He’s been leading in polls in the state for months, and Democrats largely win the state through South Florida.  And national polls mean plenty, especially when the lead is this big. Big national poll leads point to large state leads.

? Trump will never leave office, period. Biden will win but trump and his lackey Barr, will not obey the will of the people. So, looks like Trump will not leave whether Lincoln Merch is sold or not. Ridiculous theory.
Like, there are other reasons to not pick Kamala Harris, but “she might want to run for president” seriously isn’t one of them lol.  Whoever Biden picks SHOULD have the ability and ambition to succeed him, especially if he’s only a one-term president.
I’m voting for Biden because I believe he is a decent man and I trust him to build a team of good decision makers around him. I’m sacrificing my policy views and possibly certain financial interests for what I believe is country over party. Full stop.

So,  basically,  Biden will lie or conceal his true intentions in order to get elected? D--n,  this politics business is hard work!
Essential that if Biden is told to add Harris or Warren as VP that Republicans pound home that Biden has already told us he won't do a whole term and the VP will essentially be President.  Could be in the first year.
Now if you’d actually read ANY on Biden’s plans we could have an adult discussion, but that obviously out if the question
Biden isn't taking healthcare away a  Pandemic or abusing peaceful protestors. False equivalency doesn't wash with those who practice logic
That is what concerns me about the upcoming election. I left the Democrat Party several years ago as I believed then and continue to believe now that the Democrats biggest problem is the Democrats. I will however vote for Biden
Biden's notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris  via
Respectfully, the Democrats dont plan on giving him anything. He will be like a hamster in a cage running on a wheel.  They are/will control EVERYTHING he does.  A vote for Biden is a vote for a group of left interest groups pulling the strings.
It will be essential for Republicans to refer whomever pathetic Joe Biden is told to take on board as "Ms. President."  Let people know every minute of every day that he will NOT be President, but she will within a year when he resigns for health reasons.
BIDEN DOES NOT WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE. STOP LYING!!!
Here's a secret. People of the radical left view Biden as conservative. We do not like him, and he refuses to commit to anything we want.  But y'know, keep on keepin' on with the fear mongering, I guess. 😐  Hail Satan.

Just because Joe Biden is mentally unfit to hold office doesnt mean Trump isn’t as well. Can we have a 3rd option? Lol
They asked Biden what flavor jello he had for lunch.
Biden was right! If you question the left... “YOU AIN’T BLACK!”
Joe Biden-handlers are already writing “What happened 2.0”  Adam Schiff is already manufacturing “evidence” that Trump did ‘something’ wrong.  Nancy Pelosi is already blaming “voter suppression” on Biden’s loss.  All we need to do is wait for November now...
Sure and Biden without a track record is more qualified. Not happening. Trump 2020.

Former Obama advisor Susan Rice emerges as a serious contender for Joe Biden's VP pick
They say past presidents are just puppets. Nothing new with Brain-Dead Biden. Back to normalcy and corruption. Speaking of which, your dad needs to move faster on censorship and the fake virus panic, including masks, and a full open up of the economy, Friggen NOW. No vaccines.
Fuck outa here, Klobuchar dropped out and supported Biden and then Pete was like “holy shit, what a coincidence, I was going to drop out before Super Tuesday too!” I can’t do this if you are going to be purposefully obtuse. Remember this convo when the book on ‘20 is written
If Biden wins they will go away.
Biden didn’t win on policy, he won bc the DNC and Obama made an incredible Hail Mary and got everyone who wasn’t Sanders to drop out and support Biden. I’m not even mad, it was amazing. Attributing that win to Biden’s platform is a mistake, the policy being complete shit aside
Why do you continue to conflate Biden votes as votes against M4A? I’m guessing that there is no moral or financial argument that can be made so you are making a strategic one, yet M4A is overwhelmingly popular. You already identified why ppl voted Biden and it isn’t the ACA

Mr. Biden You can’t be trusted. You talk out of both sides of your mouth ALL THE TIME. You lie constantly, the Covid numbers are so clearly inflated and easy to prove, your record going back forty years on race is appalling, You all but say you don’t want “ them” on your block.
On Tax Day, difference between Trump, Biden is on full display
Trying to win what? Earn your vote? Why? Vote for whomever you want.   You have two choices - Trump or Biden or a passive vote for the winner. This election will have huge consequences for the future of the US, so throwing away one's vote in 2020 would be pretty irresponsible.
Biden’s reclaiming his time
Does the model bake in regression or diminishing returns when a candidate is quite far ahead? Would it have Biden by 10.2 on Election Day as likely as Biden by 6.2?
How can dems say they can fix things when: A:  They're the ones breaking them  B:  Biden is the best they can do for a presidential candidate
Lets not confuse a Biden vote as a vote against M4A: like you said, most ppl voted bc Biden was perceived as the best to beat trump, and then a majority in every state said they were for M4A I’m exit polls, a fact every Sanders supporter is acutely aware of
Joe Biden has to read aloud the reporters name to next ask a question? There's only about 8 people there?

Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I’m Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
My Takeaway from todays "Hearing" 1) Democrats have gone over the edge, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!  2) Republicans have all but given up in this "Fight"  3) AG Barr has the nerves of a SAINT.  4) Swalwell is still the laughing stock of the Democrats.  5) If Biden wins, we're F'ed!

It’s rare that he sticks his head up. They told Biden, “Hey Barr is killing us, hurry up and get out the basement”.

If you would actually educate yourself on the matter you would know that Biden actually wants to give 300 mill more to the police... so yeah I don’t think that means defunding. It’s all on his website
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!
It was annoying when they relegated her to VP as she ran for President. Such BS. And obviously she would be a great AG. She'd be great in any Cabinet position. If she took it she'd be doing Biden a favor. She's the best choice for VP. EOS. ("sewing" 😂😂😂)
Well, in the 90s, Dems veered to the right in the aftermath of the Clinton era, so that was certainly true for a time. But these days I’d say that isn’t really accurate anymore. The party has been drifting leftward for years now, and that’s evident in recent Biden policies.

When President Obama took office the DJIA was at 7949.09. When he left office it was at 19,827. The markets did great under Obama/Biden (44/46) You are polling behind Biden. The market has factored in the possibility (probability)of your defeat &amp; it's doing better than it should.
It’s a weird answer, but she’s not exactly wrong. Poll after poll has shown voters are more excited to vote against Trump then for Biden, so “I just want to get rid of Trump” is fine, if needlessly over complicating what should be a simple answer. I’d be surprised if she loses.

And all of you "Justice is coming "Soon" people" understand that a President Biden would stop EVERY investigation currently underway on day one, right?  Durham and his "hammer" will be riding the train home with a smug face...
You were voting for Biden before. You were never voting for Trump.  What he's saying is there are people in the middle who were going to vote for Biden who may switch to Trump because of the insanity we are all witnessing.
I didn’t consider us opponents because a) I feel sorry about how misguided you are b ) nationalism and neo-conservatism aren’t  mutually exclusive c) Trump, the leader of your movement, is going to set you back due to his clear and present failures d) I’m voting Biden anyway

The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here
You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.

Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.

Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.

So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.

have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.
I wondered if Biden would pick him for VP?
You mean a Fake Ad about Joe Biden
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don’t do anything without talking to each other.
Will your president ever condemn Biden for his racist comments ?

While he's on my TV eulogizing John Lewis, this popped up in my feed.
A lot of NIMBY’s are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY’s, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.
You are definitely voting for Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂
95 percent of liberals said they plan to vote for Biden and 86 percent of conservatives said they plan to vote for Trump. Among moderates, Biden leads Trump 63 to 22 percent.

This is what the Democrats- Pelosi and Biden and Nadler call a myth 😂😂😂
Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Clinton Sistah Souljah: “I‘m a Clinton Democrat!” Biden fundraiser comments: “Fuck Joe Biden” Lmao Absolute 🤡
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
I don’t think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there’s a “red wave” in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
via  I’m so sorry ⁦ we are kicking you out on November 3. #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd
I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

No one’s voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, “Stupid” too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.

i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
Vice President Joe Biden, please tell President Barack Obama to return Abigail to Pollyanna.  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!  Pollyanna 🇺🇲 🏛 🇺🇲

I’m a Neoliberal and Biden supporter. So no?
Can’t wait for Biden to get in there and executive order everything you did right back into existence. Are ya ready for it!!!!
This is correct...there were plenty of Obama stuff even more Trump stuff a little Hillary and nothing for Biden
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She’s senile along with Biden
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
Hunter Biden looks 1000 times better, murderer
Where are all their masks.??Joe Biden thinks he is running for the senate and he was never a quality human. Explain how someone in a government job for 50 years becomes wealthy. He embarrasses the country every time he speaks.

Kamala Harris selected as VP, will be the worse choice, that Biden could do, it would signal that those whom doubt his mind clear condition, are right and correctly doubt his qualification.  The most idoneous ticket reflecting smart and sound selection, would be Condolence Rice.

That's why democrats want mail in ballots,  because it's the only way Bumbling Biden would win!
That’d be a nice change of pace, no? A president should attend to matters of state while his social media team utilizes this platform to educate and interact, not as the tip of the legislative sword nor as a distraction! By golly, we agree! Let Biden’s handlers use Twitter!
We can only hope when Biden’s in we can get some traction on this! It’s bad enough how many perpetrators of #SexCrimes #Rape either get off completely or get super light sentences. The Judiciary doesn’t protect women&amp;children with the current system in place.

Funny how Dem run cities are allowing this but it's Trumps fault....as is Biden would be the one in control, what a laughtrump is so bored when he attacks biden. he doesnt have nearly the energy he did when going after hillary.

Do people who vote Libertarian take votes away from Trump or Biden?
You already do. Bernie has influenced Biden’s platform, he talks to Elizabeth Warren weekly.
Remember . . . what would Dems have done different . . . keep in mind Biden and other Dems called the China travel bans xenophobic. And . . . our economy was record strong BEFORE the virus using policies Dems voted against.
if biden wins he should commit to conducting the census for real, to overcome all the bs trump threw up and the virus. no reason we can't do a real census in 2022. the count is vital to our future.
"joe biden actually secretly defunded the police" is not an attack anybody but the dumbest trump zombies will buy. but sure, go with that.

That's actual footage, cupcake.  Biden likely has Alzheimer's, and it's getting worse.
Biden never undermined democracy and became an authoritarian. He help fixed the economy the last time republicans tanked it and we will do it again
Biden would never let this happen. Go Joe in 2020!
Brilliant move by Trump though. We know mail in voting will have issues, if Trump wins, and Dems cry foul, he says I told you so. If he loses, it will be a stain on Biden's election as we continue to find uncounted ballots through 2022.
For God’s sake, Biden &amp; Bolshevik Bernie are on VIDEO admitting they wouldn’t have done anything to stop Covid regardless and we wouldn’t have even known about it. Only reason we even know of it and doing anything is because “Trump is POTUS and we must play games regardless.”
Voting for Biden and helping get the monster out of the WH is in no way a wasted vote
All these things can be true at the same time: - Trump is morally unfit for office. - Biden is morally unfit for office. - Trump has helped millions of Americans. - Trump has ignored the plight of millions of human beings. - The only good thing about Biden is that he isn't Trump.
upset that Biden backers can't vote Absent Minded...
I am so sick of Trump's  attack ads on Biden. Biden doesnt attack Trump. Hes an honest person and I hope he will be our next President!

Biden calls the demon seed woman a "disgrace" and calls out Trump for pushing her nonsense.
if they open up Biden will have to debate Trump live on stage. This lockdown is of course going thru the election.

Its taken me awhile 2 come around 2  but watching him In recent days facing #MAGAExtremists &amp; inviting them to hug &amp; talk it out in private knowing  invokes violence has proved 2 me he deserves my vote, not that Trump WOULD EVER get it but BIDEN I GOT YOU
Yes. If Biden is elected the corruption will be normal and applauded.
BOA donates $1B too ok BLM/Biden.  What are they funding between now and November 3rd?  Putting more ANTIFA on payroll to wreak havoc.  This will be investigated.
People are already using Biden winning the primary to write off all number of progressive policies. Neoliberal twitter loves to argue that Americans don’t want M4A because Biden said he was against it and won, polling be damned.
First thing when Biden is President kick Barr out and all Trumps appointees
trump says "sperm dna" crackpot is an "important voice." but one time joe biden said state when he should have said city, so both sides.
the future of the democrats is boat parades and biden is still on the docks
Does anyone really think Joe Biden is capable of forming an opinion on anything anymore.
But the people spoke back then and didn't want Biden's Hoover.
Biden sucks also!
Please don’t waste our money why you just let Dr Biden take care of that!
Every vote counts and she’s playing games about endorsing Biden? What the hell? Does anyone want to remind her how her state went in 2016?

Still no boat parades from Biden. Clock is ticking.

JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER HAD A BOAT PARADE. *EVER*
I can agree with the gender gap in pay but even looking at women vs women the gap is not astronmical on a weekly basis of income. Asains make the most then white, black,  hispanic. I dont agree with Biden however that women havent been given a fair shot. Thats a loose statement
Best thing I’ve heard all day: “We can’t beat Trump by hating Trump, we have to beat Trump by being positive about Biden. “ And there’s plenty to be positive about! #foffl  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
theres no fracturing of the base. biden has consolidated it.
The media is just hurting Biden ...  I don’t think they know  😔
Joe Biden is what Trump wished for
This tweet shows how insane with hate Joe has become. [Who cares if anyone likes Biden or if he has dementia. He is not Trump]. This is why Trump will win in Nov. He is not a DC insider like Benedict Walsh.
Because he and Biden are the same
I believe your purpose in these posts is to dissuade Conservatives from voting for Trump. You have no other purpose other than to disparage Trump  and sow dissent in conservative circles in order to convince some not to vote. To not vote is a vote for Biden. Good try though
Do you think there will be any presidential debates occurring this hear between Joe Biden and Donald Trump?
Okay so no Biden, no Trump, no elections. What then ?
So Biden for you then. You’d choose an empty suit over Trump, a senile empty suit at that ?
Joe Biden is supposedly going to pick his VP Nominee this week and while some say Sen. Kamala Harris is the favorite, my prediction is Susan Rice. #BidenVP #SusanRice
Biden Takes Aim At Tax Cheats Like Amazon
Oh Jerry. He's got Biden syndrome.
Red Joe Biden, the secret Trojan horse for communism who is also nearly dead and who doesn't write his own press releases and wants to defund the police, is some kind of Fox News mad libs. And that's the Trump-led GOP message with under 100 days to go.
The GOP messaging on Biden is so obviously bad my conspiratorial mind keeps assuming it's a sinister fake out. It isn't, because they're running on Trump's ego not any real strategy. But still it's hard to believe.
I just want one with 1/2wit Biden and DJT!

A vote for Biden is a vote for his Vice President. Biden will quickly be deemed unfit to be president. Old bait and switch.  So..... if you plan to vote for Biden you don’t know who your voting for.
Biden framed an innocent man who he knew was innocent &amp; his too much of a coward to take one question. #HidenBiden

Joe Biden is a senile empty suit
Yeah, Stephen. Really. We will make sure Trump gets reelected, because Biden will destroy your "little patch" of America faster than you can say "I got hairy legs"!
I don’t like Biden. I hope he wins.
Biden over his life has been nothing more than a power mongering hypocrite. Being the butt of jokes at the end of his corrupt life seems to be the perfect pay back. The millions sitting in jail for victimless crimes because of his 1994 crime bill have no sympathy.
OK, just so I'm clear: Trump ads show turmoil in the streets Today, under His administration and, at the same time, are claiming that, "This is what America would be like in a Biden administration!" Please let me know if I'm missing something here #PortlandProtest #TrumpMeltdown
AOC wants to make it Law that Shoplifting be legal for anyone who’s hungry. Why not Breaking &amp; Entering &amp; Home Invasion? She’s a Main Democrat Party Spokesperson, So This is Now a Main Policy Of The Socialist Democrats &amp; Biden. Is this for Drug Adicts to? OH, How Loving🤡
Reality, sweetheart, it’s reality. Just like Biden has dementia.
And there you go.  Twist it against Biden.  I’m afraid AOC would agree with her.
But they’ll only admit that to their audiences *after* a Biden loss because Bernie was no longer a threat to them, &amp; they could still have the increased viewership &amp; revenue that Trump provides them, for the next 4 years. That’s it. It was a cynical game, to protect their profits
I hope Biden wins, but if he loses to Trump  (b/c he was always a huge gamble), you’ll see the media start mentioning that maybe the candidate who supported the most popular policies in history among all voters (including Independents), aka Bernard Sanders, was the better choice.
Not the same guy as he was in 2019 and into the beginning of 2020. Just not the same guy. Seems I know less about him than I do about Biden.

Biden can’t put a sentence together and thinks nurses blew stuff up his nose and went home to get him pillows. Wtf is that?
I'm thinking it's not just Biden people. We HAVE to get Trump out IMMEDIATELY. Voting for Joe is our only option at this point and THEN let's try and make real changes on the independent front. Trump is just too dangerous to allow anymore time.
Biden doesn't even know where he is inside his own basement.
Biden’s “folks”.......
I think it’s important to get someone who won’t be divisive for the next election Bc of that reason. IDK if Demmings is ready now to be president but if she’s VP  for 4 years then she would be. The problem is I’m not sure if she’s ready to be President if Biden gets called home
Your nonsensical ramblings are making you seem more and more like a Joe Biden burner account.
Exactly. Now there's no chance of their being a live Trump vs Biden debate which is exactly what the DNC and China wanted when they started all of this.
People are voting against trump, not for Biden. Says a lot about how much trump sucks
theres no actual point to this briefing other than trump is losing to biden
damn it.
just realized biden is an eagles fan. this is a problem. #canceled
Biden wasn't fooled. Maybe because he doesn't trust Xi. "We found that Biden did warn about a potential pandemic as long ago as January, and talked about some steps the administration should take. A fuller, detailed plan came weeks later."
I feel like we should start taking bets on who he blames today.  Biden, Obama, China, Fox all seem good guesses but I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say today he goes to a new low and blames the people who have died. If they didn't die there wouldn't be so many deaths.If u think Biden is going to defund the police, take ur guns &amp; raise your taxes, u’ve done 0 research &amp; a sucker to media trump wanted u to believe. It’s ok if u fell for it, it was designed to be convincing. But you still have time to learn more! Our future depends on it.
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar
We did not see this violence during the Obama/Biden years, we are seeing dystopian America under  .
Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. 🙂
Great. Let’s bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that—just until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.

It’s also notable that this means the first female Vice-President - and quite plausibly the first female President some day - will more likely than not be a black woman.   Biden’s VP would start off as the favorite to win the nomination to succeed him in the next open primary.
It’s notable that 4 of Biden’s finalists on his shortlist for VP are black women - Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Val Demings &amp; Karen Bass.   Black women voters are a big reason he won the nomination. They came out for him strong in South Carolina.
Susan Rice has now overtaken Kamala Harris in the betting markets, as Biden announces he will reveal his running mate next week. #veepstakes

This is literally the result of a Trump presidency.   If Biden doesn't win and this keeps up, what are the shit for brain Republicans gonna say then?
I love how GOP reps are crying that there was no congressional oversight over the Obama Biden administration with the doj. What were the 16 investigations of Hillary Clinton and Benghazi with no indictments????? needs to shut up.. he's going down with Trump
Let Biden go between the buildings and ANTIFA.
AG Barr, when has  asked for the violence and attacks to stop! Instead of saying “Law and Order”, he could speak to the protestors. Fcking stupid statement to make of Biden without the same for the POS in Chief!
Lol conservatives are liking and retweeting my last tweet without reading my profile. I also don’t like Barr either. I wish he would resign. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry than this hearing like electing Biden.
I hope Biden chooses Elizabeth Warren who will be tough on corporations and the pharmaceutical companies.
People vote for who they think will do the best for the job. An employer hires likewise, the candidate with the best credentials. Trump has proven his. What has Biden proved. Predator, liar, actual quid pro quo actor, dementia, womanizer and coward.
“This is what America would look like under Biden” they say, playing footage of America under Trump.
So, since there are about 100 days before the election and we have to choose between Biden and Trump, what do you suggest we do??? 🤔
Barr is on Capitol Hill. I'm surprised he showed. He's there to lie and disrespect Congress.   President Biden's (🙏🙏🙏) AG can bring charges.  House subpoenas will mean something.
If Biden wins (🙏🙏🙏) it will be 1st female VP.
I will be surprised if Barr shows up.   If he does he will be disrespectful and dishonest.   President Biden's AG can get Barr for Lying to Congress if that's the case.
Can’t wait for trump to blame Obama and Biden for this one
You can be certain that Joe Biden will not take America down the road of tyranny!

Biden thanks you.
Having read the gossip pieces on her campaign’s internal dysfunction (which I always take with a grain of salt), Biden’s team seems to think she’s be a constant source of drama in the White House, putting her 2024 ambitions first. She also has little clout on the Hill.
A Trumpless Future Is Hard to Get Your Head Around
Biden’s lead in the polls has been consistent enough where he has more latitude in his VP choice now. While Harris is a great surrogate, reading about the internal chaos in her campaign leaves the impression she’d be a source of drama in the WH, &amp; put her 2024 ambitions first.

Yeah you aren't helping your cause by blatantly lying. Biden wants to raise taxes on higher tax brackets and corporations. Your dad's tax cuts have utterly failed. From Forbes who is hardly liberal,
What if the elite are playing the conspiracist and actually trump was the bad one and Biden is good. Lol oh well that isn’t the case cus them fucking Democrats out here eating babies
Tim Apple.. Kansas City, Kansas... etc...  Sorry sweetie if you want to use the "demented card" look in the mirror!!!!  A lifetime of Biden misspoken words = ONE Trump rally. #DementiaDon
That is a great slogan FIRED UP AND READY FOR JOE!!!!!
Funny how many people close to you are criminals.  Stop deflecting you are talking about yourself. The Trump/Pence admin. is the most corrupt in history.  Obama/Biden administration had No crimes, charges, impeachment, or investigations against them..NADA!
Please "friend" Vice-President Joe Biden. We need to have more information about how great Biden will be as President!
Wow.  That Biden rally sure looks exciting.
I will be getting a BIDEN/______ 2020 Bumper Sticker. Unless it's Warren. Then it will just be Biden 2020. He won't pick Warren anyway. She was a pain in his ass for 8 years. Not in a good way either.
His TL is all about Warren. That explains that. Joined May 200.🇷🇺
Sadly, the extremely leftist liberal biased communist news, will ignore anything dementia Biden says. He is unfit to be anything other than to stay safely tucked away in his basement.
I think his only chance of winning is if he picks  or  as his VP. Yeah they have huge differences but Biden needs to get the f*** over it. He needs to these voter bases in order to win.
He deserves to be screwed. Keep being an idiot and supporting these radical leftist communist. This will be the new utopia if Biden becomes elected. We can all say goodbye to our freedoms and constitution. Wake up people

Kind of sad when Biden makes little comments to try to stay relevant
You're talking about Joe Biden's crime bill, btw. And democrat slavers, segregationists and and kkk members. Since we're going back that far. And BLM's stated goal is to keep black fathers out of the home. Anyways, nice talking to you even if we don't see eye to eye on everything

That’s really what it is, I done posted a whole ass official court document and got no looks 😂 I make jokes and everyone wanna comment. Makes no sense people refuse to believe Obama a fuckin satanist and so is Biden and the BLM movement is a fuckin scam.
If Obama had done what Trump is doing, Democrats would vote with Republicans to remove him. They could have lived with Biden.
Mr. President, I seriously doubt that Obama/Biden will pay any price for their attempted treason or coup d'état other than at the ballot box in November. I believe that patriots will come out of the woodwork to vote for you, Mr. President! TY for saving our country from Marxists!
I see this nickname going around Twitter: Puppet Biden.

Meghan McCain has AOC as more powerful than Nancy Pelosi.   Proof that Republicans want to elevate AOC to call all of us (including Biden) Socialist.

I live in south Fl and I’ve only seen 1 Biden sign
If the President chooses not to run I’ll vote for his V.P.! What will you do if Biden looses or asks where the President (Obama) is when he’s sworn in?
A definite must read article from The Rachel Maddow Show!
The ONLY reason that the Dems inc. Joe Biden are siding with China ripping off our nation, for years now, is because they are taking money from the Chinese Communist Party. If it were not for President Trump, we would already be owned by China. It’s time we took our country back!
Lol Biden think people a fool? So when Reagan talk bout war on drugs and how much black people get put in jail he wasn’t racist?
You need to get out more! It’s Noon on the 21st! What will you do when Biden doesn’t win or show up?

Biden is neither rich nor a child predator. He is  not a criminal nor did the Obama/Biden administration   commit treason or were impeached. Trump has, since in office, defecated on the Constitution, defied the rule of law and it's still doing it. Also is a vile human being.
I hope that Mr. Biden has the ability to fix what Trump is starting to destroy with China! Hopefully he can contact the Leaders there and let them know Trump will soon be GONE and not to take anything he says seriously! Trump has gotta go!!!!
Its sad that Joe Biden is all the democratic party could muster up, that man has dementia

Sanders had his economic platform set up as his campaign. Biden has adopted that economic plan. It’s socialism. If that’s your goal for this country then Biden is your guy. But if you vote for Biden you’re getting this along with it. Many more receipts than just this vid too
The ones raising for Biden no amount of antiperspirant will quell the stench
here’s a hint Byedon=Biden . We may need to give you that test that Dump scores so well on . Person, woman, man... Bwahaha
They will debate cuz trump will call him a PUSSY if he doesn’t. Makes biden look weak when Trump is always infront of reporter’s
The media will do everything they can to push Biden and limit the info on his political career. I hope people think critically and do their research.
I’m not sure why Biden is choosing this platform when his policies, voting record and public comments while in office are some of the most racist things I’ve ever heard of. If Biden has any shot he has to go another rout because there’s a million receipts over his 40yrs in office
The packets were shipped to leading Republicans by a Ukrainian lawmaker who has met with the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
Dementia is often followed by stupid acts and/or stupid statements. Biden did just that: “Trump is the first Racist President”.  I agree with the following: “How the hell can Donald Trump be the first racist president in a country where 12 presidents before him owned slaves?"
So is Biden the architect of the archaic 1990’s Crime Bill who will reverse all of Trump’s progress on criminal justice reform or will he abolish the 4th of July and make The Purge a national holiday in its place?
“This is what America would look like under Biden” they say about America under Trump.
When i look at Mr. Biden, I see my Dad, who passed at age 88 (feeble).  All I can say until the passing of my Dad, he was sharp as a whip, this man holds no candle.

4/5 of Florida RVs support mask mandate; 62% oppose sending kids back to elementary, middle &amp; high school while Covid-19 cases remain high  And there’s no way I believe Biden is up 13 in this state. He is probably ahead, but not by 13.
Joe Biden caught on hot mic! What he says WOW!!!! Disgusting !!!!!!  via  🤮🤮🤮
It will be back on track in January when Biden is sworn in.
You have no idea how much I wish these accusations about Biden’s plans for federal control of local zoning were true. Like, yes actually we should abolish single-use zoning nationwide and force neighborhoods with single-family homes to allow the construction of affordable housing

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.

⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a “fraudulent vote”. I’m happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"

why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.

This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!

Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)

You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years

It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.

I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I’m not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai
What you really mean is Joe Biden won’t sit for any Interview! Everything is pre-taped and edited! He is not capable!
Biden is “not available” means he is “not capable” of sitting for a Chris Wallace interview!

Biden-Bottoms doesn't have a good ring to it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
What a waste. Joe Biden will take it down.🌊
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS
Part of Joe Biden's Inaugural speech will be "I will tear down this wall"!
Follow if you're riding with Biden!!!
Omg.  As Biden would say, that’s a bunch of malarkey.  🙄
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can’t let Biden win
Thanks Stacy
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.
Haven't decided. Currently Biden, but hate that I have no viable alternative. Keeping a watchful eye on #Unity2020. In no foreseeable circumstance do I vote for Trump, and Kanye is simply just manic right now. It's obvious this isn't a serious campaign.
I hope all 83 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You assume it's Biden yet she didn't say Biden.  Check your assumptions.
MOMS ARE GOING TO CINCH  THE ELECTION FOR JOE BIDEN, and No GUNS, 'StormyTroopers',  Tear Gas Canisters, Batons, or Helmets ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MAKE WOMEN HATE TRUMP MORE THAN WE DO NOW!!!
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Kanye West claims he will beat Joe Biden through write-in votes  via
That is MORE than fair.  Joe Biden promises that, and he has my vote. Outside of any of that and he can pound sand.
So, I'm not planning on voting. (Not voting for Trump, but I'll condition my vote for Biden If I get these demands met:  1. Hawaii is given back to the Hawaiians;  2. 100% of aid to Israel is stopped unless 67 borders are restored AND palestinians get Reparations for Nakbha;  1/
Biden/Anybody is ok with me at this point, as long as it's not "him".
Don't know, would only be speculating, but I am ok with Harris, Warren, Rice, Duckworth, Bottoms. Trust Joe Biden to make the best choice.
A true Christian would never support abortion and Joe Biden does up to birth. #FakeChristian
Trump sending a few LEGAL Federal cops in is an overreach, but this Obama takeover, which Biden will absolutely push harder is not. Explain that.
Hiding in basements🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  What's the Biden plan Trump claims would "destroy" suburbs?  #FoxBusiness
At least to about the middle of next year. If it is still raging on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will institute a national "wear a mask" program that will FINALLY get it under control.
Does anyone truly think the real Joe Biden could be lucid enough to come up with this, let alone twit it?
You had me at beat Biden off 😍😍
Biden’s campaign = Weekend at Bernie’s 3... 🤯🤯🤯
80% Of Voters Think The Country Is Out Of Control, And Most See Biden As The One To Fix It, Poll Finds viaThis would be Biden's second time!!🤬🤬🤬
You're willing to condemn &amp; destroy a family because their 'opinion' of whom the next president should be is different than yours? This is okay? Why intentionally wreck havoc on a person's business/life because they prefer Trump over Biden or vice versa? Unnecessary.
Like the way obama and Biden used the fbi to spy on his opponent
What voters need to understand - It is no longer about a candidate, its about the people and organizations that are riding in on their coat tails.  And with Biden, you get radical organizations, militant groups, special interests such as BLN, …….
This is no longer an election for Trump or Biden.  It is an election for what everyone who died for this country believed in and tries to preserve and grow, or, for every militant special interest group, club, organization and outside factions that want this country, PERIOD
So this is about Biden asking the Ukraine for money, right? Ha ha fools
Biden is going to kick Trump’s ass in Nov.
Biden's already got international relations covered. Like Obama, he's looking for someone to help in areas he isnt as strong in.
Experienced legislator isn't as important, since that's Biden's bread and butter.  All your other reasons are true of Val Demmings.  Additionally: * 27-year LE career * Sprightly 62 years old * Gives him a boost in Florida
That’s ok we understand you meant to say Biden
I am a Centrist, but I do lean Conservative.  And, I don't always agree with President Trump.  But this election is no longer about Trump or Biden, its about whether we keep our country or sell it to the Far Left, BLN, and everyone who wants to divide the US.  Scary thought.....
But biden can’t form a sentence
Fuck Bush Fuck Clinton Fuck Bush Fuck Obama Fuck Trump And Fuck Biden Who's next

Biden is not a serious contender. He’s only a pawn for a radical agenda who will be manipulated far too easily.
Biden is sure minimumly campaigning, he is hiding from the people!!  RATs think Americans are too stupid to figure it out!!
But it’s the fact that biden is so clearly worse than Obama and he wasn’t even good enough
Waiting on bated breath for the Biden pick for his V P.
I'm thinking 80+ million votes for Biden and maybe 50M for Orange Douchius
The Joe Biden campaign ad just shown on MSNBC did NOT catch my attention. Nope.
Vernon Jones your so full of crap! You call yourself a democrat but you attack democrats!  What about all the MAGA that attack Biden supporters? Or MAGA that attack mask wearing citizens?  I hope Georgia votes you out!
It means we’re not voting for you or sleepy JO Biden you’ll both be flattened by the black trans parade’s colorful 🌈 🌈 🌈 dresses
‘I’d rather be Trump than Biden.’ Why Florida should be close in 2020, despite polls
But the people biden listens too are the people ruining society just like trump
I honestly don’t think that corporate shil biden would do any better than trumps dumb ass in this situation other than supporting masks and the same group of people still wouldn’t listen to him
Now Biden is a Muslim .  There is no limit to who he will Pander to  suck up a vote . God help us
Well at least you can stay black for supporting Biden. Way to fall in line.
Lying, Shifty  Schiff has run out of ideas to accuse President Trump of or he has acquired Critical Biden Syndrome!! 🤯🤯🤯
Feeble Biden!! Really RATs???😂😂😂
Do you remember the Obama-Biden years: major US Companies leave Country, massive unemployment, housing foreclosures high, massive suburb engineering, very high taxes, massive corruption, Presidential apologies to foreign Countries, etc...?
Biden is not picking a VP, He is picking the next President.
Is Biden confused or going blind?
Especially the conservative students? 😆 Is it like Gangs of New York if you don’t vote for Ze Furer Biden?
Well it is becoming clear that Trump's covid-19 press conferences are some of the best advertising Biden can get!  The more Trump talks the more people want to vote for Biden! #DumpTrump
How Trump's coronavirus briefings convinced one of his voters to turn to Joe Biden
Likeing, as I do, Kamala Harris , Biden should measure baggage pointed out in her rise to her station . Biden is moving against the tide as it is . Trump will throw everything at him whether true or not .Play safe , Joe . Think about Duckworth for instance .
Seems Kamala Harris is the VP pick . A former judge she has the qualifications for the job .But during the nominee debates it seems she has a pendance for revenge , giving her remark about Biden causing busing that involved her as a child .Her attittude could hurt Bidens choice .
Dude is up for re-election, focus needs to be not only to elect Biden, but also make sure it's Blue all the way #BlueWave2020
Biden is NOT capable of Leading this Country!! 🤯🤯🤯
The d'RATs are promising to spend trillions of taxpayer money  to win an election!! Americans, who are not voting for Trump but Biden, need to wake up. Don't wait until it is too late!! MAGA!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Pelosi has caught a critical case of Joe Biden Syndrome!! 🤯🤯🤯
Is that what your brain thinks that someone has to escort Biden out of the area?    Joe Biden likes to speak to people. Whoever this person is, she must be in charge of his schedule &amp; literally making sure she keeps him moving.    UR father has an entourage of people moving him.
Once President Biden takes office, all these ridiculous policy of Trump will be canceled! The United States and Europe needs our show of force  to combat Russian aggression!
Ok! It’s time for the SILENT MAJORITY to STOP MESSING with the DEMOCRATIC VOTING ON LINE &amp; SAYING THEY’RE voting for BIden when they’re really TRUMPSTERS! It’s  nice you’ve skewed the numbers like they’ve been doing all along! It’s time to UNITE and show them that Trump will WIN!

Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’
I can’t extol the virtues of Dem union policies. Rather note that the Dems have focused on things that seem to ignore unions, which leaves the door open. Biden seems pro union tho. You are right,Dems need more focus on unions.
I'll be hosting a "Women for Biden Phone Bank" this Thursday 7/30 at 12pm on google hangout!! Come and help us #DumpTrump ! #fladems #BlueWave #WomenforBiden LINK BELOW
The media just letting Joe Biden talk without any tough questions or push back.   He looks like he is sick and weak.
At Biden’s new conference today he seems to have been given the questions ahead of time as he seems to be reading  the answers from a teleprompter and also has a list of reporters to call on?
Anyone. Honestly. I'll be happy with Biden and anyone. Not white and a woman. So no to Warren. It's time for a black woman. I love Stacey but really, anyone with experience. 💙
Going from Barr to Biden makes my brain spin!
And yet.... he got elected President. Biden’s team needs to be prepared to smash him. Like the LP is.
I was glad to see Walmart banned them for a year! There is no place left in this world for these racist hateful Trump supporters. I wish when Biden wins and democrats take control of congress that they pass a federal law against all these racist Karens!
Trump refuses to pay his respect to Congressman Lewis,clearly putting his narcissism and racism on full display! Where as VP Biden is showing his human side and showing America what we have been missing for 3.5 years! #DumpTrump2020
Biden is a ass whole and insane
I’m arguing with a wall lol like I said, the silent majority will show all of you libs what is really going on.   Biden is just as much a womanizing scam artist as the next guy.
This is ENOUGH!! I just heard Nadler Obama, Biden, Rice etc call the rioters " Peaceful Protesters."" Despicable!!🤬🤬🤬
People like Schumer, Pelosi, &amp; Biden have been there for that last 4 decades.  Trump's been there 3 years, but all this his fault.  A reality check is in order.
Just get rid of the fucking Republicans  Analysis | The Health 202: Joe Biden could undo Trump's changes to the Obamacare marketplaces
My husband and I live in Florida and refuse to leave our home we are that scared for our lives. We vote by mail. Hoping Florida is scared enough to want this evil criminal shit out of office by voting Biden.
Somehow I doubt any decision Joe Biden makes could even begin to approach the death and devistation that trump has already caused. I am willing to take a chance on Joe. #Biden2020
Barr agreeing to testify before the house panel is a departure from previous invites .Could it be that since polling for Trumps reelection is dismal , he's taking a shot at clearing himself of wrong doings.  before Biden is elected?
Joe Biden can’t and won’t condemn violence. Oh snap.. at least the paid violence.
Just a reminder that today Joe Biden may reveal that  ( remember that traitor? ) is his VP pick. Between all your other daily prayers, pray that a liar will never occupy this revered role. Unimaginable and disturbing,  what’s going on in America.
Joe Biden turns to his Radical Muslim brothers .  Voice Of America Promoted A Pro-Biden Muslim Political Campaign Ad, Then Removed It
Imagine not understanding that a refusal to vote for Biden is an active assist to Trump.  If you're not willing to change your mind, as least have the guts to admit you're voting for Trump.
Hey Briab will you tell stupid Steve that Biden is not a Moderate . he is as left as Bernie and demented
If you support Biden nigga you still high

Jerry Nadler denying the existence of Antifa is like people denying that Joe Biden is free of dementia issues.
Biden isn't a needy little bitch.
That's correct, but Biden is 1000% percent better than the sociopath sitting in the whitehouse now!
Your next President? CrazyTown Extended - Joe Biden Edition  via
Amen! Biden is not perfect but he will defend our soldiers and the constitution. Where as Trump has spent 3.5 year undermining the pillars of our democracy all the while defending President Putin our enemy!
Why did Trump not push Putin for the answers?  US soldiers were assassinated because of bounties on their heads! Trump Treason needs to end! President Biden will not let Putin get away with this!
Well then one more thing for Biden to fix.
The federal employees involved in these raids should be fired when Biden is elected! I don't believe we should have federal employees who swore an oath to the constitution and then disregard it so that they up hold their loyalty to Trumps criminal desires!
So  and  , how can we get Biden signs flooding the landscapes in every swing state? I know this is old school but I truly believe the signs have an enthusiasm effect and encourage people to get out and support Biden.
I live and vote in Florida and have a summer home in my native Ohio, both battleground states. As I drive through suburban, rural and metro areas I am seeing  Trump lawn signs in yards 10 to 20 times that of Biden. Iremember seeing this alarming trend with Hillary in 2016.
Welcome to the Democrat presidential ticket:  Harris - Biden Warren - Biden Bass - Biden  Happy days!!  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Why didn't they cover Biden's nose with the mask? It would've been less effort in this horrible design to cover it (and plus masks work that way anyway)
Trump is chiding Biden for wanting  an Iraq war. Trump is stoking flames with his lies about Iraq not standing by they promise of no Nuclear proliferation. Did trump get his info from Intel that said Putin is putting a bounty on killing our soldiers? Selective choosing . ?
And I have 100’s of Biden sniffing women and kids so what?

#Obama &amp; #Biden are the real perpetrators of the entire #ObamaGateIsReal

Are we seeing the opposite with Biden?  One goes up the other down?
You should not be talking about V. P. Biden!! You need to stay with what donnie boy is going to do DAH...... YOUR IN BAD BAD SHAPE there Bunker bitch.
They are polling mostly Democrats &amp; spewing bogus #'s so people will either stay home or not vote for Trump bcs they'll figure it's no use, Biden is winning. It's a strategy the Dems are trying to use to sway voters by making them think Bidens got this don't bother voting.
I'm listening to AM Tampa 970 &amp; they claim a Quinnipiac poll shows Biden w/ a 12 point lead over Trump. A Quinnipiac pole, hello, one of the biggest liberal s hools in the northern part of the country. People the polls that are being reported by the media are bogus.
The difference between a CEO (Trump) and virtually ALL politicians. Politicians like Obi, Biden and Clinton are lawyers. CEOs are paid to get things done! Lawyers are paid to NOT get things done. Ever see a lawyer ask for a decision today? Nope, always looking to delay. 🙃
Like "Bernie"is the magic word.A vote for anyone else but Biden is a vote for Trump.
so it's not about Biden leading him in Florida...?
Somehow I can’t imagine the New York Times spending the next four years sending reporters to cafes in Iowa asking them why they voted for Biden.
I’m in I surf when Juan Williams Marie Harf and Geraldo Rivera appear Martha McCallum and Shanon Bream are jumping on the Hillary Clinton bandwagon. Biden won’t even be on the ticket. Dems act like they’ve killed Godzilla.
Here's creepy Joe Biden

Soooooo.....Biden’s America is Trump’s America?.....
Pedophile Comrade Joe Biden
10 more days until Biden announces his VP pick. Can’t wait to get the T shirt! Exciting times. (Please let it be KH)
So, Biden is so desperate that once again Obama (worst President ever) and him are running a fund raiser from his basement.The fact that  is saying he can beat #Biden proves he is in the race to take votes from #biden and ensure his homie Trumps re-election. #kanye u are a sucka! Please #vote #biden and send Kanye and Trump back to their narcissistic looney bins.
But if you can't decide between Biden or Trump? I suggest you go watch the Breakfast Club interview...
Biden could pick Tony the Tiger and I'll still vote Biden in. Actually I really like Tony the Tiger. 🌊😀☮️🌹
After it being CLEAR IN THE LIGHT Bill Clinton was in the pedo island and you are still considering voting for Biden.. I think you’re part of the problem!
Weird that Biden has the huge advantage over Trump...
has rejected suggestions that he choose Cornpop as VP. Instead, he will choose Congressmember  #Biden #2020Election #BidenGate
The Supreme Court's ruling gives Joe Biden the green light if he wins to enact whatever policy he wants and pay for it by taking the funds from the Department of Defense, which I'm sure the conservative Justices will treat the exact same way they've done here

You got it. And historically, primary opponents are not picked more often than not. Primary candidates that tried to take the nominee down are almost never picked. Remember all the Clinton hype before Obama picked Biden? Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads
Biden is leading by double digits in the polls. He doesn’t need a flashy political pick. He needs a governing partner - one with clout on the Hill.
Its more fun to say biden and fuck with the numbers so they are in shock and screaming when biden gets trounced worse than killary
Biden has a great pick to chose from Kamala is Definitely one of them. Love all his picks. I chose Kamala before she even ran in the race.
Horrible company. 42 years of service and you treat me like this. Asking  to investigate your discriminatory practices shame you.
Why is Biden even listening to this dinosaur?
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live
If biden chooses someone who was in the Venceremos then he will loose, many latin votes. Latin people are not willing to for give corporation with the castros. When i say latin i dont just mean cubans. Iean any country destroyed by socialist governments like castro's
Yes goodbye to the corrupt leadership mistakes of Trump and his selfish lies and killing of our Americans lives with his terrible leadership of the Virus epidemic! We need Biden to help get our Democracy back to the people first ! Please Vote 🗳  Senate to become Dem majority 🗳
Typical lying GOP. Obvi, Obama and Biden were handed The great recession from Bush. They took unemployment from 10.5 to 4.6. Trumps claim to fame is giving his buddies $1.3 trillion which they put in the market,  which made the market go up. Big deal. Americans know you’re a liar
#TheFive Now TheFive has Joe Biden commercials?!
In other words,  want to know how much the State Dept. knows about all their self enrichment schemes.  House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‘conspiracy theories’ about Biden
Got them all!
Job done! Followed, liked, and retweeted. 🙂
Great. Let’s bring up that shameful episode again and again, add to the narrative that Biden is a sexist dirty old man, and watch the GOP pounce on that—just until the Traitor and Biden are tied in swing states. Then we wring our hands, having given the GOP its August surprise.
Tampa Teen Arrested In Hack Of Twitter Accounts Of Joe Biden, Bill Gates And Other High-Profile Figures
The “bad taste” is being manufactured by pundits making assumptions about what Joe Biden thinks. What “those around him think” about Kamala Harris should not be used to tarnish Biden himself. You’re doing the GOP’s dirty work for them, again.
"We’ve seen huge transformation in Biden’s climate plan,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder &amp; executive director of Sunrise Movement, which claims more than 10,000 members. While stopping short of a formal endorsement, Sunrise will now campaign for Biden.
Interesting that BIASED, LEFTIST, TRUMP HATING South Florida radio station  has said NOTHING about the current Rasmussen poll showing Trump approval rating at 50% vs Biden 48%.  While they blast out every PHONY poll they can find that might show Biden leading Trump.
May be get screamed at. LOL...beaten up by a Biden supporter. That is funny.
No, it was 47-43 Biden.
New ad campaign?  Will it be scarier than the last one?   Will it be more frightening to those already afraid of The Other?  Will it paint Joe Biden as the devil incarnate whose evil minions are coming to rape your daughters and steal your wives?  If not, why not?
Continuing a regressive culture of racial and financial discrimination across the country by rescinding Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. We must move forward not backward in this global housing crisis.
Thanks for the mention!!!
Man I hope her hard work isn’t interrupted by youthful, keen-minded Joe Biden... getting in a car accident?
I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
Lmao talk to me when the heat lose in the first round. But what u said about Biden is true.
According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 42 percent said they would choose Trump, giving the former vice president a 10 point lead.
95 days until the election and I’m organizing for Joe Biden because he has a 4-point plan to give essential workers the long-term support they deserve   ⬆️wages, quality/affordable healthcare, free tuition for public higher education, encouraging unionization + more
As long as you vote. Personally, I am dragging my disabled veteran ass to the polls with mask, gloves, sanitizer and garlic around my neck. No one will mess with my right to vote. I served this country for that right!   #Biden2020 #Biden #VeteransAgainstTrump

Answer to If both Biden and Trump contracted and died from Coronavirus before November what would happen to the 2020 Presidential Election? (I’m not being political in this question, just curious how the American system would deal such … by Channing Taylo
We can’t kid, Trump has a real chance of winning this.  Biden must not pick someone most Americans hearing her name say “Who?” We need them to say “I know her, she can lead this nation if something ever happens to Biden.”  That’s the perception needed the moment VP is announced.
"After trying to stonewall virtually every oversight effort by Foreign Affairs Cmte in last 2 years, Mr. Pompeo is more than happy to help Senate Republicans advance their conspiracy theories about the Bidens and I want the American people to see it too.”
Yeah I know I make absolutely no sense for disagreeing with businesses closing over a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Go ahead and keep it shutdown because Biden doesn’t know what planet he is on. You all will be exposed for this nonsense it won’t end well.
I can see it now. Biden wins election and sends feds into Portland. After they will say why didn’t Trump do it.
fauci all but said it’s an excuse to hide by Biden
That’s it! We need the virus so that Biden has an excuse to hide. Boom ...open up the economy... takeoff the mask and let’s go to work.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
Yeah that’s why Biden as President is totally going to change America.
Never forget this tweet: Joe Biden. Last OCTOBER.
Anyone a fan of Trump or Biden?
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I’m never voting for Biden so I’m not sure what you are saying here?
She said nothing about that; there's no need to lie.  80% of Dems want #M4A. But Joe "Poster Child Of Institutional Corruption" Biden lives in the pocket of Big Insurance.  Thus, "premiums."
They're the same animal; you hate Trump more because he's mis-governed for 3.5 years.  Biden has mis-governed as an agent of corruption literally for decades.  It doesn't make Trump good - but Biden stood by while Trump was fraudulently elevated. He's equally bad.
Fake News?  I've been all over Florida, I've yet to see a Biden yard sign.
Last time I checked Trump was currently the President. This is all happening on his watch!  A President Biden would have had an oval office address consoling the nation and offering a solution to racial tensions rather than stoking racial divisions.
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.
Scary scenario... how fragile our democracy really is! A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  #TraitorTrump
Prediction… Trump’s tweet yesterday about delaying the election was intentional to trigger Dems &amp; have them on record saying “absolutely no way!” . Then, Oct surprise will show all the crimes Biden committed coming to the surface. Dems will scream “we must delay the election!”
Here’s Trump’s &amp; corrupt Republicans October surprise.....
Here’s the corrupt Trump Republicans October surprise....
It’s pretty mind blowing to me how people like Matt S don’t actually listen to or read Biden’s policies. They are super moderate and many lean right. It’s also wild how people in America want to see criminal and anti-American activity from the WH and then claim to be Patriots.
We are gonna vote so hard for Biden. Like I haven’t seen an anti-Biden post among my friends in like 3 months!
18% approval for the demacratic leaders...  That explains why there are no Biden yard signs.
Already hearing Republicans blaming the coming recession on Biden even though elections have not even taken place yet. Any idiot can see that this economy ahead will not be an easy recovery..
I travel all over... I see U.S. flags on cars, I see Trump written on cars, Everywhere I go.  Yet I have not seen even one Biden yard sign...  The embarrassment must be great.
make America great again dump this racist homophobic corrupt divisive lying POS Trump please vote for Biden
Biden’s getting a high number for investors *for a Democrat*.
A do think Biden’s number in the poll was right. It’s probably 51-49/48 right now or something like that.
The republicans can build the wall as long as they don’t accept the chip. But if the democrats win, then Biden is going to ignore the wall so everyone can come across and be programmed like the Italy and all the other European countries using it as we speak.
Ad: Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Loves Joe Biden  via
Even more controversial take: I think Biden should promise trump not to prosecute him in exchange for trump leaving peacefully if Biden wins.
If I were to meet Joe Biden in person, I would welcome a hug and would know that it was offered with genuine kindness. Trump is so disgusting that the closest I want to be to him is to have a TV screen between us and a mute button close by.
Well, then we don’t need Trump.  Obama/Biden pulled us out of a recession and gave us a historically strong economy.  Trump drove us back into recession.  Also, the hate in your comment show who your party really is
Dear Joe Biden:PLEASE PLEASE PICK KAREN BASS AS YOUR VP! Thanks from Florida, see you in November
Under Obama and Biden from October 2010 to October 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 10% to less than 5%. Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4.7%
⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
And Obama had the audacity to give a “eulogy “ about voting, mass prepaid ballots and trump.  Yeah Obama,  take the spotlight off yourself for SPYING ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WITH BIDEN AND COMMEY.   Justice will prevail.
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Maybe be better to NOT vote to continue 2 decades long war in Afghanistan  - 🤦🏽‍♀️dems are war mongers and Biden is moving to right on foreign policy. Stop the savage us savagery. Focusing on games is a distraction.
If you are so confident why did you float the idea of postponing the elections in November? Because #TrumpIsLosing #Biden #Biden2020
No risk of voter fraud? Sure. President Trump trailing Joe Biden by double digits? That's hilarious. Biden is a drooling,confused old fossil. He has no chance of beating the president.
This Biden tweet is from October 2019
30% drop under the reign of COVID-19. Biden-20 will be far worse when the sanders-commie loving socialist agenda get infected in the American system. Wait and see what happens to the economy when the govt grabs control of everything!
Now this is what our Presidents in the future should aspire to emulate!  We know Joe Biden can!
There is a super incoherent candidate who also is a straight criminal, but it isn't Biden.  So happy this time is ALMOST done
"U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by BY MARK LANDLER via NYT New York Times
Thank you Mr. Biden we need you now more than ever.
Just like he did in 2016. Fortunately, Biden's got this even if Obama and Bill get bedridden.
Brain Dead Biden
PLEASE CHANGE COURSE .ADKNOWLEDGE THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND YOU WILL WIN ..YOUR SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO BIDEN .I HEAR FROM THEM WE NEED A PLAN NOW HIRE A SPEECH WRITER AND SOMEONE WITH A REAL PLAN
most of what you say happened under your prince obama who never gave a crap about blacks, and still does'nt. I bet he gave Biden the line"You aint black if you don't vote for me" Liberals have PTS. Wear a MAGAhat 24 hours it will cure you when you see leftys from our perspective.
"We just want healthcare"  Are you even old enough to not qualify for your parent's ins? Do you know what it meant pre- Obama / Biden &amp; the ACA to be less than 26 &amp; want health ins? You'd only be able to afford a casualty policy in case you broke your leg skateboarding.
Wow who wrote that for him? BIDEN PLEASE DEBATE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!
Re-Tweeted  Trump Can’t Stop the Election, But He Can Threaten Democracy
That's not reality, it's a talking point. In reality, it's not about Trump. It's about the pervasive corruption in our establishment. Biden is the embodiment of everything wrong in our political system.
Are these the same polls that say Biden winning big? Yet polls are biased and wrong? Guess I should only trust polls you post?
Nina Turner clearly doesn’t want Biden elected. At this point she supports delaying the election because she basically supports trump.
Biden said his administration would be reflective of what America looks like  I think that look has to start at VP.
Crenshaw High that's where I'm from... I'm voting Biden cuz I know a 80% of the Black church were begging the feds to do something &amp; supported this law. These people that watched a gangbanger movie or 2 don't know a damn thing about stepping over crackheads to go to school.
Moms for Biden??? What are they doing pimping out their kids to the old pervert?
Why do Dems make everything political... that was my point ... it’s insanity... and you’ve proved my point... and amused me while I wait to get my buddy at airport ... thanks for that:) his flight was delayed :)) Good luck with Biden 🤪🤪
Another angry lil Dem... Wahhhh we lost 4 years ago wahhhhh. Make sure you board up tonight ... I just saw maybe 22 mph winds possible ... oh, and see if Biden out da basement yet... does he know he running in 2020? 🤪🤪🤪
So many Republicans are supporting Biden and expressing their dissatisfaction with trump.  Just repeating, if trump had run as a Democrat I would have voted Republican without blinking.   It's not about party or "my guy winning", it's about the right person and he's not it.
It democRATS got a candidate like Joe Biden, it is because they don't need a competitive contender to win the elections.  We must be prepared for a massive fraud. We must be prepared to defend our Country from the dirty mob.
Grind them down Madam Pelosi, grind them into the ground. Accept nothing less than what Americans deserve while  tries to kill us all.  You are fierce and fabulous! #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpVirus #VoteThemAllOut #BidenForFL #Biden
Cause... the lesser of two evils ... he was a fresh faced young guy In 2008 and Hillary is the Old System like the Bushes in 2016.  Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden is the answer?!? Disgusted with Dems.. own fault if they lose ...
We know Joe Biden isn't tweeting.
BULLSEYE!!! For when Biden is exposed ....he has them all on record now!
Getting rid of kushner is just as important as ousting trump.  The Biden team needs to campaign on the entire team of asshats that will be gone when he’s elected. It’s a huge selling point.
Which room should President Biden hang trumpy’s portrait in? I’m suggesting the incinerator room.
Opinion | Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan. The president is still a denier. By Editorial Board
Here's his "politically liberal, through and through" hero, saying he's going to... vote for Trump.
"Through and through."  Sexism and racism are not "cultural." They are core conservative "values."  Here's your political liberal saying he'll vote for Trump. Sorry he had to make you like quite so stupid.
What's he saying now?  Let's look. He's a conservative. And an idiot.
I can tell you now what they will be. Biden Wins. You Lose.
Biden is going to kick your ass so bad and you know it which is why you are trying to delay the election.
And Joe Biden is an asset of the Chinese government... And his crackhead of the son too
But he did argue.. and said nothing. Clearly noted. Biden has done nothing in a lifetime in politics
I'll bet 99% of the "black voices" are voting for Biden. I recall when my cousin's husband, who was a pastor of a Baptist Church, would beg &amp; drag us as well as members of his church to stupid events so he looks good. We are not even Baptist. We are Catholic but did it 4 him.
STOP MAIL IN VOTING!! One letter has been sent to 2 different people.  The Post Office is run by underpaid young people!! No benefits!! Fight the Democrats!! Biden/Kamala.  She had her face redone to look white???
The color of evil is putrid Orange to think a president could actually delay the elections is ridiculous? Trump you have no power to delay the election! It won't happen! You might try to sue 36 or 37 States when you lose to Joe Biden but it won't work! #dumpTrump

Somebody else shaves Joe Biden every morning.    You never see him with facial hair
have to second this...  i probably see 20 or 25 trump stickers/yard signs/etc for every biden one... but i hardly see any biden ones, if that makes sense...
His speech sucked it was a eulogy not a political rally. It’s just another desperate attempt at fear mongering to scare people into voting for Creepy Uncle Biden who cant even articulate a single sentence.
Landslide! Only a fool would vote for Biden
I don't see that at all... I see that as being American... my neighbor flies a flag on his porch and is voting for Biden in the election.
Biden did not say that Trump will achieve it, Biden said that he would try. In in fact, thats what Trump said he wants to do. So you  were/are wrong.
If he got help from his gubernatorial allies... we'd end up with a situation where only Blue states vote.  That would not be the outcome Trump wants. It's possible Biden could get to 270 without the deep Red states voting. Trump digs chaos, but not chaos where he loses big.
“My Statement on Donald Trump’s Shameless Repeal of DACA” by Joe Biden
Biden will almost certainly win Maine by double digits. U think there will be a lot of Collins/Biden voters? I’m more skeptical considering how much Collins is tied to trump.

You mean a Fake Ad about Joe Biden
Biden down only 2 in a GOP poll in a district trump win by 17!
U act like Biden hasn’t said that same thing on the campaign trail. He constantly compares Trump to Wallace and Bull Conor. I have proof if u need it.
This tweet was actually too dumb to be 4th Dimensional Chess. The Constitution is rather firm about this, so this has to be part of Trump’s fiendishly clever plan to Make Biden Lucid Again...
Imo she didn't leave enough of a pause between "cup of joe" and "Joe Biden, that is!" The joke fell a little flat
If you want more liberal policies than what Biden is pushing now—you won’t get them under Trump or from a Third Party protest vote. Elect someone who will listen to you, then push them for what you want. There is no such contract to guarantee anyone’s ideas before we vote.
The mind boggles. Biden...was....VP....
Dude that means a President Biden will do it. Obama and Biden don’t do anything without talking to each other.
Will your president ever condemn Biden for his racist comments ?

It is fear that is causing him to try and delay the inevitable, which is the American people choosing Joseph Biden. I mean how appalling is it that the sitting president doesn’t have enough respect to attend Congressman John Lewis’ funeral. Thank God he only has 5 months left!
A lot of NIMBY’s are minorities too though. Like my Indian Parents are definitely NIMBY’s, but they are still voting Biden no matter what.
The great American hero will be Biden when he wins and takes office
Let’s say there is a massive Covid outbreak, Joe Biden gets the disease and dies Oct 15. Would there be a push for the election date to be moved?
You are definitely voting for Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂

This is what the Democrats- Pelosi and Biden and Nadler call a myth 😂😂😂
Joe Biden is older than President Clinton; would anyone want Bill Clinton to be POTUS in his current state of mental decline? Wise up people.  #Trump2020
Ngl, little annoyed at this Biden ad
A Biden bro was mean to me on Twitter now I can't justify voting for Biden. Maybe think twice before you go around calling people selfish.
Biden didn't make any money until the last few years. That was part of his attraction. His vetting was easy because he'd been in politics for decades and basically just made his salary. Obama, a much more cynical man than Biden, couldn't believe that Biden hadn't made money.
Would you be saying this if the owner was a Biden supporter?  NO
I would agree if the Democrats had nominated someone terrible. But Joe Biden's a good man, a moderate choice, someone who can return us to normalcy.
Biden never ran an ad calling implying Obama was a “scary black man” or covertly pushed “birther” conspiracies. Yet ur a “Clinton Democrat”. And u don’t have to keep reminding me where I live lmao.
If God help us Biden wins the covid-19 will miraculously disappear January 2021.
we’re 100 days away from being in the same situation as Italy If Biden wins 1.Amnesty 2. Open borders 3.DC statehood 4.Ballot harvesting legalized 5.Re-zoning districts Republicans will never win again and forever be a small minority in the house and senate only 1 party system
Clinton Sistah Souljah: “I‘m a Clinton Democrat!” Biden fundraiser comments: “Fuck Joe Biden” Lmao Absolute 🤡
So what your saying is that everyone should vote Biden?
Joe Biden's mental decline is an open secret.
Trump worked through gridlock. Biden has late stage dementia.
Is Biden’s climate plan good?
Because in the real fvcking world, trump destroyed everything I worked for 38 years of my life. If you think an Obama-Biden style presidency is the same as a trump one, you’re either privileged or you live in a fantasy world.
You’re deflecting. I guess all the progressives in congress who endorsed Biden are wrong.
Biden should too.
Trent Partridge #globalcoin #facebook #crypto currency
It will get worse if Biden wins the election.
I agree but we need to see some debates. Biden needs to go heads up with President Trump. We need to see them both answering questions that they have not read and see who really is telling the truth and who is the better man.
I don’t think that is really Biden.
I'm old enough to remember this.
If there’s a “red wave” in 2020 the democrats will be off the mail in voting issue faster than Joe Biden dodging real question from legitimate reporters
via  I’m so sorry ⁦ we are kicking you out on November 3. #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd
I would swim across shark infested waters to cast my vote for Biden. Luckily, I don’t have to bc I’m registered to vote by mail 💌  p.s. Tr*ump can’t delay the election. His presidency expires on 1/20/21.  would become acting President then. Thx 20th amendment
Don't blame yourself Steve. How could you have possibly known how right Biden was back in April because up to that point Trump had been so respectful of the Constitution and especially the integrity of elections. Try not to be too hard on yourself.
Next he will just say I've seen the polls and I'm gonna win so no point in any election for the next few years I'll just stay here as your favorite president. Vote like your life depends on it because it will. Biden 2020
My person dislike has to do with her trying to smear Biden. None of the other women on the list tried to do that.
I guess we’ll  finally hear whatever crap Giuliani has been able to extort out of foreign governments about Obama or Biden or both. Unlikely any of it will be vetted or confirmable. Democrats and independents beware it’s aimed at you.
No Biden all the way
I think there's a lot to what you say, but if so, it disqualified everyone but Duckworth. All the rest have never had to face competitive elections. They were basically recruited by the party and won easily. And none of Biden's opponents did well in the primary.
No matter who they pick for VP, Left Twitter is going to bash. Nina was never going to be Biden’s pick. It’s time to grow the fvck up. If you hate Biden, go help down ballot progressives. If you want trump to win for whatever reason, just say so &amp; stop with the mental gymnastics.
She's the frontrunner in the same way Clinton was in 2008. Obama chose someone he could trust. Biden will do the same.
Except Biden's entire list is female and these donors only have an issue with one of them.
Here's the biggest problem in numbers: 15% in the polls in September, 3% when she dropped out. No candidate even came close to doing that badly. If she loses 12 points for Joe, he loses the election.
He can do anything he wants, we are a powerless nation hoping, praying, anything to have Biden win.  He's pulled off the coup because we have a Democratic House that does nothing but write hundreds of bills that go nowhere  Impeach Barr would be a great move but no guts, no glory
She also clearly said out of her mouth that she doesn't favor bussing, thus rendering her whole complaint pointless. Much like her health care stance, where she wanted to abolish private insurance and then not really but then maybe.
You all need to stop. Biden's short list is all female, so particular criticisms of any one candidate cannot be motivated by sexism unless you just hate all of them. Khivers especially need to get real. She took a wild swing a him, she failed, and she's paying the price.
There are other options besides Biden.
That's exactly it. Biden was ambitious. But Biden a) didn't try to take Obama down the way Clinton did and b) served Obama's needs for eight years, not his own. Harris tried to do a) which means she probably won't do b)
Ambition is normal. Trying to destroy your opponent's reputation is taking ambition a bit far, which is why Hillary didn't become Obama's VP and Biden did. Has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with dishonest and untrustworthiness.
Biden wouldn't support Harris in the primary. Obama didn't support Biden. Biden will stay neutral. The Democratic Party has learned the dangers of clearing the field.
Suburban mom here in South Florida ALL IN for Biden #SuburbsForBiden #JoeMentum #BlueTsunami2020
Too close to be sure of a Biden victory.
Khive wants people to lay off Kamala while they cheered her on when she basically called Joe a racist.
Ambitious enough that she was willing to smear Biden. Clinton didn't get to be VP because she went too far during the campaign as well. It's not just "throwing punches". There are certain things you don't do.
Talking about Biden, not Trump.
It was a bit more than a punch. And yes, most VPs want to be President, but while you're VP you serve the interests of the President, not your own. Biden did that dutifully. Clinton didn't get the job precisely because Obama knew he couldn't trust her. Biden can't trust Harris.
I can't imagine him picking Harris. He knows she's not loyal and will only pursue her own interests.
And we thought the last election was the most important. The ante went up folks.  Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins

Listen up, ladies &amp; gentlemen! Will Mrs Obama be Biden’s choice for VP next week? It appears to me that it might be! Last night, out of the blue, I had a dream about her!!!
They’re not switching out Biden while he’s up. Far more likely that Biden gets voted in, then they do the switch.
No one’s voting biden
A long, long, long time ago... Funny, in my house we refer to Trump by the moniker, “Stupid” too!!
NO,  Pres Trump is trying to deal with the mayhem backed by dumbocruts and ANTIFA, Covid-19, and putting Obama, Biden, Hillary and commey in prison for spying on presidential Republican nominee Trump2020.
So we get GDP figures today. It should be a good day for Biden to blame Trump not the Chinese his handlers but Trump. It’s a pandemic Joe and you couldn’t have done anything but probably put more people in harms way. But go ahead get the hair on your legs standing up.
Hunter Biden got his big payday with no qualifications because of his last name. He is indicted in Ukraine and has other issues. If you and I did what he did we would be in prison right now.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
I think she may lose her primary, and if Pelosi and Biden endorse her they are spineless. Brenda Jones should represent that district.

i mean, they all attacked her in the campaign and destroyed her by showing how tough she was on black crime, even tho we all pretend biden wasnt even worse...i don't care about all that, but it is always fun to see people savage eachother and then then find a partner after.
i hope she wants to be president, biden's mental state will be fully deteriorated in about 2 yrs...so whoever gets picked to be his VP would be taking over soon...not that it matters, Trump isnt going to lose to Biden.
She just has been asking every guest “what if he doesn’t leave?” And every guest has said a variation of “after Biden is sworn in, he’s not the president and no one has to take his orders.” William Barr can’t body block Joe from the Oval.

She'll lock up more blacks along with Biden than the both ever have before.

If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
IJS I’m in a  Democratic county  and I haven’t seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker yet..
Your right Obama was everywhere, Hikary wasn’t, but nothing comes anywhere near as Trump stuff.. it’s overkill  saying all that Biden’s gonna lose
I agree with u on the crazy Republicans with the Trump paraphernalia, but there is no way in hell Biden is beating anyone
Who would you want Biden to pick as VP?   I still have no idea who I want
During the Obama-Biden era, what #EconomicPlan or #racial #investments did he participate in?
General, do you think any significant changes will be done by Election Day? I'm assuming Biden will nix this plan on day 1. However, will there be any irreparable harm done by tRump’s plan?
You realize you’re behind double digits in the polls? And Joe Biden hasn’t done or said a thing.
Biden wins Penn,Wis,in addition to Michigan &amp; he is over 270!!!!Besides AZ,FL,NC,GA,TX,etc,etc,etc...
But in a way that’s better for Biden. We know Kamala and her record, so no surprises. A lower name pick could lead to a surprise in the middle campaign that could hurt Biden.
His next desperate move : The  caravan is on it’s way to the border and Biden will let them in and show them where the suburbs are!!
She’s senile along with Biden
I thought about that, but they like to have American fighter jets. Biden makes one call and he’s in a diplomatic bag, on a plane to Guantanamo.
If Biden wins, Putin loses. Big time. Translation: Putin will do all he can to make sure Biden doesn’t win. And Trump and the rest of the Republicans will let him.
As a Dem, you can’t be happy or excited with the choice of Biden... Obama was fresh and awesome in 08.... plenty of Talent on stage months ago at Dem Debates... Dems lost me And other when they rigged the election against Bernie in 2016...  Party is a dumpster fire
Just putting this out there: not only will Trump not try to cling to the office... I don’t believe he’ll stay on the job after he loses. I think he’ll go to Mar-a-Lago and plan for the next step, which is fleeing the country before Biden takes the oath.
I didn’t then, but my buddies and I do now... left has gone insane. Not the party I signed up for unfortunately ... they are being exposed daily. Trumps no prize at all but Dems had 4 effing years to find someone and Biden was the pick?!? Cmon mannnnnn ... do better
There has been a vice-president, including Biden, who wasn't ambitious enough to want to be president. This is another example of ambitious women being demonized. Didn't we learn how toxic that could be with the way Hillary was by Democrats? Now is the time for big ideas.
Ya know what America needs to unify it? A dementia ridden white guy and a cop
Do you think it will be better with Biden ? That’s the real question
Ummmm he walked. ... he ain’t running anywhere... except for President... and that race he’ll win... Biden is aloof
He just hates Biden; that’s all.
I agree? But that’s not the topic here. It’s voting for Biden.  I’m not going back and forth on this.
That’s not what is on the ballot those things can be challenged later. As long as Kamala isn’t VP.  That’s what you said.  You find Kamala Harris more important to not vote for Biden, than voting Trump out. Got it.   For God sakes your party can’t even run this state! Spare me.
I heard you loud and clear.  I’ve got nothing more to say. I stand by my first comment. You can throw out whatever excuses you want to for not voting for Biden. We’ve got nothing to discuss.
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Biden loses with Harris. No brainer.
Biden has been around for over 30 yrs, didnt help you with any of that shit, obamacare was a joke, im sure Trump would try to plan healthcare if he can get rid of all the illegal aliens first, just wait for the house to get taken back in 2022 and give him a chance to surprise you
I'm sure of it. Now if Kamala Harris is AG for Biden, she will kick ass. AG's have more power that VP's.
Dr. Jill Biden will make sure we get the best Education Secretary!
The meme I posted was in response to someone calling me a Looney.  Ironic. Truth be told, those voting for Biden have no room to talk.  The man is not well and he needs to be retired from politics.  A nurse was handling him to get him to walk straight last I saw.  Seriously.
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Hunter Biden looks 1000 times better, murderer
Where are all their masks.??
#97Days Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Yes- that’s where the OP started. Our conversation started about whether or not she’s been a good senator. Anyway- this is a pointless discussion because again, it’s not being made in good faith. Vote Biden regardless 👍🏻
Anyone actively lobbying Biden against Harris for VP -- in general, but also particularly for complaints that she's "too ambitious" (common sexist &amp; racist critiques of women in power) -- shouldn't be treated as a trustworthy or useful voice in his circle.
Every single day at every single meeting with heads of state or otherwise, Trump turns it into a political rally and an attack on #Biden. And the slavish press covers his propaganda no matter what the meeting was intended for. Shameless.
Means she was willing to destroy his reputation and step over the smoldering remains to get into the White House. If Biden had tried that with Obama you wouldn’t want him as vp
Someone’s having trouble accepting the greatness of Joseph Robinette Biden jr., 46th President of the United States 😂
But my initial read as Biden’s campaign being cutesy with the VP slot seems inaccurate; it looks like the campaign is dealing with a revolt from loud backers, which has spilled into the press. So I guess we’re playing our part.
And people are worrying about Biden....this is frightening
Exactly. Voters don’t care. That’s why flogging the veepstakes is a dead horse spectacle. But it sounds like there is real dissent in the ranks, and it is not Biden waffling. That’s why we have to be vocal. Sorry for all the tweets. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I thought It was rice, but now I think it’s Harris. U don’t leak especially after the Biden campaign shut it down unless u lost.
And you’re said I’m the one disrespecting Biden 🤦🏻‍♂️
The Racist is Really showing his True Color.   Don't Worry  President Biden will change it Back.
Dude, I think she’s the pick. Why would they leak if she’s not?
You sound like a Fox News infomercial, man. I have a friend who watches Fox &amp; he said the exact same thing, verbatim. Do you also think Biden “smells” children? C’mon... look at our country today!! We couldn’t take much more of all this winning!
So the people telling me to pipe down seem to think 1) Kamala is a lock 2) The press just does this on its own, it’s not from Biden campaign leaks. Stop being mad at me for telling you what you didn’t want to hear.
but even then, he would have said a complete sentence which beats out to the current dementia-laden, 5-word memorizing, dangerous-drug pushing, clown in office today! But yea, Biden will be removing the obese one!
It didn’t happen under Obama/Biden. It won’t happen.  Trump is a liar.
While electing Biden and taking control of congress accomplishes the urgent goal of removing a dictator and fixing a lawless government, changing The system itself requires a different approach, requires winning in the lower levels and going up from there..
I understand the angst, but we are facing a Dictator, Biden is not that, if Anything he is veering left. The Koch playbook worked because democrats never cared to fight at the city and state level everywhere. We are not supposed to elect "Protectors"
With its mismanagement of the Covid 19 response, this Administration hasn't shown the empathy for those lives lost during the pandemic. Seniors, especially, take note and vote for Joe Biden.

As a man I thought AOC moved us all forward on treatment of women and language. Nah. After what you just said about Biden, I realized you’ve just been well behaved for Bernie’s sake- you are still the FUCKING BITCH I knew you were in 2015 #ninaturnerisafuckingbitch

That’s ok Mr Bigot  All those votes will go to Biden After all Low Income folks VOTE
Joe Biden for president!
Smh at this rate Biden gets to 65% with college educated whites.
Biden seems like the only person to get close. Anyways focus on FL and NC in my opinion.
Pretty interesting that Covid-Don names a bunch of states he obviously thinks he is losing to Biden: NV, OH, PA, FL, AR.  Looking forward to the grants to TX, GA, KY and SC.
There just seems to be too many republican voters. Biden is literally maxing out Moderate and Independent support.
Pretty good numbers for Biden ngl.
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
Georgia Tossup 🤔. Looks like Biden is outperforming Stacey Abrams by 2 percent with white voters and massively winning swing districts, but it still may not be enough due to the sheer power of republican counties and voters.
I'm begging Biden to make Kamala Harris his VP. I might die laughing
Thoughts on Biden number?
I don’t understand. It seems like u want Biden to be president so he can do stuff. He’s running for President and doesn’t hold any office, he doesn’t have any power.

We need to reclaim these past 4 years. Biden 2020!
It’s a deliberate leak (reveal) as a trial balloon. Trying to judge the reaction for having a VP who is a descendant of slave owners and an aggressive prosecutor of minorities using the Crime Bill written by Biden. Joes handlers don’t do anything with a poll.
I’m not even sure of a virtual debate at this point. I didn’t realize how bad Biden is it’s embarrasing that this was the best Dems could do after 4 years.
A Biden/ Harris ticket is a disaster waiting to happen. Both with anger issues and a history of passing and enforcing laws against minorities. How can you vote for a ticket with a defendant of slave owners on it?
I absolutely believe this... I worry what Trump &amp; Barr will do the days after he loses (if we vote)&amp; Biden takes office! Trump will sabotage the country &amp; no telling what else.... but regardless, Trump &amp; his Administration will pay for every crime committed &amp; ever dime grifted!!
So Jellyfish Joe Biden may have slipped up and it’s possible he’s picking a VP who is a descendant of slave owners, one who prosecuted Biden’s Crime Bill aggressively and jailed thousands of minorities for offenses she herself admits to doing as a prosecutor. Kamala Harris

Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims #SmartNews

I'm volunteering for Joe Biden on the Vote Joe App. It only takes a few minutes–check it out!
We need you to be running for President. Biden is unfit to be POTUS. Trump is a dictator. I won't vote for either. We need you!
Vote Biden.  It won’t solve everything but it’s a start.
Inherited the Obama Biden  plan
✋ #ResistanceTaskForce   I will be voting for Joe Biden. Barbara Scheible 🇺🇸
Biden can't utter a cognitive sentence. He will not bring any change and he will not lead us into anything but more of the same corruption.
Biden is not the solution to Trump.
There is no hope for people like "Sassy Resists Anti-Fascist Cats for Biden". They live in a fantasy world where actual anarchy and destruction of entire cities is somehow not the fault of the ones who are doing the destroying.
God what are you 5? Just vote for Biden to get Sweet Potato Hitler out of office. Stop with the kiddie nonsense. Not getting trump out is letting fascism truly take over.  Why do centrist like to play nice instead of getting tough?
She and Biden are why I will vote Libertarian. Kamala Harris is a cop!
Biden is why we have Trump.
.. just like in 2018 .. the vote was cemented in .. it would take Biden dropping out or conceding .. that would b the easiest way for trump to win . Another way would hav federal troops arrest all democrats right b4 the election . That’s. What q is saying anyways 🙄
I hope the Biden administration is prepared to deal with increased domestic terrorism and hate crimes. Sadly, these punks won’t be going away.
You can’t even #resist telling the most obvious lie! #Enthusiasm for #Biden is YUGE and you know it, spanky!
We all can’t wait for Biden...and you....😃🥳
Biden don't give a shit about the American People neither does Nancy or Chuck. I wish they were out of Politics forever.
The reason the name BIDEN looks like (Osama) BInlaDEN is because his supporters love burning the American Flag 🇺🇸
Wish we would have been concerned about healthcare this winter.  But noooooooooo  We had to deny reality as a country again.  I'm glad Bernie debated Biden in a vacuum. I'm unhappily voting for a Christian creep. Allow Jewish ppl to have decent political positions!
FBI Investigated Biden Campaign for Delaware Way Corruption
Best part of this...YOUR DADDY DID IT..BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT YET.... IS A JACKA*S. and so are you....Not Ivanka...
As well as I highly recommend you learn the history of your country! And research before you decide!! Biden doesn't know his ass from a home in the ground!!
Never Biden.

Joe Biden was better when we just memed about him and knew nothing about him

I’m #RidinWithBiden   Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
1/2 Allow me to pose one final question. What exactly was the desired outcome of insulting me, sending a twelve tweet rant, &amp; only sending Joe Biden's website? If the goal is to accomplish swaying a potential voter, u failed. If the goal was to be indignant &amp; defensive, u succeed
Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks    #KamalaHarris4VP #BidenHarris2020
And Biden is?
I’m seeing the Florida for Biden shit trending and I’m like “no one else? Do I have to? Ugh whatever” The Biden campaign probably calls that enthusiasm
Trump never said he dislikes immigrants. His wall is to keep people who are not citizens from taking our benefits. They need to be legitimate. Their are rules and criteria for everything. Listen Biden sucks donkey balls. Trump is way better.
West Central Florida, more Trump signs for sure but I have seen people ona busy street corner with Biden signs.
Go to Joe Biden's website. It's all there. It's not hard to find. You replied to my tweet to disagree with me asking a question. What is the Dems platform, if it's not this? I'm not voting for Biden. If you think that's wrong, tell me why.
And you imply it's not true. I ask what is the correct info then? I didn't go to a pro Biden tweet to contest it.  Your not going to get any new Biden voters on your team by condescendingly telling people to figure out the Dems "correct" platform for themselves buddy.
Did Kanye just say he was going to beat off Joe Biden 😬
Biden literally came out with his presidential campaign policies over a week ago
USA CANT TAKE ANOTHER 8 YEARS OF   factory layoffs, massive company closures, high unemployment, service job declines, lower salaries and higher taxes, decreased hours, part time and multiple jobs just to stay alive.  NO MORE BIDEN  NO MORE DECLINE
I see that too. I just can't vote for Biden. We need to send a clear message that we vote for our convictions. They use fear to keep us as slaves. Vote your convictions!
USA CANT TAKE ANOTHER 8 YEARS OF   factory layoffs, massive company closures and unemployment, service job declines, salary declines and longer hours just to stay alive.  NO MORE BIDEN  NO MORE DECLINE
Not voting Biden. You reap what you sow. I did not vote for Andrew Gillum either. But, I can say that the Governor of Louisiana is the best. He should be President.
Higher taxation means less money in your pocket and greater government control or Marxist Socialism. Opposite with  more money in your pocket means your choice, your destiny, not the governments, not Biden's.
I would pay to see Biden and President Trump and a debate
Do you need to see the receipt that I gave to Joe Biden? $25 of my hard earned money to Biden! OK group of Catholic Karen’s what the hell you gonna do about that? Tell on me? Call the pope! But you won’t because Karen’s have no power.
I see a lot of people saying "Dems didn't say that".  Which is funny, but also, if that's NOT what the Dem platform, and more specifically, Biden's platform is, then what is it that Dems want? Please tell me, what are the platform stances Dems are for? (Besides hating trump)
This is literally Biden's campaign platform. Including "the abolition of the suburbs".
Thank you. I am not a vote shamer either. I get why people vote for Trump or Biden. I think the whole medical system in the US needs to be overhauled. That means everything! Our current system is too capitalized. Everything from pharmaceutical development to hospitals. 1/2
I was a lifetime Democrat. I haven't voted Democrat, except local elections, since they cheated Bernie in 2016. I voted Trump because Hillary is POS and the Dems are too. Trump = Hillary/Biden. I voted Independent Fl governor. Voting Libertarian for first time. I don't like Howie
Yes it’s a waste, we need to drown Trump in the blue water of democracy and vote Biden and move back to America the World leader and not in deaths by a stupid president
Biden’s world
I have a joke about a mask, Joe Biden and Trump but only 2 of them can Make America Safe Again. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Joe Biden is a pandering fool.  I don’t believe ANYTHING he says,

Biden is why we have Trump. Vote 3rd Party.
Travel ban? You mean in April? You lie....Big Win? Only for Biden in November.
So, elect Biden??
We will have to drag him out crying and whining...he won’t go quietly into the night. He has already said, if he loses, he will not go to Biden’s inauguration. like a 2 year old.
thinks if he destroys the post office...he can stop vote-by-mail...he can’t. WE WILL VOTE....TRUMP HAS TO GO..HERE IS MORE PROOF..I WOULD CRAWL OVER BROKEN GLASS TO GET HIM OUT...VOTE BIDEN...
If you don’t support the Phillies, you ain’t black...Joe Biden July 23 2020.
Biden would be asleep once the basement putting lotion on his hairy legs.  We would be getting shit on again by every country who wanted to screw with us
Enjoy your Biden country if you help make it happen.
People tell me they will vote for Biden just because Trump irritates them. They will be the first ones crying after Biden starts to rip our country to shreds. I have been thinking of moving to Costa Rica or Panama and if Biden gets in ( by some freaking mistake) I’m out
And you REALLY think the majority of voters in this country want Poor Joe Biden ? Most Democrats feel sorry him. But will not vote for him .
Make sure you check Biden's ear for a device.
Go away Obama your time is up and you must be kidding who could vote for demented Joe Biden BAWawaWawa
Flashback: Biden Accused Romney of Being a Racist
....which reminds me. will Trump be requesting special precautions against History repeating itself and demand special precautions that Joe Biden isn't slipped the debate questions by the same pundit or any pundit for that matter?......
Wow! Tough guys...That dancing flower girl looked dangerous.🤡 This is a #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare BIDEN AD.
“Chip in” is a good way to put it! Vote in Biden, and we my all have chips put in us!
Biden needs to be retired. He is not a cognitively functioning adult. I hate Trump, but I won't vote Biden.
There won't be any debates. That would be political suicide for Biden. The man can't put 2 words together coherently. Trump would annihilate him.trump is an insane liar. He is still okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. Vote for Joe Biden on 11/3/20.
The first one who hates wearing a mask is Joe Biden, hypocrites!
He’s right about that. 1/20/21 President Joe Biden will be sworn in and the USA will begin to move forward again. Vote Joe Biden on 11/3/20.
You and the  trump  sycophants  are the only  people  who  believe  that . That's  about  30% of voters .  Vote  for  Joe  Biden  on  11  /  3  /  20 .
Black people aren’t safe in trumps America. Vote for Joe Biden 11/3/20.

Joe Biden  won't  be  sworn in  until  1/20/21. How is taking  a  few days  to count  all the  ballots  a problem ?
trump  is  responsible  for  the  150,000 deaths  in  the  USA  from  covid19 . warned of  a  pandemic  in 9/19 trump  failed to  notify  the  public . When  he finally  took action  in 3/20 the  virus had already  spread  over  the  USA .  BIDEN  11/3/20.
This is odd if you know Biden promised he would reign in his own ambition and consider being VP the end of his political career and not run for prez, when Obama was vetting him. But here we are. His ambition is ok though. Stop holding women to double standards.
Biden is out mine. He can’t speak straight!
What really bothers Americans is that you’re Putins puppet and you’re okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. We want JOE BIDEN , an American , to lead the country. Vote for Joe Biden 11/3/20.
Anything you do will be undone by Biden. Keep dreaming awake!
The American people are tired of trumps ignorance, incompetence, hate, lies and racism. We want an American President not Putins puppet. VOTE for JOE BIDEN on 11/3/20.
That question is why I find the polls interesting. If they are representative it seems like the naysayers are fewer, even if very vocal. If Biden is at the top, why not EW or KH? He’s not my choice, but he’s what we got. They
Biden is my guy.
And the Democrats are represented by Joe Sniffing Biden, which reminds me of this.
Biden with have free rein, then work with #GOP remaining to balance and heal the Nation.  will be counseled by Bo.
Tell me when we have effective vaccines AFTER Biden is in office, and how many obstructionist GOP members are ousted along with Trump. Then I’ll give you my answer.
After the first debate, Biden’s lead is going to disappear.
No need to fret, Biden will pardon the lot’
Up to Biden because you didn’t know to do it in the last three years!
Mickey be nice, say hello to this Biden supporter.
I wondered how much this was going to be held against her. It also explains why some others are still on the list. We are going to learn a lot about what Biden thinks about women’s leadership. Does he want a peer who can challenge him? Or someone he thinks will be deferential?
They keep on campaigning for Biden.
trump is controlled by Putin. trump is a traitor. trump is okay with Putin paying terrorists to kill American military personnel. Vote for JOE BIDEN 11/3/20.
I oppose him taking Federal funds from Charter and Private schools. We all know that children from low- income families benefit from these funds especially the McKay scholarship. This is the Biden-Sanders plan.
Trump is toast. Biden enters office with pedal to the metal. Keep your sell orders to a minimum.
PATRIOTS !  NO LONGER BIDEN ! WE NEED TO STOP SAYING DEMOCRATIC EXTERMIST !  THIS IS A COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT THIS IS A TAKEOVER OF OUR COUNTRY !  THE ELECTION WILL NOT HAPPEN !  We have already heard MSM SAY TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED  COMMUNIST DO NOT GO ! MUST BE REMOVED!
No convention , no politics , no Biden !  Only communist and the shadow Government working in silence !
Fixed it for you..  THIS IS BIDEN/ CLINTON / OBAMAS AMERICA FOR YOU
Biden Does not understand your asinine tweet, you have to explain it to him and very little words and very slowly.🤡
You have to admit though, it is good to see Pelosi and Biden with a mask over their mouths. Really good to see!!!
trump has declared war on America. He is sending his gedtspo to selected cities to sow violence and chaos. trumps idea of America is what was 1930’s Germany. We must vote for Joe Biden on 11/3/20 to stop this fascist madman.
Well folks it’s July and for the past month the RNC and the trump campaign has been burning dollars on negative ads in Florida against Joe Biden . I smell fear, or maybe trumps diaper. The gop is supposed to have Fla. locked up.
Well Trump's supporters have jobs and contribute to society Biden supporters like to feel his leg hairs don't mind being sniffed and are all sitting back waiting on a stimulus check President Trump is giving them NOT Joe Biden, I suppose that makes his supporters stupid to 🙄
Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, AOC, and the Democratic Party are rejoicing.
We gotta get  to make biden a song.
.It was certainly wonderful to see and hear you, sir. I’m particularly impressed with you and Mr. Biden practicing the necessary guidelines with social distancing and masks. If only you were president when this all started, I know things would be so different.
He’s campaigning for Biden OPENLY!
You are confused, that's what kids say to Joe Biden.
Get over it. The two most embarrassing things a president ever did were Obama ignoring the plight of black people in America, and picking Joe Biden for VP.
I am not sure but I do know they helped the handicapped.........Joe BidenWhich Joe Biden have you been listening to?
What is taking so long??? There have always been a limited number of choices- Joe Biden made it that way! His inability to pick is like his campaign-uninspired!
Biden is procrastinating on making a VP pick like he is about deciding to get into this race! Any concerns over his lack of decisiveness? He mandated his choices were pretty limited!
We need to stop the Joe Biden ads

I'd NEVER vote for a person or people who think I'm a super predator  Biden more than most is why police militarization is what it is.  So, you vote for him, you're voting against your life.  You vote for trump, you're voting for the same.  You're just voting to do it.
Biden, like Hildabeast, will take more from the people.
What does Trump plan to accomplish by accusing of Biden selecting a black woman? Is he insinuating it's the wrong choice or that she couldn't handle the role??
The reaction from black folks No matter who Joe Biden picks for his VP.
I would like Biden/Warren for rebuilding the country, and Harris for AG to prosecute Barr and all those who were complicit during this administration.  No "let's just move forward from here" BS
Biden what you gonna do ?
I’ll be voting for Joe Biden.

⁦ Trump has done a lot right on Corona. Here is how we did not handle the H1 N1 correctly
Let's remember that Bill Clinton, in all of his POS-ery, used Sista Soulja (also in the mold and evolution of Stokely) as a way to win his election.  In an IDENTICAL way HRC and Biden used "Super Predators" to code word Black Folks.  Why folks revere either clinton is beyond me.
Biden didn't even have a flunky show up
We do t have to worry about them now... they are your stsffs... can you even use a cell phone? I see your symptoms.. my dad has it.. I know Biden has mental defects due to dementia
Hi. Mom for Biden here. I attended the launch party last night with  and it was refreshing to hear positive and informed ideas. I can’t wait to vote for a candidate who will value and protect the lives of children, teachers, and staff. #MomsForBiden

Exactly. Any vote for Biden is a “fraudulent vote”. I’m happy to be a fraudulent voter in that case.
If Joe Biden feels that she is the best choice to help him Build Back Better, then no one should stand in the way. I believe in Kamala and if she were VP then she would absolutely make all of us proud.
1. I'm going to frame this picture.   2. It's frustrating to read reports that people are actively working to prevent Senator  from being picked as Joe Biden's running mate. The most glaring reason is that they believe she is too ambitious.
As I said, Biden's quote was "poor people are just a smart as white people"  You cant get more racist than that, or maybe you can, the Biden Quote, "You have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-11"
We will make #GoodTrouble to elect Joe Biden! #WeWillVote
We definitely need debates. Have you seen Biden?  He’s not all there.

I will wade through a moat of fire surrounding the polls to vote for Biden.
Trump wants to overturn the rule on housing segregation.  Let's be honest...if Joe Biden wasn't running for president, he'd support this.  Think about that when you advocate for him.
"You're not black on the inside. I'm more black than you on the inside."  see also: "You ain't black" - Biden
If Biden wins this election, this will be the third time in a row an elected Democratic President will have to clean up a huge economic disaster left by his Republican predecessor.
In November.........If we are not Riding with Biden we will "Dying with Donald"
If we are not Riding with Biden we will "dying with Donald"
The Democratic Party and the liberal media will continue to say that Biden is leading in the polls so when the dems actually lose but steal the election they will say  That trump was losing all the way up to the elections so of course he lost. MEDIA CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE
I checked I have over 400 friends for Trump 2020 vs. 19 Biden supporters
Look in this f****** piece of s*** he don't care about landlord he don't own properties I don't know if he's all the way up there you look like a mental case worse from Joe Biden look at the face who going to to help landlord to recover all the month of unpaid bill TK DickSanta's
why do we have to chose between him or biden 🤦‍♂️
Joe Biden what is your plan to help get marginalized communities out to vote, are you planning on busing, register them to vote, have a task force to help them vote, have a center in their neighborhoods for early voting with a mailing system?  What is your plan?!!
Hope Biden picks her. I'm biased.  From Chicago.
Is it true that DJT order the Post Master to slow the mail down? And what are you going to do about it Joe Biden??!
Not because of Biden. They don't have equipment. Funny you left out that part.
Mark Levin  covered this on his show and it stopped me in my tracks, as I was in a state of shock learning about the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. They would file lawsuits against suburbs and tax payers are the ones that foot the bill. Thank you again Mr. President! #MAGA
You framed the question wrong. Shouldn’t it be, anyone afraid Kanye win the election or get more votes from both Biden and trump. No?
That would be Obama and Biden.......
So if yt people don’t even want to vote for Trump or Biden than who y’all voting for??
Joe Biden is almost brain dead
Biden is gonna have a lot of shit to fix.
You have to love the poles and the numbers.... so tell us if you want to be harassed and damaged or do you want Joe Bumbles Biden?
This is who you want as pres? Doesn’t sound good to me.
Joe Biden for president!
Of course Trump believes that someone with a terrible record of upholding punishments for false convictions would be a good VP pick for Biden given this country’s current political and social issues. It’s like a softball for him during any upcoming debates
Can't wait til PRESIDENT Biden goes in and cleans you out!
I’m voting for Joe Biden!
Says the person who’s candidate is JOE BIDEN😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Would this be the same Joe Biden that wrote the crime bill? Oh yeah so radically left 😂
Well this Floridian never wanted him! And my Biden 2020 flag in my front yard gets me positive comments almost daily here despite I'm surrounded by a red sea.
They asked Biden what flavor jello he had for lunch.
mention one quality that you like about Biden. Biden is a career politician (strike 1) Biden has lied about his qualifications to be elected:  graduated at bottom of his class ,  1 degree not 3... (Strike 2)  Biden has made many racist comments over his career  (strike 3)

Biden was a WRECK today
What a disaster Biden was today .. lol
Wooden, stilted, rehearsed! I’m Joe Biden and I support this message!!!
I love the Barr debates, it really shows what a bunch of idiots in the Democrat Party are trying to try and run this country . Thank God I am no longer a Democrat . Biden just said thank God  we must be alllowed to build this country , he did not add or burn it down
Based on the Anita Hill case, Biden being against busing, supporting the Iraq War and so on, I think the two are closer than you think on many of these.
Obama was even further to the right than Biden and had to be dragged into supporting gay marriage. A true leftist would in no way support drone strikes or indefinite border detaining
Biden is Reagan plus LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights. They seem to agree on almost everything else (immigration, drugs, police, health care, foreign policy etc)
Barr is lying like Trump! Trump,Pompeo and Barr are pathetic liars who are just gaslighting this country to try and stay in power. We need an honest and non corrupt Administration! Vote Biden 2020

If you werent so defensive youd realize we're saying to vote someone on the ballot and make an actual difference. If youre a Trump supporter just admit it. You dont have to hide vaguely behind "voting by my morals, which might be 3rd party or Trump, but definitely not Biden" lmao
You see? They got you. You really believe Biden is evil lmao. For what? Something he signed in the 90s?  No politician is perfect and you expecting them to be (or otherwise calling them evil) is a big problem in this country.
And yet Biden and eating shit are still better than Trump.
I can't tell if you're saying that Trump matches your morals (racism?) or if you're going to throw your vote away to someone that hasn't done anything politically either, like you claim of Biden.
But you see what's happening right? Same as in '16. The right knows Trump is a piece of shit, so their goal is to make it seem like the other person is just as bad, therefore it's a coin flip for some voters.  Biden may be status quo, but Trump sets the country back 40 years
I'm voting by mail and I'm voting for Biden!  Done!!!!!!!

Judicial Watch announced it received records from the U.S. Secret Service showing that, for the first five and a half years of the #Obama administration, Hunter #Biden traveled extensively while receiving a #SecretService protective detail.

Been seeing a lot of tweets talking about when Biden wins in November. STOP IT. Stop it now! Let’s not get complacent. Remember a few years back when everyone assumed trump wouldn’t get into office? Let’s not have that again. Time to rally people!
Hello Gov. You would be a terrific choice to be Joe Biden's running mate and I hope he selects you.  You have an impeccable background and you would do great things together.  Good luck!  In any event, the citizens of Rhode Island are proud you are their Governor.
I live in South Florida and the same, not one Biden sign anywhere
I agree. I am afraid if Biden picks an African American for VP there will be problems. trump is a bully. And there are a lot of racism that is underground. Hell, a lot of it is no longer underground.

Unfortunately, you and your pal at the WH cannot provide the leadership that our state need. We need people like Biden who are decent human beings that put the well being of the people before politics. Your neglect has costed thousands of lives that could have been saved.
We don’t need to see Biden being interviewed. It’s more fun watching  Person Man Women Camera TV.  Stable genius
Then again I'm sober and I still wouldn't vote for Biden no way.
There didn't seem to be a problem with Biden and Hussein in the same room, shootin the shit. 🤔
It's called respect.  Thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
Cant belive how nieve people are not seeing how Biden is..hes a joke
I am not a Bernie supporter lady.  Sorry.    But thanks for finding that.  I don't see any super predator speak in it, but yea, Eff Bernie, and Biden and def HRC and their supporters.  Ok, now what?  I'm still not voting for Biden.  So ????  You want a cookie?  Just made some.
So?  What makes you think I'm a Bernie fan?  Because I said screw Biden?   SCREW BIDEN!  and HRC for going out with the super predator stuff.  Since you like Google.  Google me a video of ANYONE other than HRC, Biden, or Billy clint Clint being super douchie about it.
Please stop talking about how hot Joe Biden is and focus on his policy
Biden would HATE if you retweeted
And you dont listen.  I said I dont like nor support biden.  And I rightfully despise trump.
There is no truth to your rhetoric. Nice try, but I despise Clinton &amp; Biden You truly believe your side is 'right' while supporting an incompetent asshat like trump who procured underage girls from epstein.  Laughable. You're no different than catholic priests in your hypocrisies
I still think the DNC cheated Sanders it's no way Biden should have won Texas with no support there

More if he gets a second term. He will get that. Too many ppl on the left think, why vote? I've got things to do. Someone else will do it. Then you just voted for Trump. Ppl have to vote Biden. And senators as well.
Hey, didn’t they have a fiery exchange about busing or done legislation Biden authored??
I admire her greatly, but will she be the inspiring person needed to add life into the Biden campaign? I’m not so sure. She is part of the old regime. This campaign needs new blood, something to show DEMS are moving forward not relying on the past. Biden is more than we can hai
What you really mean is Joe Biden won’t sit for any Interview! Everything is pre-taped and edited! He is not capable!

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obviously ur not a true democrat bc if you were, you would be questioning A&amp; speaking out against Pelosi, Schumer, Waters and the idiots like AOC.  Biden is a puppet who can’t remember what office he’s running for, can’t remember his wife from his sister. He can’t remember shit!
Where is the justice for you ignoring the constitution, getting foreign governments to help you win an election, blackmaing Ukraine for dirt on Biden and obstructing investigations and telling admin to ignore subpoenas. So much for LAW &amp; ORDER!  Such a loser. No winning for you!!
Those who hate Trump are going to think that regardless.  The people who are undecided will side w/ Biden if he doesn’t restore order and side w/ Trump if he does.  Those who love Trump may jump off the Trump train if he lets this continue.  THERE ARE NO CONS TO RESTORING ORDER..
No worries, as soon as Biden is in office he'll be back to screaming about government overreach.
Reverse the polls saying Biden 62% and Pres 38 such BS
Part of Joe Biden's Inaugural speech will be "I will tear down this wall"!
Omg.  As Biden would say, that’s a bunch of malarkey.  🙄
#Trump2020 Mr president you must win Florida send your best people. We can’t let Biden win
Thanks Stacy
Is that why Biden is up in ALL polls!  You're going down DUMPY!
They will vote Biden because they want a leader who won't give up on America like you did. You couldn't handle the crisis America faced &amp; gave up Americans want a real leader who won't abandon America during a crisis. On Nov 3rd, you're fired for incompetence &amp; epic failures.
No worries.  Everyone knows Biden is close to being brain dead. I can't wait to pull the plug.
???? You know that ad is a lie. Biden want to add to police funding.   Stop drinking the kool-aid.
That's pretty much it, frankly. Hence why it's the default choice, in a broken duopoly of a system were stuck with for the time being.  Biden might be an out of touch crypt keeper but at least he's not a malicious narcissist crypt keeper.
Haven't decided. Currently Biden, but hate that I have no viable alternative. Keeping a watchful eye on #Unity2020. In no foreseeable circumstance do I vote for Trump, and Kanye is simply just manic right now. It's obvious this isn't a serious campaign.

Biden/Anybody is ok with me at this point, as long as it's not "him".
Don't know, would only be speculating, but I am ok with Harris, Warren, Rice, Duckworth, Bottoms. Trust Joe Biden to make the best choice.

At least to about the middle of next year. If it is still raging on January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will institute a national "wear a mask" program that will FINALLY get it under control.

Joe Biden Slams Trump Over Treatment of Latino Workers
Biden is supposedly considering someone named Bass as his VP.  Can you say fish face?
Agree. My only fear is that Biden may feel that he’ll be overshadowed by her, charismatic as Kamala is (which would be a shame).
Yeah that’s not entirely true - the entire dem platform is catered to republicans- they have zero leftist policies and nothing for independent voters - trump is even to the left of biden on foreign policy
What is your plan Mr Biden ??a lot of criticism but no plan ???

I don't think there's been any change in awareness of Joe Biden's platform from July 24 to July 29.  I think it's a lot more likely Change Research was just a shitty poll.   Let's see how the polls change over the next few weeks when we get a clearer view ✌
Not Donald Trump falsely attacking Joe Biden for not wanting to pick a Latino VP when HIS Vice President is   *checks notes*   Mike Pence
They’re already attacking Biden in Spanish TV ads for not picking a Latina VP. The ad is meant to turn brown people against black people. It isn’t going to work but it shows where they’re going.
Prediction: Trump camp is going to abandon the ‘law &amp; order’ campaign for a bit since it’s not working.They will be throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks.Most likely strategy is to attack Biden as a racist/sexist &amp; attack the VP candidate to depress D turnout.
🤣🤣🤣 more peopl votes for McCain against Obama than Bernie voters voted for trump. Stop putting shit candidates out there and you would get more votes. It doesn’t get more establishment than Clinton and Biden.
You're citing the Change Research poll. For what that's worth, it's rated poorly by 538. Other polls show a more sizable lead. Five days earlier, the better-rated pollster Fox had Biden far outside the MOE in each rust belt state

I’ve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
What’s at stake this Nov is the future of America... as we know it. If Biden is elected, you can kiss everything goodbye 👋🏻
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.
And some want to vote for Biden so he can kiss Xi’s arse like did Putin !
Wow! So soon! A plan? House hearing finds US no closer to plan as coronavirus is 'raging out of control' – live

You are wrong, the Castro stuff has PLENTY of teeth here in Florida. Trump has been running ads accusing Democrats of being "socialists" for weeks on Hispanic media, and it ABSOLUTELY moves the needle here. This would be a very bad choice for Biden if he wants to win Florida.
That’s kinda fair but I think the primary process turned out to be important and useful. Biden got better as it went on and Democratic bench got stronger.
we got some former candidates raising money for Biden via “grassroots movements” and some just sucking cash out of Super PACs lmfaooooooooo like I cannot take the hypocrisy and headassery I’m seeing
Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I hate that we’ve resorted to a 2nd primary- except none of us get a vote. I sincerely believe Biden knew who he was going to pick a long time ago &amp; this whole thing has been an attempt to amplify multiple voices. It was working that way until recently. Now it’s needlessly ugly.
hearing people talk highly about Biden and obama is so cringey😖
Joe Biden trying to win black votes
I went ahead &amp; ordered a Biden/Warren 2020 t-shirt today. If she isn't selected, I'll have a T-shirt; if she is selected, the country will have a brilliant &amp; amazing VP next year.
with all of the actual points you could make against Trump you chose misinformation claiming he denied the virus existed yet it was Biden who called Trump a racist when he banned travel from China early in the Pandemic  but at least you are correct on one account- we won't forget
The Biden campaign should be concerned about the secret $400,000 settlement  office paid to settle 'gender harassment' claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.
Trump and Biden are pretty equal on their terrible policies so yeah a vote for biden is a vote for trumps policies and a vote for trump is a vote for bidens policies

I think the decision is already made but the announcement was pushed back due to the John Lewis death and funeral. It would’ve been in bad taste to make a such positive announcement during a week of public mourning. DT likes to do things like that, not Joe Biden.

Don’t believe ANY republican that says they are going to vote for Biden. Don’t even believe ultra rich liberals. The money they are worried about losing is what will ultimately make them vote Trump. Think about how often people say one thing and do another in this country.
Newsom Cuomo Yang Gabbard Booker - all of them would have helped Biden win and govern. The choice now is simply woke posturing and foregone that it is a Women POC. Zero interest.
Exactly. I think most of us are not as excited with Biden himself.   The vote now is against Trump. We need to move on.
I think this can be like when McCain was with Palin.  She contributed tremendously to his loss.  I think Biden has to be smart but at this point we should all be so excited for Biden that it should not matter, yet here we are. Unexcited.
I myself don't even like Biden as a candidate and I would feel like I am voting for the pink panter if I were to have to vote for Kamala Harris but I think now it is clear what we have. My vote is not for Biden but it is against Trump.   At this point it's not  about the tkt
#Biden equals chaos!
🚨🚨🚨 If he doesn’t want to seriously  endanger his chances of winning Florida Joe Biden MUST steer clear of Bass as his choice for VP. She represents a MAJOR risk in a key swing state. Remember the cardinal rule for choosing a VP: “first, do no harm.” In Florida, she would.
Bruh. You don’t vote for Joe Biden, you ain’t black.
Can't wait to see who Biden's VP pick is...a man, or a woMAN 😏
Biden in his late appearances, plagiarizes again! All President Trump's campaign guidelines! Promises!
Bass would be a terrible choice if Biden wants to win Florida. Her condolences after Fidel Castro’s death will cause a huge backlash from Florida’s Hispanic community, imperiling his bid to win the state. Not worth the MAJOR RISK she represents in a key swing state.

“When Biden told reporters...he would choose a running mate in the first week of August, two aides told CNN that the timing of an announcement was more likely to be pushed back until the week of August 10. But Biden's advisers gave him a deadline of next week to make up his mind”
I've been telling people for months that I intend to write in Bernie, part because he got robbed and to piss off anyone bothered by that. I can be reasonable, but Biden has done absolutely nothing to earn my vote I don't care how bad orange man is
Education :)
Looks like Curbelo won by a little less than 12 in 2016. I get the point, and it’s not safe D. That said, it went D in 2018 despite lower margins on top ticket races. If Biden wins by 18-20, will ticket splitting save CG?
It sounds good for Biden so I believe this one
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don’t believe me look at Joe Biden’s draconian record on black issues.

Joe Biden is apparently up 10% points in Florida... a state where he has zero visible support... meanwhile everywhere you go there are Trump flags, signs, and bumper stickers.  Ok.
if you don’t address these two issues you won’t win the election 1. How to pay your rent/mortgage specially if you loose your work to COVID19 2. Food on the table anything else will end backfiring and Biden doesn’t even need to speak
Biden and Trump aren’t the only two people running for office. There are other candidates with great ideas and motivation to help this country
. organized &amp; participated in Communist brigades that brutally assisted the Castro regime in repressing dissidents corralled in #Cuba's forced labor camps.  Joe Biden's VP pick is a brutal Communist who enjoyed repressing the Cuban people!

Good one and true! Strawman Biden is owned by Xi
Wait until Biden steps down, she becomes President AND then she selects Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Will be a freaking nightmare.
Biden seems pretty committed to having a woman of color as his VP. It would be great if he chose Warren, but I'm not optimistic.
The edited video ads of a “senile” Joe Biden are hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣   your cult leader Trump has the communication skills of a preschooler not to mention he’s a liar and a cheat. He will go down as the most corrupt president of our times
Not as many times as Joe Biden has bent his knee to them... that is for sure...
Joe Biden believed in segregation btw
Weekend at Bernies ,tell your boss Biden its ok to step down now thank him for his service for us !!!!
I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don’t go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it’s absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as “progress.” The only reason why Biden isn’t seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn’t? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn’t a single policy that Biden supports that I’m in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.
The guy who supported Pete Buttigieg and now supports Biden says Elon Musk is “bad at politics” lmao.
Guilting people using a mans death into voting for someone who isn’t any different than Trump ideologically speaking is disgusting. Name one thing that Biden is against that Trump isn’t either. It’s pointless to vote and to settle on candidates that are simply corrupt bureaucrats

Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn’t care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
Brain Dead Biden
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.

These people are delusional.  That’s why I’ve changed parties, voting RED this November.  They criticize like if there is a “Guideline to Combat a COVID Pandemic” and was not followed.  They cannot even say something good about Biden. So, they criticize.
I think it's great that folks from outside of this country would vote for him. If eligible, Trump could run and win the presidency both here in the US and in Russia. Bet Biden can't say the same.

Wait if Biden got anywhere close to a new deal, that would be less desirable than the status quo? I respect everyone's opinion and embrace reasoned debate. You and I will not find common ground on this issue but I very much respect your opinion.
Yes i do but I'm just saying, having biden would be the worse choive to have as president. No police, segregation may make a comeback, far more blacks in jail. You can say what you want about trump but before covid or in this the chinese virus, he was doing great
Honestly, if you're looking for a president that's willing to do more for blacks, I'd recommend trumps since biden wants to imprision/incarcerate more blacks and not to mention that he's a segregationist
We hope that you fixed that.  Biden for President!

I am outraged that a Trump is giving a campaign speech as opposed to a Presser. Biden should have equal time.
I'll explain what is happening here.  No one gives a damn about Biden. No one likes Biden. No one is excited about Biden. 2/3 of the Biden vote in a recent poll were voting AGAINST Trump, not FOR Biden. 90% of Trump voters were voting FOR Trump.  If that hold, Biden loses YUGE.
Watching Trump on TV outright lie to the citizens of the United States.  Oregon &amp;other states have been voting by mail for years.They have the data to prove it works.  I object to Trump doing a campaign speech on national TV. Biden deserves equal time to address all US citizens

That was my dream ticket last year but I knew it was going to end up being Biden/Harris. I say Harris/Buttigieg 202X because Biden running as an incumbent might be too good of an opportunity to pass up. It’s going to happen though.
Biden is going to get crushed and the #Media will be left shaking their heads as to why the polls "were so wrong" again.
By 2:1, Biden voters are voting AGAINST Trump and not FOR Biden. That is NOT a winning formula folks, especially when you are counting on youth and black votes to get you across the finish line. These groups turn out FOR candidates they are EXCITED about, not to vote AGAINST one.

This article on voter enthusiasm spells DOOM for Biden in November and is being IGNORED by the #Media:
Remember what I was saying about Trump leading on voter enthusiasm?  It's actually 2:1 over Biden.  No wonder no one has polled this again since early June.
Yes let's vote for biden so he can imprision and segregate blacks. Let's vote for biden so he can get rid of the police completely. That sure sounds like a good president. Definitely sounds better than the orange man who's made black lives better and made drug prices low.

F**k off Bernout. Don’t slide in here with that nonsense. Biden is in excellent health. Bernie Sanders will never be President.
The dirty secret of "fraud-by-mail" is this - Democrats know their base will not turn out for Biden, so they plan to "harvest" those stay-at-home voters with mail-in's.  Democrats are losing, they know they are losing and they will do ANYTHING, including cheat to avoid that.
Bernie is not the nominee because 18-30 year old voters had record low turnout in the primaries, in some cases down by 50% or more from 2016.  If Bernie himself could get only half the 18-30 turnout Hillary got, what hope does old white guy Biden have?
How is it Trump voters have the highest enthusiasm ever recorded and Trump's approval among Republicans is a record 96% while Biden is losing the black vote and young vote as never before with Bernie voters threatening to stay home, yet Biden leads by 14?  Impossible math.
We have heard many former leaders from the Bernie Movement claiming they have no intention of voting for Biden.  This represents as much as 1/3 of the Democrat base potentially staying home or voting Trump out of protest of the DNC.  Why do you think they want fraud-by-mail?
I don't know about Democrats, but Republicans are PISSED and ready to vote in their greatest numbers ever.  Proof?  Turnout for President Trump in primaries has SHATTERED all prior records for incumbents. Not merely exceeded, SHATTERED.  Meanwhile there is ZERO Biden enthusiasm.

Biden picking kamala in this social climate would be quite foolish considering she still defends her terrible prosecutorial record.

To give you an idea of Democrat priorities: her history of prosecuting poor Black people to the full extent of the law isn't on the list of reasons some don't want Kamala Harris as VP, but it would definitely be on brand with Joe Biden.
This pile on is a clear indication that ⁦ is leading the VP field by a mile.  Obama supporters had reservations about Joe Biden in 2008 after he made a major verbal gaffe about his future running mate.  That still worked out...
"The..nominee wants to pick someone..like him (or at least the way he saw himself as VP): loyal, trusted, experienced, apolitical, someone with whom he will bond ... if Biden’s demand for loyalty is paramount, several top Dems questioned whether Harris would be the right choice."
That’s where we would be if Hillary Clinton had been our President.  Or Obama. Or anyone. Biden certainly.
Biden said, “Robert C. Byrd the KKK recruiter and Kleagle elevated the Senate.” History don’t Lie

The attack to which Jill Biden considered "a punch to the gut" was not in reference to Biden touting his work with Eastland, but Harris suggesting Biden was racist for opposing federally-mandated busing, which, adding insult to injury, was the same position Harris, herself, held.
Terminal means he ain't gonna be voted out by senile Joe Biden.
Yes 👍 She should focus on becoming president. The white elephant in the room is Biden’s age. He’ll be 78 at inauguration time. We’re vulnerable at any age. It increases exponentially at his age.  We need someone prepared to clean up this sh*t Trumps made. It will take years.

The best reason for third party simps to go vote for Biden this year: you think he'll be strong enough for a second term? Let him be marginally better than Trump for 4 years. Then you primary his then 82 year old ass with a real progressive.
I imagine not knowing which of Trump or Biden is purely some rich people shit because everyday problems of race, class, etc don't touch their lives. I have SOME understanding of regular people's lack of motivation to vote at all. Not sure how Biden's VP choice changes either mind

Good thing Biden is running because he loves black people, and u ain’t black if u don’t vote for him
I will vote blue, more against Trump than for the Dem party frankly. I think it is my civil duty although Biden is not a candidate motivating the masses and many Republicans just can’t make the jump.  I am a moderate but those who are clearly Republican are struggling to choose.
Biggest concern with Harris from Biden’s perspective imo isn’t the debate moment, but the pieces on how dysfunctional her campaign was. It was rife with internal drama &amp; the staff leaked like a faucet.   The culture of the campaign is tea leaves for the culture while in office.
REMINDER: Donald Trump started off his career by blocking Black people from living in his buildings. He is a racist.   Please talk to your friends instead about how Joe Biden would defend fair housing and work to root out discrimination.

I'd hardly say I'm a "joe biden supporter" but it's the whole lesser-of-two-evils thing.  I think Biden would go back to Business-As-Usual, somewhat repair our image on an international stage, and Yang could get a cabinet spot which helps him launch for 2024.
If they're smart, they will drag their feet a little.  Why pull people out if Biden puts them back in?
Too close to comfort? I assume Jeet is saying he’s concerned Biden might win.
But you are against the census citizen question and everyone registering to vote? Overreach much? OK Basement Biden.
Mr Biden I wouldn't pick Harris because of her job record.
They say "I've never seen any evidence of that I'll have to do some research. But Biden..."
Calling it now. Kamala Harris is a misdirection on the Biden Veepstakes. Michelle Obama is my guess. Biden just wants to be President- would be willing to get elected and give the Presidency over to the Obamas.

If you ever wondered if Joe Biden is really a sellout here’s your answer
There are dozens of reasons why  is dangerous to America but the one that is most disconcerting is that when she steps in as President as Biden steps down, she will select Hillary Clinton as her VP.  Clinton had her facelift in December 2019.
At Biden's urging, Democrat Party delegates have rejected a federal marijuana legalization amendment to the 2020 party platform.
Presidents normally vote by mail and so do most officials. You did not know this Biden? Or did you forget again?
Looks like it's going to be Kamala Harris more and more. I think Obama and Hillary are pushing for her behind the scenes.

I’ve been suspicious of Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP-pick since last year.  My nightmare scenario is Biden steps down after wife declares him unfit to serve, Congress invokes the 25th, Harris becomes President, then she chooses Hillary as her VP.  A fkn nightmare for our republic.
Just like in the House neither the Speaker or the president pro tempore has to actually be a member of Congress. In this situation the senate dems could choose Biden to be the pro tempore on January 3rd and then he would become president on January 21st when trump term ended.
I'm no Biden fan but I don't think this is true. His polling lead is wider.
what else can we do, stay with orange man who is closer to a psychotic break than Kanye? It's so disgusting that's it's come down to this situation of choosing the lesser of both evils but we can surely make Biden the president who also doesn't get reelected.

🚨🚨🚨 If he doesn’t want to seriously  endanger his chances of winning Florida Joe Biden MUST steer clear of Bass as his choice for VP. She represents a MAJOR risk in a key swing state. Remember the cardinal rule for choosing a VP: “first, do no harm.” In Florida, she would.
Bruh. You don’t vote for Joe Biden, you ain’t black.

I have absolutely zero doubts Trump will be re-elected and we'll retake the House on his coattails. 2/3rds of Biden voters don't even like Biden, they just hate Trump. We saw how THAT worked out for Romney in 2012.
So don’t go guilting people for not voting because the system is broken and it’s absolutely idiotic to think people should vote for the lesser of two evils and see that as “progress.” The only reason why Biden isn’t seen as negative as Trump is because his mind is so fried
What is it that Biden provides that Trump doesn’t? Both are against UBI Healthcare for all, ending foreign occupation, Free education, etc. there isn’t a single policy that Biden supports that I’m in favor for. Tired of neoliberals thinking people have to settle.

When did Farrakhan say he was voting for Biden in November?
Would you ha e been so incolved if it would have been a Biden supporter. I didn't think so. Goodbye antagonist.
You are a Democrat puppet. Notice this guy says he is running for President, but only attacks the Republican President🤔. I hope it backfires and takes votes away from  Sleepy Joe Biden
And the next person who will serve as President (Biden) can reverse it, so your Great Leader van enjoy the next several months
We don’t worry about them now because this isn’t Joe Biden
Biden 2020 clean the trump swamp
What can we expect from a racist.  Also, this is a rule change and guess what, Biden can adjust it as well.  This is a political tactic if I ever saw one
Just make sure all our Bernie Bros Vote for Biden
Never has a President been so loved by at least 150,000,000 people Dems can’t win with brain dead biden
Can somebody tell me if its true that George W Bush is trying to turn Texas blue and that he is voting Biden
Also, being that a lot of trump followers disregard the virus/doesn’t care about masks, I feel like they would have the advantage going to the polls... unless the numbers are right and Biden is in the lead, then it would make more sense for trump to all of a sudden care.
It is true that between Biden and the orange clown the obvious choice is Biden no argument there, but failing to see that Joe Biden is not 100% there...and he cannot even say a coherent thought or phrase really is mind boggling!!
3) And the more energized base.  Cancellation isn't compelling. It's repulsive.  And Biden's base consists of nothing more than the old guard of party bosses, the donor class and old media. In short, Hillary's base. How well did that work out?
1) Isn't funny? The very same pundits, corporate media outlets and their pollsters - none of whom saw the Trump phenomenon triumphing - are claiming Biden has it in the bag.  They apparently never got the memo about the 2016 election: politics isn't like money ball.
At least Biden has a brain and empathy and he cares about the country. He doesn’t want to politically divide the country , or be racist like you, or to promotpeople to get sick and not wear masks and promoting fraud in all your 20,000 lies. You are owned by Putin!  You will lose!
He will! Biden 2020
He’s actually defending The Constitution against The Deep State that has been in control for decades of both parties, but have specifically destroyed my beloved Democratic Party to a point that is unrecognizable and Obama/Biden/Hillary has been major enablers

You can dream !!!!  Never again ! Biden 2020 all the way !!
Obama oversaw the most corrupt administration in American history:  Obamagate IRS Targeting Biden &amp; Ukraine Benghazi Fast &amp; Furious Solyndra Cash to Iran Hillary’s Emails Uranium One The VA Cover Up  We should be holding him accountable, not celebrating him.

It was also the chasis upon which a middle class flourished, modernized infrastructure, and US ascension to arguably greatest world power in history. There was a lot of leveraging the future but can you be both more progressive than #Biden and more fiscally conservative? 🤔DEMOCRATIC PARTY ONLY CHANCE TO WIN IN 2020..... REPLACE BIDEN FOR MICHELLE OBAMA

Biden is so bad at this he will probably pick Ellen DeGeneres as his VP
Democrats called the FBI after finding shipping receipt for anti-Biden dirt sent to Devin Nunes from overseas: report | Raw Story  via rawstory
Joe Biden thinks he is running for the senate and he was never a quality human. Explain how someone in a government job for 50 years becomes wealthy. He embarrasses the country every time he speaks.
THEY NEVER THOUGHT HILLARY WOULD LOSE..... FUTURE PREDICTION TRUMP WILL WIN IN A LANDSLIDE.....BIDEN WON'T BE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL REPLACE BIDEN.....WHO WILL REPLACE BIDEN???
Are u literally the last person on earth to believe the Putin conspiracy theory? You prob believe the impeachment evidence but not the quid pro quo that Biden and Son were mixed up in with Ukraine. And u must also believe Clinton when he perjured himself. U will believe anything!
REMEMBER THE WORLD TOLD YOU ALL.....TRUMP WILL NEVER BECOME PRESIDENT.....YOU BEEN LIED TO......FULL CIRCLE BIDEN POLLS LMFAO CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT....YOUR FUTURE HAS ALREADY BEEN PREDICTED 👇👇👇
Trump Powerful? His power has limits. He can’t stop the press from lying. Remember the press brought down Nixon, covered for Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Biden.   The media reports what they want to report. Trump has done good but we rarely hear about it from the media!
WATCH DEMOCRATIC PARTY REMOVE BIDEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.....WILL WE SEE A TRUMP AND BIDEN DEBATE??? WILL THIS BE THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY, AMERICA HAS NO PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S???
NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN ALREADY.....WHERE IS BIDEN??? YOU HAVE NO CLUE DO YOU???
The person Joe Biden picks should be chosen BY JOE BIDEN! It has to be someone HE FEELS COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH. It is his decision and his alone! I'm sick of hearing people like JOY REID bullying him into picking a black woman simply because of her race!
The Democratic Party is immoral. Vote for Biden if you want, but at least have the decency to be ashamed about it.
look I never Believe in Poll Numbers they are always Wrong, Biden is a idiot, AOC is a stupid young kid who knows no better, The Muslim ladies on Congress should have never been in Congress,
Right!!! Biden is creepy AF!!
Feinstein: Letting Americans sue China over coronavirus response would be 'huge mistake'  #FoxNews  For her and Biden's big interest in China $$$
Biden and Dems would disband Customs and Border Patrol, if given the chance. That alone is enough to make a sane person vote for Trump in 2020!
Biden will be withdrawing soon due to real mental issues that is if he isn’t forced to withdraw for the Burisma fiasco he did with his boy! U know, the real quid pro quo billion $ deal! It’s sad you can’t see who actually cares for our country. I hope yr ready for 4 more years!
It’s always partisan politics!  There was nothing serious about that. Trump did nothing wrong.  It was obvious. The Dems were grandstanding.   It was such a “solemn moment” wink wink!   I’m guessing u saw all that REAL evidence against Biden  Son?  The billion $ quid pro quo?
WILL THIS BE THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY, THERE WILL BE NO PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S??? NO WAY; WE THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE TRUMP AND BIDEN HAVE A DEBATE..... HISTORY IN THE MAKING 👇
WHERE IS BIDEN? WHY IS OBAMA HAVING A RALLY AT A FUNERAL? WHO IS IN CONTROL? WHO REALLY IS IN CONTROL? #PAIN  THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD NOT FEEL SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS #FEAR
No no no no no! Because of Biden’s age, we CAN’T have a VP that old.  I have other reasons as well,  but that is my main reason.  I am for  as VP.
This is Biden doing his best to look like Putin!
It’s called throwing as much mud as possible at Trump and hoping any thing will stick! The mud doesn’t even have to be true just as long as it’s salacious and can convince a  biased media to run with a false narrative! During the campaign Trump will talk about Biden-China/Burisma
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president   Condolence Rice ia the most experienced, qualified, black (no offensive but a truth) woman and idoneous VP
Kamala Harris selected as VP, will be the worse choice, that Biden could do, it would signal that those whom doubt his mind clear condition, are right and correctly doubt his qualification.  The most idoneous ticket reflecting smart and sound selection, would be Condolence Rice.
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I’m Nervous For Biden’s Health. I Predict A Plot Involving Biden’s Health To Redirect The DNC Campaign. Lord Knows Epstein Didn’t Make it... Democrats Are Too Desparate To Win. I Hope I’m Wrong For Biden’s Sake.
If Biden wins the popular vote by 9% there's no way he's losing the electoral college, Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%, if she won by 3% she'd be president
No. He lost due to a bad campaign and a poor candidacy.  Trying to be what the Party wanted - and not himself.  It never should have been close.  But it was.  Just like with Hillary (and with Biden).
It's worse if Biden wins because his VP will be the nominee in 2024. The DNC won't even have a pretend primary like in 2016 &amp; 2020. The Democratic nominee will be Biden's VP; no chance of a progressive candidate unless we have a 3rd party up and running.
Better than Joe Biden and your Shit Show.
He didn't lose it.  He quit.  Biden didn't win it.
In this universe - Joe Biden is a LOSING proposition.
He has done more for the Democratic Party this year than Biden has, unfortunately.  Bernie was a fool to try and play in the party game.
I'm not mad at Biden.  I don't like Biden.
I don't think - I KNOW that contrary to their constitutional role - in practice - the parties operate by having the Presidents propose policies.  What do you think Biden and the Democrats have been proposing?  And you don't need to overcome a filibuster to PROPOSE legislation.
They have not progressed under one party.  Both parties are meant to keep them FROM progressing.  Sorry Biden is no "winner."
1) I am not voting for Trump; 2) You are likely going to lose to Trump; 3) the ACA was a bailout for Insurance Companies and kept health care DEPENDENT on Insurance.  There is no field, this is no game.  Biden is on the other side.
Joe Biden and the Democrats are BAD.
It's not "sour grapes." I OPPOSE the Democratic Party and Joe Biden.
No I am not supporting Trump. How hard is that to understand. I support NEITHER Trump nor Biden.  Get it - neither.  Neither is promoting a progressive agenda.  Learn how we got into this mess in the first place (playing the two party game).
I'm not voting for Trump.  Or Biden.
Biden is running as a Republican.  For Republican votes.
Biden isn't a Progressive.  So voting for Biden is not what Progressives do.
Biden loved hunter mooooore 😬
You need more? Search "Biden sniff" in the gif and you get a bunch of pictures of him with little kids.
If Biden wins pandemic ends  If trump wins they’ll create another pandemic   Democrats have run out of options.
Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
Biden is stepping in the WRONG DIRECTION.
TBF Cheney (WY), Biden (DE), Lieberman (CT), Palin (AK) weren’t from swing states. Also Paul Ryan didn’t net Romney Wisconsin
Biden can win but not by more than 3. We are a very inelastic state
And Biden’s been doing it right for 50-years?
So true. I don't believe any of the COVID19 numbers he reports. I am voting for Biden!
Its not about Trump.  You can’t restore a democracy undemocratically.  Biden is a joke and an insult.  I would never vote for him.
I love  so much!  "Bernie’s Campaign Co-Chair Says Voting For Biden Is Like Eating ‘A Bowl Of Shit’  via
This are going well enough for the Biden campaign, they need to fix that Dodd mess ASAP.
He’s lost both he and Biden.
While I disagree, I don’t have a problem with Republicans voting for Biden. What I don’t like are self proclaimed Republicans advocating for voting straight ticket Dem
Biden could very well win but SC? I’d bet my home and my entire life savings on Trump getting a similar margin there as in 2016
Trump 2020 and if not since the polls say biden they are the same pools said Trump down in 2016 Fixed, Biden will destroy this country and he wont run it his VP will how sad
Bernie supporters get a life already it's time to change the country Bernie couldn't do it so support BIDEN and FIRE Trump.... #VoteBIDEN2020 end the madness that disgraced OUR WH and shamed OUR country....
Yes vote for Biden he’s been in politics for almost 50 years but now he has all the answers .  Lol #DementiaJoe
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN!!!
#DescribePoliticsIn3Words Joe Biden, Really?
your a scumbag.  Your Trumps buddy. You just wanna hurt Biden.  Go away you nutbag!
Watch what happens to Trump and his fellow assholes the moment Biden kicks them out of the White House. You want arrests?  You're going to see arrests.
The latest email from  asks us to sign a petition to have reusable masks sent to everyone. So that's where we are. We could've had the #MedicareForAll president but instead we'll be lucky if the least we get is masks. JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN FUCK OFF.
Biden all the way 2020, the only hope for this country as we knew it!!
Biden is lowkey racist. Trump just doesn't care.

I have yet to see a Biden sign 😎😎😎
Because Biden is positioning himself as a Republican.
It is only going to get crazier.  The worst idea was this artificial unity for Biden.  Its likely to backfire.
No I haven't seen any Biden signs but lots of primary signs people running for clerk of courts, judges, etc. I have seen Trump signs in Polk county but have not seen them in Osceola or orange county.
Yes, yes, yes. I have neighbors who voted for Trump in '16 but will not vote for him this year! They are all voting Biden. They are all long-time Republicans over 65. #TrumpIsLosing
I mean honestly this is the first time I think Biden will win Florida. But I def think it will be close.
It is a strong possibility that Trump may very well lose. But I’m 99.9% certain it won’t be a 1980 landslide for Biden
PUPPET BIDEN, MUST FOLLOW THE 16 YEAR PLAN TO DESTROY AMERICA..... SAYS THE PUPPET MASTERS....
Polling is basically voodoo/astrology these days. It’s all about fundamentals. If a poll showed Trump and Biden tied in NJ, we’d rightly wipe our asses with it
Don’t Vote Biden. That’ll literally be the end of everything as we know it. We can work it out with Trump in office. This is only in parts of the United States
If Biden does win Florida, be within 3 points, that’s just how the state works. You can’t believe polls
Where is the uproar about Biden's racism that is pretty blatant?  Thanks  for bringing it to light!
IN THE MIND OF OBAMA....... NOT NOW BIDEN....STOP YOUR TICKLING ME......NO NOT THE HAIR IT IS MY TICKLISH SPOT....
Yes you have and we thank you Mr. President. You Will and have done a lot more then Biden can or has done is whole entire career. Biden doesn't even know what he is talking about example:
him just like he has used all of those that voted for him in the past and who will just vote for Biden because Obama tells them to. #PUPPET #ObamaGateIsReal #Trump2020VictoryNowMoreThanEver
Joe Biden can't pass one and you know it. You have no common sense which is why you are butt hurt by Trump. Joe Biden just shook his head and maybe said like a few words. Obama isn't running for president he needs to shut his mouth stop spoon feeding Biden because he is using
You want to see a bad memory, just wait if Biden gets elected. That empty vessel will lead us straight to hell. The dems already have us half way there!
The Ministry of Truth: Pelosi, Biden, Newsome, etc... hold 3 truths self-evident: 1. Rioting &amp; Looting is Friendly Protesting 2. Defunding Police is Caring. 3. Locking Down Americans is Freedom. Remember this come November and bring 'em down!
But we have the Ministry of Truth: Pelosi, Biden, Newsome, etc...They hold these 3 truths self-evident. 1. Rioting &amp; Looting is Friendly Protest. 2. Defunding Police is Caring. 3. Locking Down Americans is Freedom. But wait, you're right, it's tyranny!!!!
Why is Biden not being questioned by the lame stream media regarding his son's dealings with Burisma and China.
This tweet makes no sense...  ask who 90% of these people would vote for.these arent the “MAGAmorons” that are destroying the cities.nor is it Trump or Trump’s cabinet.  How can you say I want to vote for Biden because Biden supporters burn down cities while “MagaMorons” dont?
WIN POSTING Q POST/DROPS OF OBAMA AND BIDEN GET ME BAN FROM TWATTER??? NO.....I KNOW PUT Q POST OF TRUMP THAT WILL WORK.....LETS FIND OUT

Don’t care. Biden will be President.
It will be known when all legally cast votes are counted. Could be that night. Biden in a landslide.
Not a chance. Biden will win in a landslide and after that, the only unresolved issue will be where to send trump's last presidential check. By the way, these conspiracy theory, worst case scenario stories, serve no real purpose. Report real news and lay off the what if stories.
I was watching and thought, oh noo, he caught whatever Joe Biden has, he thinks he's running a campaign again. I was hoping someone would remind him he was doing a eulogy. 🥴
These are Biden rallies....10 days for Ginsburg ?
This was a eulogy?  More like a campaign speech for Biden.  Shameful.
Big Enthusiasm for Sleepy Creepy Joe !😱😱 Only 247 People Are Watching Joe Biden Attempt to Read a Teleprompter in His Basement  via
I don’t 100% agree with that. And although them and Biden aren’t the answer it’s a fuck ton better than the Dictator we currently have. I feel like PL is Atleast dividing the GOO
Like Joe Biden?
Right . Trump can actually think for himself and not a puppet like Biden would be
Threaten to suspend it and then see how fast this mail in voting stops. This corona is serious stuff. The Dumbacrats say you don’t take it seriously and don’t do enough . Biden is stuck in his basement. You can’t do rallies and cancelled the RNC. Suspend the election. !!!!
I’m not against NATO, but the other countries have to meet their obligations, or by their actions they are saying they don’t care about NATO. Reagan comparisons aren’t valid as the USSR doesn’t exist and no one sees that China is that new threat yet. Even ppl like Biden
There is nothing that they can “uncover” about  Biden or his son  that would make me vote for DJT. Nothing.
Bumbling Biden in rare form. Stayed tuned . Plenty more to come

Remember the movie Death Becomes Her, yeah that’s what’s going on, they cannot have her die just yet. I believe they are doing the same thing with Biden.
Your placard insinuated that Biden's supporters are killing cops, destroying property, looting, etc. I didn't put those words in your mouth, you posted them. Don't post statements like that if you don't mean it. Again I assume you aren't in favor of cops shooting unarmed people.
Obama Biden was pretty bad.
Oh please try something else we aren’t buying what your selling about Biden. Florida for Biden
Joe Biden would need a handler to help him find the helicopter and navigate the stairs.
Biden will do and say whatever his "handlers" tell him to.  "Ignore the man behind the curtain"!
If .exe Biden wins, how long before no one cares about the virus?
Who knows gregg. Bumbling Biden doesn’t realize he even said that. You can see them already setting this thing up for claims of voter suppression . They call someone having to show a picture ID to vote , a form of voter suppression. Yep; suppression of an illegal vote!!!
He really is sleepy joe...so boring to watch. It’s like a nascar race; people go to see the wrecks. I just watch bumbling Biden to catch the next gaff ...!!!
You know what?.. I’m not even gonna debate this, I’m glad you came around and decided to vote for biden!
I can't wait till you're our FLOTUS. We really need one that does important work like this. Thank you Dr. Biden.
Wait.  What happened to the “summer of love”? How do people with a mental IQ of 50 get elected?  How is a sub zero IQ man Biden the Democratic nominee? Where are the real democrats? Cowering in the corner with the GOP? If we don’t fight we lose America.Equation: DEM=GOP.  No dif.
Nadler and Swalwell are tied for this honor, but Biden definitely has them both beat !
Joe Biden IS A NOTHING !!!
Lets just buy minorities their own business, and have the Biden Family and the Chinese run it for them !
We will in Florida. Florida for Biden
Her voice is an important voice, but I don't know anything about her.
Biden?   jumped all over your Veep announcement
Ok. I believe Trump mishandled it early on just like most of the world but when he did ban flights from China and later Europe he was called a xenophobe by Biden.... calling him a racist for trying to shut down incoming flights. A lot more should have been done... no doubt...
Biden must win.
this is so pathetic to answer presubmitted questions by pre approved reporters. This is what North Korea and communist China do.  Biden is so feeble he cannot do a real press event with real questions without a teleprompter.  I'm embarrassed for you.
Ok... Biden believes whatever they tell him to believe. Gun sales are going through the roof. There are almost as many democrats buying them as republicans. I hate the two party system. I feel they are holding us hostage. Nobody feels safe right now.
... I’ve been supporting Biden since bernie endorsed him, glad you eventually came around, but it’s a little ridiculous that it took trump going full gestapo for KYLE to even consider voting for him...
What is the Democrats plan by insinuating Trump will not leave office ifdefeated?  Multiple lawsuits when Biden loses?  They will be still contesting 2016 and the 2020 elections forever?
....so he hasn’t always been in favor of Biden... imo it’s pretty sad that it took trump to openly show people like Kyle that he’s a fascist, it took fucking lay after park to change him mind smh
Florida for Biden
If you tell republicans Covid is a hoax, they will believe you, no evidence. If you tell republicans Biden wants to defund the police, they will believe you, again, no evidence. Independent thinking is not a strong republican trait and they are often exploited as a result.
Wait is he voting for biden now?
I find Wallace to be very fair and a great interviewer. He goes after the questions and the story, not favoritism. He looks for holes in the story regardless of which side of the isle it is coming from.  That showcases great weakness and trouble for Biden’s messaging.
WAYNE ROOT: BIDEN = “BIGGEST IDIOT DEMOCRATS EVER NOMINATED”
Look I get it, if Biden wins with a coalition with a lot of moderate support and some anti trump Republicans you're worried that you'll get left behind. I get it. But I feel like that's a less important issue that what's actually happening right now, which is causing death
Trump only started to care about the coronavirus in the last 2 weeks bc it's spreading in states he views as important to his reelection. And trump has built his entire persona on racial fears of white America. Like yeah Biden has issues, but if you think some bad bills=trump
Meanwhile trump won't even go there at all. But the people that won't bite or write in Bernie or some shit will keep saying there is no difference between Biden and Trump
Right now you see what a true President does when he respects our heroes. Biden is paying his respects for John Lewis

Come on Tapper, don't be a hater. Wallace's interview of trump was excellent. And, he was definitely tough on trump. I support Biden so don't think I'm one of those Fox News loving n..s. Wallace holds people accountable and doesn't let them get away with double talk. Always has.
Pelosi and Biden both suffer from Dementia !

Joe Biden will reform the police. Not de-fund them.  Spread the word.
As a candidate Biden is a normal human being, and shows humane qualities like empathy. Trump, in terms of personal qualities, is clearly one of the worst human beings in America.   So a friend said, 'But the Democrats are just as bad'
.....they try to put her in good favor grouping her comments with Obama and John Kerry. Don’t be fooled by her. Poor Biden doesn’t know which way is up and the socialists will lead him to her and others like her (AOC-the frauds not squad)
Saw a bumper sticker for Biden yesterday &amp; realized I can't safely put a Trump sticker on my car or wear my Trump 2020 hat because the left are violent and out of control. Pretty sad state of affairs when we have to live in fear of the opposing political party.

No, dear. The Obama-Biden administration ended in 2017. We use the past tense for things that are no longer happening. Surely there’s a book somewhere in the White House you can consult?

Look, I'll say it, Biden is not my first choice for President, but I intend to vote for him.  Another 4 years of trump would be a disaster. We will barely survive this term. It's going to take years to undo the damage trump has done both domestically and globally.
remember, if you aren’t voting Biden, YOU ARE VOTING TRUMP. just remember that the next time you repost something on your story about BLM, abolishing ICE, wearing a mask, or anything else💙 #Biden2020 #FlipFLBlue #DumpTrump
Waste your vote 😆 biden and bernie socialist have already lost
Yeah bernie is busy figuring out a way to bankrupt America and biden will do the same and then forget he did it. Face it, your socialists have lost this fight due to incompetence.
Bernie is a joke...Biden is right there with him. One wants to bankrupt us and the other would bankrupt its but then forget he did it at all...maybe even forget he was president if he was in office. 😄 🤣 nor bernie or biden are fit or will ever be president in 2020
Florida for Biden
Actually believe it or not he can actually focus on more than one thing at a time  whereas joe bumbling Biden doesn’t know where he’s at.  Ohhhh, here comes Billary and bama to the rescue...

On your dreams. America is burning because of you. We are the laughing stock of the world. Stop your tweets and try fixing everything you have down. Biden has a big job ahead of him to fix all the wrongs you have done.
thank you president biden! that will be my meditation....no anxiety for me then!
Trump’s still calling Biden radical left? Boring!!!!!!

Yes and it will be for Biden
I'm a liberal and I DON'T WANT HIM TO QUIT! I want to run his ass out of office by voting for Biden. I want him to be humiliated beyond humiliation. I want him to lick his wounds from defeat until he has ulcers on his lying tongue!
It only matters if he votes for Biden and gets others to do the same.  A statement is just the first step.
Lol. Thank you for the compliment. For the record, I am fairly non-partisan. I loathe Biden too.
Hey  I've heard Joe Biden being referred to as a "puppet" many times. Maybe your father should consider changing his nickname from "Sleepy Joe" to "Puppet Joe". God bless the Trump Train!!
LOL, nobody is watching Biden.

Does he mean by voting for Biden?
Yes Bernie Bro , but now Riden with Biden. So bite me!
Brilliant! #Biden
You think Biden has a huge following? How many people do you think trust the MSM at this point? You think those Bernie/Warren voters are lining up for Biden after the DNC's shady behavior behind closed doors? Democrat cities are in ruins now. The silent majority will prevail 👍🇺🇸
Or.  Do a "Clint Easrwood" Debate a Biden "cardboard"cutout on stage.
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election -
That’s why that covers the bar is so great because your people believe anything that they give you and have been for years it’s OK it’s all about to change don’t say we didn’t tell you🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🍿🍿👍🎯 wantsome popcorn and not Popcorn that Biden talks about😂
I don't know what happened to him but Proud Resister took a hard left turn into the crazy land of Bernie Bros. How someone could go from Warren supporter to anti-Biden is beyond me? Warren is was my 1st choice, but I'm fine with Biden.

Whoa. Biden being handled, literally.
If only  would really stand up against Biden and the DNC. I would love to see it and so would millions of others.
Because Biden is worse in all ways 40 plus years of nothing nafta crime bill
Yep, exactly. Biden’s financial support only comes from the fact that he’s corrupt as hell.
He would never drop out of the race. It's not in his DNA. He would rather occupy the White House after the Biden inauguration, be dragged out kicking and screaming and cry about how poorly he was treated.
Trump’s sweeping claim that Biden wants to ‘abolish all charter schools’ -
Are you talking about the hearing yesterday where the Democrats did not allow the AG to answer questions? ? ? Your statement about the hearing proves you are NOT as alert nor as observant as JOE BIDEN
Immaterial...Biden will be the "ALSO RAN"
Good strategy I don't think Trump can read  Kamala Harris topped Joe Biden's list of handwritten notes alongside talking points like 'do not hold grudges' and 'great help to campaign'
Maybe it's because I'm old. But Health care has really went to shit. Everything was covered and it was cheap. Now nothing  ‘This is health care moonshot time’: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left
A bunch of Patriots should dress up like ANTIFA and BLM then drift into the elite democrat neighborhoods and 'peacefully' protest every night until the election.  Watch  how fast they abandon Biden.  Those NIMBY folks will wet their Depend diapers.  #MAGA #KAG #AmericaFirst
Clearly we know Biden chose kamala. He may as well just drop the ad.
It’s like he’s preparing to hole up there and not accept Joe Biden’s win November 3rd or worse he’s preparing for marshal law.
It is alarming.  He’s preparing to not recognize Joe Biden. As the winner November 3rd or worse he’s preparing to declare marshal law.
I fear that if biden is elected...this country will become a place where YOU will not want to continue to live in..

I’m just waiting for liberals to grow a backbone and stand up to the leftists that are abusing them. But, I won’t hold my breath. Doesn’t look like it’s going to happen at this point. And that’s why Biden is so damn dangerous.
neolibs love to daydream about trump being dragged kicking and screaming out of the white house by muscly joe biden wearing sunglasses as if that will solve every problem we're facing
You know someone is not playing with a full deck when they endorse Biden for President
This is happening under YOUR watch. When Joe Biden Is president we will have PEACE
Agree, I'm not voting for Biden, but I am voting against the sick fascist currently in office.
Sounds like 2 people are voting Biden. Anybody else? We need about 33M people. Mary Trump, niece of the president, says she’ll do ‘everything in my power’ to elect Joe Biden
DUH how long should the shortlist be? Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
99 days??? That's too long to wait for Biden, but I will!!!
I am a Floridian and a Biden supporter as are 98 per cent of my friends and family.
you do the same as I do, I research everything. But I just wanted 2 give u 1 more thing 2 research. I came across this b accident. I was on Google &amp; looking up how many different sites Joe Biden had for donations 1 stuck out 2----
We will on a November 3rd when we elect Joe Biden in a landslide! Resign now and save yourself public humiliation .
THANK YOU DR. JILL BIDEN...OUR NEXT 1ST LADY!!!
I don't envy, V.P. Biden.Dictator Trump,will leave him. A bankrupted county,like all his businesses.He always ran into the ground. We don't know, if their will be a revolution by then. How many more thousands, dead from COVID. Crime,&amp; homelessness quadrupled. Marshall law imposed
Don't forget,  Biden's covid plan includes EVERYTHING Pres Trump has already done..👍👏👏👏🇺🇸
Biden must flip Florida...so far trump's impacted two sectors...the old and the young...he's sending them like lambs...he cares not at all...yawn yawn...he's so over this....25th amendment now.
I never expected to see politicians just say screw it.. destroy what ever you want.  I wish I know the end game they are hoping for but even if Biden wins, someone will have to put a stop to this or citizens will and even Democrats can't allow that.  It's bigger than we think

One week until Biden panders and selects a minority woman to be his VP.   Won’t be the most qualified.  Won’t be the best resume.  Won’t be ready day one.   Will be someone who can check off a few boxes, because as we’ve seen libs only care about what helps them win, not help USA

Well if she’s VP she’s got a big head start for 2024 because Biden will be a one term president.
Not tested but am suffering emotionally with Trump Virus and can only hope for the one cure on November 3rd, Joe Biden winning in a landslide and taking the Senate and keeping the House.
no way trump will debate Biden..NFW.....he's a moron...unteachable and lacks self control...Joe will destroy him simply by breathing and looking at him like the fool he is....
Can Donald Trump repeat Putin, Bounty, Taliban, American Soldiers, without fumbling? When is able to stand before the American people and repeat those words then you may come back and comment on Joe Biden's gaffes.
Unfortunately, it is no longer "we the people" it is 'we the elite'. Biden was their choice, made possible by power alliances with major media &amp; others forming a narrative of relative elect-ability, &amp; people bought into this bc that's the majority of what was given to them.
Maybe the democratic party should start acting like the democratic party and not a center-right party?  Why does Joe Biden object to:  Banning fracking? Student debt forgiveness? Medicare for all? Universal Basic Income? Defunding police (he wants to increase funding)?

Essentially a hybrid Leptokurtic/mesokurtic distribution? Limited voting could hinder Biden, however, seems that republicans can also be negatively impacted by this shift to vote by mail. Could it saw put AZ in the D column and WI in the R?
F*UCK Fox News! Good for Biden! They will just make him look bad. They are State Run Propaganda. They will be liable soon, for accomplice. To brainwashing millions. To think the pandemic, was a hoax!
Warren is Biden's worst choice, she is a back stabbing hypocrite,
I would like to give you an opportunity to convince me what position of Trump’s is clearer than Biden’s? 1 2 3...go
Ridin with Biden...
I have an idea. Biden only has 7.2 million followers. What if everyone told all their followers to follow  right now? And shared everything on his feed. I bet we can make him louder than Donald on Twitter. You in? #ResistanceTaskForce
No it's not about ego like it is with the big orange idiot. I like Biden and will vote for him. But I don't need to follow him to keep up to date. I check his page often. I never check Trump page.
No just like most politicians. If they don't follow back do they really care. I have had a few follow me. But you don't have to follow Biden to see his tweets.
Trump runs anti Biden ad saying how it will look in Biden’s America. Doesn’t he realize this is trumps America?? Trump=shmuck!!

Will you stop blaming everyone like a little baby . It is never your fault. You are such a baby. Just realize it is all your fault . America is burning and you are golfing again. Biden is going to have a tough job fixing all your mistakes. You are the joke of the world

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
She has a point about Biden but it is obviously mute.
These Polls are a freaking joke. Just like they were in 2016 They are just more obvious now. Even #Foxnews is in in it!! If you were to look at a Trump Rally compare it to a Biden rally SAMETHING with the virtual rallies Trump beats Biden by 309 miles
Biden has reversed Trump's 2016 lead among voters age 65 and older - and we vote.
My 90 Year Young Dad...Says Trump will bury Biden in a Debate...
Well, I think everyone will be supporting Trump, Biden is “Night of the Living Dead”!
If Biden was much younger and hotter, maybe I’d beat him off, too.
And you wouldn’t endorse masks and social distancing until the pandemic was out of control and you realized you opponent isn’t Joe Biden, it’s The Pandemic.  You have done a terrible job and will lose in November!!
What about trump? Or did you just admit you're running to beat Biden for the very low polling trump?
I do not want BIDEN...heres the thing... I want my country the way it was before obama &amp; BIDEN..PERIOD !
Many people already take advantage of what the government allows: medicaid, social security, FEMA, and you feel that is not "socialism." It is! Joe Biden is NOT  a socialist, not does he promote socialism. Learn your facts before making ourself foolish.
Trump and his liars have destroyed most of our democracy. We cannot afford another 4 years for surely the will totally destroy our democracy. On November 3rd, let's detour country back on the road restoring the soul of the nation. Joe Biden 2020.
Yep the majority is already going Biden or Trump. Potentially if you vote a third party you are helping Trump win.
Watch this share and expose Joe Biden is a pedophile
Texas is actually contested this time! Biden polling neck-and-neck with Trump right now. I guess Texans have a low tolerance for bullshit.
And then the waitress at Denny's came over and said, "sir, sir those placemats are for the children." Maybe so but I still aced it. I'll bet Joe Biden couldn't do that.
You should sit down and stop. You’re delusional if you actually believe that , no one is buying Biden’s bullshit anymore. He’s also a pedophile so ya, we are voting for Trump. Buckle up, the silent majority is going to make him your president for another 4 years!
She be ten times better, than Pence.Who is just a Trump Yes Man. No spine, just a typical brown nose.Was suppose to lead,a pandemic response. But hasn't done much, all anti science rhetoric &amp; misinformation.Amb. Rice, would help out V.P. Biden. Great choice, &amp; I hope she gets nod
trump is now running on the left of joe biden regarding crime reform and access to affordable medication and you're telling me that the yelling old guy wasn't electable why?
No no Biden, please debate you incoherant geezer!

Any day not focusing on electing Biden along with every Democrat on the Ballot...  Is a day lost.  #VoteDemocratic2020

But if we elect Biden then we are replacing a narcissistic buffoon who has kept the economy chugging along, with a senile pedophile, who has done more to hurt black families, with his 90’s crime bill (with the horrendous mandatory-minimums) and the tripling of federal prison beds

Biden also refused to defund the police and wants to give them MORE.
No, he isn't. If you believe Bernie is the only one who wants this or the only way to achieve it you are as narrow minded as you are wrong about the democrats giving a shit about you.  Asking again, why won't Biden support M4A or UBI?

Joe Biden Makes Racist Comments While Accusing Trump Of Being Racist
They will all be voting for Biden.  😆😆😆😆😆
Looks like Barr misspoke or was viewing the entire years numbers. What's your point?  Conspiracy and lies?!!!   Every time Biden misspeaks I'll consider him to be intentionally lying to defraud the American people. He called his sister his wife. 🤔 Is he married to his sister?
Breaking News! Biden plans on rushing the release of the new $20.00 hero Harriet Tubman bill. For trump supporters another new zero bill will be released. True value will be 0.0. 💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲
Best one yet!!! Great work!! We need a remix; with Biden!! 🤣🤣🤣
Heard VP choice. I obviously didn’t read the whole report, as I don’t have that kinda time—I read the tweet thread version. I do agree that Warren as VP is the best a Biden admin could do, as they clearly won’t pick someone super progressive out of Bernie world.
If Biden were to take and pass the test, which I’m sure he would, I doubt he would brag about it. It’s funny because Trump thinks it’s an accomplishment. For him it probably is his biggest accomplishment, so maybe we should say congrats.
You can call the guy a lot of things, and you do, but Trump definitely does not have dementia. Biden's memory and recall are gone.
Why are property taxes being used to pay for a public school education that is just programming a Lectist agenda into our children? Biden will want us to be taxed to pay for free college as well to ensure that everyone has a higher education in that programming.
Yeah but they can blame it on Biden
So desperate and sooo scared of Joe Biden.
I live in a pretty mixed area.  About equal Republicans and Democrats.  The adult democrats (people over 35) openly admit that they think Biden is suffering from dementia.  Also this guy and his 'Shooting up bleach' and  letting him get away with it is disgusting.
Of course she would. Biden better not choose this corrupt politician to be his VP

Got news for you.  No matter how you try to get something on Joe Biden it will not work. He’s a good, decent man who will be put next president. So... abortion pill , child support looser.  Get lost,
Where is Hunter Biden?

No strategy..no tactics..no master plan in evidence as of today will allow joe biden to win. Our country is not as divided as MSM and other entities would have you believe. (Kayne West is  more qualified than segregationist joe biden)
