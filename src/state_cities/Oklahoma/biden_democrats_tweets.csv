Me too. But, I'm abstaining on POTUS.  Biden hasn't earned a vote.   Oklahoma Elector selection won't have a different outcome without my input.
I'm kinda sad knowing we may have heard the last pitch for Raimondo from Mike if Biden picks his VP next week. Oh well, we'll always have Chicago.
I don‚Äôt think Biden will fall for it. He knows he needs somebody ready on day one so I‚Äôm thinking Harris or Rice.
I‚Äôm sure Biden‚Äôs people are aware.
Support for a party is one thing but I do not get the worship! Trump supporters flat out think he can do no wrong. Ask any Dem &amp; we will agree w/ u on the many flaws of the Clintons, Biden, etc. But any disgusting thing Trump does is either the media‚Äôs fault or ‚Äúout of context‚ÄùüôÑ

According to Trump, AMERICA IS GOING TOO HELL, if joe Biden wins Election this year. Even the guys behind him were looking around, shaking their heads in disbelief in what he just said!!! #trumppresser #Vote #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Please when Biden becomes President. Please please do not constantly berate him on the news. Anything he does is going to be 1000% better than Trump.
It‚Äôs because Biden is a fellow white man
The subpoena demands all the records the department has turned over to Senate committees that are investigating Hunter Biden's work for a gas company in Ukraine.
The one good thing this time around is that Biden has said he‚Äôll pick a woman of color. Leading the media to talk about many women of color who typically get little national coverage.
Still not sure why  hasn't officially picked  as his running mate yet.
Joe Biden is the definition of a moderate. He has no leftist policies. He won‚Äôt push for any leftist policies. It‚Äôs a lie.
Reading comprehension? He is saying that Biden has been pulled more left than BERNIES PEOPLE THOUGHT. NOT further left than Bernie. Geez you should apply at CNN

‚Å¶ Is so worried with mail-in ballots, the election will be fixed or fraudulent....when it looks like it‚Äôs going Joe Biden‚Äôs way. Yet, when it looks like it would go his way, like in 2016...he doesn‚Äôt have a problem with it!!? #trumppresser
What‚Äôs the funniest lie in this tweet? Trump lying about being at 50% or lying about Biden being more left than Sanders?
Mr. Obama does not really believe in Joe Biden.
Don‚Äôt believe the polls.  Same as 2016.   And with the most recent poll showing #Biden 15 points ahead ?   Look at small print. Only 1006 people were polled.  And only 23% were republicans
TLDR- if (when) Biden wins in a massive landslide tRump will claim fraud.
To be honest, a debate needs to happen or there will be a very strong chance Trump loses in November.  At the moment, all media outlets are pushing Biden.  Its Trump vs Media right now.  Get Biden on a stage to debate and lets wrap a win up for Trump.  It MUST happen or we lose.
The ‚Äúinsistence‚Äù is about making sure it‚Äôs fair and balanced and not ‚Äúonline‚Äù with Biden being given questions ahead of time by liberal owned media pundits.
‚ÄúThe effort by the Trump campaign to expand the debate schedule was first reported on Thursday by Politico. A Trump campaign source confirmed the plans to The Hill.‚Äù

Your a failure and loser! Vote for Biden!!üëçüòÖ
Once again Trump plays the Democrats and the media like a Stradivarius.  He planted a seed about the Dems attempt to open the door to Mail In Ballot fraud in one small Tweet.  Now the press will give it hours of air time.   Trump is playing 3D Chess, while Biden eats his checkers
It looks that way. A politico article leaked saying he chose Harris as VP. Not sure if it‚Äôs official or testing the waters. But it‚Äôs exactly the tone deaf response I‚Äôd expect from Biden.
Trump is using his thugs to snatch protesters off the street, I get that.  But Biden has stated he wants to arrest my Anarchist comrades as well.  Doesn‚Äôt matter who wins in November. I gather both shit bag candidates want to gut social security.
If Biden wins, then what? The Left goes back to sleep?   Is Biden gonna do shit about Israel brutalizing Palestinians?   Is Biden gonna twin in Wall Street? Because his old boss sure as hell didn‚Äôt.  Is Biden going to do anything about Climate Change?
My family lost our house when Joe Biden was in the White House.  Dude, I know Trump is awful. But Biden ain‚Äôt gonna change a fuckin thing.
Stupid insurance because it doesn‚Äôt actually benefit us. That‚Äôs ok, hopefully when Biden takes over we can convince him to expand Medicaid &amp; we‚Äôll all be covered
Very confused by this statement.  But I will say, I'm referring to the small amount of people that feel the need to defend Biden/Trump at the very fact that they are attacked on a certain basis.  Pragmatic defensiveness isn't most people imo.
That's cool, but I just don't understand all this support for Trump.  I way rather him be prez than Clinton or Biden, but that doesn't mean we have to suck his dick constantly.  He played us the same way Obama played people  He saw anti-war as a popular position, and he seized it
this goes without saying but if you're voting for joe biden please block me i don't associate with liberals
Word. Harris/Warren 2024! Biden/Harris 2020. We'll see though!

look at how many was watching - when trump was in Tulsa in was in the tens of millions - broke every online record - Biden will not win - the best election modeler  and pollster  say a big win for trump - don't trust me but follow them
owes  an apology, as does  who published a similarly inflammatory and unhinged editorial in the  in April. Biden‚Äôs assessment of Trump‚Äôs character was entirely reasonable at the time and now looks prescient.
Biden is still losing it mentally, and "Build Back Better" comes from the UN, an organization that is currently criticizing the US for protester treatment, while ignoring the Uighur genocide in favor of China.  #UNJoeNeedsToGo
The sad thing is there is really no one ready to lead.  Biden is not sane and Trump is not strong.  I say no government is better than any government.
Joe Biden I finally come up with the perfect nickname for Joe Biden Pinocchio president if you ever get to the office it's the people that are pulling the strings which are the Democrats and AOC which was truly be running the country Joe Biden it's just Pinocchio
My Rep Kevin Hern‚Äôs staff called me today and that was one of my concerns was whether Biden would debate Trump.  She said they are planning for a first debate but she didnt know when.  And my other concern was prosecuting Ilhan Omar, stripping her citizenship &amp; deportation.
So only 130 die if Biden was prez?120?Cmon don‚Äôt be foolish. State and local govts and healthcare are what can help end this as we wait for a vaccine from a private company. The Feds are too inept to help or hurt much of anything. Worthless inefficient greedy blowhards. All them

Political opportunism showing no potential for loyalty.  Biden will not pick her.
If the GOP forces Trump to resign, we will see A Pence/Haley or Pence/Pompeo ticket, but I‚Äôm going with the first to match Biden/Woman to be named.
Hey Biden campaign:  If Kamala spends 4 years trying to become President of both the US and Canada, then you can call her "too ambitious."  Vice President isn't a real job anyway, and the best case scenario is that she spends your entire administration campaigning.
I understand the extremist rioters don't like Biden.  My point was that bringing in National Guard and Federal Troops without their hands tied behind their backs WILL stop the violence imo.  These governors and mayors are rejecting solutions because Trump is behind the wheel imo.
It's sort of interesting to me because, while I think more riots will happen if Trump is elected, I think Trump is more likely to take care of them than Biden  On the other hand, Dem cities would actually let Biden take care of the issue if he so chose, so that might be better.
When Biden is safely  Ensconced in the White House can we stop talking about Trump. Please. üòî  I'm so tired.
Like I said, Biden is much less Libertarian than Trump (Low Bar)  If you don't realize that, then you don't know anything about Libertarianism.  It's why Libertarians tend to swing right.
I've stated multiple times that I don't like Trump and he may be a racist, but somehow you take that as me "talking up" Trump?  I'm just shitting on Biden.  It's not the same thing even though the establishment has brainwashed you into thinking such.
Btw, Trump (who I disdain to an extent) is closer to Libertarianism than Bernie's platform that Biden is running on.  It's a far Left platform.
I honestly don't even know what this means.  You're a shill for Biden, mocking someone with a more unique opinion than you.
You're not though.  You're arguing with Trumpers about how much better Biden is.  This is a pissing contest to you.
I would argue that Bernie has had in the past WAY more enthusiasm than Biden ever has and ever will.  Bernie is a major reason you're even getting a fairly Liberal platform.  Biden is a moderate.
Obviously an opinion.  Biden said the n word multiple times on tape.  Biden said he opposed desegregation because his kids would be in a "racial jungle"  Biden pushed the crime bill with racial rhetoric  Biden said "throw yall back in chains"  Biden said "you aint black"
Didn't Biden support the War in Iraq?  What was the deal with that?
They both announced their support in 2012.  In 2010, Biden said marriage was between a man and a woman
And you running interference for Biden, makes you a pedophile.  Horrible point.  Devaluing what a "racist" actually is.
What if they were both equally racist?  Biden has said worse shit than Trump, but I wouldn't put it past Trump being a legit racist.
Student loans have increased tuition cost 213% in the last 30 years.  Gun control hurts minority communities disproportionately.  Pollution controls are an often inefficient cost that only giant companies can afford.  Joe Biden only started supporting gay marriage in 2012
Biden was against gay marriage until 2012.  Everything else on here just convinces me that Joe Biden would be terrible for this country.
Because it is July 30 and Obama / Biden administration is still the most corrupt administration in history

Technically, I supported her for President but I voted Biden. I'm a horrifically reasonable realist. I gave and give money to her. I support her ideas and policies (even those she stole). But! She isn't who we need now.  I've ignored Harris's past. I think Demings is a gem.
Ok Biden jr only 150,000 have died not 700,000 lmao
Purportedly, on a conference call- Weaver told Sanders delegates NOT to push Biden. To stop challenging the platform. Go along &amp; get along.
You proved them for me with your petty can't take the heat name calling. Biden said "You ain't black" if they don't vote for him, not Trump. Again, you have nothing.
Delay, delay, delay.....Trump beaten by Biden and sweep it all under the rug.
Wonder if Biden has Obama writing his teleprompter script? Cause we all know Hiden Biden isn‚Äôt coherent speaking impromptu!
Oh but let's excuse the FACTS that Biden loves touching young girls &amp; sniffing all female hair he can get near, young or older. Again with the name calling bc you can't handle the truth when slapped with it. Keep them coming, you're just proving why Trump will win.
Well Joe Biden is certainly not going to do what the Radical Right wants! He, unlike you, has more integrity, values &amp; morals! Which means he will make an awesome president, again, unlike you! You're welcome! #JoeBiden2020!

democrats excuse me the marxists are bat shit crazy they are going to try and declare biden wins no matter what they are going to cheat any possible way we must be vigilant and vote by the hundreds of millions in person leave no room no way to cheat we can not allow any cheating
if democrats really believed in the polls and believed that biden is way ahead of trump then why try and stop in person voting They know the polls are false and trump is way way ahead in reality
I ave no issue if Biden has 3 VPs. we have a lot of work to do. He needs a lot of help....

Hey Henry. It doesn't look so false after all does it. Trump is talking about this exact thing today. I think you owe someone an apology. Biden was spot on and you were dead wrong!
Trump has planted this dumb idea that mail in ballots are BAD and now even if he doesn‚Äôt succeed in postponing the election and somehow Biden wins there will be a seed of unreliability in the voting process. His followers won‚Äôt believe it was a fair election. This is dangerous.
Hey Jonathan, you see what Trump is talking about today? Delaying the election. Looks like Biden was on to something.
And you think Biden is that person?  I am terrified of that very thought. If everyone would stop thinking they are victims and realize they are responsible only for their own actions it would not be necessary to continually ‚Äúclean up the mess‚Äù
I just like to point out that Obama, Biden, and Hillary are the ones who cheated in the last election. They have yet to prove a real crime committed by the President. If mail in voting is the only options than require voting IDs and require it to be notarized.
she is out of her drunk ass mind it isnt Republicans burning cities cop cars throwing fire bombs attacking police looting setting siege to federal court houses ripping down historical statutes burning our history its the democrat base not gop its the biden voters
Joe Biden wouldn't suggest it because he's not a fascist.

Dumber than dumb donnie is just an asset for Putin, even allowing him to place bounties on American soldier's heads, &amp; will do WHATEVER Putin wants him to do--even at the expense of Americans! I'll take Biden over Putin/trump any day!!! #1 of #WhyIDontLikeTrump
you‚Äôre not wrong. I did find it interesting though even in my red city, Bernie was just barely behind Biden in the primaries. It was because young people here voted for Bernie. I keep telling people to have hope bc I have a feeling Biden will have a decently progressive cabinet
It's their plan. What's not to like?  Biden is not Progressive, &amp; he will nit govern "like FDR".
Old joe Biden saying what ever it takes to get elected. Writing checks on the taxpayers backs.
Everyone under here tweeting shit about Biden are either Russians or MAGA.  Nice try. Trump is toast.
Have a point?  Nothing will stop me from voting for Biden.

Valerie, Obama &amp; Biden must be sitting on tacks wondering if Durham‚Äôs Report will entrap them like a Boa Constrictor.  Or are they so arrogant that it‚Äôs of no concern. (Stupid??)
I cannot imagine what it would have been like if Biden was president, he called the president a racist when he stopped flights from China and Pelosi was in Chinatown telling everybody to come to the party and I bet they wouldnt have got the ventilators made like Trump did..moron
Women Can Have a Little Power, as a Treat
The questions were almost too hard.   If they had been more difficult Biden would have started saying the questions came from Trump and refused to answer.
The Democrats are so scared that Donald Trump is going to win that they refuse flat out refused to have Joe Biden do a debate who is Donald Trump they're so scared they can't even think the Joe Biden with even when any kind of debate like that I've never seen a candidate
Keep Biden in the basement, win the election. I am shocked I haven‚Äôt heard Donnytron attacking him for being corrupt, ‚Äò94 crime bill, past incompetence. Meanwhile Donny is running on keeping statues and acting like he is the status quo. If he doesn‚Äôt change strategy he‚Äôs done.
This picture and others like it should be tweeted from the campaign accounts at least once a week. This is this year's Hilary's emails. Every day, every week, Biden being caught spying should be drilled into the public. Get to it.
I thought about all this pomp and BS and the funerals I have not been able to attend for friends and family but hey it‚Äôs just like all the lies told by the media and people buy this BS like a lunker bass on 5 pound Line.  Toxic libtards and Biden being asked questions w/ answers.
I live in Oklahoma and yes we are scheduled to go back to school as planned. ‚ÄúIdiots‚Äù Can‚Äôt wait for you Dr Biden. You and your husband give me ‚ÄúHope‚Äù when despair is trying to take over.  Thank you. I like the idea of the two of you giving us weekly samples of that hope.  Please
Not a bot, and Biden was literally my last choice in the primary. I love Nina Turner and I wish Bernie was the candidate too. I can see that we agree on everything, except maybe that I‚Äôm willing to hold my nose and eat the half bowl of shit if it means Trump will be gone.
Those babies in cages as you say, that happened in 2014 under Obama/Biden
another nail in the joe biden campaigns coffin
I think my prediction that Kamala Harris would be the next president is going to end up coming true in a roundabout way. Biden is going to win the election, and have to leave office during the first two years and she will slide right in there Amazingly
It will be wild accusations manufactured by Barr...just enough to cast doubt on Biden. Maybe Maxwell‚Äôs revelations will doom Trump. We can hope.
Joe Biden‚Äôs son made MILLIONS OFF him being Vice President allowing shady deals to happen. We should be rich too like his family .

joe biden is pandering he has zero intention of keeping his promises he wont be President 6 months whos kidding who he is sick in the mind and body hes feeble he is a CRIMINAL pedophile liar cheat unfit for any office
Until I see him arrest Hussein obama and Biden, I'll hold my judgement.
I think it's not that the answers are pre-written. I think his handlers are typing out the answers as they hear the questions. Biden just sucks at cold reading!

Reporter - "Why should voters vote for you vs voting against Trump?" Biden - "Huh?".... incoherent answer
You can scratch Kamala Harris off Biden's VP shortlist. Harris is ineligible to be VPOTUS/POTUS. She is not a US natural born citizen. NBC=Parents=US natural born citizens. Harris was born in USA to two foreigners in in the USA on VISAs.  cc:

i had to leave the room i can not take anymore pandering lies race baiting by biden he could not lead america he is unfit to be President he is an admitted criminal in Ukraine extortion bragging about it the 1.5 billion dollars from CHINA to Hunter china owns them now believe IT
my god biden is absolutely disgraceful he is a racist liar he has no clue on how to lead America he would finish this destruction he is only a shell a puppet of CHINA trust me Biden is a liar he has no plan only bullshit empty pandering lies
And yet, Trump's term is up regardless on Jan 20th. So Biden can "Work From Home" for all I care.   Rename the White House to The People's House.
They're playing music, now. It's a modern, cool hep-cat tune.   You don't know what a hep-cat IS?   Biden does (some of the time) . . .   42 minutes and still waiting.
Where is Biden ?
I'm watching Biden's live-stream.   He's late.   Again.  Trouble getting the dosage right?
I know Biden will work on unifying the country not tearing it apart like trump has. All trump cares about is himself, his family and all the special interest billionaires he surrounds himself with. Look how much they‚Äôve lined their pockets since he‚Äôs been in
I‚Äôm voting Biden because if trump happens to get another four years the effects will be devastating. And please, trump is a sexual predator through and through. He sure has had an interesting relationship with his daughter as well...
If Biden wins Florida by +8, this will be an historic ass kicking for Trump. If Biden barely wins Florida, he will win the general pretty confortably.
I think Biden wins AZ,MI, PA and WI. I think he stays within 5% of the other states. I‚Äôll be shocked if Biden performs anywhere close to that well in Florida.
I honestly don't care who Biden's VP is. I just want a female person of color. I see positives in all the candidates.
Biden can also run the government from his house..
Well, if you honestly believe that Biden is as bad as Trump, then I'm not sure there is much I can do.  We've reached an impasse.
Trump slams 'deranged Anarchists and Agitators,' predicts chaos if Biden wins election   And he‚Äôs right again.
Oh i agree. Certainly! But at least Biden has been in this and has political experience, and doesn‚Äôt make us look like the laughing stock of the world.   Plus, I can at least see a shred of empathy in Biden‚Äôs word, instead of cold selfishness in the other‚Äôs.
See that‚Äôs the issue, is he‚Äôs not and if anything has been a big proponent against helping our Black community with his ‚Äú1994 crime law‚Äù that Biden helped write. Again, doesn‚Äôt change anything‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not gonna be great either.
I‚Äôm worried about Biden too tho! There‚Äôs a lot he‚Äôs for and has been for that‚Äôs just plain wrong and I‚Äôm not happy about it.  The sad thing is we don‚Äôt have a better option, which truly shows how fucked and twisted our political system is. We‚Äôve learned nothing in 4 years.
And don‚Äôt try and tell me Biden is supportive of abolishing the police. The document he and Sanders signed doesn‚Äôt have that anywhere in it. 45 got fact checked on that hard! #VoteTrumpOut

Funny you acknowledge riots and biden is down for defunding the police.... So uhm yeah, the mayors n governors wont even let the police protect homes if crowds are "2 big" i know if i lived in a city like that, well, it be governed differently lol
You admit he said it tho, right? Not trying to beat a dead horse, but facts matter. Here in the US, a push for truth and science needs to remain at the forefront as we transition to Biden.
If anyone actually believes Joe Biden is some crazy anarchist socialist and not the centrist democrat he‚Äôs been for 40+ years, you‚Äôre fucking stupid.
Make it beautiful so Joe Biden will have a lovely place to do press briefings
The Dems have made promises for years when they were in office . Promises made but never kept . Trump has never made a promise that he hasn‚Äôt kept. Don‚Äôt tell me biden wrote this. His handelers wrote this . Joe can‚Äôt put 3 words that make sense together!!
I will vote for Biden regardless of his VP choice.
I feel like his campaign is using Kamala for fundraising only then will go with someone else. No other potential choice has campaigned for him more than she has...as a matter of fact, has Rice even done an event for Biden or any other candidate for that matter....

WRONG. EVERYONE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLIM MINORITY HAS ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND. We don't need them to vote for Biden as we have sane republicans on our side.  This is just tweet/like/retweet garbage. Do better and stop making up BULLSHIT scenarios.
Biden isn‚Äôt the president.....yet.   Not much he can do.
Was simply pointing out the fact that biden often referred to byrd as his mentor.  attended his funeral.  byrd was an actual klansmen.   you shit talk the current POTUS while your guy joe is given a free pass for most everything, including sniffing little girls.
It was an AP poll so you need to add 30 percent to Trump number and take 30 percent off of Biden's number!
Did biden go?
That was the primary. It's over. Joe knows that. Let's save the hard feelings for Trump now. I think Biden considering Kamala for VP is a great honor, whether he picks her or not.
Assuming the election goes horribly wrong and Biden is elected into office; what are the top 3 new rules for the Biden White House? Here are mine: 1)All personnel must use unscented hair care products. 2)Take your child to work day will be canceled. 3)Nametags are required
Fuck you and your fear mongering. We all will rag his fucking ass out of the WH if needed. SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT and focus on Biden

Hidin Biden needs to do interview with Chris Wallace, No questions before the interview.
Dr Jill Biden pushing her clearly declining husband out for President when she knows that he is incapable of carrying out the duties - does she love him or does she love the limelight more?  Why else would she keep pushing him when she is educated and knows how deficient he is!
At least by January, we‚Äôll get to hear from Biden on this..
At this point in 2016, Trump and Hillary were basically tied. Biden has a 10% lead right now. Biden isn‚Äôt gonna duck the debates. He has no reason to.
I just think this is setting up very similar to 2016. Polls al saying Trump is going to lose big. The three debates are going to be huge. Biden needs to do all three and not duck Trump.
Stacey Abrams doesn't have the experience, she have even won an election. I'd be fine with her in a cabinet position, but she wouldn't be ready if something happened to Biden. I think it'll be Kamala Harris or Tammy Duckworth. I think Warren will be in the cabinet.
Biden with Wallace and Trump with Maddow would be a fair take
Nearly every one of them are more capable than Trump/Pence combined. They each have real strengths that would make every one of them ideal for various cabinet positions in a Biden administration.
You do realize without a debate Biden can't win
I put up a lot of Christmas decorations controlled by a computer. I put up a Mega Pixel Tree like the pic.   After Nov, I can scroll words, pictures, etc on the tree.  I am going to put 46th President Joe Biden on it along with other things. I‚Äôll play that from Nov 4th - Dec 1st

Maybe he should pay attention to the Vice Presidential candidates then. Both Trump and Biden are showing early signs of dementia.   I don't mean to be ableist about this. But at each candidate's ages, using actuary tables, both are only 50-50 to survive the next four years.
I'm terrified about what a Biden presidency may mean...
Biden! Even the GOP is starting to realize the failure he has created.
Trump's proven to be of zero help in confronting Peking. Ivanka's patents (Donald's) stand in the way. At least Biden's not up to his neck in debt like Trump so he might throw back their rice
Peking responded with tit for tat to minimize their spy den busted in Houston. Hoping Biden will take on China stronger than Trump's tepid actions

Biden was obviously out of any future debates when he went downhill after the Democrat debates.
Val Demings is my pick.  I think the police chief thing actually helps Biden with independents and moderates.  Makes them feel comfortable Biden won't defund police even though they still will.  Bottoms makes sense though.
Biden may be the worst Dem candidate of all time.

Joe Biden is on the debate stage and he's horny

In your dreams, this will never happen. Biden, Obama and his whole corrupt administration will pay for what they did though.
I don't believe on any turbulence.    Conservatives, in general, are spreading fear. They want people to be scared so they don't vote. Most who voted for Trump have learned they made a mistake. Biden will move to the White House peacefully. It's God's will.

Biden‚Äôs words himself. I‚Äôm a card carrying member of #CultTruth &amp; U R a sheep that covers your eyes &amp; wonders later ‚ÄòHow is it I‚Äôve been fleeced??!!‚Äô Get a life &amp; perhaps with that a clue. The idea U put all UR eggs in the Biden basket says more about your instability than ours.
Biden has already admitted himself that he will not make it through his own first term [dont worry he won‚Äôt be elected]. He‚Äôs a puppet and it shows you the immoral lengths D will go to grab power, and this continue the deep state Kabal coverup. #MAGA2020 #DrainTheSwamp #4MoreYrs
Bro, there are a million things in your world that you need to beat. This is not the time to focus on Biden or anyone else. Focus on "The beats" where your true genius is... Not beating some outside opponent. Good luck to you.. Leave politics to other people.
Biden comes in more like a chain of boiled egg farts.
Lmao are you serious you can‚Äôt be serious with what your profile says and your telling people to grow up your the one that needs to grow up miss I don‚Äôt troll Bahahahahaha BIDEN 2020
Tell her who tgey are.   Ask her why R's are fine with Biden; and ask why Biden is good with Kasich, who was an R candidate for POTUS in 2016.  Biden is to the right of Reagan.   Show her that.
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. These little boys need to go join Biden in the basement. I'm sure they all would love that!
Seriously, has anyone seen a biden flag in their neighborhood?   I haven't. Seen millions of Trump flags though.
I‚Äôm a USAF veteran, voted Romney in 2012, supported Trump in 2016. Disrespect toward John McCain. ‚ÄúVery fine people‚Äù was disgraceful. Change from Republican to Dem last year after seeing enough. Entire family is voting for Biden this year. #RepublicansForBiden #VetsforBiden

My vote couldn't elect Biden.   Oklahoma went to Trump by 520,000 votes in 2016.  I don't support his centrism. I don't approve of his record. I question his perspicacity.  Why would I throw away my vote on HIM?  Instead of (hopefully) helping Greens get to 5%?
It will be a surprise as every poll shows her losing, especially considering how historically well Biden is polling in Oklahoma county
You like Martial Law and men in unmarked vans grabbing people off the streets? Then you‚Äôll LOVE retribution when Biden does it to you. Thank you for supporting us now. We will thank you later.
Biden is a trojan horse.  Having Trump as president makes it easy for Biden to win.  Biden's not all there, so he probably won't even be president, his VP will be.  That way, far Left policies can slip into the White House without the scrutiny of a general election.
String this all together.  It really tells the story. He should have never ever been elected President.
Three.   Your not Biden vote for Trump, your not Trump vote for Biden AND your vote for Green.  Now, that's return on investment.
Joe Biden had 19 ....1..9...people watching his broadcast the other day. If you REALLY believe that, then I have some Democrat gold bars to sell you.
Trump doesn't have to beat Biden Biden is beating Biden
We supported Bernie's policies. We do NOT support Biden's.  Why would we send money to a nominee whose policies we do not condone?  Bernie can ask until he's blue in the face.  Without that policy (honey), there's no access to MY sweet money.
I have dual citizenship and have relatives all over Europe. The goal, of course, is to elect Biden.  I hope being flippant didn't bother anybody.
Yes I‚Äôm ready let vote Biden 2020
Pray for the health of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer on a daily basis..it‚Äôs a long time for them to go until Biden is sworn in.

What a country! Where else can a dictator-loving, pussy-grabbing liar become President! Putin's Russia  Saddam's Iraq  Kim's NKorea  Hitler's Germany  Amin's Uganda And now we have Brown Shirts in camo! And you say the next choice is Biden? Are you there, God? Can you hear us?
America's only chance to come back from this assault from the kung flu from China the BLM cop killers antifa mercenaries marxists burning cities burning churches looting shooting cops is voting for President Trump Biden is running on anti American anti police anti god platform
I am continually shocked when anyone supports you. I trust Joe Biden and I have doubts that anyone with a brain would support trump
I am 70 and have already requested a mail in ballot for the general election in OK. My vote will not stop OK going to Trump...but in my heart, I know I voted against him and for Biden. If I had no mail in, yes, I would stand or crawl to vote for Biden.

Where have you been? Biden‚Äôs basement? There has been one for the states to do. What have you ever done for Americans?
Take off the biden goggles and then watch it. But find all of them and watch them all. Not just what they want ya ta see.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. It‚Äôs their call who they vote for and shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed for it. I know I‚Äôm not gonna sit and be pinned down because I refuse to vote for any of the democrats. Trump ain‚Äôt perfect(there is no perfect candidate) but I ain‚Äôt voting for Biden.
If the DEMOCRAT/Socialist/Marxist party of today led by BIDEN PELOSI SCHUMER. ARE NOT CONSIDERED ‚ÄúTRAITORS‚Äù to America then there needs to be an OFFICIAL APOLOGY TO THE CONFEDERACY!!!
This could not be more CLEAR !!! If the DEMOCRAT/Socialist/Marxist party led by BIDEN PELOSI SCHUMER is not CONSIDERED TRAITORS!!! Then apologize to the CONFEDERACY!!!
Obama knew. Biden knew [though by now he may have ‚Äòforgot‚Äô]. They all knew and authorized it in the most malicious attempt on a political rival in our history. Time will continue to reveal details and those WILL be held accountable. EVERY American party aside should be FURIOUS.
Biden is beginning to remember dreams and think they were real.  The more he talks the more he illuminates his diminished abilities to do anything except retire.
Who could Biden pick that GOP wouldn't demonize?ü§®
This shows the ppl who what &amp; why the Democrats want Biden . Remove God from this country!   #MAGA2020
This whole "Biden adopting bernies platform" is a sham. The plan was for the nominee to push far left policies. Im not surprised at all   I'll be surprised when one of the parties gives SS recipients a liveable wage. I believe the average is $772/mo? .....
While Biden still refuses to legalize weed.  Willie is only doing this for Bernie.
Even Biden doesn't think China is our friend.  These Leftists create a boogeyman out of Russia (A dilapidated hell-hole) but pretend China (The largest country in the world) poses no threat.  Ridiculous.
"You'll have beautiful healthcare, it'll be the greatest...."  Doesn't take a genius to drive a supertanker around Biden's yawning gulf on Biden's left.

US: 4,186,329 COVID-19 cases with +147,650 deaths. The failure of leadership on this alone is enough.  Joe has a COVID plan. He has also has an impressive heathcare plan to address racial &amp; disability inadequacies.   Help America heal with Biden.  #ONEV1 #bluedot

The polling is all Biden Nationally- &amp; in swing states.  I have 0 faith in polls- but, to say the polling shows Trump winning is wrong.  I even suspect he WILL win. Or whichever R ends up on the ballot.
I like Paw Patrol.  Bet Joe Biden does too. Which kinda ruins your narrative, truth be told. But truth isn't really your strong suit, now is it?
Translation: T—èump has wiretapped and is spying on the Biden campaign
Have you seen how Biden's kids (and extended family actually) "earned" their money? I mean, yeesh. Talk about corruption. Trump and fam are not grifting.
nothing short of all out nuclear war will stop me from voting im just praying im alive to vote for President Trump in person im afraid if i die first i will end up voting for biden by mail
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Joe Biden. Pass it on.
As opposed to those doing this for Biden?  Yes, Trump is exhibiting cognitive decline.  That SHOULD be discussed.  And the D nominee shouldn't suffer the same issue.  This whole situation is so 2020. I hate this timeline.
They cant run on trumps accomplishments and Biden is wisely staying out of the news so they cant attempt to dunk on anything he does.
There‚Äôs no moral or fiscal justification for killing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, but that‚Äôs what Joe Biden proposes to do.

Hunter Biden had the finest Business Aircraft.  How much does he owe the citizens
Black woman VP might get Biden beat. Just sayin
He's terrible.  So is Biden.  Now what?
The video begins with the men criticizing President Trump.
What he meant to say was:  "Coronavirus is coming back. 4 million cases in the US. Unemployment is surging. Some cities are having to shut down again. Deaths are popping up everywhere. Hospitalizations are soaring. POTUS poll numbers are plummeting. Biden is a WINNER."
You mean communism, socialist, one world government, standing in mile long lines just for a loaf of bread or gallon of milk. You think Biden is gonna save you? üòÇ More like throw all you puppets under the bus. The dems care about 1 thing only, themselves.
What is that? Biden

Former President Obama joined former Vice President Biden for a socially distanced conversation in a campaign video.
Biden commercial just now, here in OK.  He restored the middle class after the 08 crash?  He led a "recovery"?  He will bring "access to affordable health care"?  What a complete crock.  He has as much access to my vote as I will have to health care.  Neither of us can afford it.
That picture of Joe Biden looks over a decade old!
Why do MAGAs keep saying Biden is too old? (Well, he might be, I dunno.)  Trump himself is SEVENTY-FOUR FUCKING YEARS OLD.
Russia as in BO, Rice, Biden et al spying on  b4 and after election and their having known the whole allegation of  and Gen Flynn involvement was non existent but still they went ahead with the farce taking the country thru hell for 3 years. Why do you think
You liberal democrats all get giddy when you see trump golf. And Obama golfed a lot. Obama committed treason along with his campaign. Trump had nothing to do with Russia. Biden is in bed with China. Trump is holding China accountable.
joe biden is running on the ANTI American ticket the ANTI law and order anti  police ticket anti safety in our cities ticket release all criminals out prison to do more crimes ticket anti American citizens ticket Joe is running on the INSANE ticket joe is a liar and criminal
What a disgrace you and joe Biden are . Trump2020
i watched joe biden calling  President Trump a racist joe biden used the N word on the senate floor accusing blacks as predators and he didnt want them attacking his sons brothers mother as he described it he wanted them removed from society
bidens own words came out of bidens own mouth he is a criminal he extorted and blackmailed Ukraine extortion blackmail are felonies joe biden is unfit to be President for several reasons mostly he's a stupid liar racist CRIMINAL
Did you see how many brand new, low follower, troll accounts responded in that thread?   I had myself a block party, just now.  Desperation is weird, with polling so strong for Biden.   I can't understand what's happening at all.
the mask and staying separate away from each other is all bullshit this is a control fear tactic the democrats are scheming conspiring to cheat and steal they will just declare biden wins you watch we must guard this election from being stolen democrats projected their intentions

Joe Biden's own words about the 1994 Crime Bill he still brags he authored.  #JoeBiden    .
He's the ONLY answer. He won the primary. Hell be the other only choice on your ballot on November 3rd. If you want to get rid of trump, you better vote for Biden.
Then you should vote for #Joementia .  . . which Joe is your favorite? I'm taking a wild guess that it was the 1994 crime bill.  Biden in 1993 speech pushing crime bill warned of "predators on our streets" who were 'beyond the pale'.  Who was he meaning?  .
. wants to address health care disparities, toughen gun control, overhaul policing, provide free community college, erase student loan debt, invest in green energy and improve the nation's infrastructure.

You had best get a new hashtag for Biden! More like #dementiaBiden2020! Or #BLM4Marxism. This has nothing to do with racism. Get a new playbook as calling him a racists no longer works. You're losing the black &amp; latino vote! Democrats realize their party has been hijacked! LOL
Biden is dirty! Hunter's deal with Ukraine &amp; the Chinese...smells like doggie pooh! Drug addicts dishonorably discharged from the military...always end up with international lucrative million dollar deals where they have no experience &amp; can't speak any foreign language! HAA! HA!
Not one Democrat will tell me why anyone should vote for Biden. Not one has ever told me what good things he has done for the American people. He has said he would raise taxes. He wants to take away personal property and cars. How is he good?
You say you can‚Äôt fathom why anyone would vote Trump. But I feel the same about why would anyone vote Biden. I have researched Trump, I have lists of things that he has done that are good. I have lists of bills he has passed for the American people but not one...
Well we will never know because Biden will never hold Presidental office. At least not president of the United States.

Biden shouldn‚Äôt even be in double digits !
Why would anyone ever build a statue of Biden?
That's a good point.  I seriously hope things don't go back to square one, but you're right that it'd happen with a single overstep.  Another important thing he needs to do (tho I don't know how) is get Biden in front of people.  Biden benefits so much from being hidden.
What is AG Barr waiting on, to see if  wins the election. Obama and Biden need to be stripped of their perks and thrown in jail. The rest of all the president‚Äôs men/women go to jail.
MSM acted as though Trump was going to lose and in a big way.  The RCP averages didn't depict a blowout leading up to the election.  Trump can win if Biden is up by 3 points (Thanks to the electoral college), but there's no way he does if he doesn't close some of the gap.
I understand the mistrust of polls, but I'm worried, and I just want to illustrate why.  Around this time in 2016, Trump was leading Hillary by 0.9; it was his only lead.  Hillary won by 3 million votes, and the polls ended with her 3.2 up on Trump.  Biden is currently up by 8.7.

Good luck finding it. U just repeat whatever u here. Sorry, its proven fact Trump has done more for minorities than fobama biden presidency.
JFC Biden was the ARCHITECT of the ‚Äò94 Crime Bill.   Not a goddamn thing will change under Biden.

What the hell difference does that make? The virus came from China &amp; there's ample evidence that, it came from the Wuhan virology lab, that China tried to cover it up, leading to world-wide spread. I can't believe that anyone thinks that Joe Biden is remotely fit to be President.
Joe Biden just makes things up, off the cuff. He's a habitual liar, a plagiarist, has proved to be corrupt~bribed Ukraine govt to fire prosecutor investigating his son, for one example~ &amp; has proved to be suspect of having dementia. Dems running JB for POTUS begs Q: WHY him?!

It's amazing how idiotic Boris is to use video of what is happening right now, in trump's America, and say the video is how it would be in Biden's America. My 4 year old kids used the same basic argument when they accused a sibling of doing the very thing they were caught doing.

It sure seems like the Biden supporters are more defined by the opposition to Biden than their actual arguments FOR Biden? There just is zero "here's why he's great/a great choice". Only "He's not Trump" and "sOrRy He'S nOt GoNnA fIx EvErYtHiNg, LeFtIsTs"
Biden is the most moderate candidate I've ever seen...
Biden would take away those rights, and do whatever is party wanted. Because none of them approve of the constitution. We are in uncharted waters right now. Trump is trying to protect the innocent in Portland. And went in as a last resort. Not the first reaction.
Karter, the difference between Biden and Trump, is Trump abides by the constitution. Which says the state has the responsibility to manage their own issues.  They can request federal aid, but the government is not supposed to go in unrequested.
"AP FACT CHECK: Trump Distorts Biden's Position on Fracking" by The Associated Press via NYT
I can't imagine where this is headed if Biden wins and the R's lose the Senate.   As much as some people may not like Trump, and he's not one of my fav people, but he has to win in Nov.  Alternative is not acceptable.
Q anon and conspiracies. That's the only reason people refuse to see current events for what they are.   Biden is not a shining star, even though Trump and current events make him appear to be. Alex Jones is a close equal to Himmler
he's literally running ads that say "settle for biden"
Are you living in an alternate universe?  Trump rode in on VP Biden &amp; Pres. Obama's shirt tails after they initiated the successful plan to recover our economy after the 2008 recession. Trump's been on that ride that hadn't stopped until he ignored the pandemic. Fact ‚òëÔ∏è Yourself
Cause you won‚Äôt be president. Oh, hi to the person who controls Biden‚Äôs twitter account. If he can‚Äôt speak real sentences I wonder how he would write any.
So what you're saying is the pandemic is a Democrat plot to make Trump look bad, and Joe Biden knew about it in October because Obama developed it to help keep the Democrats in power?  WAKE UP PEOPLE! THE TRUTH IS STARING YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE!  #TheTruthIsIMadeAllThatUpJustNow
is the racist his own actions and friends prove that. Friends with people like Robert Byrd and Strom Thrumond he also uses racial slurs. Biden also has been accused of rape. Since you support Biden you must support his racism and assault on women.
Biden is played between Clinton and Republicans. That‚Äôs a laugh.
Nice piece by  this morning. Offer big change that feels familiar. Avoid ideological traps and be ruthlessly pragmatic. Hope  and his team give it a read.
Remember that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Don‚Äôt feed the fire, vote for
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Can‚Äôt Delay Voting, but He Can Cause Confusion" by Unknown Author via NYT
Biden is a fucking conservative. He isn't the left. Eww
Facts: he is our President, he isn‚Äôt cheering he is stating truths that media won‚Äôt, he banned travel from China early on &amp; Biden called him xenophobic, Biden later admits this was right thing to do, covid is less deadly than flu so doesn‚Äôt really matter
He can‚Äôt even remember what he is running for. Biden is a puppet for the rich liberals.
Y‚Äôall still voting for Biden??
Biden is a pedo as well why tf are we voting
Sense? This man changes his mind, more than he washes his hands. He makes as much sense as Biden-none. He‚Äôs been wrong about everything. Picture from the 80‚Äôs. HIV era, Mr Fauci, ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù Fuk that leprechaun.
It's not paranoia to believe Trump is going to sue to get the results overturned and a hold put on swearing in Biden while it works it's way up to the SC where they will declare the results null and void.
This isn‚Äôt going the way you thought it was. This is projection of your own personal beliefs, not what has been witnessed on camera with Biden and his wandering hands, on women and children. He‚Äôs sick and so are you.
The Obama/Biden admin killed 10,‚Äôs of 1000‚Äôs brown men, women and children. They allowed ISIS to thrive. Trump comes in dismantling these killers. He‚Äôs called a racist for saving their lives and you call Obama a hero. Obama a hero, for pigment only, content of character? üôÑüôÑ
I'm either going for Trump or Jo Jorgensen. Biden is absolutely out of the question.
Biden won't be president. We all know he's just a puppet.
The main advantage with Biden is he‚Äôs still perceived as a moderate, and always will be, which only makes it easier for moderates to vote for him and be on board (or at least not panicked) with his progressive policies being implemented in the future.
Perhaps that‚Äôs true in regards to ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù who act like Briahna. With that said, read Biden‚Äôs platform and unity task force with Bernie and tell me with a straight face that it‚Äôs accommodating to republican moderates.
If we follow Biden‚Äôs agenda this will be our look soon.
You talking about Biden I assume?
I honestly can‚Äôt see you voting for bidenüò¢üò¢... that won‚Äôt be a biden presidency and you know that.
We have to make sure that Biden wins and wins big
That‚Äôs His handlers biden is already in bed
He gave the eulogy at John Lewis's funeral and used it as a pulpit to bash Trump and push Biden and mail in voting... his usual snarky bullshit...
I know this is a very different and pivotal election year (aren't they all) but goddammit I wish the dems would get their shit together. Bernie or Warren would probably be polling higher and have better odds than Biden.
We lose because the dems want candidates who want things to be like the Clinton years instead of looking forward. I'm gonna vote for Biden but I do not have very much confidence in him winning
Remember, you have to vote for Biden too unless you ain‚Äôt Black. Fml
That's the problem with Biden though, he doesn't appeal to anyone except for old ass liberals and people who are like 'well he's not the other guy.'
He has zero chance of getting elected if he doesn‚Äôt debate BDD. Trump will completely destroy Biden though if they do debate.
Yeah and elect Biden if you want.. you know, the thing.
Well, I cried all day about this mess.. I trying to figure where to immigrate ..  But, I won‚Äôt go down without a fight!! I am making phone calls for Biden!! We have to be apart of the campaign on the phones and on the ground depending on health risks..
Let's not pretend that Biden is an even decent candidate. He's simply "not Trump". That's his redeeming quality.
Maybe they better keep Joe in the basement  #LeadRight #TWGRP #VoteRedNov3rd
I think that says something to the blind trust, or at least the facade of public support, that the RNC has given to Trump.  Just like 2016, I would've rather had almost any other candidate - like you, but there are only 2. So I will be reluctantly supporting Biden.
Um....  I don't think Republicans are interested in closing polling locations or disenfranchising anyone...  they are opposed to voter fraud and stolen elections.  Besides, who actually thinks Biden will even garner half the votes that HRC did?
Um, considering that Biden will only serve one term, shouldn‚Äôt that be one of the traits the search committee should prioritize?
The video is great !! I will be working on phone calls with Biden in Texas! I am in Oklahoma... Let me know if you need my help ..
Following everyone! #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Resist üëä
‚ÄúFiscal conservatism‚Äù is still on break and will not return until Biden is sworn in. That‚Äôs the day Republicans bring back the monthly ObamaCare repeal bills.
One, I am shocked you didn't type bigly. üòÜ Two, you attacked American people more than once. You claim you have power that no President has or should ever have. Three, Biden actually understands the position of President and our Constitution. You have demonstrated you do not.
Nothing will change under Biden. They‚Äôre both neolibs.
Our democracy that you so proudly tout failed 3 million Americans last election cycle. Gave us Biden over any other candidate. If you seriously think THIS is what tips the scale for our democratic integrity idk what show you've been watching. LMFAO
He‚Äôs a self-serving jerk. He cares nothing for his constituents, only about making brownie points with the prez. Probably wants a cabinet position. Give it up, Stitt. President Biden isn‚Äôt going to give you one.
Only a tacky Obama provides the enthusiasm needed to guarantee a win for the dotard #Biden.  If it‚Äôs Michelle, trump will make bulge jokes since she a Tranny.  I think Biden will put Barack on the ticket as vp, but he‚Äôll resign later in favor of a real freak, like Eric Holder.
Joseph Biden = Trojan Horse.
Perhaps Pelosi &amp; Biden could then follow.
you're my dude but can't follow Jeff weaver or anyone else you vote for Biden.
If you want a President vote for Joe Biden. If you want four more years of a two bit grifter who wants to be a dictator vote for the other guy.
what's more embarrassing, that hillary lost to trump or that trump is going to lose to biden?
By ‚Äúthat candidate‚Äù you mean Biden?  Because of my understanding of sin, I believe every election is about choosing the lesser of two evils. But certainly there are third party peeps who are better morally then these clowns.
It truly amazes me that the American people think that a couple geezers, with signs of early onset dementia, are the two best options for President. #Trump #Biden
Better hurry. If Biden wins it will all go away!
Joe Biden will announce his running mate soon. Here‚Äôs who‚Äôs on the list.  via
Lmao Biden will be in a retirement home really soon...
Keep thinking Biden is going to win. Lol

If Joe Biden wins on November 3rd, you won‚Äôt hear a damn thing about the Corona Virus again.
Trump could literally bring world peace and people would still criticize him. I find it unbelievable that y‚Äôall are so fixed on this bullshit narrative that Trump is the fucking antichrist. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is/who he is.
Yes, Sir,  keep it up, Mr. Biden. üòµüë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
Hence VP Biden's "We choose truth over facts" statement. That wasn't misspeaking - it was an admission. Naturally, they define what "truth" means, and do so without any reference to facts or actual science.
Clumsy phrasing, clumsy walking, clumsy stare, clumsy word salads...but sure...Biden is the one lost
George W. started two wars and Obama added 5 more. Trump is the only President in the past 20 years who didn‚Äôt start a war. And Biden voted for the Iraq war. That‚Äôs your candidate.
Is this the Dems 'concession' to the left for running Biden? Obama opining? Lol
tRump just earned Joe Biden my vote. #NeverBiden no more. Regardless of who is chosen as VP I‚Äôm all in for Biden.
Get ready for many many hateful tweets from  about 2 to 3 am in the morning. My guess is hateful tweets regarding Obama, Pelosi, Voting, Lewis, Dems, Biden among others.
It's not "it didn't have to be this bad" but  "this didn't have to happen at all" Trump is the "founder" of coronavirus. I've been a Biden fan for a long time and I'm going to be really pissed if you all screw this up.
No.  If Biden wins, it‚Äôs whatever. Biden is not for M4A and will have a swamp Administration beholden to wealthy donors as always.  Sure, I‚Äôd be glad Trump is gone but neither get my vote for many reasons.
says that he will make the rights of the LGBTQ community his 1st priority, he said the same thing about BLM &amp; immigrants. Biden changes his priorities with the wind change he will forget about you tomorrow.
What about 4 million black votes (for Hillary) that WILL NOT VOTE IN NOVEMBER FOR BIDEN?  DEMS have a big problem and no way to fix it.  They chose the wrong person - Biden should be at home, retired!!!!
Ngl if Biden won trump would run again in 2024 and since Biden is a neolib who will do nothing for people, trump would have no problem winning in a few years time.
I think Seth is right. The election happens, Biden wins a landslide, even taking red states that everyone thought out of his reach as his supporters stay home. He then uses these unusual results to bolster the argument the election was rigged. High risk ploy for the GOP.... 1/2
So after KHive pretended to be deaf to Kamala‚Äôs calls for donations you guys pretended that Kamala didn‚Äôt call Biden out for being a Segregationist. KHive is broke and has no morals.
Nothing surprises me about this. The deep state is still in control and I am afraid the deep state is running the clock on spygate. If Biden gets in all goes away and General Flynn goes to jail.
‚Å¶ So sit down, bitch.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the t**mp campaign and the GOP made fun of Vice Pres Biden for suggesting POTUS would suggest delaying the election.
What do you have on Hillary?  Maybe it's pre-announcing, like they did with the announcement a couple days ago that Biden picked Harris for his VP on August 1st.
There is the distinct possibility that millions of people may actually vote for Biden. Trump wants this nipped in the bud now.

Yes!!! On the day of that rally, I predicted it would kill Cain.
I will show up in person and wait in line if necessary to insure my vote for Joe. Biden is not hijacked by the Trump administration.
I thought with Martial Law the election could be delayed.  Maybe this is Trump‚Äôs way of getting the Dems to stop the riots in their cities.  If they don‚Äôt, then martial law will be declared.  Everyone knows Trump will win 2020.  If Hillary couldn‚Äôt beat him Brainless Biden can‚Äôt
Its only going to get worse. Hold on to your pantyhose ladies and gents. The devil is scared #Biden

A hot take: The Presidency is supposed to represent the best of us. If this is the best the Boomers can do - Trump and Biden - then maybe we should phase Boomers out more quickly. At the very least, they need to take responsibility for it and quit blaming Millennials.
Ok...dude...that is exactly what could be said for Biden. Using your very own logic that is exactly what you Trumpers are doing to Biden. Trump admits to it, he is accusing himself. Not to mention Biden never put a full page out saying some innocent kids need the death penalty.

OMG. Is BIDEN "Q" ?!?!?!
Translation: Trump is scared he's going to lose to Biden so wants to delay the election so he can cling to power.
And what about Trump? I could literally show you hundreds of excerpts of him showing signs of dementia but you guys ignore that and bring up Biden Biden Biden. Like wow. The projecting is strong with y‚Äôall.
He's scared he's going to lose to Joe Biden so is suggesting the election might have to be delayed, citing some bullshit reason.

Joe Biden dealing with Dementia. While Donald Trump is deploying the US military against US citizens.  I gonna "waste" my vote on a 3rd party.
Or else you will waste the entirety of the political capital of the VP slot, which, as Joe Biden's experience in 1988 and 2008 vs 2020 will tell you, is incredibly valuable.   Who can beat Hawley/Cotton/Hogan/Baker?   I don't trust Susan Rice bc she's never done it at any level.
They can name a Federal Prison Library after him. He won't be here though. My money says he is in Russia on the day Biden is inaugurated.
You sound like Joe Biden!  "Poor kids are just as smart as white kids."
Joe Biden has said that he‚Äôs probably only a one term president. You have to be confident that whoever is the VP nominee can beat a Republican challenger in 2024. Obviously that person should be focused on becoming president. Dumb fucks.

...but what is Biden's solution?
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs allies‚Äù = Dodd. But sure, give it to Rice so Fox can give Trey Gowdy and his hair a nightly show leading up to the election where he only talks about Benghazi

Biden isn't scary so the right is trying to tie him to rose twitter and the squad basically. It's dumb, but then Trump doesn't have much respect for his base.  And frankly they don't warrant much respect.

At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

To help his friend trump win. Thats the point of his campaign to try and steal some of the young people or black vote which takes votes away from biden and then kanyes buddy trump wins again

I have my pick of course but will vote for Biden if he chooses a wet noodle to be his vice.
No way I‚Äôd ever put my husband through this. Jill Biden should step in but she won‚Äôt.

Biden sucks
Like Obama and Biden did during H1N1  Took 6 months before acting Called off testing  Trump moved quickly closing travel to china States move slow NY move old people that were I'll to nursing homes Got them killed But sure blame Trump Plus covid numbers are skewed
I gotta think running next to Trump in a district that Biden looks likely to win won‚Äôt help Neese in the general.

She divided the party, and caused great anger in a lot of circles, but she means well, that more than Trump, or Biden can honestly say.
Yes. I am. The process played out democratically. Biden won. I didn‚Äôt like it either, but it‚Äôs his choice. He has to decide who he thinks is best to save our country.  If you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs your decision. But to parade around publicly that you won‚Äôt vote if he chooses a...
That's a bold claim. I don't think anybody knows besides Mr. Biden.
Legitimate question: How many moderates did the Dems turn away today with their ridiculous sham hearing of AG Barr and their equally ridiculous sham Q&amp;A time with Joe Biden???
I used to the that the Federalist was an honest player when it came to the Constitution, especially the 10th Amendment (assembly always made conservatives uncomfortable). Perhaps if Biden wins you will learn to love the 1st and 10th again.
Really?  Do you think the "DEM center" wants Biden?  Pete Buttigieg would be more aligned.  DEMS are fooling themselves if they think black Americans are actually going to vote. Obama had a movement. Hillary had a black base.  Biden condones black profiling in his words &amp; actions
Biden‚Äôs enthusiasm is laughable!  He was given every question and was prepared for them.  He can‚Äôt number things on the fly.
I‚Äôm pretty sure I just heard Biden say he hasn‚Äôt been tested for Covid, he said this in a public place without a mask on. Using his own ‚Äúlogic‚Äù isn‚Äôt that irresponsible? Couldn‚Äôt he be asymptomatic and spreading Covid-19?  #MAGA #bumblingbiden #babblingbiden

I believe Harris or Demmings is the best fit for Biden at this time of unrest in this country
Less than 100 days left. 2016 9 states were decided by less than 3%. 2 by less than 1%. These 9 states represent 107 EV well more than enough to tip the election. No one will convince me Biden can‚Äôt pick up 3% in at least 1/2 the red ‚Äò16 states. #Biden2020

Yep! I have no problem denying Biden a presidency when Dems all dropped out to endorse the dude who took 32 years to win a primary.
It‚Äôs funny how much Biden‚Äôs people swore we were all part of a cult.   Did you have a problem with reading comprehension on my last reply?  Did Tim Kaine run for POTUS? Or do you just have a problem with black women being selected for VP?
Yeah I would want Biden to be on a debate stage with tRump. Biden would just forget where he is, tell voters to cast ballots for The Other Biden and insult minorities. It‚Äôs better to keep hiding Joe Biden
Biden is thinking of all the Benghazi ammo he would give tRump by choosing Rice. Benghazi would rally tRump‚Äôs base and energize them in time for November.

4 more years of tRump. I‚Äôll outlive all of tRump‚Äôs judicial appointments. Biden won‚Äôt budge on M4A or recreational weed/ rescheduling so I have no problem waiting for 2024 to see if there is a Dem worth voting for.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
The concrete was not cured properly, so fell from high winds.  Today's post/pictures are old; the damage was not caused by Hurricane Hanna.  While I agree that Trump has MANY faults, I see a more safe, financially sound, "America first" economy with Trump.  Biden is China's rug.
Biden's Senate record was Pro-black profiling! His vote totals in November will be millions less than Hillary. Trump, however, will get about 63 million (he will get some new votes, but also lose votes when COVID-19 keeps many home/not voting). Biden does have asst help him poop!
Biden represents Not Trump.

Biden will be a placeholder President.  Very important election but not especially effective.
Plan all along was for Biden to put one of the Obamas on the ticket.  He or he will resign after the election if Biden wins. Biden can replace him or him with whatever he is told.  At this point the democrats don‚Äôt GAF.  Barack and Jarrett set it up to get back at Trump. #KAG

Lol. Where is my money? Biden doesn't have a plan. He is trying to fool the left with window dressings and task forces. Why don't you spend your time phone banking for him instead of arguing with me. It would be more productive. You can't convince me to vote for Biden. Ever.
I'm being serious. Why are you laughing? Where are we headed with a Biden administration? Back to the environment that created a need for Trump? Ffs. We can't keep doing the same.
I wish he would have had more time to state his case but I agree with him. Trump comes up with these imaginary boogey men, creates a fake army, gives Fox news lots of footage to try to scare people into thinking this is Biden's America, even though it's actually Trump's America.

You‚Äôre pretending Bernie was an exclusive CNN guest? And that he didn‚Äôt have multiple townhalls. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Bernie‚Äôs FB/ online campaign had articles written about the efficiency that Biden would need to copy.
The fact that you defend Biden‚Äôs buffoonery is pathetic. Mr. Dementia is not the answer.....
why aren‚Äôt you investigating Obama and Biden? More proof these 2 clowns are hypocrites.
You posted on my tweet so it‚Äôs my turn to return the favor.  This post from the press secretary calling a liar is, in fact, a lie. Trump said exactly what Joe Biden quoted, video clip from the Tulsa Rally  This is how truth works, in case you‚Äôve forgotten.
Please keep talking publicly and bragging on yourself. It‚Äôs increases Biden‚Äôs lead daily.
What is the point of this?? This literally IS trump's america, where the gestapo beat up peaceful protesters and pepper spray nurses.  I'm voting for Biden because this is not acceptable to me.
If Joe Biden wins we get AOC as energy czar among other destructive things.
Hey good morning. Yes I think Biden will win. It‚Äôs still 100 days out so who knows but yes it‚Äôs looking positive.
I voted for Hillary (under protest) this is much different. There are millions of us who refuse to vote for a party that continues ignores us. We aren't voting for Biden. That ship has sailed.
Biden team lies.... that is exactly what their doing destroying our country!!!!
I'm sorry. But I'm not voting for Biden. I want a revolution. Trump pisses us off enough that I might just get one. Stay safe.

VP Biden has an amazing field of WOMEN from which to choose. The last thing we need to do is build up conflict around his choice. Here's hoping everyone will sign on to full support no matter whom he chooses. Opinions welcome, as always.
They said they were doing it ironically to protest the mask mandate and to show what life would be like if Biden is elected. I don‚Äôt believe them obviously.
I can complain about Trump, even voting for Biden. I can complain about the bus driver if I want. Oklahoma is getting more Progressive. We've been purple in the last few elections. Our Congressswoman is a Dem, in OKC. We're getting there. Lol.
Joe Biden will reform the police. Not defund them.  Spread the word.
We can't be bullied into voting for voting Biden. Remember they tried 2 do that with Hillary? They're not reaching out 2 the Progressive Independents. Biden keeps emailing me, asking me for money, never asks me what topics matter to me. I don't want my vote 2 be taken for granted
No book in Nevada (or offshore) has the GOP favotlred to take back the house. None.   Ladbrokes has the Democrats favored to win both the house and the senate right now and Biden 4/7 over Trump 13/8.

Troy, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for in a Presidential Candidate. But, if you can‚Äôt choose between a decent man (as stated by LYNDSEY GRAHAM) like Joe Biden, and Trump who stole millions from his own Children‚Äôs Charity, then you need to just stay home. THAT is my opinion.
Biden and obama
This is spot on, but may I add that before, the racist Boomers (and older) only feared one thing: black people moving into their suburbs. Now, Trump is stoking fears with his ‚ÄúBiden will destroy your neighborhoods‚Äù rant. They can‚Äôt openly complain anymore so they use code words.
You really need to Google dementia and yes I honestly think Joe Biden has it and it is the beginning of Alzheimer's

Holy God in Heaven!! BIDEN is creepy?? Yeah, don‚Äôt vote. Just stay home.
2/2  While it is true that Biden hasn't explicitly said he wanted to "defund the police," he has said he wants to "redirect" some of the funds allocated for police to social services and other non-law enforcement entities.  So by definition, his policy "defunds the police."
1/2  Very disappointed to see KOCO "Local News" tonight blast the President by playing a CNN style hit piece about his claim that Joe Biden wants to defund the police.  The segment was so biased and one-sided that it was actually embarrassing.

In 2016 Trump won OK05 53-40, and if this poll is correct, and Biden wins it 51-46 it would result in a 11-point swing in favor of the democrats.  If this turns out to be, I wonder what the overall state margin would be? 35%+ would be my guess
So our government has decided not to extend unemployment benefits .(the extra 600) Or do anything about the thousands of people who can't afford rent or mortgage. I know we need Biden right now, but we have to vote out millionaires who are so unconnected with the rest of America

I don't think Trump is trying to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è chances of winning by stigmatizing mail-in voting. It's not clear that decreased mail-in voting doesn't hurt his chances more than Biden's. He is setting the stage to declare results a fraud and void. Keep your eye on the man behind the curtain

If you want to look at it that way, Biden calling Trump the first racist president was a really effective way to draw attention to the relative scope and scale of the problem today. He was wrong, and now we ridicule and shame him, but he was speaking what a lot of people believe.

WOW!! No, I mean WOWEE!! Did I just see that? Again, I say, Biden and Pelosi need to sit down in a park somewhere and watch the kids play...oh, wait, kids and Biden a bad combo...
Biden could pick Ernest T Bass and still be better than anyone in the White House today. At least Ernest T enlisted in the Army and didnt dodge the draft.
If Biden loses in November, its straight up bc Democrats are too pussy to slap a bully back.
Joe Biden is trying hard to scrape together any kind of vote he can get! It's funny!
#JoeBiden HEY YALL That R Actually Writing This HORSHIT!  &amp; to All the LEFT That R TRYING 2 Get Biden Elected NEED 2 ASK 4 FORGIVENESS because it's the TREASONOUS BEHAVIOR. It's ASTONISHING 2 EVERYONE IN USA!
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lyin dog-faced pony soldier.‚Äù -Joe Biden to a supporter of his
I‚Äôm assuming you hold the same standard to Joe Biden??
Happy birthday. My 70th birthday falls on Inauguration Day and it would be the perfect gift to say goodbye to trump and hello to Biden. Make it happen people. VOTE.
I‚Äôll call Biden out...OUT!!...but do we REALLY think he knows what it means??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ, yes that was rhetorical. Peace and great health!
Joe Biden's disastrous plans for America's suburbs  via  Scarsdale is the most expensive 6.67 sq miles property to live in, in America, and something tells me they won‚Äôt be building low income-high rises there.
Trump called it a Hoax, every governor like mine Governor Stitt jumped on the Trump Express to death.  Fine example we need Joe Biden &amp; the way we handle heath care in this country. Scary part. COVID-19  just getting started. I'm look at a quarter million deaths by Christmas
More proof Obama and Biden ( Batman and Robin ) knew about the illegal spying on our President.. and Barr says the bith of them would not be prosecuted.  That ‚Äòs what pisses me off big time.
So what.  Youd go nuts if you ver heard things I said years ago in Gym locker rooms or when Im out with the guys.  I used to be a more crazy guy.  But he aint a Racist like Joe Biden.
And I don't agree with everything that Trump or Biden stand for but sometimes you have to look at the greater good and pick something.  No organization is perfect. Not even BLM.   But there is a problem and they're the closest to bring changes about.  So just kneel to support.
Why doesn't he just vote for Biden and make it unanimous
Wise men seek good Counse. We  know Joe Biden would be reaching out to every expert in the field of medicine,  economics and education get this country back on its feet.
The 15-minute video, posted online Thursday, is the latest maneuver to get the former president involved in the 2020 campaign for his former vice president, as Biden tries to rebuild Obama's winning coalition in November.
Right. Omg... Some of these Dem(Wits) voting for Old lost his mind Biden after his lies, plagerism, racism, failed 40+ years in Governement.  Trump needs to create a task force to help Dem(Wits).Joe Biden is the definition of a moderate. He has no leftist policies. He won‚Äôt push for any leftist policies. It‚Äôs a lie.
What‚Äôs the funniest lie in this tweet? Trump lying about being at 50% or lying about Biden being more left than Sanders?
TLDR- if (when) Biden wins in a massive landslide tRump will claim fraud.
BIDEN IS A JOKE WHEN COMES TO 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGY!
Biden‚Äôs running mate!
Your a failure and loser! Vote for Biden!!üëçüòÖ
Word. Harris/Warren 2024! Biden/Harris 2020. We'll see though!
Because it is July 30 and Obama / Biden administration is still the most corrupt administration in history
Technically, I supported her for President but I voted Biden. I'm a horrifically reasonable realist. I gave and give money to her. I support her ideas and policies (even those she stole). But! She isn't who we need now.  I've ignored Harris's past. I think Demings is a gem.
Delay, delay, delay.....Trump beaten by Biden and sweep it all under the rug.
Wonder if Biden has Obama writing his teleprompter script? Cause we all know Hiden Biden isn‚Äôt coherent speaking impromptu!
Well Joe Biden is certainly not going to do what the Radical Right wants! He, unlike you, has more integrity, values &amp; morals! Which means he will make an awesome president, again, unlike you! You're welcome! #JoeBiden2020!
YES YOUR RIGHT.......ITS GONA BE A GREAT NIGHT FOR JOE BIDEN!!!!
Great botched video clip of  Biden, it‚Äôs not gonna work! What he said was true about you. You are on a sinking ship, and I hope the Republicans wake up or they will sink with you!!!
Is he supposed to just sit there and keep his mouth shut while the media and democrats keep going after him for bullshit. If there was any true reporting going on I wouldn‚Äôt care but they complain if his hand shakes while drinking water but won‚Äôt say shit about Biden‚Äôs dementia
It‚Äôs normal for outlets to pre-write big stories like this, so they can update it then release it immediately, and hopefully be the outlet that breaks the story.   Ever wondered how beautifully-written obituaries appear moments after a celebrity died?
How do we go from Chris Dodd to a so-called plethora of Biden folks undermining her?
Can you imagine Joe Biden answering the ‚Äúred phone‚Äù to stop a nuclear apocalypse?
He started closing flights in January. Where have you been. Under Biden 1000 died before he said there was a flu problem in 2009
Nobody in his entire life has ever described Joe Biden as radical. He‚Äôs a 35mph cruise down a country road with nothing to see but trees and grass. Boring, calm, steady. The kinda President you can take a nap to. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all rallying behind him #BidenTime
My ‚ÄúSuburban Lifestyle Dream‚Äù....Trump is no longer President of the United States and Biden wins 2020...things get better!! All of the senators, governors, mayors...all supported Trump, are voted out year after year after year until they are all eliminated!!
Exactly why woukd anyone want to go back to eight years of failure with Biden when we actually had someone who finally broke a record in keeping promises and getting things done and putting Americans first. Low IQ idiots with very short memories is why.
Marie harpie;  Joe Biden not a radical üòÇüòÇüòÇ he‚Äôs a demented blathering mouth piece for insane evil dims. A radical for sure. Whoever had eyes SEE. Whoever has ears HEAR.
You‚Äôre right!  It‚Äôs Biden!  He can help mend this torn country back together again;  Trump has no desire whatsoever to help America heal.  (He seems to love the division) smh
Then vote for Biden, and end this nightmare!  You don‚Äôt have to like the guy....  ijs
Dumber than dumb donnie is just an asset for Putin, even allowing him to place bounties on American soldier's heads, &amp; will do WHATEVER Putin wants him to do--even at the expense of Americans! I'll take Biden over Putin/trump any day!!! #1 of #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Old joe Biden saying what ever it takes to get elected. Writing checks on the taxpayers backs.
Valerie, Obama &amp; Biden must be sitting on tacks wondering if Durham‚Äôs Report will entrap them like a Boa Constrictor.  Or are they so arrogant that it‚Äôs of no concern. (Stupid??)
The questions were almost too hard.   If they had been more difficult Biden would have started saying the questions came from Trump and refused to answer.
I thought about all this pomp and BS and the funerals I have not been able to attend for friends and family but hey it‚Äôs just like all the lies told by the media and people buy this BS like a lunker bass on 5 pound Line.  Toxic libtards and Biden being asked questions w/ answers.
I live in Oklahoma and yes we are scheduled to go back to school as planned. ‚ÄúIdiots‚Äù Can‚Äôt wait for you Dr Biden. You and your husband give me ‚ÄúHope‚Äù when despair is trying to take over.  Thank you. I like the idea of the two of you giving us weekly samples of that hope.  Please
Reporter - "Why should voters vote for you vs voting against Trump?" Biden - "Huh?".... incoherent answer
I actually took a break to watch fool Biden answer some nice questions from fawning reporters but got sick after 5 minutes.
My pop said he'd vote. I'm working on him to vote. It's hard, with a 74 year old. But I'm like "Dad, you are his same age and Biden is older and he has a great pat." SO FUCK DJT.
If Biden wins Florida by +8, this will be an historic ass kicking for Trump. If Biden barely wins Florida, he will win the general pretty confortably.
I think Biden wins AZ,MI, PA and WI. I think he stays within 5% of the other states. I‚Äôll be shocked if Biden performs anywhere close to that well in Florida.
Wrong dictator wanna-be! When Joe Biden beats you in a landslide, our country will begin the road back to a full democracy, people will be dancing in the streets, &amp; the world will utter a great big sigh of relief! ONLY then can we be better! #Biden2020! #BlueWave
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
Biden hasn‚Äôt planned anything - the usual commie committee running the Demoncat party is. And you ain‚Äôt gonna like it. ü§¨
Wow, a plan!!!  How novel, 9nothing we've seen in almost 3 yrs.  Yea!!!!  Mr. Biden.
When Biden starts blinking and sqinking his eyes .....HIS BRAIN GOES DEAD!
When I hear VP Biden is elected, I will thank God and be thankful!
Lol Biden is not worse off than trump in that regard and Trump is completely clueless about his own agenda. Which he doesn‚Äôt have. Biden will be fine in the debates.
Katie‚Äôs right‚ÄîDelusional Sniffer Biden‚ÄîBut if he thinks women‚Äôs rights were bad, where was he over the last 40 years in helping improve and perfect the situation?  Just sniffing!!!
At this point in 2016, Trump and Hillary were basically tied. Biden has a 10% lead right now. Biden isn‚Äôt gonna duck the debates. He has no reason to.
You can beat Biden off...
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt know his own fing birthday!
Biden was obviously out of any future debates when he went downhill after the Democrat debates.
Either are Biden supporters
You jest,  of course!  Can you really imagine bumbling Biden with access to the Nuclear Button!  Think big picture!  Trump trying to get us out of Wars...Biden helps send pallets of cash to people who want to kill you!  No to Hiden Biden!
"Joe Biden called Arizona a CITY...."  Seriously?!?  Person. Man. Woman. Camera. TV.  We're done here..... smh
Biden‚Äôs getting confused between his dreams and real life events.  Otherwise he is just lying and making up BS.  Either case is disturbing.
Biden‚Äôs taking so long picking a running mate because he‚Äôs planning an 11th hour run at Trump‚Äôs base by picking the Confederate Flag.
Where have you been? Biden‚Äôs basement? There has been one for the states to do. What have you ever done for Americans?
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. It‚Äôs their call who they vote for and shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed for it. I know I‚Äôm not gonna sit and be pinned down because I refuse to vote for any of the democrats. Trump ain‚Äôt perfect(there is no perfect candidate) but I ain‚Äôt voting for Biden.
Biden is beginning to remember dreams and think they were real.  The more he talks the more he illuminates his diminished abilities to do anything except retire.
Better vote Trump. If Biden party of hate  takes over Christian imprisonment and executions will be our future. Dims are Vicious  Godless people
I like Paw Patrol.  Bet Joe Biden does too. Which kinda ruins your narrative, truth be told. But truth isn't really your strong suit, now is it?
That federal bldg in Portland is going to be burned down. Just a matter of time;  you can say outrageous 5 million times: no one. No one cares and the few who do are too few. Insurrection is coming to every city. Especially with Biden &amp; Party Of hate.
What is that? Biden
Fool  useful idiot. Laughing stock. Befuddled Biden
He was in Biden‚Äôs basement showing him how to pitch
Like you said for Decades. How long has Trump been in office? How long has Joe Biden? Obama? Nancy? Etc. Yet the Problem Lies with Trump......  #WakeUpAmerica
That‚Äôs funny üòÇ coming from you Biden
And don't forget what Biden said! He is a poor excuse for an "American" and we sure don't want him in Control of our Country! It's not about Black or White...it's about what's best for our Country! TRUMP 2020
Not one Democrat will tell me why anyone should vote for Biden. Not one has ever told me what good things he has done for the American people. He has said he would raise taxes. He wants to take away personal property and cars. How is he good?
You say you can‚Äôt fathom why anyone would vote Trump. But I feel the same about why would anyone vote Biden. I have researched Trump, I have lists of things that he has done that are good. I have lists of bills he has passed for the American people but not one...
Well we will never know because Biden will never hold Presidental office. At least not president of the United States.
I'm crapping on Biden.
This is Trump‚Äôs AMERICA!!!  NOT Joe Biden‚Äôs!!!! LOOK around and see how messed up things are everywhere in America right now because of Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership!                                                Point to anything and you tell me how Trump is making things better!?
I know that people are complaining about Trump &amp; his cognitive exam, so let‚Äôs see Biden‚Äôs. That could open up a whole new conversation!!!
That‚Äôs pretty standard. Wait till you‚Äôre in 70!s  you‚Äôll see.  Bet Biden couldn‚Äôt do a two word test üòÇIvanka Trump to "reach across the aisle" and because Biden wants to sniff her. FIRST üëè FEMALE üëè VP üëè
Biden is just a puppet for the rich.
Biden is just a puppet for the rich. If you want a communist country move to China!
Biden is just a puppet.  Being controlled by the Clinton‚Äôs and Obama.  If you want to live in a communist country move!
It was Biden campaign rally
Can you imagine getting email from 15 Democratic candidates? Biden alone is drowning me.
You still don‚Äôt care that Joe Biden is a sex predator.  Can‚Äôt forget about that.
Trump&gt;Biden. Biden is a joke
Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around Aug. 1 and told reporters this week that he would "have a choice in the first week of August."
Rasmussen has Trump at 42% and Biden at 48%. Get your facts straight! #ignorance #Narcissist
Mr Pinkney. Yes.that statement should expose to ALL PEOPLE the true racist drunk uncle joe Biden really is but for some reason his comments are treated as a joke. Who is he to tell black people who THEY ARE!  He‚Äôs a disgrace but is a presidential candidate. Even more disgraceful!
As well as being sexually attracted to children, Joe Biden had to drop out of his presidential campaign in 1987 because he was caught plagiarizing speeches.
Biden should have picked Senator Harris as his running mate a month ago and been done with it.
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo for documents on Biden's son
No, we need all the Millenials to vote for Biden. We have the largest voting numbers since the baby boom.
I just don‚Äôt want to vote for either but as everyone says not voting for Biden is voting for Trump so üôÉ
Yes we do, Biden is am idiot.
I understand that Trump wants a white American but again allowing Biden to run for office and win does nothing but uplift pedofiles. Biden Clearly has dementia and I‚Äôm sure he could us that as an excuse to justify his actions.
It sure seems like the Biden supporters are more defined by the opposition to Biden than their actual arguments FOR Biden? There just is zero "here's why he's great/a great choice". Only "He's not Trump" and "sOrRy He'S nOt GoNnA fIx EvErYtHiNg, LeFtIsTs"
Biden is the most moderate candidate I've ever seen...
Biden would take away those rights, and do whatever is party wanted. Because none of them approve of the constitution. We are in uncharted waters right now. Trump is trying to protect the innocent in Portland. And went in as a last resort. Not the first reaction.
Karter, the difference between Biden and Trump, is Trump abides by the constitution. Which says the state has the responsibility to manage their own issues.  They can request federal aid, but the government is not supposed to go in unrequested.
"AP FACT CHECK: Trump Distorts Biden's Position on Fracking" by The Associated Press via NYT
I can't imagine where this is headed if Biden wins and the R's lose the Senate.   As much as some people may not like Trump, and he's not one of my fav people, but he has to win in Nov.  Alternative is not acceptable.
he's literally running ads that say "settle for biden"
Cause you won‚Äôt be president. Oh, hi to the person who controls Biden‚Äôs twitter account. If he can‚Äôt speak real sentences I wonder how he would write any.
is the racist his own actions and friends prove that. Friends with people like Robert Byrd and Strom Thrumond he also uses racial slurs. Biden also has been accused of rape. Since you support Biden you must support his racism and assault on women.
Nice piece by  this morning. Offer big change that feels familiar. Avoid ideological traps and be ruthlessly pragmatic. Hope  and his team give it a read.
Remember that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Don‚Äôt feed the fire, vote for
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Can‚Äôt Delay Voting, but He Can Cause Confusion" by Unknown Author via NYT
Biden is a fucking conservative. He isn't the left. Eww
Facts: he is our President, he isn‚Äôt cheering he is stating truths that media won‚Äôt, he banned travel from China early on &amp; Biden called him xenophobic, Biden later admits this was right thing to do, covid is less deadly than flu so doesn‚Äôt really matter
He can‚Äôt even remember what he is running for. Biden is a puppet for the rich liberals.
Y‚Äôall still voting for Biden??
Biden is a pedo as well why tf are we voting
It's not paranoia to believe Trump is going to sue to get the results overturned and a hold put on swearing in Biden while it works it's way up to the SC where they will declare the results null and void.
I'm either going for Trump or Jo Jorgensen. Biden is absolutely out of the question.
Biden won't be president. We all know he's just a puppet.
The main advantage with Biden is he‚Äôs still perceived as a moderate, and always will be, which only makes it easier for moderates to vote for him and be on board (or at least not panicked) with his progressive policies being implemented in the future.
Perhaps that‚Äôs true in regards to ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù who act like Briahna. With that said, read Biden‚Äôs platform and unity task force with Bernie and tell me with a straight face that it‚Äôs accommodating to republican moderates.
If we follow Biden‚Äôs agenda this will be our look soon.
You talking about Biden I assume?
We have to make sure that Biden wins and wins big
He gave the eulogy at John Lewis's funeral and used it as a pulpit to bash Trump and push Biden and mail in voting... his usual snarky bullshit...
I know this is a very different and pivotal election year (aren't they all) but goddammit I wish the dems would get their shit together. Bernie or Warren would probably be polling higher and have better odds than Biden.
We lose because the dems want candidates who want things to be like the Clinton years instead of looking forward. I'm gonna vote for Biden but I do not have very much confidence in him winning
That's the problem with Biden though, he doesn't appeal to anyone except for old ass liberals and people who are like 'well he's not the other guy.'
Yeah and elect Biden if you want.. you know, the thing.
Well, I cried all day about this mess.. I trying to figure where to immigrate ..  But, I won‚Äôt go down without a fight!! I am making phone calls for Biden!! We have to be apart of the campaign on the phones and on the ground depending on health risks..
Let's not pretend that Biden is an even decent candidate. He's simply "not Trump". That's his redeeming quality.
I think that says something to the blind trust, or at least the facade of public support, that the RNC has given to Trump.  Just like 2016, I would've rather had almost any other candidate - like you, but there are only 2. So I will be reluctantly supporting Biden.
Um....  I don't think Republicans are interested in closing polling locations or disenfranchising anyone...  they are opposed to voter fraud and stolen elections.  Besides, who actually thinks Biden will even garner half the votes that HRC did?
Um, considering that Biden will only serve one term, shouldn‚Äôt that be one of the traits the search committee should prioritize?
The video is great !! I will be working on phone calls with Biden in Texas! I am in Oklahoma... Let me know if you need my help ..
‚ÄúFiscal conservatism‚Äù is still on break and will not return until Biden is sworn in. That‚Äôs the day Republicans bring back the monthly ObamaCare repeal bills.
One, I am shocked you didn't type bigly. üòÜ Two, you attacked American people more than once. You claim you have power that no President has or should ever have. Three, Biden actually understands the position of President and our Constitution. You have demonstrated you do not.
Nothing will change under Biden. They‚Äôre both neolibs.
He‚Äôs a self-serving jerk. He cares nothing for his constituents, only about making brownie points with the prez. Probably wants a cabinet position. Give it up, Stitt. President Biden isn‚Äôt going to give you one.
Only a tacky Obama provides the enthusiasm needed to guarantee a win for the dotard #Biden.  If it‚Äôs Michelle, trump will make bulge jokes since she a Tranny.  I think Biden will put Barack on the ticket as vp, but he‚Äôll resign later in favor of a real freak, like Eric Holder.
Joseph Biden = Trojan Horse.
Perhaps Pelosi &amp; Biden could then follow.
If you want a President vote for Joe Biden. If you want four more years of a two bit grifter who wants to be a dictator vote for the other guy.
what's more embarrassing, that hillary lost to trump or that trump is going to lose to biden?
By ‚Äúthat candidate‚Äù you mean Biden?  Because of my understanding of sin, I believe every election is about choosing the lesser of two evils. But certainly there are third party peeps who are better morally then these clowns.
Better hurry. If Biden wins it will all go away!
Joe Biden will announce his running mate soon. Here‚Äôs who‚Äôs on the list.  via
Lmao Biden will be in a retirement home really soon...
His rhetoric is why I will vote for Biden and I will vote against Republicans the rest of my life!!
If Joe Biden wins on November 3rd, you won‚Äôt hear a damn thing about the Corona Virus again.
Yes, Sir,  keep it up, Mr. Biden. üòµüë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
Hence VP Biden's "We choose truth over facts" statement. That wasn't misspeaking - it was an admission. Naturally, they define what "truth" means, and do so without any reference to facts or actual science.
Clumsy phrasing, clumsy walking, clumsy stare, clumsy word salads...but sure...Biden is the one lost
Is this the Dems 'concession' to the left for running Biden? Obama opining? Lol
tRump just earned Joe Biden my vote. #NeverBiden no more. Regardless of who is chosen as VP I‚Äôm all in for Biden.
Get ready for many many hateful tweets from  about 2 to 3 am in the morning. My guess is hateful tweets regarding Obama, Pelosi, Voting, Lewis, Dems, Biden among others.
It's not "it didn't have to be this bad" but  "this didn't have to happen at all" Trump is the "founder" of coronavirus. I've been a Biden fan for a long time and I'm going to be really pissed if you all screw this up.
No.  If Biden wins, it‚Äôs whatever. Biden is not for M4A and will have a swamp Administration beholden to wealthy donors as always.  Sure, I‚Äôd be glad Trump is gone but neither get my vote for many reasons.
says that he will make the rights of the LGBTQ community his 1st priority, he said the same thing about BLM &amp; immigrants. Biden changes his priorities with the wind change he will forget about you tomorrow.
What about 4 million black votes (for Hillary) that WILL NOT VOTE IN NOVEMBER FOR BIDEN?  DEMS have a big problem and no way to fix it.  They chose the wrong person - Biden should be at home, retired!!!!
Ngl if Biden won trump would run again in 2024 and since Biden is a neolib who will do nothing for people, trump would have no problem winning in a few years time.
I think Seth is right. The election happens, Biden wins a landslide, even taking red states that everyone thought out of his reach as his supporters stay home. He then uses these unusual results to bolster the argument the election was rigged. High risk ploy for the GOP.... 1/2
So after KHive pretended to be deaf to Kamala‚Äôs calls for donations you guys pretended that Kamala didn‚Äôt call Biden out for being a Segregationist. KHive is broke and has no morals.
What do you have on Hillary?  Maybe it's pre-announcing, like they did with the announcement a couple days ago that Biden picked Harris for his VP on August 1st.
There is the distinct possibility that millions of people may actually vote for Biden. Trump wants this nipped in the bud now.

I will show up in person and wait in line if necessary to insure my vote for Joe. Biden is not hijacked by the Trump administration.
I thought with Martial Law the election could be delayed.  Maybe this is Trump‚Äôs way of getting the Dems to stop the riots in their cities.  If they don‚Äôt, then martial law will be declared.  Everyone knows Trump will win 2020.  If Hillary couldn‚Äôt beat him Brainless Biden can‚Äôt
Maybe you should apologize to Joe Biden.
Biden Seeks to Abolish America‚Äòs Suburban Communities   ...how would this help every-day, hard-working Americans.
A hot take: The Presidency is supposed to represent the best of us. If this is the best the Boomers can do - Trump and Biden - then maybe we should phase Boomers out more quickly. At the very least, they need to take responsibility for it and quit blaming Millennials.
Ok...dude...that is exactly what could be said for Biden. Using your very own logic that is exactly what you Trumpers are doing to Biden. Trump admits to it, he is accusing himself. Not to mention Biden never put a full page out saying some innocent kids need the death penalty.
Am I wrong for saying I would vote for Kanye before I vote for joe Biden lmao cause...ü•¥

The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won‚Äôt help them, writes
The Democrats was the embarrassment, they knew that they weren‚Äôt as smart as Bill Barr so they talked over him, interrupted him and was down right rude to the guy. Those conspiracy theories have names attached to them, Obama, Biden, Rice, Yates, Comey, Brennon, Tapper

Joseph Biden = Trojan Horse. Wake up America!
Is he TRYING to help Biden?
Well he didn't put them in a Holiday Inn.  You should do some fact checking.  Even Biden admitted to having kids in cages.  Don't act WOKE.  Be awakened.
Why would the "radical-left" want a centrist-right politician like Biden?
I wish Biden was half as radical as fox makes him out to me. He doesn‚Äôt even support m4a.

Biden will put one of the Obamas on the ticket.  He/he will quit after the election, particularly if the Dems take the senate. Then #biden will name a REAL freak, and they have binders of freaks.  They don‚Äôt care what it looks like.   It won‚Äôt be the Jamaican lady.
Smoking weed makes you a liberal? Well shit, I guess I‚Äôm voting for Biden instead of Trump like I had planned, seeing as how I own a Medical MJ dispensary.
This Biden ad mentions his policies. That's how I knew it was a fake.
Agree. The way 'too ambitious' was used in context with it being against Biden is pretty messed.
Yeah,  but he signed those pipeline permits.  Won't get that from Biden.   He's not much of a horse to ride, but he's the only horse we got in this upcoming election.    I would love to be able to vote for   ..........  but hey, it is ,  what it is
If Biden wins his VP will be the pres in less than 1 year. His health/mind are legit bad right now.

Americans are simply not safe in Joe Biden‚Äôs America.
You sound like Joe Biden!  "Poor kids are just as smart as white kids."

Biden was about my 16th choice.   Doesn't matter.
I'm not a Biden fan or even a registered Democrat, but Trump is uniquely terrible and needs to be removed.

M*A*S*H  Dude, have you ever watched SVU? They could make several episodes about you. OTOH, they could make a few about Biden as well. You know who they couldn‚Äôt write an episode about?
Losing recent memories and reliving partial past memories is the clearest sign yet of Biden‚Äôs advancing dementia. For a moment, he thought he was working at Kingswood CC. Did he work there when he was young and he‚Äôs reliving that memory?  This is common with progressive dementia.

Can this election just be over now? I'm sick to death of hearing about Trump this and Biden that. November can't get here fast enough.
I have never seen a worse bunch of idiots and liars as the correct group of democrat leaders.  They create disruption and blame Trump, but won‚Äôt let him solve the problem.  They lie about every thing Trump.  Biden is not qualified to be POTUS , but they support him at your risk.
I'm not one for pomp and circumstance and I don't get emotional but the day that Joe Biden is inaugurated is going to be one of the happiest days of my life.
We'll get your gas can and matches ready
Talk about cuckoo for Cocoa puffs. All Joe Biden has to do is exactly what he's doing, just keep letting trump talk &amp; be his trump. What a total train wreck &amp; embarrassment for our country this short fingered vulgarian idiot is! #GOTV2020 #BAMN #SiberianCandidate
You may be referring to more than just politics, but when I get close to that point I send a little donation to Amy McGrath, Biden, or similar. It helps a bit to do anything.
Jfc...you literally took sound bites like from Biden in regards to past statements AT THE SAME TIME ignore what Trump has said...done? Glass houses motherfucker....glass houses.
With every cringy moment, we build an expectation that Biden is Mr. Magoo. What if Biden is pursuing a rope-a-dope strategy? Most voters don‚Äôt see these clips. The #crazylikeafox move would be set the bar low and then amazed by being not pathetic. #chessnotcheckers

Biden's not going to make it to the general. Also, lol.

Why would Russia want President Trump (he has been more strict on Russia than the previous administration) over Biden, a man who has admitted to Quid Pro Quo with a foreign government? Come on use your brain - If you are Russia you want Biden, he can be bought.
This is all we need to hear. It‚Äôs as if he wants Joe Biden to win by a landslide, and he will.
Biden too busy hidin in the basement waiting on Obama to tell him what to do.
Right wing media did a good job of convincing people that Hillary Clinton was basically a mafia don, it's hard to see that working on Biden. The Burisma stuff was a stab at that, but you can't be a wildly and visibly corrupt president and then run on public integrity.

To anyone who voted for President Trump in 2016 who is thinking about voting Joe Biden in 2020 look to how William Barr was treated today, Those are Biden's people there.
Idk who you are or how you found my page but we held Brett Kavanaugh accountable why wouldn‚Äôt we hold Biden to the same if not a higher standard.
At least one of them is a Bernie bro. But... this group is the group of people who'll be hoping for Biden to have a heart attack come a quarter past 12 on January 20th, 2021. Alex already as much said so.
You are as much of a socialist progressive by voting for Biden as you are voting for Trump.

Yes. I am. The process played out democratically. Biden won. I didn‚Äôt like it either, but it‚Äôs his choice. He has to decide who he thinks is best to save our country.  If you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs your decision. But to parade around publicly that you won‚Äôt vote if he chooses a...
That's a bold claim. I don't think anybody knows besides Mr. Biden.
Legitimate question: How many moderates did the Dems turn away today with their ridiculous sham hearing of AG Barr and their equally ridiculous sham Q&amp;A time with Joe Biden???
I used to the that the Federalist was an honest player when it came to the Constitution, especially the 10th Amendment (assembly always made conservatives uncomfortable). Perhaps if Biden wins you will learn to love the 1st and 10th again.
Really?  Do you think the "DEM center" wants Biden?  Pete Buttigieg would be more aligned.  DEMS are fooling themselves if they think black Americans are actually going to vote. Obama had a movement. Hillary had a black base.  Biden condones black profiling in his words &amp; actions
I‚Äôm pretty sure I just heard Biden say he hasn‚Äôt been tested for Covid, he said this in a public place without a mask on. Using his own ‚Äúlogic‚Äù isn‚Äôt that irresponsible? Couldn‚Äôt he be asymptomatic and spreading Covid-19?  #MAGA #bumblingbiden #babblingbiden
I need to hydrate and I'm only yelling at my TV.  Ooh, AND Biden is speaking. Is this National Democrats Day and I missed a memo?üôÉyes, the VP bashing Biden for not sending out the national guard is probably still the best, but the senator whacking her opponent for taking selfies with her dog instead of solving unemployment or whatever it was, that's pretty wacky too. projection much?
What is interesting is that it hit CPAC early on. Now WH staffers, üôàüôâüôä governors who refused to shut down and/or enforce masks in red states are getting hit hard. Small wonder the red states are moving towards Biden. Personal experience has informed their blue vote.

Good job getting a political plug in there! Remember everyone, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù!

Will you vote for Biden or not?
So the red state governors, overwhelmed by sickness and death and mandating masks are just playing us? That‚Äôs why the red state voters are moving to Biden. They are now *experiencing* it, not just talking smack. They got suckered and they know it now.
From Oklahoma here Judge . I do understand that there are 3 people in our state that are planning on voting for Biden, but I think they‚Äôll come to their senses before November. üòä

Assuming the model says Biden has a better chance to win, then by just a quick count the model was "right" about 85% of the time ... So that's the probability Biden wins according my model of the 538 model.
Quite mistrustful of their motives. Dems should yield NO concessions on platform, but please by all means,  vote for Biden and Dem Senate candidates.

George W. started two wars and Obama added 5 more. Trump is the only President in the past 20 years who didn‚Äôt start a war. And Biden voted for the Iraq war. That‚Äôs your candidate.
Nothing surprises me about this. The deep state is still in control and I am afraid the deep state is running the clock on spygate. If Biden gets in all goes away and General Flynn goes to jail.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the t**mp campaign and the GOP made fun of Vice Pres Biden for suggesting POTUS would suggest delaying the election.

Or else you will waste the entirety of the political capital of the VP slot, which, as Joe Biden's experience in 1988 and 2008 vs 2020 will tell you, is incredibly valuable.   Who can beat Hawley/Cotton/Hogan/Baker?   I don't trust Susan Rice bc she's never done it at any level.
They can name a Federal Prison Library after him. He won't be here though. My money says he is in Russia on the day Biden is inaugurated.
Joe Biden has said that he‚Äôs probably only a one term president. You have to be confident that whoever is the VP nominee can beat a Republican challenger in 2024. Obviously that person should be focused on becoming president. Dumb fucks.
Biden isn't scary so the right is trying to tie him to rose twitter and the squad basically. It's dumb, but then Trump doesn't have much respect for his base.  And frankly they don't warrant much respect.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Hogtie his legs and wrists together behind his back, put an apple in his mouth and a stick up his ass and have Biden carry him down the street leading a thousand person parade of people wearing pig masks.

At least he passed it. Biden won‚Äôt release the results of his because he did‚Äônt pass it
Old video junior. It‚Äôs summertime , lady has winter coat in and Biden wears his mask dipshit
Are there seriously going to be Perdue/Biden voters?
Biden will reverse it.
Yes, let‚Äôs have a debate on which candidate speaks better, you really want Joe Biden here? I think it‚Äôs extremely problematic that Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is a lot of times, forgets questions &amp; his train of thought. I also don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever watched a single trump speech
Obviously if their is republicans for biden in Texas then they are liberals hiding in republics in territory their coming out showing their true colors....
Blah blah blah blah she talks but she lies... time for the lies to come to the light.. you slept to your job in California are you willing to be groped by biden for your job while he calls you jill?

We know everyone is going to have gaffes! What we don‚Äôt expect is someone not knowing what state he‚Äôs in, naming a state a city, confusing his sister for his wife, calling himself the husband of joe Biden etc. especially since he reads from a prompter,while only 15 minutes a week
‚ÄúCrimAte clisis‚Äù Joe Biden lol
Obama killed manufacturing by taxing and regulating it out. It has not recovered. This virus has killed much of the tourist industry. There will be a full fledged commie runing this country not Biden. This will take our nation down for the count. China is complicit with them.
This isn‚Äôt the ideal answer, but it‚Äôs the honest truth. The post popular thing about Biden‚Äîamong lifelong ardent progressives &amp; evangelical conservatives alike‚Äîis that he is the opposite of Trump.
Fuck Joe Biden
Almost as though a healthy America, free of the virus called Covid19, would present a problem for the Democratic nominee Joe Biden?How truly sick are these people, my gosh? The 2M estimate of COVID19  deaths early on was probably wishful thinking by the Democrats. All for power.
Someone told me Biden stands for.. Best Idiot Democrats Ever Nominated.  Ouch. Id vote for you Tommy Chong with cheech as your vice pres.
Biden might actually help some down ballot candidates here (Horn/Broyles/etc.) - arguably the first Pres candidate since Gore? Clinton? to do so.  Obama was dynamic, but üò¨ not sure Oklahoma was gonna bend much for him.
A vote for Biden is like voting for a toad, but the toad probably has more on the ball. A broken candidate for a broken Party... perfect.
You and Trump appear to be the only ones confused on VP Biden's position on police defunding. Spreading misinformation is NOT PATRIOTIC.
Let‚Äôs don‚Äôt get cocky, my peeps. This cannot be close. It has to be a landslide. We must recruit, we must be sure other Biden voters have a ride, and we have to VOTE!!
I‚Äôd bet on trump over biden getting the ball to the plate .
should  be allowed on the debate stage with Trump and biden? #everyvotecounts
Oh he‚Äôs a democrat and he using corona to stop a debate so dementia Biden doesn‚Äôt have to talk
BIPARTISAN says the man who told his Republican Constituents their most important job was to make Obama one term.BIPARTISAN says the man who said he WILL block any Legislation from a Biden administration. VOTE THIS HIPOCRITE OUT!
Biden apparently refuses interview with Chris Wallace on FOX!!!
After all James, most of these simpletons would vote for a yellow dog right? So Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt seem so bad to them. Saying Dems have low standards doesn‚Äôt describe what voting for Biden would be.
Democrats burning down a City run by Democrats. Do you recall  Pelosi or Biden condemning such actions? Remember that on Nov 3rd, or a riot is coming to your town too.
Remember the 2M plus experts predicted would die from Covid-19 in the US early on? That was referring to the number if Joe Biden was President.Clueless Joe criticized DT for stopping flights from China on 1/31. No telling how many more infected Chinese he would had let in the US.
If joe Biden believes women were equal, he would allow the Delaware university to do a search inquiry on Tara Reade‚Äôs name! He doesn‚Äôt believe all women! I understand that if he‚Äôs innocent he shouldn‚Äôt believe her but if I were innocent, I‚Äôd allow them to do a search for her name
Biden should say "No taxes, no debate."    Would refocus on Trump's corruption.
That‚Äôs not racist, that‚Äôs people making fun of Biden‚Äôs absurd comment to the black community: ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote for Trump....I mean, what kind of crap is that???
Along with the financial impacts of Trump's impetuous decisions, there are political ones.  ‚ÄúIf Joe Biden wins North Carolina, Trump gets his ass kicked all across the country,‚Äù one state Republican official told NBC News.
Save our money Melania. You‚Äôll be gone in a few months. Dr. Biden will over see that job
Do we have to keep watching Joe Biden campaign ads?
Nadler is as brain dead as Biden! WTH?
Biden camp scared.... they know he‚Äôs out of his mind
Biden needs to take them on this.  Not Carlson.  Not Hannity.  Wallace has integrity.  Biden should jump at this.
Silver is up more than 5%, bringing the gains over the last three months to 57%. This is likely due to inflation concerns regarding another possible stimulus package and a spike in demand if Joe Biden wins in November, which appears very likely. $XAGUSD #Silver

Joe Biden is extreme enough
Yes, you did your duty and served honorably, sir. When President Biden is in office, I hope you will reconsider your resignation. Our country needs more true patriots, as you have proved yourself to be, many times over.
Even as a Biden supporter I am repulsed by this image
Our loved ones are dying without us, their bodies put in cold trucks or being triaged to their homes to die because hospitals need the bed. And MITCH MCCONNELL IS, WITH A SMIRK, PROMISING TO KEEP GOVERMENT IN GRIDLOCK IF BIDEN WINS. THIS IS THE FACE OF REPUBLICAN PRIORITY.
Biden team lies.... that is exactly what their doing destroying our country!!!!
Please remember the "Silent majority" is code for Russian and foreign interference! We must be prepared for this code word when the polls appears to be overwhelming for Biden but some home Trump still pulls off an electoral college win.. A cheater will cheat and Trumps a cheater
Hate to break it to you but Hilary, Obama, and Biden are not very popular in the leftist world. Obama is OK at best. Most of them are not enthused about his war crimes.
"comrade Biden" lol Classic case of "call every democrat a socialist but have no idea how to react when meeting a real one".  No contemporary Republican or Democrat would think he is politically extreme. He was a Republican in all but name for most of his political life.
Am I the only one that has a 12 year old living in my mind and could not stop laughing after reading, ‚ÄúI could beat Biden off...‚Äù üòÇüò¨ #NoShame #MaybeALittle
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU.  AGAIN.
Unlike Trump, Biden can do both because he will be able to delegate issues to his professional staff. We have lost enough time dealing with Trump issues. Let the DAs and federal prosecutors take care of Trump.
Guys, there‚Äôs a lot of moderate, fringe, borderline voters out there.  I know that pointing out how awful Biden be is fun, woke, and very VERY easy, but PLEASE PLEASE wait until after the election.

If, by some strange coincidence, Biden wins, Nov 5 surge ends.
This is my actual fear, the polls are correct, there is over whelming support for Joe Biden,  everyone gets out and votes for Joe Biden, he wins the popular vote by 5 million votes but trump some how pulls off an electoral win and claims it is the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù. Russia cheats
You state this while Biden has adopted much of Bernie and Warren‚Äôs socialist policies in his platform, so I disagree.  Today‚Äôs Republicans and Democrats couldn‚Äôt be farther apart in ideology. Trump has moved GOP to the right. Biden moving Dems left. Bernie is happy with Biden now

From 2018:  And A Homeless Veteran Have A Very Human Moment
If Biden wasn‚Äôt controllable, the DNC would have undermined his campaign like they did Bernie‚Äôs  in 2016. Fact.
Not one thing you listed here about Joe Biden is accurate. He is a career political hack who‚Äôs landmark legislation was a crime bill that jailed hundreds of thousands of blacks needlessly.He is corrupt to the core, became a multi-millionaire as a public servant. Has mod dementia
That interview with him &amp; Ady Barkan made me so upset for Ady; Biden was unsympathetic to the suffering of people who struggle even with "good" insurance to get the treatment &amp; meds they need for a stable life. We need better, but all he wants to do is tweak the ACA a little üòî
People are smarter than their elected representatives
These would not be inconsistent with National polling trends. That's probably about as blue as OK-1 can get. OK-5 is a wild world, so who knows there? Some feeling that the Biden number there could even grow if trends don't change soon.
We had the top-line of some credible internal polling shared with us yesterday. While we don't have the crosstabs to show you, we saw:  OK-5: Biden 51% (+11 from 2016), Trump 46% (-7 from 2016)  OK-1: Trump 55% (-6), Biden 41% (+8)
WOW! Joe Biden Says It‚Äôs Wrong to Hold China Accountable Because Americans Can‚Äôt Distinguish Between ‚Äúa South Korean and Someone From Beijing‚Äù
Latest Joe Biden campaign ad.
Nah they would still have hypothetical polls of him vs Biden and he would still be losing in those.
Another story on Trump, while ignoring Biden who can‚Äôt tell what year this is.  More overt bias from Joe the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù.
If we can legalize weed, we can elect Biden.
Calling all suburban soccer moms, you vote for Biden and your neighborhood will turn into one big crime scene. Wake up, now.
Like... BIDEN has been doing and receiving no end of grief?
Let‚Äôs see Biden debate Trump! Bet he won‚Äôt!
But Biden can‚Äôt!
Biden can‚Äôt even complete a sentence lol good luck with that!
JW, I would like to see you continue to confront the other JW in his refusal to address questions during the FIVE. He sounds more like a campaign manager when he plays the perfect democrat he is now deflecting when asked specific questions regarding Biden and Dems
Wait, but Trump is our first racist Prez .  Biden also plans to have physicians at the polling places.
Biden not debates yet....
#VOTE to deliver an overwhelming margin for Biden so Trump cannot challenge the results with any legitimacy.
I know Biden is not one to pull this kind of crap, but if Trump goes after his son, I'd say Trump's offspring is fair game. Especially those who "work" in the Oval Office and I'm counting Jr. and Eric as part of that team. GOP might want to think twice before going after Hunter.
Lots of people we've spoken to have compared Trump and Biden in way that they would compare arsenic and almonds. They both really taste the same, but only one of them will kill you.
Also, have we forgotten about the whole Hunter Biden B.S. from Ron Johnson? They're going to be mining that for material in the months to come, yet we are focused on protesting? What's to stop these paramilitary people from interfering with our elections, in the name of "safety"?
Your theory is bullshit, and you know it. Trump and the GOP will weaponize ANYTHING they can get their hands on, and if they can't they make it up anyway. They're already calling Biden a socialist, so why do we always have to live in fear of their ads? 1/2
Our simplified model update for 7/23:  Pres: Trump 57%, Biden 40% US Sen: Inhofe 56%, Broyles 44% OK-1: Hern 58%, Asamoa-Caesar 42% OK-4: Cole 61%, Brannon 39% OK-5: Horn 53%, Neese 47%
Biden is an imbecile and that makes him a very dangerous person.
All of this is to say that while Biden winning the burbs does little for the Pres race in Okla, it creates all kinds of down ballot problems for the GOP. If trends hold, expect many Okla Co GOPers to buck Neese's hug Trump approach, and cut their own path to save themselves (4/4)
Biden at even +3 to 5 would be a sea change in Okla Co, as, unlike in many years past, Dems have done a good job with good candidates in County wide races. Sheriff, Dist 2, Clerk, Court Clerk are all within reach, as well, a few OK House and Senate seats. (3/4)
This is a gut check for - especially Okla Co - Republicans. They can feel confident about seats elsewhere, but Okla Co is probably polling at somewhere near Biden +5 to 7. We don't have a poll to show you, but from info we continue to glean from campaigns, this is plausible (2/4)
Folks, quick thread here... it's easy to get caught up in generic "suburb" numbers, but the trick is in the demographics. If you believe the national (not state) polls, Biden is smashing Trump in the traditional suburban demos. Even the traditional suburban Okla demos. (1/4)
No need for Biden to run ads when his opponents is making them for him.
If anything could convince me to not bother voting it would be people going "settle for Biden" for the next six fucking months
does biden have a brain?
Excuse me, I'm sure that it was Trump, NOT BIDEN, wishing a pedophile (Maxwell) well. I can't seem to locate one picture of Biden with Maxwell, but there's plenty of photos with Trump, Melania, Epstein, and Maxwell.Is the convention in the in the Biden basement ? Asking for a friend.
So what you're saying is the pandemic is a Democrat plot to make Trump look bad, and Joe Biden knew about it in October because Obama developed it to help keep the Democrats in power?  WAKE UP PEOPLE! THE TRUTH IS STARING YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE!  #TheTruthIsIMadeAllThatUpJustNow
I honestly can‚Äôt see you voting for bidenüò¢üò¢... that won‚Äôt be a biden presidency and you know that.
That‚Äôs His handlers biden is already in bed
Keep thinking Biden is going to win. Lol
Trump could literally bring world peace and people would still criticize him. I find it unbelievable that y‚Äôall are so fixed on this bullshit narrative that Trump is the fucking antichrist. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is/who he is.
Not well. It ended early. I cried on the way home. But, I‚Äôm okay with it. I spoke the truth. And, I think the Waffler will vote Biden. It‚Äôs just sad. Why are Trumpers so ANGRY?

Holy God in Heaven!! BIDEN is creepy?? Yeah, don‚Äôt vote. Just stay home.
Biden not debates yet....
Because the only people that want Biden or people to watch CNNWell crap.  Trump‚Äôs coronavirus policy is failing in Australia.  What would Biden do?
Let‚Äôs see if Biden‚Äôs explanation is even half as entertaining as Trump‚Äôs.
Biden cannot put together a simple statement, Your next President? Do you actually think this career political hack can function as leader of the free world? Not hardly!
I haven't danced in years! But, I am developing my own "HAPPY DANCE" that I will perform on two occasions.  When BIDEN is elected &amp; when TRUMP is imprisoned! If you have one already please let me see it...I need ideas!
You don‚Äôt really believe that do you? I mean, I get you‚Äôre voting against Trump. But...you don‚Äôt *really* think Biden will be a good President do you? (I predict you‚Äôll say better than Trump, but there‚Äôs definitely a difference in voting for someone &amp; voting against someone.)
If Trump wins in 2020, there won't be a United States left in 2024. The people ( well, except for the crazies who wouldn't know crap from chocolate) are beginning to wise up to this snake-oil salesman. I would, as a Republican, rather have Joe Biden than Cadet Bonespurs in office
