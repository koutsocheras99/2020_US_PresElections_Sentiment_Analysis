Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump. Trump's trade deals will mean trillions of future dollars to the US. Just one more reason we must re-elect President Trump.
MSNBC warns Republicans will criticize Joe Biden's running mate, which is mean or something I guess
and #LeningradLindsey  are using Russian disinformation to try to smear Joe Biden. This is happening in their Senate Committes. Just think about that for a minute. US senators are helping Russia undermine our democracy. #TraitorsInUSSenate

Geez Biden keep showing his ass to the only constituent group who backed his nomination üò§
Joe Biden smear ads make him seem like a way better candidate than he actually is.
Correction: Biden's PR people tweeted out something to try to do damage control.  If anyone believes that was Biden tweeting, I've got a bridge in San Francisco that I'm trying to sell at a great price.    via
Do you think all the libs that support legalization of weed are going to support her, after she prosecuted hundreds and then bragged about smoking it herself? Oh, and the clips of her attacking Biden at the dem debates are going to be great for the Trump ads. This for a start.
Anyone out there that didn‚Äôt understand what Joe Biden was saying is an idiot and probably doesn‚Äôt need to be voting in the first place...
Yes, they may be conservative democrats, but they still vote democrat. I have many Indian neighbors and they plan on voting for Biden.
I don't want ANYONE knocking on my door. I'm voting for Biden
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
Yeah, sure. I heard Biden say in his typical dull witted way, that prosecuting Trump after he leaves office could be seen as  political revenge and a threat to Democracy. What he's really saying is it's politically destructive to him.
When trump goes on CNN, MSNBC, YOUTUBE, TOWN HALLS, PODCASTS, CBS, and all others Biden has done
I am black and i will be voting for Biden. Thank you.
They'll be running the country if Joe Biden is elected.
If Biden wins, BLM  and ANTIFA  will be running the country, and the Constitution will no longer exist.
‚ÄúIf you are have trouble deciding whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù -Joe Biden
No, he clearly talks now and always have down to that community. That is the very definition of a racists. Biden trues to act woke and cool to pretend he‚Äôs engrained within that community so it gives him a pass to say these things. To allow that is to enable a racists.
Cant wait to hear the content for the next 4 years.    Anybody comment on the racist remarks Biden made yesterday or does that not fit your narrative?
I‚Äôm gonna keep saying this til I‚Äôm blue in the face‚ÄîUse Biden as a stepping stone for radical change the same way he has used POC as a stepping stone for his political gain.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!
Biden's winning, the conditions are ripe for a change election, but the campaign still hasn't really started yet. Buckle your seatbelts.  The Man Who Wasn‚Äôt There
Tbh Dems can take black voters for granted. Biden will get 90% of black voters minimum.
So wait, is Trump suggesting Biden is more powerful that God?
As of right now . Even Fox News says if Biden refuses to debate Trump . Trump will lose the election . It does not look good for us at all .
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
You know I never thought of that. I think he should run on that. Maybe he can blame Biden for COVID.  Biden made it in a lab and presto he did it. Yes and he did this at a Pizza place.
You know these are not Biden's words of apology bc he doesn't use the phrase "Man, you know..."
Wait, have you literally not listened to Biden this week. Good Gawd his almost gone.
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
Now do Biden‚Äôs zooms.
Joe Biden has the mindset of a Plantation Owner! How anybody can vote for him is inconceivable. He would confuse Russian people with Chinese people. So sad to watch this happen in real time!
If Biden wrote that, I wrote the Gettysburg Address.
They are digging their hole. They don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs all virtue signaling. Biden days y‚Äôall all think the same. He‚Äôs right with Pro sports.
Joe Biden: I‚Äôm racist.   Also Joe Biden: My handlers swear I‚Äôm not racist.
This logic makes my head hurt. Voting for the Lib doesn't take it away from Trump unless you were going to vote for him in the first place. It definitely doesn't give the vote to Biden, it gives it to the Lib. It's the equivalent of not voting at all, except you make a statement.
But it practically means a Biden socialist government with higher taxes, more regulation, and eventual Venezuelan style bread lines.  Just admit your a RINO!
Will be interesting to see how long Biden‚Äôs coattails are. Seeing this A LOT
What makes you think there will be a debate? Biden is being urged to not debate.  If you can't handle the debate stage, what makes you think you can handle the world stage?
Like Biden starting a race war with his own base?  Like that behavior?
Joe Biden is a racist.
"Harris isn't as good a campaigner as people think, so Biden should pick someone who has never campaigned for elected office." It's a take, I guess.
If Biden were an actual "practicing Roman Catholic"  would be calling for his crucifixion.
Trump humiliated his religious followers, especially Catholics, by insinuating they are stupid enough to think that Biden will hurt God. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Repugs put the final nail in their coffin by rushing to get Kanye on the ballot, implying black folks would vote for him cos he‚Äôs black.
At least he noticed, and corrected it. Biden would keep saying it wrong to convince you, that you‚Äôre wrong.
After Biden‚Äôs comments the past two days, she‚Äôs got the wrong dude. Biden‚Äôs alwYs been racist. He just thinks he‚Äôs woke enough to be one of them. Good luck with this racists AF cat.
We need the debates so we can honestly look at where Biden is at. That way we go into a Biden presidency eyes wide open.
With Biden you get the far left agenda and a senile old coot.
Biden couldn‚Äôt get 1% of the vote the last 2 times he ran for president!  You  libs are gonna cry worse than you did in 2016!!!
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.
Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic will hurt God says this guyüëáüèº
Apparently bein Hunter Biden also makes you a junkieü§´
We have 5 members of SCOTUS who were born and educated in Catholic schools. All are conservatives and vote that way. Yet you decide to point to Biden's Catholicism?
Do you ever quit?  Relentless criticism. Has Biden uttered a coherent sentence today?
Biden‚Äôs has 6 less chins and normal sized pupils for starters.
OMG. When are MAGAs going to figure out their hero is Jim Jones  5 till midnight. Whatever cookies he had are gone. BTW, Joe  Biden is a lifelong Catholic.
If Joe Biden wins the election, BLM and ANTIFA will be running the country.
every time i hear one of the trumps call biden "sleepy joe" it reminds me of a kindergartener making fun of the kid who actually sleeps during nap time üò¥
If she cared about racism, she‚Äôd denounce Biden‚Äôs past 2 days of comments.
No. They DON'T. It's just a tactic  Because if Joe says no, they will say Biden is afraid to debate trump
You actually know Joe Biden personally and have had a window to his soul. What‚Äôs wrong with YOU!? Put your party aside and show some fucking loyalty to someone who‚Äôs been nothing but loyal to your family. Shame on you.
Anyone think they‚Äôd let Biden drive a car?
Biden just needs to run ads with him and prominent 80‚Äôs tv vehicles. Kit, Airwolf, A-Team Van, Magnum PI car, Chips motorcycle
They say laughter is the best medicine, I think this is Joe Biden's "improvement" to Obamacare. To his credit, it's a top tier bit.
Biden is just getting warmed up. Wait til the 70‚Äôs Biden really gets cranked up.
Y‚Äôall better start covering Biden‚Äôs last 2 racists days. Unreal over there.
I want just one dem, with a straight face, to tell me that they honestly believe Biden is writing these tweets.
Yet Biden just keeps throwing POC gaffes right and left.
You‚Äôre triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
She contradicted previous testimony, meaning she lied. She also lied to cover for Biden's role. And she, thankfully, rolled Comey under the bus. This ain't over, and you know it. The truth will be brought to light.
Have you watched Biden at all?  Its just mean to keep him around. He needs to live out his days fiahing or whatever. He's done.
No matter your color, race, sexual preference or gender preference a vote for Joe Biden will ruin your grandchildren‚Äôs future. Think about the ramifications of what the Democrats are proposing for our country... DON‚ÄôT BE STUPID!
If Biden had that control, he himself wouldn‚Äôt be quarantined in his own basement
If Biden wins, the Constitution will be shredded, and BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in America, second only to the US military.
If Joe Biden wins the election, BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in the country, second only to the Military. BLM already owns the riot cities and professional sports. They are extorting money from Cuban restaurants in Miami. That will only spread.
I‚Äôm not a Trump fan. He‚Äôs an idiot. Not as big as an idiot as Biden, but an idiot. How does mask data not mean anything? If masks are the key to other countries success, and we wear them more, how does that work?

As a voter, I would love to see a presidential debate.    Biden vs Trump!   Who says we can‚Äôt enjoy the process to it fullest!  As a populous, are we not worthy of seeing our potential leader‚Äôs dialect and exchange? #timetodebate
Biden was not president and didn't withhold ANYTHING, neither did obama
Everyone in the public eye has ‚Äúnegatives‚Äù of some kind. There are always those who find something to pick at. Not endorsing either Harris or Rice, I truly don‚Äôt care. Biden has my vote if he picks a dauchshound. Trump must go!
Yet, Biden can‚Äôt speak. But sure, ok guys.
Exactly. Time to dump  for not prepping Biden with this perfect response and hire a real street fighter.
The American Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden.. can we just do it normally so both sides have one less reason to bitch and complain?
We need Joe Biden more than anything NOW
At the last minute, President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, are searching for places to impressively yet safely accept their parties' presidential nominations as the spread of the coronavirus adds uncertainty to the campaigns.
got a video idea for you. Mash up Biden‚Äôs video with the corvette and trump in play drive the semi-truck
No one is dragging ANYTHING. Biden agreed to debates long ago. Quit with the Fox crap
You guys are trying everything you can to get Biden out of the debates, aren't you? Hey, we've seen him talk. We don't blame you.
The media's takeaway: Don't ask Biden any more questions like this. Just pelt him with cotton balls.
I'm sure he will give you a free signed copy of his new book. I love seeing you on all the Fox shows Makes my heart sing!! Thank your 4 telling the truth about dems today- Biden, Kamala Harris etc &amp; that dems do not have the best interests of the Americans people at heart today
The people who believe Joe Biden is hiding need to be shown proof of his activity, otherwise they will believe Fox‚Äôs lies. I would be showing Joe walking down a long ramp, climbing a tree, climbing a ladder, a utility pole, etc., all with running commentary. Why do we do nothing?
I guess the rumors that Biden would pick Karen were ... off-Bass.  I will see myself out.
And this isn‚Äôt the first time they have used images of Biden praying or in quiet contemplation to infer that he is sleepy or lacks stamina. It is SOP for the Trump team.
As I've been predicting, there will be no debates. Again, Biden will back out but his camp will blame Trump. Or COVID. Or both. It really doesn't matter. And the media will play along. They will NOT question Biden's mental capacity. The Great Silence.
Yes. We have no choice. If Biden is elected your freedom goes out the window
Yet Biden does another disaster of an interview.

Democrats are exploiting Biden.  They know he has dementia and they continue supporting him.  So sad

You have to be at least 150 feet away from any building where voting takes place. That includes wearing a Trump or Biden shirt or hat. Otherwise, I don't think they can keep you away. Same rule applies to weapons.
Did Joe Biden write that tweet?
It‚Äôs hard to believe anyone at this point but vote Biden.
No you have no clue how we think and that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre mind is closed to facts and truth. You‚Äôre candidate is suffering from dementia. There‚Äôs no way he should be president of anything. Name one thing Biden has accomplished in his 50 yrs in office!
This will be epic. We need a drinking game. Shot every time Biden can't remember something?
I‚Äôm sure they will book Biden so they can ask him his favorite color.
DTJ, Biden can barley put a coherent sentence together, of course they don‚Äôt want debates. The DNC should face jail time for elder abuse! I sure hope reasonable people will see what‚Äôs going on and vote Trump 2020. May God Bless America!
Just got back from traveling around the west-no Biden signs anywhere. But Trump signs EVERYWHERE!! Cars, trucks, shirts, flags, billboards and even a mask or two.

Everything that people see so clearly about Biden, you keep accusing Trump of. It must be nice to have followers who are dumb enough to believe you.
It's the latest thing. Get Biden out of the debates but try to make it look like Trump's fault.

I've already got this Tweet saved, so when it is announced that Biden won't be debating, and you take this down, it will still be all over Twitter World.

Joe Biden needs new advisors. You would be a great choice.
Joe biden couldn't debate a grape. He can't have a conversation. He can't even say a sentence clearly. He can't even read a teleprompter without help.  His seat in office has been for sale the last 4 decades. The Communist party is trying one last time but he's all used up.
Yes -- great point and that's a likely scenario as well. Constitutionally, there would be nothing to stop Biden from resigning the day after the election. That's highly possible. In fact, it might be the most logical scenario.
Bait and switch. Joe Biden won‚Äôt be the nominee.
Just look it up. Obama became the presumptive nominee in early June 2008 when Clinton finally dropped out so that‚Äôs a little more than 2 1/2 months to the VP pick. Bernie dropped out in early April so it will have been more than 4 months before Biden announces a VP pick
But when was it clear in 2008 that Obama would be the nominee versus when it became clear Biden would be the nominee this year. Keep in mind Clinton drug out the primary process for a while 12 years ago. Biden has clearly been the nominee for like 4 months now
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt running for office. He is simply a placeholder for Planned Chaos so Pelosi to step up once ballots aren‚Äôt counted.

For decades, China has been paying off members of Congress (Feinstein), industry, education. When Obama came into office, the number of people being paid off grew (Biden, for one). The trickle became a flood.  Cut off the money, prosecute those bought - END this problem!!
He could've promoted mask wearing instead of criticizing Biden and saying wearing a mask looks weak. Now there are all kinds of crazies out there hurting people and even killing because they say their rights are infringed on. That's crap and is DANGEROUS
Biden VP pick announcement not likely this week: source  #FoxNews
TI got rich misleading poor uneducated minorities. Telling them they could never make the money he made off of capitalism. Rap music has been controlling the minds of youth and adult minorities for decade's. That's why Biden said "or u ain't black" they are used to this criteria
Public relations, ad campaigns and legal battles cost money. The billionaires are not contributing, they're investing. This is the corruption that is rotting our democracy. Do you think Biden will fight it, or was Sanders a better choice?
I'm still willing to bet you that it is Biden who doesn't show up to the debates. Why won't you respond?
I still say Biden's main handler is Obama.
Somebody else is behind this. Biden is incapable of thinking this much. I suspect it's Obama.

Why the hell do right-wingers continue to beat the 'defund police' drums when there's no actual proof Biden said that??
No. We are not Marxist. We are not communist. If we are accused of being racist cause we support Trump, then every Biden supporter is a Marxist.
Best as for Biden yet!  Keep ‚Äòem coming Donny Boy!
Biden needs to just go ahead and pick a running mate already. He was effusively the nominee in late March/early April. It‚Äôs August now and he still hasn‚Äôt named his running mate and there are reports that he may delay the announcement by another week
If Pelosi/Biden/Schumer cave on this they should burn their Democratic Party card.  An election is coming up, they have the hammer. GOP can't force anything but taxpayer relief/ All they have to do is say no, and state their case.
If she can't even own the position on her website, I have zero confidence that she would fight for it. I am not expecting Biden to nominate a progressive anyway, but I'm not going to get excited about Karen Bass.

wom-IX-n"? Would think that if Lockhart is right, that Trump will only lie, then it would be to Joe's advantage to debate him. The media would spend until the election all of Trump's lies and Joe's honesty. Win for Joe! But, Trump won't  have to lie to beat Biden.
CNN analyst Harry Enten explains recent polling that shows some historically Republican states could be more competitive leading into the 2020 presidential election, and other factors that could make President Donald Trump's reelection challenging.
I'm guessing you're talking about her deplorables remark. The real 'deplorables' are those politicians like HRC, Biden, Trump, McConnell, etc who take cash from vested interests in exchange for bill support. That's not left or right, it's bribery.
There won‚Äôt be any debates. As I‚Äôve previously pointed out, Biden isnt in full possession of his mental faculties and is no condition to debate Trump. Biden can‚Äôt even walk and talk in public without a minder and physical assistance.
He‚Äôs terrified of Biden?
Please take time to set aside and address each issue. the media is driving the narrative- it‚Äôs time our country stands up against media bs.  Your campaign needs to focus on ur positives, the country, yes Biden has dementia but this is about Trump vision 2020.
If ANY of that was true, it should be to Biden's advantage. MSM would have a field day exposing Trump's "lies". Problem is, Trump doesn't need to lie to make Joe look bad. The left is just trying to find an excuse not to debate because they know Joe will look foolish!
If Biden wins you will never here about this again!
Trump loves freedom...Biden loves government.  Period!!!
Did Biden sanction the Bible burning rally in Portland?
Weird how her favorability and approval ratings with Black voters have  jumped since April.
You will have an amazing next chapter in your career in the Biden Administration.
Joe Biden had 5 deferments. 4 student deferments. After graduating he received 1 from Selective Service classifying him unavailable for service due to asthma as a teenager. His memoir, Promises Kept, he talked about his active childhood. Football/lifeguard. No mention of asthma.
If Biden is unlikely to run for a second term, the criteria should be 1) do no harm in this election, and 2) be a credible frontrunner ready to grab the torch in 2024. To me, that's Kamala Harris.
I‚Äôll give you this, a Biden presidency will be hilarious. We‚Äôd have a hawk of a Republican in another 4.
Trump is the ONLYoption to do the job.  Biden is an incompetent minion.  Can only read off a prompter and doesn‚Äôt have an original thought.
I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm excited by someone who doesn‚Äôt want the presidency. Biden indicated he plans to be a one-term President.

...But Trump has apparently agreed as well.
I didn‚Äôt remember hearing this but you‚Äôre right as far as Biden goes...
Trump should adopt the Biden strategy. I was planning to vote third party but the more I hear Trump talk the closer I come to voting Biden as a matter of national security (by mail of course).

I have seen a good number of Trump signs and bumper stickers this year. I have seen 0 Biden anything. I feel there is no fire in the Biden campaign. I guess it‚Äôs basically an Anti-Trump vote in November. Sad for Democrats that they can‚Äôt nominate a person to rally behind.
Yeah, it just irked me. I'm over it.

F*** you, Joe Biden
Yes. Alternating between suggesting that Biden is a corrupt socialist despot-to-be and a dementia patient.
Biden has been a politician for how many years? But all the United States problems are because of Trump now? It‚Äôs ridiculous. He was in a lose-lose with the Coronavirus. And please tell me you think Biden is of the right mind to be president? Can the Democrats not find better?

Yes, they may be conservative democrats, but they still vote democrat. I have many Indian neighbors and they plan on voting for Biden.
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Biden has Woodrow Wilson look
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!

No, he clearly talks now and always have down to that community. That is the very definition of a racists. Biden trues to act woke and cool to pretend he‚Äôs engrained within that community so it gives him a pass to say these things. To allow that is to enable a racists.

Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!

Tbh Dems can take black voters for granted. Biden will get 90% of black voters minimum.
So wait, is Trump suggesting Biden is more powerful that God?
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
You know I never thought of that. I think he should run on that. Maybe he can blame Biden for COVID.  Biden made it in a lab and presto he did it. Yes and he did this at a Pizza place.
You know these are not Biden's words of apology bc he doesn't use the phrase "Man, you know..."
Wait, have you literally not listened to Biden this week. Good Gawd his almost gone.
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
Now do Biden‚Äôs zooms.
Joe Biden has the mindset of a Plantation Owner! How anybody can vote for him is inconceivable. He would confuse Russian people with Chinese people. So sad to watch this happen in real time!

You‚Äôre triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
She contradicted previous testimony, meaning she lied. She also lied to cover for Biden's role. And she, thankfully, rolled Comey under the bus. This ain't over, and you know it. The truth will be brought to light.
Have you watched Biden at all?  Its just mean to keep him around. He needs to live out his days fiahing or whatever. He's done.
No matter your color, race, sexual preference or gender preference a vote for Joe Biden will ruin your grandchildren‚Äôs future. Think about the ramifications of what the Democrats are proposing for our country... DON‚ÄôT BE STUPID!
If Biden had that control, he himself wouldn‚Äôt be quarantined in his own basement
If Biden wins, the Constitution will be shredded, and BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in America, second only to the US military.
If Joe Biden wins the election, BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in the country, second only to the Military. BLM already owns the riot cities and professional sports. They are extorting money from Cuban restaurants in Miami. That will only spread.
I‚Äôm not a Trump fan. He‚Äôs an idiot. Not as big as an idiot as Biden, but an idiot. How does mask data not mean anything? If masks are the key to other countries success, and we wear them more, how does that work?

I guess the rumors that Biden would pick Karen were ... off-Bass.  I will see myself out.
And this isn‚Äôt the first time they have used images of Biden praying or in quiet contemplation to infer that he is sleepy or lacks stamina. It is SOP for the Trump team.

No you have no clue how we think and that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre mind is closed to facts and truth. You‚Äôre candidate is suffering from dementia. There‚Äôs no way he should be president of anything. Name one thing Biden has accomplished in his 50 yrs in office!
I‚Äôm sure they will book Biden so they can ask him his favorite color.

Same way some ppl listen to Biden and believe he is competent to lead the country. That is whenever he emerges from his basement to which he quickly returns.
Sounds like Joe Biden a wee bit does he?
I've already got this Tweet saved, so when it is announced that Biden won't be debating, and you take this down, it will still be all over Twitter World.
Then no reason Biden shouldn't do an interview with Wallace, right?
Joe Biden needs new advisors. You would be a great choice.
Joe biden couldn't debate a grape. He can't have a conversation. He can't even say a sentence clearly. He can't even read a teleprompter without help.  His seat in office has been for sale the last 4 decades. The Communist party is trying one last time but he's all used up.
Just look it up. Obama became the presumptive nominee in early June 2008 when Clinton finally dropped out so that‚Äôs a little more than 2 1/2 months to the VP pick. Bernie dropped out in early April so it will have been more than 4 months before Biden announces a VP pick
But when was it clear in 2008 that Obama would be the nominee versus when it became clear Biden would be the nominee this year. Keep in mind Clinton drug out the primary process for a while 12 years ago. Biden has clearly been the nominee for like 4 months now
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt running for office. He is simply a placeholder for Planned Chaos so Pelosi to step up once ballots aren‚Äôt counted.

TI got rich misleading poor uneducated minorities. Telling them they could never make the money he made off of capitalism. Rap music has been controlling the minds of youth and adult minorities for decade's. That's why Biden said "or u ain't black" they are used to this criteria
I'm still willing to bet you that it is Biden who doesn't show up to the debates. Why won't you respond?

If she can't even own the position on her website, I have zero confidence that she would fight for it. I am not expecting Biden to nominate a progressive anyway, but I'm not going to get excited about Karen Bass.

Ask Biden or Obama then comment you hideous liberal.
I use to think this but if after trump, BLM movement, Joe Biden nomination only winning 4/10 is rather alarming to me. At this point it‚Äôs a generational phase in for Dems at best
If we need the "best of the best" to run our country, how could Dems even consider Biden as a nominee, much less a "candidate"???????  #VoteGOP2020
I‚Äôm think Trump‚Äôs got some late-breaking surprises. After more than 4 years of persecution from the left at every turn, he‚Äôs bound to have plans to prevent their cheating with mail-in voter fraud. Also, I think Obama‚Äôs riding in to Biden‚Äôs rescue is a sign the Dems are worried.
Yeah. Vote for Biden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

wom-IX-n"? Would think that if Lockhart is right, that Trump will only lie, then it would be to Joe's advantage to debate him. The media would spend until the election all of Trump's lies and Joe's honesty. Win for Joe! But, Trump won't  have to lie to beat Biden.
He‚Äôs terrified of Biden?
Please take time to set aside and address each issue. the media is driving the narrative- it‚Äôs time our country stands up against media bs.  Your campaign needs to focus on ur positives, the country, yes Biden has dementia but this is about Trump vision 2020.
If ANY of that was true, it should be to Biden's advantage. MSM would have a field day exposing Trump's "lies". Problem is, Trump doesn't need to lie to make Joe look bad. The left is just trying to find an excuse not to debate because they know Joe will look foolish!
If Biden wins you will never here about this again!
Trump loves freedom...Biden loves government.  Period!!!
Did Biden sanction the Bible burning rally in Portland?
Weird how her favorability and approval ratings with Black voters have  jumped since April.

You will have an amazing next chapter in your career in the Biden Administration.
If Biden is unlikely to run for a second term, the criteria should be 1) do no harm in this election, and 2) be a credible frontrunner ready to grab the torch in 2024. To me, that's Kamala Harris.
I‚Äôll give you this, a Biden presidency will be hilarious. We‚Äôd have a hawk of a Republican in another 4.
Trump is the ONLYoption to do the job.  Biden is an incompetent minion.  Can only read off a prompter and doesn‚Äôt have an original thought.
I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm excited by someone who doesn‚Äôt want the presidency. Biden indicated he plans to be a one-term President. It would stand to reason, then, that is his V.P. would be natural candidate to lead the race in 2024. It needs to be someone who wants that job.

Biden has a terminal disease-dementia. He will not get better. He will have good days and bad days. Look at his video and pictures over the last 8 years. A child can see what Biden has.
With respect to the respective demographics and their voting habits, Joe Biden was right, and had no need to apologize.
I am not entirely convinced that when  said Biden is going to "hurt God", Trump wasn't talking about himself ü§®
Watch, biden self destruct before the election. He's one or two more stupid quotes away from blowing his chances.
Linguistically, this Team Obama mistake is almost definitely about how closely related Biden and Obama are in anyone's lexicon and not some slip where Biden is just a front for an Obama 3rd term. (And honestly, I don't know why Rs think it would be easier to run against Obama.)
The surprise is not when they do shady shit, but when these folks admit it--  Kanye West admits he's running a spoiler campaign to draw votes from Biden and see Trump reelected in bizarre interview
Because the Fed is throwing billions of $ into the market to keep it afloat. These are false highs. When Biden is elected the Fed will stop feeding Wall Street, the markets will crash (As they naturally should have months ago) &amp; the Repubs will blame the Dems
Kanye's behavior is officially garbage. That is all.

I‚Äôm pretty smart. My sons are very smart. We all agree Trump is very smart. They also both believe that they are smarter than Biden. So you need to wake up. Young people can see through your BS.
Biden will listen and forget two minutes later. He‚Äôs fried his brain.
Biden speaks from the heart. His frontal lobe dementia has destroyed his filter. He believes all Black Americans are alike.
I think  's assessment of the possibility of Trump refusing to leave office is essentially right EXCEPT a strong Biden victory might backfire. If Biden is too successful it could play into a "fake votes" narrative. Fox News' will decide how Trump does, not the GOP.
China has figured out Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer. But Trump scares China. They have no idea!!
Hispanics are not a racial group. They don‚Äôt vote as a block. So what exactly did Biden get wrong?
Trump was blessed with great genes. Biden does not have Trump‚Äôs work ethic or energy. Biden‚Äôs good genes of his youth are no longer expressed. He‚Äôs an old man, fading toward his finitude. No one can stop that.
I meant Xi. But Biden and Xi are the same.
That alone should be enough to elect Biden.
Xi could have killed 30 million Americans and a 100 million around the world. He had no idea how lethal his virus would be to the world. Horrific. And Pelosi and Schumer won‚Äôt investigate Biden.
The ability to admit mistakes and apologize for those mistakes is one of the most critical differences between Trump and Biden. He is nowhere close to perfect, but still is miles ahead in terms of caring for others. It is our job to hold Biden to these promises once elected.
Betty, I‚Äôm a physician. Trump has a great mind. Biden has a failing mind. Look at Biden videos over the last two years. Something is going on. Let‚Äôs see a cognitive test and EEG. Let‚Äôs inform the public; let‚Äôs bring this out into the light of day.

Disappointed but not surprised to see Biden‚Äôs apparent desire to ban ‚Äúassault weapons.‚Äù A national debate about firearms is fine and necessary but the tired ‚Äúweapons of war‚Äù rhetoric displays either ignorance or bad faith, both of which have no place in an honest conversation.

Biden is so much better than Trump so I'm Ridin with Biden. Biden's the better of two evils because Trump is the biggest evil.
Does Biden have Dementia? That question can be proven true or false. So how do we prove it? Biden has to submit to a cognitive exam. That‚Äôs all.
Poor Biden. There are a lot of people close to him that are very worried. Cognitive decline can come on like a Hurricane in September and leave Joe with pneumonia languishing in a long cold winter.

I'm not even religious nor am I for Biden but that's just crossing a line right there. That's lower than low. As November comes closer, a feeling of desperation becomes stronger. Fuck this clown. Not. My. President.
How can all these bible thumping idiots still support Tr*mp after that campaign? Using photos of Biden praying in an attempt to say he is mentally unable to do anything. Tr*mp keeps digging himself so deep into this hole it's pathetic, kindergarteners are smarter than him.
The only question is does Biden have Dementia. That question can be proven true or false. But Biden refuses to take a cognitive test. So how do we prove. It comes down to judgement. Let‚Äôs see more of Biden. Let us judge him. Unless he‚Äôs hiding something that should be easy.
Biden has lost his appetite. He‚Äôll go with Harris over Obama‚Äôs protest.
Biden could catch COVID. He‚Äôs going to get a lot of exposure soon. That would be a great twist if Trump helps to save Biden.
7,400 people die everyday in the US before COVID. Less have died in first two quarters of 2020 than the last two quarters of 2019. Most COVID deaths are in at risk elderly. Many sent to their deaths by Dem gov. Trump has saved our economy. Biden can‚Äôt go to Milwaukee. He‚Äôs over!

Biden‚Äôs best days are over. He‚Äôs living his last hour. His memory and executive functions are failing. Biden is hopeless. Dementia is a terminal disease. No cure. Let him live out his life in private in dignity.
Biden doesn‚Äôt like Jill anymore either. She can‚Äôt sit next to him during his interviews. Sad!
The left wants a pathway to power over Biden‚Äôs dead body.
Biden is extremely high risk for COVID. His age and dementia are complicating factors. If I were his doctor, I‚Äôd tell him to resign and give someone younger a chance. Enjoy your last hour of life, Joe. Prepare for your finitude. You‚Äôve been involved in politics for 50 years.

Also I wonder if Biden would have asked a white reporter the same question. I doubt it.
Biden has a strategy to hide. Let‚Äôs see how that works.
Biden got testy during an interview and refused to take a cognitive test. He compared a cognitive test to a urine drug screen. That defensiveness is what is called compensation for dementia. Very sad!
Denial is a powerful phenomenon. Look at Biden‚Äôs pictures over the last two years.
Trump has the best empirical mind of our time. He wakes up looking at COVID issues, numbers, vaccine results, world monetary data, jobs, interest rates, stocks, bonds, valuation, and Fed Reserve concerns. Biden wakes and asks where am I.
Biden has done little in his life. He‚Äôs an expert at finding excuses not to do something. He is an expert at excuses. But dementia undermines his efforts.
Biden attended a mass gathering at a funeral and looked fragile and senile. COVID is an excuse to keep him off the national stage. Dementia is a cruel disease. The truth will emerge. He got testy during an interview this morning. His handlers cut him off.
So Trump enacted criminal justice reforms, the felons should vote for Trump!  Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are responsible for locking them Up forever!
Biden is wasting away. Dementia is cruel. He‚Äôs afraid to travel to Milwaukee.  Biden cannot serve America in fear!   He‚Äôs fallen, and he can‚Äôt get up.
To be fair, Trump should be given the Debate questions this time around.  I‚Äôm positive Biden already has the questions and is being told what to say, as we tweet!

why didn‚Äôt you ask Jill Biden why she no longer appears with Joe in his interviews?
Eight days ago at Wilmington Delaware, he did not know where he was. He was Joe Biden‚Äôs wife a month ago. He announced that he was running for Senator several months ago. He has forgotten what state he was in twice. He‚Äôs old and forgetful vs demented.

Biden looks really bad. He‚Äôs not writing those tweets. These tweets are being looped back around to make it look like Biden is engaged.
The protestors believe their cause is to destroy America. No compromise or negotiation. They need to remove the police and then their mob can systematically rob, rape, and murder one community at a time. Biden &amp; the left will let it happen. ‚ÄúThey are mostly peaceful protestors.‚Äù
Rice is Obama‚Äôs operative. Obama knows that Biden can‚Äôt deal with the stress of the presidency.
Biden won‚Äôt last with this pressure. His team is faking interviews with candidates this week. He was supposed to announce this week. He was ready to announce K Harris. Now he‚Äôs faking interviews while waiting on Rice. This is the lying Democrats MO.
Biden is looking bad, really bad. He‚Äôs about ready to tap out. The left should throw in the towel.
Biden is wasting away. He‚Äôs not eating and unable to carry out activities of daily living. He needs 24/7 care. The left continues their suicide march with Biden. They‚Äôre all terminal, suffering fools. Go Trump! Go America! Security first!

More important: to remind people that Kate Brown, Ted Wheeler, and Joe Biden are also fascists who helped create and support Trump so that he could push to further increase state power.
Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer have agreed not to investigate Xi and China for exporting COVID to 194 countries. Why?
If a guy‚Äôs head is crushed and he doesn‚Äôt no where he is, he‚Äôs got a head injury. Biden doesn‚Äôt have a head injury. He has the stigmata of Dementia. And guess who put the Dem in Dementia?
Biden has plenty of appearances that provide plenty of material to examine. His decline is part of public record. The cause of his decline is under the broad category of dementia. No specific diagnoses given.
Biden has lost interest in Jill and screams out at night. Sad! Trump has the best empirical mind of our time. He represents the existentiality future freedom, security, equality, justice, and prosperity for all Americans. Biden wants to defund security which underpins everything.
More bad news about Biden‚Äôs deteriorating condition. Big decision for the Dems. Leaks are sinking their ship!
üö®BREAKING:  has finally named his VP!
Biden has a lot of reserve physically. But his mental reserve has exceeded his ability to cover his waning executive functions. If he is losing weight, the downward spiral will accelerate.
No one is giving up sources at the NYT do they suffer from bullshititus? Sounds like you‚Äôve been drinking. Get some coffee and watch the deterioration of Joe Biden over the last six months.
Biden is flawed. Obama knows he can‚Äôt do the job as president. Obama has intervened and is demanding Susan Rice as VP. Biden‚Äôs team wants to wait till after Susan Rice‚Äôs testimony before naming her.
Don‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs word. Look and see for yourself. Who do you trust? Do you trust your own senses? Check out Biden‚Äôs decline over the last year.
He‚Äôs being tested. They would announce if Biden was COVID positive.
My source is from inside Biden's camp security.
Watch Biden walk. Compare his pictures today with six months ago  and one year ago. Verify the obvious and consider the leaks. Self-evident truth needs no verification.
The greatest con on the American people is that the media uses old pictures and surrogates to create the phenomenology of a thriving Biden. He‚Äôs not available for comments. What‚Äôs he doing? What is he doing that is so important?
Biden is slowly sinking in the polls.  His campaign is becoming irrelevant as leaks about his deteriorating condition make there way to the public. The campaign must make a critical decision.
At this rate, only a miracle drop in COVID-19 cases and similarly miracle massive boost to economy can save him...  (... or a huge Biden scandal, but given his long-standing high profile, that is unlikely... not even sure his gaffes can do the trick at this stage)
Reiner‚Äôs arrogance highlights his fall. He used to be a talent, and now hate has reduced him to these stupid tweets. Biden is failing and his security staff is leaking. All the lies in the world cannot alter those facts. President Trump is America‚Äôs existentiality and future.
Biden is losing weight because he‚Äôs not eating. Dementia is blossoming. He doesn‚Äôt write his tweets, and he‚Äôs not making any Monday appearances. His staff is hiding him. But his security staff are leaking the poop on Biden.
Vote Red!  The Communist Party endorsed Biden.  Trump loves All Americans!
Biden will never preform unless someone else is pulling his strings.  Biden is a useful puppet.
The idea that if Joe Biden goes far enough right he can sway a bunch of Republican voters and THEN start doing progressive stuff is ridiculous. This is an idea with literally no merit. Politicians just cannot conceive of courting votes from anyone but white supremacists.
How is that landslide going to happen without all the people who have been totally alienated by Joe Biden? There millions more people further to the left who would come to the right policies than there are people who will ditch Trump if Biden gives up on progressive policy.
It‚Äôs plain to see, Biden is not fit to be President.  The Dems would drag him to the WH if he was taking his last breath.  The treatment Joe is getting, he doesn‚Äôt have a clue how he is being used.
Vote these hard left Socialist out forever, our lives, livelihoods &amp; children‚Äôs lives depend on it.  The Communist Party endorses Biden, all you need to know!
I laugh every time I see the Reagan/Biden commercial by "Midas Touch" I'll bet RINOS helped create it.
A blue Georgia is within our grasp -- but we have to fight harder than ever to make it happen.  Register to vote. Volunteer with your local party. If we all do our part, we can deliver a new future for our state. Are you ready to do the work?
By getting rid of you and Biden I‚Äôm down would be amazing for the us
Biden will soon lose the ability to decide for himself.
Yeah Biden's the one it's hard to take seriously
What do you say about the evidence for Trump‚Äôs mental issues and the possibility that he had a stroke? Biden may have issues but I‚Äôd trust the team around him more than the swamp Trump has around him.
Perhaps denial. Reportedly Biden has lost interest in his wife.
A great way to bring families out of denial is to get them to bring photos taken every 6 months over the last two years. That usually breaks through. The media should do that for America with Biden‚Äôs pictures.  That will shock people out of denial.
Biden surely will make himself a DNR with no feeding tube. Socrates would shake his head in disgust. No honor!
Biden could end up with a feeding tube. He should make a living will. Reporters should ask him if he has a living will. I would not want a feeding tube.
They would have never believed Monica without the Blue dress and Clinton‚Äôs reproductive DNA. The Dems will argue that Biden liked to touch women. He probably has lots of fingerprints with women‚Äôs DNA. Sad fact!
They found Biden‚Äôs fingerprint on one of his files in Delaware. Within Biden‚Äôs fingerprint, they found female DNA. They have requested samples from four female staffers that worked for Biden. Remember Tara Reade accused Biden of the greatest hand-rape in US history. Crazy times!
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me.‚Äù From the heart of Joe Biden ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you think. I‚Äôm voting for President Trump.‚Äù
The sources are inside Biden‚Äôs campaign. Reportedly part of his security team.
The Biden Conspiracy will make a great movie a couple of years from now. Inside Biden‚Äôs Bunker with hate-based left and the main stream media who support lying to keep the public from knowing the truth about Biden.
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me.‚Äù Joe Biden
You had me somewhat interested until somewhere around paragraph thirteen!    Opinion | Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates - The New York Times
Joe Biden has gotten angry with Jill calling her ugly names. So they have been afraid to put Jill on a set with Joe.
Biden is gone. He‚Äôs a puppet!
China already owns Biden.
The media is prohibited from any negative stories on Biden. Any reporter writing on Biden is scrutinized and censored.
Biden‚Äôs Dementia will become an embarrassment and he will disappear soon. The media won‚Äôt talk about him or their attempt to cover for him.
Yes. Barney Fife never got to become sheriff of Mayberry. Barney Biden . . .
Communist Party Leader Endorses Joe Biden for President  via
Biden is exhibit one of our evidence.
Biden could go on medication but that would expose the Democratic scam. Jill is the one who is his power of attorney. She gets to make all of his decisions when he is unable, trending soon.
Bro you realize Biden actually has a mental illness that we don‚Äôt know about yet. It‚Äôs early stages of something. Most likely Alzheimer‚Äôs
Biden will be eating a steak on camera to refute the truth. They‚Äôll shine his forehead and prop him up. You can bet they‚Äôll fight back and fire the security team that leaked this info.
trump‚Äôs youtube ads are all ‚Äújoe biden has embraced the policies of the radical left‚Äù  absolutely not you stupid bitch, we fuckin wish he would
Still can‚Äôt believe we let Bernie Sanders lose to Joe Biden. I‚Äôm still annoyed with y‚Äôall about that.
Empirical facts, emaciated mentally slow Biden slipping into his last hour of life. Dementia is a terminal disease. That is the only established science. Joe looks like a poster pinup for a guy in his second infancy.
Power! The Dems want power over Biden‚Äôs dead body! Horrific. If he were Republican the cries by the media and congress would be deafening. He‚Äôd have to resign.
Biden has zero chance of winning the election if he has to talk.
That is the big decision and the big lie. If they pull Biden, they have to admit Trump was right and that they lied. That means they‚Äôll probably drag this out till Biden‚Äôs condition can‚Äôt be hidden. As soon as Biden gets exposed, he‚Äôll disappear like Hunter. Gone forever!
Crazy Bernie gets it if Biden disappears into his second infancy.
That is the cautious gait of senility. Every step creates a question mark of uncertainty, regardless of prior experience on the same surface. Biden has lost his way and there is no way home! Sad!
I don‚Äôt think they want to give up their sources. Dan tweeted about the same. Biden‚Äôs camp must make a decision.
See Dan Bangino. He‚Äôs got similar sources inside Biden‚Äôs security. Once you lose your impetus to eat, you are in the final stages of dementia. Biden will need 24 hour care.
Biden‚Äôs lost interest in Jill which seems the most devastating development. He doesn‚Äôt want Jill around him.
The VP pick belongs to Obama. Rice is the only one willing to wetnurse Biden‚Äôs second infancy. Obama realizes how bad Joe‚Äôs dementia is progressing. He needs Rice in second command. That‚Äôs all.
They‚Äôd hoped Biden could make it. The guys at the local grocery store who deliver food to Biden know the truth. They are trying appetite stimulants etc. There is talk of using a feeding tube, a PEG tube with the excuse that Joe is having swallowing problems. Sad!!
Joe Biden. You can hide but you can‚Äôt run from your destiny. No matter where you go there you are! I knew it was just a matter of time before the truth would catch up with the Dems. Their puppet is done!!
The campaign is in freak out mode. Biden won‚Äôt eat. He‚Äôs losing weight. He‚Äôs also lost interest in Jill. It is sad. Dementia is a horrible disease.
Biden isn‚Äôt capable of a debate, Biden has Dementia.  When I typed, Biden has... the word ‚ÄòDementia just automatically popes up!
If it takes this long to decide who your running mate will be, how long would it take Biden to push the nuclear button if bombs are heading our way?  ü§™
Moves Georgia to toss-up
Now that‚Äôs some leftist propaganda. Biden the man is not doing well. He has dementia a terminal disease. That will progress. He‚Äôs losing weight and has to be reminded to eat. Not good. The goons have kept him hidden. They‚Äôve done well. Hiding Biden Campaign is about over.
New York Times wrote a big story on the MSM propaganda war to defeat Trump! It won‚Äôt work was their conclusion. But it‚Äôs worth a try. Biden looks bad. Really bad. He‚Äôs mentally deconditioned. When ask about his VP pick, he said they‚Äôll decide soon.
The State of Texas is turning the corner on COVID. Trump has saved them once again. Biden just announced no more drilling and no more fossil fuels for Texas. He‚Äôs pushing the failed windmill farms. Inhale the Biden dust.
Rice will need pudding to keep Biden from spilling the beans. She‚Äôll pick Biden‚Äôs cabinet and his China players. Obama wants to start his own Global Fund to become a multi billionaire. He‚Äôs planning on selling access and selling America to the highest bidders.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump, he loses big time!
Here‚Äôs another falsifiable statement by Biden. Would a black swan that did not vote for Biden be white?
They know Biden can‚Äôt debate. Biden can‚Äôt lead, only follows the far left.
Biden will remember enough. And the fact that the Dems are pushing him as a solid thinker means they will have to own whatever he exposes.
Rice knows what she did. Obama knows what they did. They are worried. Biden is an old demented white guy. Trump could take him out with one question in a debate. They are worried! Trust me!
Democrats coming up with fake news on why Biden can‚Äôt Debate, everyone knows the real reason, Dementia.  Biden is not capable of being a leader, Biden can only be Led further down the Socialist path.  Look who is leading Biden, those people are the ones pulling him further left.
Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
Obama is pawning Susan Rice off on Biden. Jill despises her. Biden is afraid of her. Why?
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me,‚Äù Joe Biden. ‚ÄúOkay, damnit don‚Äôt vote for me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for President Trump!‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you, mylady.‚Äù
Biden has dementia. He is now protected from criticism and political harassment. He‚Äôs like a protected species. He has a terminal disease‚Äîdementia. Save Biden from a stroke or worse from sleep deprivation. Send Sleepy Joe home on Nov 3rd.
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for me.‚Äù From the heart of Joe Biden
The only solution for Hide‚Äôn Biden is a chip implant. Then let us all follow Biden. We can all sleep with confidence knowing where Biden is everynight. We worry that he could walk out into the road.
Of course not, we must be careful what we believe because there are many false bakers, there is a difference between Q and Qanon....everybody knows that dummy. Now have you noticed Biden‚Äôs ears recently?
How about a trade. Give me two days of Biden‚Äôs private documents at University of Delaware? I‚Äôll give you Durham‚Äôs indictment list.
Breaking. Fellow deepstate agent predicts October surprise. Joe Biden‚Äôs fingerprint identified with female DNA within. There are four former female senate staffers that are being sampled for a match. One: Tara Reade . . . Would the media even cover this? Sad!
African American pastor: Black community realizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äòvery big part of the problem‚Äô
When doe the big momentum work the best? When the other team plays prevent defense! That‚Äôs all Biden knows.
Biden has dementia. That is a terminal condition that only gets worse. Biden could become chatty demented old man and destroy Obama‚Äôs history by his reveals.
Brilliant. I‚Äôm sure Durham has been waiting for the right time to pull the trigger. Biden doesn‚Äôt want Rice. Obama does!
Jarret will not be a wet nurse for Biden‚Äôs second infancy. Rice has agreed to keep Biden from pooping on Obama‚Äôs history, and she has agreed to keep Biden under control as his dementia progresses.
Rice has the job if she is not indicted. That means Flynn will get to take on Biden and Rice in the courtroom or the campaign. Go Gen Flynn.
Obama prefers Rice to protect is bottom. Biden will pick Rice if she does not get indicted.
Biden-Sanders Policy Statement Drops Federal Pot Legalization
Warren protects the rights of the Bolsheviks to burn down, rape, and destroy America. She hates America and will do anything to burn it to the ground. Socialism via inflation and then turn the Bolsheviks lose. That‚Äôs Warren and Biden‚Äôs plan.
Take as many polls as you want, Biden is not winning Georgia.
Joe Biden is the closest to an actual segregationist anyone knows.  Didn‚Äôt want school integration because he didn‚Äôt want his kids in a ‚Äújungle‚Äù. In 2017 he called black kids roaches.  Called Obama ‚Äúclean‚Äù.  It‚Äôs like projection is a science of the left.
Biden plz ignore this guy
Lebron did not care about black lives in Cleveland or Chicago. He‚Äôs a puppet for sale to the highest bidders‚Äîjust like Biden.
Why does the press attack Trump while protecting Biden? How does covering over unrest &amp; violence on the streets serve this strategy. Why defund police during riots? Why disarm the police? What we have is a media with an agenda: the ends justify the means‚Äî‚ÄúWe‚Äôre morally superior.‚Äù
How does the DNC pass on Kamala Harris? A woman of color who served her country, who speaks well, and as a final bonus she doesn‚Äôt sniff children! Cmon man. It‚Äôs like you want to lose. Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign is elder abuse.
The left doesn‚Äôt care about Biden, they only care about who will take his place when he steps down very quickly after election.  To bad, Democrats will again be screaming n crying!
Biden and the Dems plot a way to socialism via inflation and Bolshevik Revolution. But it all hinges on divide and conquer. They must remove our police and security. The mob want complete control.

Couldn't be clearer ...  Black Voters Know Biden Is Clumsy‚Äîand That Trump Is a Menace  via
How Joe Biden describes Black Americans yesterday was down right RACIST!ü§¨
Biden's support, unironically. I had a good laugh though.
Joe Biden Fluke Ass Gon Make A Nigga Vote For Kayne He Keep Saying Stupid Shit Publicly.
Did some reflecting and rationalizing. I am convinced Biden won't make it to Thanksgiving next year, I would vote for his VP. If it's Kamala no way, but Rice is a contender. I was VP debates. I could care less about Trump and Biden.
Joe Biden smear ads make him seem like a way better candidate than he actually is.
We should be moving heaven and earth to get him out of our lives. He is a cancer on this country.   Putin must wake up giddy every day when he sees the death and suffering the US is enduring because of his control of Trump.   Biden has a lot of really hard work ahead of him.
The good try tho part. And the fact that only 19% of Biden voters actually want HIM as president opposed to "not trump" doesn't predict well for a high turnout
Obama built it. Trump broke it. Biden will fix it.   04 #BeCounted
NOONE BELIEVES BIDEN HAS FAITH IN ANYTHING, but you fight on tv all day over a lie Donna no one cares
Wow.   Really?   WTF is wrong with you?  There is no time for Jedi mind tricks.  It is what it is.  You have to vote for Biden regardless.  You know this.
Joe Biden is a clown but so is Trump which is why I'm writing in my ballot.
Also Biden again wasn't wrong. If you understand nationalities and culture and intersectionality you'd know that.
Woke up to a headline that says Trump says Biden lost the black vote üòÇ. We're not stupid fam. We understand context. We have internal discussions. Republicans think they can point and go ooh ooh look and we just bite. Nah goofy. The mission is get yo ass gone Donnie. Bye.
Biden will need #KamalaHarrisForVP
Biden spoke...then his handlers tried to patch it....these are NOT Joe Biden tweets, but from his staff...
So the man in the White House says Joe Biden is Hurting GOD. Soo....locking kids in cages, being racist, stripping people's healthcare and rights away, attacking protestors, letting over 150,000 Americans die from COVID-19 and so much more isn't hurting GOD? GTFOH.
Biden radical? Has he sent federal troops into American cities? Stood down the federal task force in the middle of a pandemic? Supported the Russian dictatorship after they paid for American troops to be killed?
I will definitely vote for Biden. I do hope he wins, my life is better and the lives of others have better outcomes. Trump hasn‚Äôt made anything better for me.
Anyone who votes for Joe Biden because they genuinely want to is trippin. He‚Äôs as textbook a definition of ‚Äúa means to an end‚Äù as it gets for me.
Biden would lose. No question
So you‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs a coastal elite.....and joe Biden, being from Scranton is a man of the people....
Everyone I‚Äôve talked to is truly thinking Harris is Biden‚Äôs VP. I think she‚Äôs great. But, better suited for AG. How can  pick anyone other than
with your rationale, it will be 2 to 3 years before schools can open back up.   Of course if Biden is elected,  then hey,  schools will open back up.
WOW, is this why Biden doesn't DENOUNCE the destruction of Christian Church's &amp; burning Christian Bible's. #EvangelicalsForTrump #CatholicTwitter #Portland #Wisconsin #Minneapolis
It‚Äôs extra funny bc it was an attack ad on Biden and he doesn‚Äôt wanna defund the police so.
How many people who would‚Äôve voted for Biden would flip it to Kanye, a known Trump supporter, if he was on the ballot?  Also, Kanye wouldn‚Äôt make it on enough ballots to have a mathematical shot at 270, so I‚Äôm not ready to worry about the Clown Vote tipping the election.
Let‚Äôs not pretend that Biden speaking is a disaster, when Trump is every bit that and worse. One standard will do just fine, we don‚Äôt need two.
I‚Äôm going to send you $10 to cover your losses on that Joe Biden bet
Whatever empathy I had for him &amp; his mental health, just evaporated.    It‚Äôs one thing to be mentally damaged. It‚Äôs another to continuously and willfully remain in an unhealthy state.  Yet, knowing there are men in power ‚Äúpreying‚Äù on his weakness and arr‚Ä¶
Knowing that Joe Biden is racist and still voting for him makes you ignorant as fuck.  And it also makes you the same as  a MAGA supporter. You‚Äôre a joke.
We got Trump because of Biden, so why would I ever vote for Biden?    I'm not stupid.
Exactly since Biden equals Trump.
Do you think all the libs that support legalization of weed are going to support her, after she prosecuted hundreds and then bragged about smoking it herself? Oh, and the clips of her attacking Biden at the dem debates are going to be great for the Trump ads. This for a start.
Joe Biden damn near talked hisself out of becoming the next president..
How can Biden ‚ÄúHurt God‚Äù??
BIDEN out raised Trump in May and June it's only a 5 million dollars difference with cash on hand  VP won't make that much a difference
I don't think you understand how dire this is. Yes, Trump wants votes. He won't get mine, but he WILL get them. Compare to Biden, who doesn't seem to want votes from anyone but the donor class. The people vote for who earns it. That's how this works.
Not at all!! Like I said, I‚Äôm glad Biden apologized and continues too, and I wish Trump would when he says messed up stuff.  All I was saying is that we all know that wasn‚Äôt Biden writing that tweet.
I'll be voting for Joe Biden 2020üëä
I am SO tired of people questioning Biden‚Äôs cognitive ability because of how he speaks. He speaks slowly because of a stutter. Roughly 3 million Americans stutter. Idk how you can complain about his speaking abilities when you look at our current president. Trump is incoherent ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Could you please ask Joe Biden's wife, if Joe wins the election is he planning on running the country from his basement?
How do y‚Äôall feel about this upcoming election ? I think it‚Äôs fucked either way ... trump or Biden ... but could be worse with trump... I think we all doomed
Wow dude your clueless and have been brainwashed by the MSM and the Democratic party.   A little common sense will take you a long way. Joe Biden is losing his mental faculties, it's so obvious! Anyone with half a brain can see it.
We need to do a write in candidate and fuck up their entire program. I say write in Cynthia McKinney for President and Tulsi Gabbard for Vice President...  Fuck Biden and Kamela and Trump.
I know! The white great-granddaddy comes out of Joe Biden more and more each day. Joe needs to pick his Black female VP and stay quiet
Pandemic point of the day. Keep away from non masked people. Love My Biden!
joe Biden saying " you aint black if don't vote me " should've been a eye opener he don't care about  minorities like he says he does .  he be saying the slickest stuff out his mouth and nobody correct him. honestly none of the presidential candidates are worthy of a vote
biden voters showing respect for their elders.
Embarrassing.    Safe bet every one of them are Biden fans?
The media backpedaling on Biden‚Äôs racist diversity comments against black is staggering. #BidenIsARacist #biden #KAG2020LandslideVictory #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
This poll from two weeks ago just shows what dumb mother fuckers Trump's minions are. They convince Kanye to run to take votes away from Biden and look how it's biting them in the ass now. Biden stayed the same, but Trump dropped a percent. #idiots #JoeBiden #kanye #NeverTrump
On 7/20, Biden had a +8.8% polling average, today it stands at +7.8%
The more Joe Biden talks the more  he  loses  votes. A Dementia Gaffe machine.
i know biden is bad and all but there are seriously people who think he‚Äôs worse than trump ü§Ø and i‚Äôm mind blown by that
Sad thing is my people (black people) are still gonna vote for this POS over Trump ! Our ignorance as a people hurts my heart! Liberal media has brainwashed blacks against trump and glorified Biden and a lot of blacks don‚Äôt take the time to find information for themselves üò©
Joe Biden should announce his VP this weekend or on Monday.
Also, i did not know that about Harris's relationship with Beau. That is heartening to me to learn.  Thanks!
We agree on that. There is connective tissue throughout the diaspora. Your point is noted. My point was simply that Biden‚Äôs comments ignore the rich diversity within African America. And making comments so public and wrong is dangerous.
Trump is way more dangerous than biden, trump is a dictator period, i had no problem with with biden for 8 years under Obama and I have none with him now, no candidate is perfect,  but trump is letting 1000 of people die a day and say it is what it is disgraceful,  he must go
I am waiting for the VP pick. And to be clear, if I vote for Biden, I am punishing the GOP. Get your s#it together and go pull your principles out of the trash can. Here's a hint, principles transcend the President. Act like a coequal branch not a frat party.
FUCKING GOD DAMN JOE FUCKING BIDEN IS A FUCKING DIP SHIT
Why you bringing up Trump I never said his name. Stay focused take the blind folds off.  Look BIden has to apologize to save face what would you do if you were running for office say he‚Äôll yeah I meant it.
Joe Biden knows nothing about any people of color. It‚Äôs hilariously bad that people let him get on television and talk.

You could barely find any reasonably priced AR-15's or AK-47's after the pandemic started. Now things are more stocked up but still flying off the shelves anyway. Biden wants to eliminate assault weapons but will have a tough time with it I imagine..
I really believe what they are doing to Biden is elder abuse!
Stupid and inaccurate. Biden's team need to get him to stick to the talking points. When he freelance it's a disaster
No.  The people who are going to vote for Biden will vote for him regardless of what either Trump or West does.  Maybe the people voting against Biden have a new choice?
Biden posted a clarification on Twitter Thursday night, saying he did not mean to make African Americans seem like a "monolith."  via
Oh for fucks sake! Trade issues alone make Biden worth my vote.
In your opinion does Biden have normal cognitive skills for a man his age?  It‚Äôs a simple yes or no question.  You won‚Äôt reply.
How horrible the short term memories of the right are. They said the same thing with President Obama, yet here they still are. I hope you all have that frame of mind if Biden wins. And you guys say that the Left won't "let" you guys have opinions ü§£ Hypocrites. #TrumpHasNoPlan
Solid analysis. However, i think you underestimate the critical importance Biden places in *trust* and "chemistry" as  critical components of the POTUS/VP relationship. By all accounts, he has more of those w/ Rice than any of the others mentioned. She's a known commodity to him.
Biden holding onto the VP selection like it‚Äôs the Krabby Patty formula
I don‚Äôt wanna hear shit about Trump being a racist from a Joe Biden supporter.
Biden still ain‚Äôt picked a VP?!?!? Fuck is he doing?
All these recent videos from  are getting a pass by the left media. As expected.  But this, has anyone ever considered that JOE BIDEN. Is. A. RACIST?   ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Great point made to someone who posted that Biden was an example of white privilege.
joe biden: at least he‚Äôs not trump!  (he‚Äôs just ronald reagan)
Trump attacked Biden‚Äôs faith (alley) and Biden absolutely dunked all over him (oop)
Ignore that. Biden ignored (or didn‚Äôt know) that. There is diversity and similarities within most ethnic groups. Biden didn‚Äôt know that when he spoke of AAs.
This is like the second deadline Joe Biden has missed for his VP announcement. Guess he too busy making racist comments about black people.
All of you will be making excuses for Biden until election day.
Isn‚Äôt that what Joe Biden said ü§î? We ain‚Äôt black if we don‚Äôt vote for him. No thanks.
Biden tries to clarify remarks suggesting lack of diversity in the Black community
Y‚Äôall get on here every day and talk shit about Trump for being racist.  Then think this is okay.  Joe Biden is a racist.  You do not have to vote for him. You do not have to vote for Trump.  YOUR legacy is on the line. AMERICA CAN DO BETTER.
Let's just take a walk down memory lane. Joe Biden has always been racist. Democrats are full of closet racist.    Black Vote
I would wait in an 8 hour line to guarantee Biden‚Äôs loss üòÜ
Don‚Äôt allow him on the ballot to distract or move votes from Biden! If we split votes to candidates who we know will NOT win. 45 will be back in that whitehouse making poor decisions! This post was to keep y‚Äôall woke! It‚Äôs not about who is friends with who it‚Äôs about facts
I don‚Äôt know that I can agree with that. There are extreme cultural differences between Tuskegee and Montgomery in Alabama. I think asserting otherwise falls into the fallacy that Biden committed yesterday. The south is not monolithic. Many of the pathologies and problems may
Kanye Admits His Presidential Bid Will Take Votes Away From Biden: ‚ÄòI'm Not Denying¬†It‚Äô Only a fool or a Trump supporter would vote for Kanye! Kanye you're a TRAITOR to your people! May you see Karma soon!
Their strategy is basically empty moralizing without action or addressing the inherent hypocrisy of their claims. The DNC worked themselves into a corner with Biden, and they're going to get pummeled for it. They lost the higher ground that they could've kept with Sanders.
It‚Äôs so embarrassing to be Black, know that Joe Biden is racist, and still be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still voting for him‚Äù.  Y‚Äôall are so problematic and don‚Äôt even know.  We got shit to do and instead of uprising, y‚Äôall going with the status quo. I‚Äôm tired.
Where was all of this biden hate when he did 8 years with Obama... Black people so easily persuaded... Stand on your own principles.. Crime bill was a direct link to Regan introducing the usa to the drug trade and he was a Republican.. U jus a pawn..trump cares about money not u
I wonder how many of our so-called allies will continue speaking out against racism after Biden is elected or is all of this really just anti-trump acts and nothing more. trump is a racist and opportunist. Sad truth, so are some who claim to be on our side.
Conservatives and the Trump campaign are in such a dire desperation, they are hoping Biden would commit a self inflicted wound. Biden is right, though. The Latino population are from vast diverse countries.
Do you believe that after 40 years in public office, if Biden could have effected positive change, he probably would have done it by now?
Please explain How is Biden better, unless you subscribe to the theory He will not run the country, you see him, you hear him  Please answer
For a good laugh go to the   website and see how they reported Biden‚Äôs latest gaffe.  buried it among several clickbait links.

biden needs to tell his supporters to stop doing this!
That is not a happy looking biden voter.
Because he doesn't have the "Get-out-ofJail-Free" card that Nixon had; if Biden wins, it's likely that a lot of people in his inner circle get prosecuted.
Ok I'm confused is it Team Obama or Team Biden ?
Biden apologized. What do you think Trump would‚Äôve done in that situation?
Also If Biden wins he will most likely resign, and his running mate would be the first female president, which would be either Elizabeth warren or Kamala Harris so

AOC - catholics who tend to leprosy colonies are white supremacist garbage  Biden- abortion is womanhood  Trump- yall like bibles and church right?  Center Rights- hahah omg I can't believe Christians buy trumps garbage, how condescending of him.
And the amount of votes that will not get counted as they are mail-in that will get "accidentally lost" And then the people that are going to vote write in, and now the people that will vote Kanye as a joke. You have a much tighter race between Biden and Trump
I have to agree on this one .Ana is on Team Biden
Kanye actually came out today and admitted that he's only running to steal votes from Biden... This is not a conspiracy theory anymore,  100% of the available population doesn't ever vote. take into account the people that are going to vote green or independent
I should finish this by saying .. Biden KNOWS Y‚Äôall will get into a fight that is not your fight, has never been your fight and [Inexplicably] vote for him because He said so‚Ä¶ Not because he has shown you a policy you like so much, you can‚Äôt wait.
He's not grabbing bitches by the pussy. He's an old dude that's "touchy Feely" if I get what that means, not a serial rapist. I wouldn't do 5% (2%?)of the touching Biden does, but it's not banging 10year old girls dressed up to look like Ivanka.
Where were all of yall when Obama selected Biden?? I guess yall were too busy ingesting the socialist air and didn't have time. Only if y'all had put this much in 2016 against the Grand Wizard...but know our precious socialism that primarily excludes blk brown ppl.
Biden's "support" I'm sure you mean.
Old bigot Biden showed his true colors. Remember when he feared the "Racial Jungle" brought on by desegregation
I don‚Äôt buy this ‚ÄúKanye is out of control; nothing his wife can do‚Äù BS. Remember Kim decided she wanted to be a lawyer &amp; Trump indulged her. Think if Biden‚Äôs elected he‚Äôs going to give her WH access like Trump did? This is a woman who ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù released a sex tape for fame.
Nice young biden voters.
Mom and pop investors benefit from real estate tax break that Biden wants to cut  #realestate #investing
The smallest African country.. the inhabitants hardly speak the same language, hardly like the same color on clothes, have varied attitudes towards work, play, sex, fun, death All in one. What Biden was saying is..‚Äùwe stripped the variety  Off blacks.  it worked"
Biden's gaffes are never on the scale of the monstrosity we currently have in office, but it's frustrating that he can't seem to talk about us without playing into harmful tropes about us. I think he means well and all, but yeah. It's frustrating.
So you aren‚Äôt AA. I may not be fully AA. And yet we both would be considered so just about everywhere outside of this nuanced convo. Biden was not thinking of this when he said what he said.
I will vote for Biden so hard and then do my damndest to push him to the left for his entire term. If he does what I like even ten percent of the time it's still better than the current orange dictator. (and I suspect he will do far better than 10%)
Hey just don‚Äôt be disappointed by Biden if he let‚Äôs you down you get what you vote and not vote for peace.
And also, can we at least agree that when Biden made that statement, he was considering none of the nuance we are tweeting now?
It has always amazed me African Americans, in a country this vast..are mind bogglingly‚Ä¶The Same. You could debate me to death.. but you will never see yourself through Non AA eyes.  Biden was saying what ‚ÄòPeople of all races" think of you..Non AA Blacks included.
This is why I look at people stupid when they have both ‚ÄúBiden 2020‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù signs in their yards.
Joe Biden is not "very moderate" you hacks. He is nothing but Weekend at Bernies being propped up by you the media and the far far left that hates this country.

I definitely believe the polls about GA being a tossup, but I also believe that voter suppression tactics+strategies will be deployed to the fullest extent possible in order to ensure that it does not swing to Biden in Nov.
I truly believe Biden was thinking about voter behavior when he compared blacks to Latinos. In that case, it‚Äôs true: the ‚ÄúLatino vote‚Äù is more divided across the parties. But voters aren‚Äôt the entirety of a community‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre the only members politicians think about.

‚ÄòSit down‚Äô: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô
Even if Joe Biden was just trying to say that black people vote as a block in a way Latino voters don't, it's super weird of him to draw the conclusion that black people largely voting Democrat means we don't have differences that are meaningful to how we engage politics. 1/
in my opinion - "where's Biden" is the better chance at winning the Presidency than his foot constantly in his mouth and his head up his ass.  Just my opinion. Obviously we both want Trump to lose, but i think we just have different views on how/why.
Many of them use mumble jumble Biden speak making no sense at all.
Advisors  think being more anti-transgender will either a) win more votes or b) encourage shaky voters to go ahead an vote for Trump?    What voter considers this an important issue that is not already with Trump?  Is this the same advisor who told Trump to say Biden hates God?
Kanye is trying to throw a wrench into this election so Biden will lose. He want the black votes. He really think blacks are stupid enough to vote for his crazy ass?  Kim , get your damn husband. Over 150,000 died because of Trump and Kanye is helping him?
The hatred for Trump is irrational.  Make America Great Again!  How is this racist?  The reaction controversial?  Do you remember Hillary's slogan?  Do you know Biden's?  Great to know the government is to answer to the people.  Is this not common sense?  American is the best!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
just because trump is a literally killing people and being a complete racist/facist. Biden is not the reason Biden is ahead in the polls.
Nothing that Biden does is going to seriously change his level of support in the Black communities, especially with young folks. And instead of trying to do something ‚Äúfake‚Äù looking he just needs to be his authentic self. mho
Epstein isn‚Äôt why Hillary isn‚Äôt the candidate. And to think anyone around Biden wants a ‚Äúfar left‚Äù VP shows a complete lack of understanding of American politics.
Biden is like the kid that gets passed on to the next grade without mastering the material; year after year; then suddenly he's in a spot where he's supposed to know/use the knowledge/skills that he "learned" in school.  But he doesn't have it within him to do it.

criticizing  about God, guns, blah blah blah is an oxymoron. Joe is Catholic &amp; he lives his faith &amp; oh he attends mass. Trump knows nothing as Biden loves cool cars &amp; dogs, &amp; he loves people. He cares. Yeah let‚Äôs debate values D loses!
I now have to check out his show. I'm usually watching CNN at that time.
I‚Äôm very pro- Trump, but as a Christian I‚Äôm quite certain that sleepy Joe Biden cannot hurt God, lol.  The idea that the GOP somehow represents Jesus Christ shows a very limited understanding of who Jesus is.

Do people understand that Latino simply refers to anyone from any country that‚Äôs Spanish speaking. This then means you can be Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Venezuelan etc. Biden‚Äôs point was due to vast cultural differences their political ideology is more diverse.
, Are going to just sit there and not FORCE this klansman. To PUBLICLY recant that all black people think alike? This is why I did not vote for you. N2N how many times did Joe Biden call you a n*****. Then turn around and say: its been a stressful day, we guud?
I would add the Joe Biden is a hateful racist.
Biden has been a racist since conception
So by that logic Whites, Asians, Hispanics and other ethnicities should vote Trump then cause only black people can vote Biden.
I feel you bruh, but Trump ain‚Äôt the answer. Biden definitely is not a great choice, but he is lightyears better than Trump. Trump seems to be remedial and a clown.
I don‚Äôt think they care about the people that are outraged. I thought Biden wasn‚Äôt even the Top 5 outta the 7 people I remember but the current system isn‚Äôt gonna ever go too far from what they‚Äôre used too

True. Every VP would be viciously attacked, but attacks on a 90-odd day on criminal justice records on blacks, dating a married man of power, calling Biden a racist, won't be attacked as hypocrisy as blacks speak about criminal justice, morals, racism, and black lives matter? Ok.

Joe Biden Flexes Increase Of Campaign Support With Massive Ad Buy Across 15 States
No, he clearly talks now and always have down to that community. That is the very definition of a racists. Biden trues to act woke and cool to pretend he‚Äôs engrained within that community so it gives him a pass to say these things. To allow that is to enable a racists.
I agree with your premise about Joe ‚Äúapologizing‚Äù but we both know that Biden didn‚Äôt write that tweet
All Biden said was that there‚Äôs a diverse Latino community in the US (Venezuelans and Cubans for example), and because of their own various histories and struggles, have different political views than African American in the US. A logical statement. That‚Äôs reality.
The debate moderators in the control booth should have the ability and authority to hit a kill switch on Trump's mic when he begins to run his mouth out of turn. Of course, the same goes for Biden's mic but you just know it won't be necessary on Biden's side.

Zack, reading your work, you are clearly smart enough to know what Biden means, even if he‚Äôs saying it poorly. To say that the issues/voting tendencies of black community is less diverse than that of ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù community is simply true and not offensive.
Yes but they are heavily correlated.   Also likely means that it isn't competitive but if the race tightens, it might be closer. It doesn't mean that Trump has a significant chance of winning.   With that being said, it seems like you're overstating Biden's chances in Mississippi

You know I never thought of that. I think he should run on that. Maybe he can blame Biden for COVID.  Biden made it in a lab and presto he did it. Yes and he did this at a Pizza place.
In your opinion does Joe Biden have normal cognitive skills for a man his age?  It‚Äòs a simple yes or no question.  I‚Äôve asked his supporters that same question dozens of times and not one person answered.  Will you?
I love  but we need to be as VANILLA as possible when compared to #Trump‚Äôs madness.  Show the voters a #Biden administration will be drama-less and without scandal. #TeamJoe please do not select her!  #SusanRice #JoeBiden #Veepstakes #Biden2020

Ugh, this is bad that we‚Äôre in this place. This president has completely changed the significance of the title.
You'd vote for this guy?
So does this mean you‚Äôre not voting? Cause John Lewis who just died got beat down fighting for your right to vote. You may not like the choices, but NOT voting for Biden is a vote for trump. Hold your nose &amp; vote Blue. Do it to honor those who fought &amp; died for your voting rights
Joe is DEFINITELY not helping
Ok but am I gonna vote for this guy...?
If you honestly think that, you need to re-educate yourself seriously. Under a really corrupt Democrat who acts like Trump it might be a worry, but with someone like Biden, that will not happen.
I‚Äôm worried about this coming election though. I read a story, were they‚Äôre saying Biden will pick Kamala Harris. Then when Biden can‚Äôt go any farther &amp; since Kamala‚Äôs parents had her before they came to America, so she can't be the President, that will make Nancy Pelosi be?üòí
The American electorate is mostly uninformed and gullible. Joe Biden is demented
Understand that what trump said about Biden being against God is wrong. Don‚Äôt tweet, don‚Äôt booo, don‚Äôt be mad, just vote. 89 days till this ü§° is out if office! This fool makes Joseph McCarthy look like a choir boy.
Unfortunately, Kanye West, whether knowingly or willingly or not, is definitely being leveraged to skew the black or whatever vote away from Joe Biden and secure Trumps 2nd term.
I hate all the options...but I‚Äôm curious what you think we should pick between Biden/Trump? Shouldn‚Äôt we ease out of this trash or just take another 4 years of whatever and then hopefully figure it out?
This is the umpteenth time  has thrown BP under the bus. Not including his anti-black political past. If  actions are an indication of his administration ... THEN SO ARE BIDEN'S!
so by that logic can we finally come to terms w/ the fact that joe biden isn‚Äôt the candidate that should be our nominee...

Sounds like Joe Biden speaking from compiled data and reports from and experience with Latino community. Statement sounds exactly like their talking points ‚Äî they are different. They say it everyday in every way while leveraging in America.   It‚Äôs politics not personal.
Young minority voters show overwhelming support for Biden: poll

Biden seeks to clarify comment that Latino community is diverse, 'unlike the African‚Ä¶

If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you are essentially voting for Trump. I don‚Äôt care if an electric chair is his running mate; I‚Äôm voting for Biden. The VP doesn‚Äôt execute anyone, so who cares what Harris has said in the past? I want Warren, but I‚Äôm voting Biden no matter what.
Who do you think Biden will choose as his VP? #Election2020 #Democrats
Joe Biden has a strong faith that‚Äôs guided him through unimaginable tragedy, and Donald Trump is a shitbag.
Privilege, in the sense that Dreamers and their families have been hurt badly by Trump and would be hurt less so by Biden.  Absence of privilege, in the sense that there are 10 other stressors.   IMHO.
because half of all white people are trump supporters so statistically the odds Biden would want Trump re-elected is one in two.
You go on the air and express your disgust with this guy and his administration and then you consider not voting for Biden because of his VP pick? Are you a member of that fake news he's always talking about? I've lost all respect. No need to grill his surrogates anymore.

Biden, we are gonna need an African American Female VP pick.
Imagine that....2 racists arguing about which is more racist than the other. Biden has just about lost me with this latest comment. From him not stepping up to getting defensive when questioned by black host, that is not something I had expected to see from him. I'm still voting!
I'm more likely to vote for Trump over Biden in November.

If Biden picks Susan Rice for VP... get ready to hear about Benghazi for pretty much the rest of the year.
Are you sure about that?  After all Biden is only the Father of mass incarceration  Trump is definitely a Damn Fool  But Maybe you should also do your research on all the dirt Biden is attached to
yeah I'd replace biden with a different candidate for the trump vs democrat race right now. it's not hard to find one without a history of racism and misogyny
Herein, an intern takes control of Joe Biden's twitter account.  Recommendation to the intern:   Scrap the gun confiscation platform while you're at it. Something like 3 million liberals just bought guns this year because of Covid and the riots.
How can you blame Biden for companies outsourcing? Companies use cheaper labor to boost profits. Consumers support this by choosing cheaper foreign created products vs more expensive American ones. In other words YOU gave away those jobs.
How soon will Biden say ni in an interview? I give it less than a month.

Fav comment from Biden
This is the biggest bunch of BS I‚Äôve ever heard. 1. Biden, like Trump, also only cares for the needs and wants of his billionare donors. That‚Äôs why he said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù  2. Biden put so many kids in cages and split up so many families as VP.
Correction...Biden's Team attempts to walk back the most recent racist remarks made by their figurehead.
So tell us,  what Biden VP pick this side of satan would lead you to vote for Trump.
Um, Eric, the blue line is Biden. It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs confusing if you‚Äôre not bright.
You criticize Biden but Trump on worldwide television suggested we inject ourselves with bleach and sunlight to cure COVID  LOOK NOW... Don't bullshit about that FACT. Trump did say that. Dr. Birx died inside when he said it.
The only difference between biden tweets and trump tweets is that biden apologises.
But in donalds favor, Biden has no clue what Covfefe even is

I think Warren.  Everyone who is voting for Biden will.  She will bring energy and excitement to the campaign.
Biden really needs to STFU...already don't like you...but anything is better than that orange idiot we currently have...UGH!!!
In order to hurt God, doesn't that imply Trump thinks Biden is more powerful than God?

Good question. Given the way u framed the question he‚Äôs not wrong. Biden committed a political Gaff: expressing a truth and we‚Äôre all supposed to deny.
Damn yall really out here voting for Biden just because. Maybe if he wasn't a clone I'd vote for him too. He malfunctions a lil too  much for me though. We need a new model.

I hear you, but GOP will create unique drama with any of the fantastic females who will be our next VP. Susan Rice is ready to do the job of POTUS, which is apparently Biden's top criteria. Harris (+ others) would be great VPs but maybe Biden wants them for other cabinet roles.
Hopefully voters are smart enough to see that this is exactly why Kanye is trying to get on ballots.
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to walk a political tightrope. I know you‚Äôll help make America a better place. It‚Äôs in your heart. We all say things that don‚Äôt always get the treatment we intended. You are a good man,Joe Biden. You will win this .

They sure did. Bernie said George Wallace was sensitive to the needs of his constituents at the time and the left defended him but now these same people love to take Biden out of context and act fake outraged. Bernie opposed busing too lmfaooo but I digress.
Biden just trying to cover up his racism. Dementia has a hard time covering your true intentions.
Let the loosing trash heap sue everywhere. Hopefully some of the Americans who think of themselves as patriots will wake up to how desperate this garbage is and come over to the side of sanity, namely, Joe Biden.

Oh shut up desperate Trump! #HeTriedit #trumplies #dumptrump

If you‚Äôre a person of color and you‚Äôre adamant about voting for Biden don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs better than Trump. Just say you don‚Äôt like Trump and want someone else in office because they both don‚Äôt care for people of color ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I blame the Democratic leadership  for this. Poor planning and lack of strategy. Over the past 4 years we couldn‚Äôt come up with anyone better than 80 year old Joe Biden? A mess. It‚Äôs just frustrating.
Wondering how many members of your campaign staff collaborated on this response.  Clinton had his "Bimbo Eruption Team".  Biden has his "What I meant to say Team".  Gee, your thoughts seem so much more organized in these tweets - hmmmm.
Joe Biden threw black men in prison.  Joe Biden tells blacks they ‚Äúain‚Äôt black‚Äù if they don‚Äôt vote for him.  Joe Biden thinks Blacks are too stupid to have diversity of thought.  Joe Biden is a perfect nominee for the racist left.  so sad democrats back this mentally ill racist
Ummm- I‚Äôd vote for a potato before I will vote for  He‚Äôs the #WorstPresidentInHistory, he‚Äôs literally killing us, put kids in cages, is completely devoid of humanity. Yet &amp; still ppl like you are wondering about Biden? GTFO!!!

I humbly disagree with your bullet points. Biden made gaffe and it should‚Äôve been caught. Let‚Äôs not make this be more than it is. We have 2 choices in the upcoming election.
I really don't care for Joe Biden. Trump Supporters just won't hold Trump accountable for anything. Locking up there Obama admin, Hillary and being petty towards folks doesn't enact real policies needed in America. Everytime he gets in trouble he whips out an EO. No governing

I will be stunned if he ducks the debates. His only chance right now is for Biden to implode on national TV. I could see him sucking Kamala or maybe Warren but Biden is a light weight.

At least Biden hasn't threatened to shoot a dog if we don't vote for him...yet.
Tweeting at me isn‚Äôt doing anything about ending racism my friend...never said Biden is perfect in fact he‚Äôll probably admit he‚Äôs not unlike Dumpy. What‚Äôs funny is the hypocricy of you worried about whether or not Biden is racist but not concerned about your own candidate.
So, you want to incapacitate Trump, is what you're saying? Biden could probably make it with a few hits; Trump would be twitching on the floor before he was done with his opening statement.
trxmp literally said ‚Äú[Biden] is against god‚Äù.  Ladies as gentlemen, your president is unhinged. Please keep this man out of the media. He‚Äôs running against his own mouth at this point

Number 2!  You nailed it.  It‚Äôs the only way they can get in a black female president.  If Biden were to win, he won‚Äôt serve 6 months.  He will be deemed unfit to hold office due to dementia, then the VP steps in!  Sneaky, Trojan horse!

But it does mean electing Biden. Idiot
Trying to take votes away from Biden. He was getting help from Republicans connected to Trump.
When VP Biden was campaigning for Hillary, he told an audience Trump couldn't be trusted with the nuclear launch codes. Then the moron pointed out the agent carrying his launch codes!
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
according to joe biden there are a few exceptions
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt care about Black people
Not bloody likely. The few Bernie folks not voting for Biden will either stay home, skip the Prez race or write in Bernie. Voting  for West doesn‚Äôt signal protest.

Biden has agreed to all of the debates, as all candidates have done for the decades. Trump is throwing up a smoke screen of a fourth debate to distract from his unwillingness to commit to the three original. Don‚Äôt let it fool you.
That should everything to black people who are remotely thinking about voting for Biden. If a grand wizard of the KKK was your friend, mentor and guide, shows how you feel about black people, in addition to his 1994 crime bill.
It may come to that if Trump wins by a landslide. You can bet that the Dems will be screaming voter fraud if that happens. And if Biden wins by a close margin, watch for endless requests for recounts by the GOP

Trump repealed Biden‚Äôs racist crime bill, gave permanent funding to black colleges, developed opportunity zones in poor areas, created economy that for  first time in 3 decades worker‚Äôs wages are growing faster than their manager‚Äôs wage. If Trump is racist he sucks at it.
And why does he think he is going to funnel people from Biden?   Kanye has been canceled by most people.

Polls going bad? Looks like Biden still in landslide territory
Biden's support for Byrd is not "edited". He calls Byrd his "mentor". If you're going to apply "racism" to one side, then keep it consistent and apply it to the other.
It is very difficult to watch. It also kills every liberal narrative of Trump being a racist without them looking like complete hypocrites. There are many other videos as well. This one of a fun one. You have to skip a few minutes in to get to Biden.
The main reason he is running, or trying to, is to take away black votes from voting for Joe Biden  As a matter of fact, the federal election Commission should intervene since this is a corrupt act between Kanye West and the corrupt and criminal president
You guys think it‚Äôs all about money. Silver and The Economist and that MSNBC douche say it‚Äôs a Biden landslide
Wait! Doesn‚Äôt Quinnipiac have Biden up big?
Black lives matter but the support of that organization is basically paying Joe Biden &amp; the Democratic Party. Again, as before, the blacks have been hijacked &amp; used. I'm sure its Trump's fault...just ask
Why would someone be hiding their vote. The man is literally President. Feel like there‚Äôs more secret Biden voters than a trump voters
Really? You are that shallow? WOW, you will vote for Trump if Biden doesn't pick the person you like? My opinion of you just dropped below the basement. Conceited much?

Biden‚Äôs handlers support this kind of ridiculousness.
Biden said Latinos have more diversity than blacks. He said it. If Trump had said it, WP would burn its front page to make it the headline.
Joe Biden is a racist pig. Always has been. Not sure why anyone would believe what his handlers tweet for him  you know the tweets are the handlers because they may be stupid but at least they‚Äôre coherent.
Fake ads and photoshopping will get you nowhere. You‚Äôre being called out and made to look really foolish. Give it up. Just resign before you lose badly.
He said he supported redirecting the funds. Are you going to claim this is different. I've checked a bunch of your BS fact checks and you aren't really getting it done. I guess this is just for entertainment purposes. Your work on Biden vs Extortion 17 and outing the Seals is BS.
So Biden is saying the black community is monolithic, somehow I‚Äôm thinking this isn‚Äôt so
Biden is having a bad week? Compared to 45? Not really.
Mr Biden is right  The context of his statement is correct  Latinos come from over 20 countries with different cultures, traditions and even language differences  The black community generally is more defined and their cultural traits are more alike
I love this. Lol. Biden digging his hole deeper into dementia daily.

Biden could pick a potted plant as his VP and I would still vote for him.  Really do we care that much?  All the finalists are great and would be better than DJT or Pence by like 1000x.  The end.

Russia doesn‚Äôt stand a chance against Biden if he can hurt God and The Bible.
Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.
My view is that Biden isn't a super exciting candidate, neither was HRC.. so maybe someone with a little more sparkle would be better than someone more "meh".  But the environment is different, so it might not matter.
I tend to agree that Kaine, while a great person, was a bland pick.  But Tom is likely right that it might not have mattered. However, someone more progressive might have smoothed the Bern Bros over.  Biden faces the same issue, theoretically, but the environment is different.
He also inherited that economy from Biden. Also Biden has co sponsored bills that have helped many Americans such as Disablities act and finance regulations. Also made some mistakes but everyone does, senators aren‚Äôt high profile like presidents.

Oh, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don‚Äôt question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, Americaüëéüèº
He literally is not running on his accomplishments. Please show me where‚Äôs he‚Äôs running on the economy (which is shit right now). The only thing that he possibly is running on is the wall (which isn‚Äôt built) and saying Biden has dementia but is also a left wing radical
I just don‚Äôt think Biden has it in him. Even w/o his dimentia, he has no passion.
Also, compare policies. Trump signed prison reform that RELEASED majority POC, Biden's prison reform IMPRISONED mostly POC. Trump funded HBCUs, Biden supported segregated schools. Trump created OZs to help minority communities, Biden supported policies to keep POC impoverished.
T-dawg, the main concern is how easily bigoted comments just roll off Biden's tongue like it did today. He doesn't even realize what he's saying is racist. That's a bigger issue than someone recognizing racism and taking action against it.
That's fair. Let's listen to what he has to say. I will remind you, however, that the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force recommendations are available. There's nothing "moderate" about it.
Biden could have Hillary Clinton as his VP and I would vote for him at this point.
I'm actually from LA, went to school at UCSD.üëç  Trump has said some dumb things, but its hard to deny that he has helped POC with his policies. And you know Biden is no longer a moderate. He needs the left to win this election. Otherwise "Trump-haters" is his only base.
Yeah, because Biden is so very eloquent, HES an obvious choice #meh
As a centrist, we need you now more than ever. You understand what's happening around you, right? You really want Biden's America?
Biden wants to meet God in a parking lot in Temecula.
It's crazy how quiet liberals have gotten since Biden's racist comments today. After debating w/ some of them, it looks like they weren't even aware of his well-documented racist history. Wonder why? #MSMIsTheEnemyOfThePeople
There you go again fear mongering. Biden has not said he would take away guns.
This should be a wake-up call for all those people that only hate Trump cause you think he's a "racist". If you're going to apply that term to one, then be fair and apply it to the other. And if you're Black and this doesn't give you pause, you're only confirming what Biden said.
I thought that word shouldn't be used in ANY setting, but fine. It's not just that clip. It's a repeated history of racist language AND actions. If you're going to say Trump is a racist, then be fair and do the same to Biden.
1927??? That's almost 100 years ago! What about more recently?  Here's some history for YOU. (Warning: Biden uses the N word.)
Sir, I implore you to look into Biden's history of bias against POC. His prison reform bill that HE championed. His stance on busing, how Black kids can't learn next to blond-hair, blue-eyed kids. He thinks ALL of you will vote for him because you can't think for yourselves.
Joe Biden is a lifelong Catholic and Trump couldn‚Äôt accurately quote John 3:16 but subtle dog whistle my dude
Mr Biden is not wrong  The Latino community, unlike what white people think they are all Mexicans, is extremely diverse. A latino from Argentina is not similar to a Latino from Mexico or in Puerto Rico  Even within states there are significant differences in Latino community
He's a "coon" for having a different opinion? Is Biden right about all Black-Americans? You guys should all have the same opinions because the color of your skin? Who's the racist here?
No, I don't agree with Biden, I don't view all blacks as monolith.  We were used as a qualifier, to "advance" how "diverse" the Latinx community is.
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Joe Biden really just called Blacks monolith. All the same, no diversity.   That old fucker really don't want our votes.

Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.

That is exactly right! My Grandmothers both died from dementia. It is definitely a part of the disease. His wife and the Democratic Party should be ashamed of themselves! This is elder abuse! I have no respect for Biden, but the Dems are using him for power!

I've believed all along that debates would never come off. The Dems are scared to death that Biden's deteriorating mental condition would be exposed in any such forum. It's too bad, but they really should have him step aside to preserve his dignity. He deserves that.
In 40+ years he's been in office, he's apologized for past racism. Afterwards he again wanted to segregate Black kids because he said they would have a hard time learning next to blue-eyed blonde kids. Yes, he apologized for that too. Will he do it again?
You don't need words to apologize. You change your actions. It's ACTIONS that speak louder. Biden says one thing and STILL supports policies that promote segregation. You can say sorry all you want, but if you keep punching me, are you really sorry?Pick a Latino who cares at this point Biden is a mini trump prove me wrong
That technicality won't change the spectacle of Joe Biden shitting his pants after getting clowned on live TV.  I'm really hoping for the debates.
ARIZONA GOV to BIDEN: ‚ÄòCome on Man, Get Out of Your Basement Joe!‚Äô
They're not going to let this man debate.  Can you imagine?  Just countless tweet threads cleaning up hours of gaffes after each rap battle/roast/debate.  #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
Can't wait to see all the dumber than rocks Trump supporters vote for Kanye to 'Own Biden'.
Democrats are gonna make Biden afraid to open his mouth! They can lock him in the basement, but it‚Äôs gonna be hard to gag him for three months! But, I‚Äôm sure, they‚Äôll do their best!

Well you can send her flowers. You do realize that being First Lady isn't a job right? It just means you're married to the President. They're are QUALIFIED women Biden could pick and not wreck the campaign.
Prediction Strengthened: I predict Biden will nominate Michelle (3rd-Term Barack!) Obama as VP.   Andrea Mitchell's gaffe today, saying "Team Obama" got a big "get" today by bringing Ana Navarro on to...Biden's campaign for Latino outreach is a tell. Andrea Mitchell could know.
Biden will nominate Michelle O. Just watch...
Bidens confirmation made his (Biden‚Äôs) ‚Äúgreen‚Äù handlers (the posse squeeze like a ripe lemon after being rolled. Come on y‚Äôall you can do better than that.
The one thing Joe Biden didn‚Äôt plagiarize, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon man!‚Äù.....Oh wait!
‚ÄúFor President Trump to attack my faith is shameful,‚Äù Biden said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beneath the office he holds and it‚Äôs beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders."
I am still not sure Trump isn‚Äôt going to sacrifice Pence and pick Haley. It would give him both a COVID scapegoat and a woman on the ticket to match Biden.   That said, Biden could pick some rancid meat as his running mate and still have my vote.  #Biden2020
Beautifully done, (President) Biden!!

Kanye and Biden the only people standing up to Trump and Biden flakey as a mf
That was a ton of fluff.  I'll vote for Biden because I believe that he will make the better President. I am right.
If Joe Biden followed me on Twitter, he would know three things. 1) Trust Black Women. 2)My color is a joy not a burden. 3)Black people are not a monolith.
No, Biden thinks Black people THINK the same, not ARE the same. Subtle difference, but still old-skool racist af.

Cardi B Reveals She's Spoken To Joe Biden, Talks VP Candidates
They both mean it. Biden is simply less racist. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
We do not turn a blind eye to racism. We have to vote for the lesser of the two racists since the late 60s. We will continue to do that. Biden is the lesser of the two racists!
Right?! It amazes me how many people were privileged enough to not wake up to these problems until Trump became president. &amp; then they get mad at those who have suffered &amp; learned from experience that things won‚Äôt get any better with Biden.üôÉ
Trump has 84.7 mil followers. Biden has 7.4 mil. Nobody cares about Sniffin' Joe.
They hate trump so much they would put Biden in. The ramifications of a senile commander in chief eludes them

Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?  #SmartNews
Uhm... Biden‚Äôs was today.  And remember the interview when he told black people they ain‚Äôt black if the are confused about who to vote for?  And the little thing about 7-11s.  What did Trump say last week? I think I missed it. You must know since you referenced it.   Do share.
just reported that you will be doing outreach to the Latino community for the Biden campaign, &amp; I think that's great.

Racist Biden: Blacks Are All the Same, Have No Diversity of Thought
Trump is off his rocker to claim that about Biden!  How can he claim to know Biden's relationship to God?

Takes a while to set this up in states that do not already have it. Biden wants to hide, not debate, let others speak for him and choose a woman of color to pander votes.  I am ok with any color, but I would focus on qualification before promising a gender or color.
OPINION: Why Biden's VP pick matters
Mail it in FAST before you get to hear the two candidates debate and hear what they stand for.  Obama is trying to campaign for BIDEN so you don't pay attention to him  Watch out people

All they're doing is lowering debate expectations for Biden.  By the time it's over and he doesn't drool on the moderator he'll have won.
The debate won't happen though. We all know it. The interesting part is how the Dems &amp; MSM will try to blame it on Trump. We all know #Biden #Biden2020 is incompetent.

If you told me 20 years ago that the 2020 election would be between Biden and Trump, I'd wonder if the country was nuts?   And I'd be right, too!
Even if it is a plan for Trump, I got no problem with that, Joe Biden, The clintons, Bill Gates, Obama. Etc need to be a as far away as bc possible
Raise your hand if you voted for Biden regardless of how poor his debates were

If you don't recognize a person suffering for dementia when you see it, you are a very lucky man.  My father died from Alezheimers in 1997, I'd say Biden has two years at best in this world.

Seriously? And you aren't even mad that the media lied to you about Hillary winning. Then again, if you think Biden is a good pick then not much hope for you anyhow

This is why you can't have an honest discussion with leftists, facts don't matter. Joe Biden gas clearly demonstrated severely diminished mental capacity and y'all can't even acknowledge it.
But then again, we have Biden in the basement.  Trump's game plan is in place, we got that.  It's time we know more from the democrat's plan  who's in who's out.
In the world before Jimmy Carter became President, Beirut was known as 'The Riviera of the Middle East.'.  Can't wait to see what Biden has in store for the world.

Which is true.  Even the CIA, FBI, NSA, Barry and Biden couldn't find a lie to pin on him.  How's that Russian collusion Hillary paid for working out for you?
It will be fun to watch.  I'll be honest I could care less who wins.  I love Trump like a brother, I wouldn't want my brother putting up with this abuse 24 x 7.  With Biden as President I can just sit back an laugh, laugh, laugh.
Biden's mindset is to stereotype- Obama , clean, articulate- like that's a one off.  This is latest example- blacks do cocaine- come on man
Joe Biden has been a weather cock his entire career- prevailing winds- Joes your man.
If Donald Trump or Joe Biden lose votes to Kanye. The fault solely lies on them. No candidate is owed any votes.  It‚Äôs kind of ironic how the people who say that Trump is a threat to democracy, are literally advocating for less democracy in regards to Kanye.
CDC has been warning about this, but the Biden Campaign needs an issue to try and attack the Orange Man with.  I'm sure the DemocRATs feel it's an acceptable price for YOUR kids to pay.
My comfort level may just have been reached.  In the past 24 hours, I have heard of another poll putting Biden in a squeaker lead in Georgia.  üòÄ  Enjoy your Tuesday.

I did see a bumper sticker that said obama\biden 2012.  Does that count?  Other than that, no yard signs.
I love your witty sense of humour, my friend. Spot on! I don't think there has ever been a more obviously racist president. Actually, I suspect he hates most of us regardless of colour. I hope Biden chooses well.
Look, Biden would destroy your dad. Your dad is incoherent. Look at the Axios interview.
It‚Äôs a shame Godless DemocRATs try to score political cheapshots off this poor kids loss.  I tried to find this kids GoFund Me page but there are 5 or 10 Biden campaign phishing accounts trying to steal from him.
He needs to worry about Biden being able to stand up for a debate
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt fit because he‚Äôs old and have dementia. That‚Äôs it ?
Every time I get a fundraising text from Biden I text back: Just pick Harris already and I'll give you more money. I don't think it does anything but it makes me feel better.

You have a perception problem. I am neither fat or ugly. Joe Biden is not your savior. You are not healthy.
I predict we will know by November 4th because Florida is used to absentee balloting and if Biden wins there, it's over.
Sean - it‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs afraid of. Biden, living off the few brain cells rattling around in his head, thinks he can take on Trump one on one. His advisers and handlers know better though.

That's terrifying.  Biden wins, there will be blood.
has been my 1st choice for VP since  took Super Tuesday. She will skewer Pence in the debate. She will be a relentless campaigner. She will be as effective a VP to Joe as Joe was to Barack. Pick her, Joe.

Smiling and nodding. I understand your anger though. It must suck waking up everyday knowing Joe Biden is who you place all of your hopes and dreams with. I really hope you can come to terms with your anger, it's gonna be a long 4 years and 91 days.
Nevermind all the destruction just Obama &amp; Biden did in 8 years. None of them are perfect. The President could do good if he wasn't attacked every second of every day.
The fact that Biden is running pushes white supremacy like ain‚Äôt no other more qualified candidates in the entire country that can be president besides him or trump that alone makes Americans chose making suspect coming from a global view old slow and out of touch with the now
It‚Äôs your right to do so. It‚Äôs just the Biden supporters who bully and harass others who don‚Äôt want to vote for him that irritate me.

'because of the expected surge in voter fraud'   There I fixed it for you.  Trump beat Hillary by 10% before the cheating took place in 2016.  He'll have to beat 'You aint Black' Biden by 25% this time.  The neofascist DemocRATs have upped their game.
‚Äúsettle for biden‚Äù is the most disappointing aesthetic instagram info slide i‚Äôve seen yet
'you aint black' Biden was too afraid to leave his basement to attend the Joe Lewis rally.     What's up with dat?
It went very well for the conservatives....we were the union, fighting against slavery. The KKK, and slavery were democratic institutions. Ask Biden how many slaves his family has owned. As for me and my lineage...0
Translation = Dems scared to death Trump will roast Hiden Biden Like an old walnut? Dems gutless to let Biden out of his basement.
Because Biden did oh so much in 50 years?
A polite young man,  clearly articulating his reason for peaceful protest. Probably voting for Biden. Must make his parents and family so proud.

Sacrificed on the alter of the Joe Biden Campaign.  They think it's worth a generation on food stamps if it saves them four more years of President Donald J. Trump.
Biden really doesn't know what is going on. I can't believe anyone would vote for him
The gaps Obama/Biden made larger and Trump/Pence closed.  45 years of doing nothing but lining his own pockets and you idiots want to elect him president.  You can't fix stupid.
That‚Äôs a pic of Biden presidency. He‚Äôll tell the public what they want to hear until he gets back with his handlers to tell him to do something else.
Why did Joe 'you aint black' Biden boycott the John Lewis rally?  Alezheimers acting up and couldn't get out of the basement?  Asking for a friend.
Where are you VP Biden? We are testing for free all over America, and at our private doctors offices ! We have PPE.
So if you support Biden you are a pedo? Or have dementia? Just cause a person supporters someone you don't doesn't make that person nothing but a human with a brain to have their own beliefs. That's what so special about everyone. We are made to be different
They are being sacrificed on the alter of the Biden Campaign.  All their hoaxes up until now have failed to dislodge the President.  Your children's futures ruined, just the price you have to pay for the 'New World Order'.
Still no explanation on why Joe 'you aint black' Biden boycotted the John Lewis rally.   Must have been one of the 'bad days' with his Alezheimers.
if your chosen for v.p god help america bc you and biden will definitely  f . it . up !!
Follow the money.  A new vaccine will generate billions of dollars in profits.  A 50 year old generic drug, virtually nothing.  They are killing us to score cheap political points for the failed Biden Campaign.
Biden is absolutely right. Remember there was a period of time, in the last 3 1/2 years, where some would have been content with a president who could just spell the word ‚Äòscience‚Äô.

Lmao I got blocked too. I was as nice as I could‚Äôve been about itüòÇ it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me when people say that about trump, but worship Biden when there‚Äôs actual video proof of him groping kids.
Biden‚Äôs crew caught up with that vid
I‚Äôm tired of leftist thinking that we can‚Äôt put the same pressure for M4A on a president yang that we can on a president Biden
Joe 'You aint black' Biden will take whoever George Soros tells him to take.
Bernie‚Äôs activists have made it clear they are sitting this one out anyway. Which is what he can do. Sit down. He has done jack squat for the Biden campaign. I get emails from Kamala, Pete, Amy, Beto, Liz, and Cory to support Biden. My emails from Bernie are about Omar and Tlaib.
He‚Äôs not going refuse to debate that dumb ass but even if he did Biden has it hands-down. I don‚Äôt think Biden has to do anything else to win the presidency he could sit in the corner of a room and be punished and he still got a win. Trump is a monster
If the flag is racist why doe John Lewis want one on his casket?  And is this why Joe ‚Äòyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äô Biden boycotted the rally?
Biden, 2020.. I‚Äôm with you brother
Where‚Äôs the proof that trump rapes kids? I‚Äôve seen the videos of Biden groping multiple children, but have only heard rumors about trump. I‚Äôm no fan of either, but interested if you have evidence of trump doing something other than making weird comments.
If Biden showed up with hookers and cocaine at a Motel 6, I would still vote for him.
One of my Republican friends told me the other day that he‚Äôs voting for Biden because he knows that he and Biden are both patriots. I applaud him for that.
Biden and that dementia. Too bad, but look at the bright side. #Trump2020
Biden's pick for VP is more like a pick for who will actually be controlling everything that Biden does. Biden can't remember the days of the week anymore.
VP? The problem is with JOE BIDEN, lol. Losing ticket from the start.
Message to the Kamala Harris cheerleading squad Joe Biden already knows who he is going to select for his VP he knew months ago. All of your cheerleading doesn't really mean anything.
Biden doesn‚Äôt hold rallies, but nice try!
So honest question! Why should I NOT vote for Trump? He sounds less lethal than Biden.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Drop it off in person if you can. But on that ballot, don‚Äôt just vote for Biden over Trump. Vote against the GOP in every down ballot race. Get rid of them. They have been sowing the seeds of dissent and systemically building distrust in government for my entire lifetime. (3/x)
What has Biden done besides getting hos family rich
You are so stuck on that shit you can't look further. Like with things of why Biden had Ukraine prosecutor fired to keep his son from being investigated. Or why Hillary paid for debate questions and the Russia dossier to interfere with presidential elections to win
I'm retired and my brokerage accounts have gone up astronomically since the middle of March.    I'm almost tired of winning...  If Biden is elected I'm selling it all and putting it into Bitcoin.  Then if and when I go it all disappears and the DemocRATs don't get a penny of it.
Lol, then you can‚Äôt be voting for Biden, he can‚Äôt speak without making a gaffe of forgetting what he is saying or even where he is.
Even Biden wants it banned due to national security reasons. China is using it to learn your behaviors.
I still want to know why Joe 'You Aint Black' Biden blew off the John Lewis funeral.
When Biden wins he hires a team that knows how to govern instead of a team to disrupt and destroy. Totally different objectives.
Do research and you'll find Biden wants it banned to for national security reasons.
Would be great, Trump will win with 70% vs Rice/Hiden Biden?
Hiden Joe Biden, scared of news Conferences &amp; scared he will go after some liddle kids to get them to stroke his leg hair or tell him where he is?  Worst most incompetent candidate ever - kudo's Dems?
If Trump sniffs Biden‚Äôs hair during a debate, I‚Äôll vote for Trump. That‚Äôs just the way it is. Sorry. Don‚Äôt  me.
what are 14 year olds gonna do.  as biden would say- come on man- oh man, come on man seriously man
If the neofascist BLM/KKK has taught us anything it is that everyone needs a weapon.  There will not be any police coming to help you with Biden, it' s everyone for themselves.
AMEN! Greg...Biden needs to name the VP so this shit ends, Now!
Yeah, I'm tired of trying to save people that don't want to be saved.  I'm retired if Biden wins and a generation of young people start their careers on food stamps and weed in their parents basement, fine by me.  My family will do just fine.
Are you saying to vote third party? bc Trump and Biden are both assholes
Pelosi, Schumer and Biden should be ashamed to call themselves Americans!
Understand.  Frankly, I really think most of the white people who aren't liberal but support Biden don't really care who he picks. I could be wrong.
Bottom line is the hydrochlor with Zinc &amp; Z pack probably works - but the $ made for Moderna &amp; the shutdown which helps Hiden Biden = probably a concerted collusion by Dems/Pharma/Media to get Trump &amp; Get $?
What a joke, China in order to help Biden &amp; Dems sent the China Virus to USA on purpose - economy was great under Trump unlike Biden/Obama? Far as deaths can thank Dems/China for that snowflakes?
And now the good news. Biden is leading your master in Florida.
So it was just meaningless? You tweet the same way joe Biden talks
Just got my mail in absentee ballot here in the Red State of Georgia! I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden!

Am I the only one to notice Joe 'You Aint Black' Biden boycotted the John Lewis funeral?
Another day &amp; another Congressional hearing in which  made an even bigger fool of himself. Gym wanted to talk about protest crowds but failed to mention political rallies like Tulsa. Given more time he would have covered Page, Strzok &amp; Hunter Biden. Idiot!
A serious question....  Why wasn't Joe 'You Aint Black' Biden at the John Lewis campaign rally?

LOL that would be quite the trick, wouldn't it?  I agree 100% that Obama is the right voice for this country right now, but wouldn't you agree that at some point that needs to become Biden?  BTW Lincoln's skill as an orator was widely known.  The Lincoln-Douglas debates? Legend.
I‚Äôm not voting at all this time around if trump and Biden are the only options. My conscience won‚Äôt let me vote for old, senile pedophiles... So it depends on your perspective. Trump supporters say it‚Äôs a vote for Biden. Biden supporters say it‚Äôs a vote for trump.
This should raise zero dollars, Elizabeth Hipocrit Warren couldn't raise money for her campaign  Grassroots my butt. Trump would beat Biden/ Harris in a landslide
If I got offered tequila and cigars, I'd vote for #Biden.  But I just get offers to meet Elizabeth Warren ü§Æ
Fox will cut away from President Trump if they sense a 'campaign rally'  But if there is a blatant Joe Biden Campaign rally disguised as a funeral they got 'wall to wall'.

#blueMAGA Biden supporters are helping trump win more than any other group of people. Trying to bully anyone who criticizes the senile pedophile they worship.
Just when you thought the Biden Campaign could not get any lower, they start to dig.
Biden can secure election victory with voters who won't admit they're backing him
There are people who have been loyal to Joe Biden for years and they will never get over Kamala Harris accusing him of not wanting her to go to a good school and then starting selling that lame t-shirt. They would accept any VP but not her.
Tearing down people's hope is useless and cruel if you're not going to guide people to a solution. Why destroy what little glimmer of light people have?   Also, Biden is FAR from perfect, but do you genuinely believe he's equivalent to Trump?
And you think Biden is better? ü§£ü§£ü§£! He's a fumbling, bumbling idiot.
I agree with Ryan. I don‚Äôt think Biden is any better than Trump. And a ton of people blame Bernie supporters for trump winning bc we didn‚Äôt support Hillary soon enough I guess. Who knows
Uhhhhh,seriously??we all love ND ,but Biden, Pelosi and Schumer are true idiots....JMO
he rule was one of the worst abuses of the Obama-Biden administration ‚Äî a raw power grab masquerading as racial justice.
IKR, that Joe Biden is great
My understanding is it‚Äôs Hillary again, Biden‚Äôs a prop.

Trump and Biden‚Äôs kids all went into the family business. And they all got rich.
It depends on who‚Äôs in the whitehouse! 45 will make it difficult for Democratic governors/states to get the vaccine, He will sell it! Biden will share it with the world.
Why would someone be hiding their vote. The man is literally President. Feel like there‚Äôs more secret Biden voters than a trump voters
Joe Biden is a racist pig. Always has been. Not sure why anyone would believe what his handlers tweet for him  you know the tweets are the handlers because they may be stupid but at least they‚Äôre coherent.
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
Hmm, I prayed to God, queried Her regarding this latest preposterous claim of Trump's - She was quite bewildered. She replied that Her servant Joe has been a most devout follower.   "Trailing in election polls, Trump says rival Biden is 'against God'"
It‚Äôs like they have us over a barrel! We‚Äôre sures hell not voting for Trump so all that‚Äôs left is Biden and he‚Äôs not right for America either. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unfair that 4 states decided who would be the democratic candidate for the whole country!  How are we ok with this?
Biden could pick a potted plant as his VP and I would still vote for him.  Really do we care that much?  All the finalists are great and would be better than DJT or Pence by like 1000x.  The end.
You will never have an administration!
Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.
My view is that Biden isn't a super exciting candidate, neither was HRC.. so maybe someone with a little more sparkle would be better than someone more "meh".  But the environment is different, so it might not matter.
I tend to agree that Kaine, while a great person, was a bland pick.  But Tom is likely right that it might not have mattered. However, someone more progressive might have smoothed the Bern Bros over.  Biden faces the same issue, theoretically, but the environment is different.
He also inherited that economy from Biden. Also Biden has co sponsored bills that have helped many Americans such as Disablities act and finance regulations. Also made some mistakes but everyone does, senators aren‚Äôt high profile like presidents.

He literally is not running on his accomplishments. Please show me where‚Äôs he‚Äôs running on the economy (which is shit right now). The only thing that he possibly is running on is the wall (which isn‚Äôt built) and saying Biden has dementia but is also a left wing radical
Yeah, because Biden is so very eloquent, HES an obvious choice #meh
Biden wants to meet God in a parking lot in Temecula.
There you go again fear mongering. Biden has not said he would take away guns.
So it seems we‚Äôre stuck with the lesser of two racists? Picking dumb or dumber? Biden was supposed to know how to stick to a script and not make these stupidly ridiculous off the wall comments on things he really shouldn‚Äôt be talking about! Can we just get Bernie? Is it to late?
Joe Biden is a lifelong Catholic and Trump couldn‚Äôt accurately quote John 3:16 but subtle dog whistle my dude
No, I don't agree with Biden, I don't view all blacks as monolith.  We were used as a qualifier, to "advance" how "diverse" the Latinx community is.
Joe Biden really just called Blacks monolith. All the same, no diversity.   That old fucker really don't want our votes.

Haha Misha I love you. Indeed it should be Keep.. if he had actually done anything to make us better. I'm voting for Biden :) #RepublicansForBiden #changeiscoming
Or with Trump taking action (e.g. China travel ban) in late January and all the left (including Biden) freaking out.
Tf is Biden supposed to do
Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.
Are you  trying to give Joe Biden a gift? No, absolutely not, we need to see how a candidate can handle the pressure BEFORE he could be president.
"Assault Rifles" have been banned since 1986. Biden's administration doesn't know the definition of Assault Weapons nor know anything at all.
Joe Biden won 17.6 million votes and the Democratic primary by ignoring twitter pundits and doing stuff like this. Might be something to think about before you fire off your hot take trashing it
For those who believe these polls, they have tightened significantly. I wonder why? Be that as it may, maybe this is why the Left doesn't want Joe Biden to debate...ü§î
Biden refuses to debate until there‚Äôs a COVID-19 vaccine.
I feel I should mention that I do actually like Joe Biden.
Trump will double the Black vote from 2016; 6% to 12%. Fact. #TrumpLandslide

Biden at a virtual fundraiser with Atlanta Mayor  today: ‚ÄúIt would be a hell of a win. But if we come close in Georgia, we probably will help elect a couple Democratic senators.  We elect a congressman. We elect up and down the line. And we have to build our bench.‚Äù
Oh MY GOD enough with this sexist trope.  Joe Biden never registered in presidential primaries either!  FFS he lost two of them.. never got into the top echelon.  Please stop with this misogynistic trash.
That is exactly right! My Grandmothers both died from dementia. It is definitely a part of the disease. His wife and the Democratic Party should be ashamed of themselves! This is elder abuse! I have no respect for Biden, but the Dems are using him for power!
You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs a shame Biden used that word.
He's a beard for the Obama Bros behind the scenes. Whoever the VP is will be the real POTUS. And Biden will resign within 12 months.
Given his state of mind Biden would,probably say ‚Äúhold my diaper‚Äù!
In fact, when you include Kanye in polls, Biden‚Äôs margin grows and his share stays the same, but Trump‚Äôs share shrinks. Kanye doesn‚Äôt hurt Biden - he hurts Trump

Should Biden win, he'll be running on the most progressive platform in modern history. None of this will be fixed overnight, but I'm confident in our ability to get things done.

My fellow Sesame Street fans &amp; 90s guys with autism, I urge you to gather in Delaware to tell Biden that we want federal funding for Big Bird!  We want federal funding for Sesame Street‚Äôs initiatives, especially its autism initiative!
With Biden not getting anything significant done.
If you added up every Biden gaffe, you'd still have the equivalent of just one Trump press briefing.
Safe to say that  is floundering badly in his reelection campaign. The fact that his staff doesn't care to see it, will only serve to help  win in a landslide
We need 5 seats to retake the senate (only 4 if Biden wins). North Carolina and Montana seem like good bets.
Obama/Clinton/Biden incompetency comes from the total eclipse of common sense and decency by unparalleled levels of arrogance. Hence the stupidest most obvious ‚Äúspying scheme ‚Äú of all time
I think Biden should agree to debates only if both candidates can be fact checked in real time. I know Trump would never agree to this because he can‚Äôt tell the truth
Nope, definitely a Biden.
And all his cult is out there talking about how people are trying to hide Biden... odds Trump does another interview like this anytime soon?
How can I catch all of Carmen Sandiego‚Äôs crooks across the US if Trump keeps making the federal government &amp; even all of my fellow ACME detectives look bad?!  Biden, all of my fellow ACME detectives &amp; I need you!  #Biden2020 #TrumpPenceOutNow #RemoveTrumpNow

Imagine this still being your only defense after that brain dead interview given by Trump.   Many crtisism of Biden would work if Trump didn‚Äôt fully embody every single one of them (not being mentally capable, pedofile, puppet for foreign leaders, ‚Äúthis is Biden‚Äôs America ‚Äú)
That seems like a pretty good scenario Biden gets to be president of the west coast.
I don't doubt it.  But if most are conservative they aren't really Biden voters anyway.  My point is there will be negatives for any of the VP candidates, and I don't think it will ultimately matter in the final analysis. The election is about Trump.
Look, whoever Biden picks articles like this will be written.  I do not think Bass is the strongest choice, but in the end, people are going to bitch about whoever it is.
Because if Biden is winning FL, he's also probably winning MI, PA, WI, and AZ.
If Florida is called on election night in Biden's favor, the race is essentially over.
One problem is that the enthusiasm to vote against Trump is significant. Biden appears to be suffering by significant cognitive decline and there is absolutely no concern about it at all.
Why don‚Äôt you have concerns about Biden‚Äôs cognition?
If this bothers you (and I am bothered by it) but you are unconcerned about Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive issues then you are acting like a hack.
You insist that Trump‚Äôs re-election wouldn‚Äôt be materially worse than Biden winning. There is no comparison. Trump is uniquely unfit - intellectually, morally, temperamentally and cognitively.
Informative article. How will the Christians fare under a President Biden - it is my understanding that he shares Obama‚Äôs views on the Islamic Republic?

Just one poll. State polling looks much better for Biden
Delaware is not a swing state either, you could have argued the same exact thing about Biden in 2008.  I just don't recall those arguments about him.  Honestly, what is the difference?
LOL the coordinated protection of Biden is so transparent

The fact is, Biden is 77.  This VP really could become POTUS.  FFS we want one of our heavy hitters who is ready on day one, and that won't be a wallflower.  These men need to get over themselves.
No.... it has to be Biden....
My FB account got restricted for 30 days for posting some meme with Creepy Joe Biden hugging kids. They called it sexually explicit content.
It was laughable listening left loon Rep Duckworth on Chris Wallace suggest we need Biden for of all things to be tough on Russia. I guess Biden Will send her over there with a stupid clock with a red re set button.
And if Biden loses?
Barack Obama chose Joe Biden to be his VP on August 23, 2008. Two days before the DNC. It's not atypical to wait for those things...

Meanwhile, Gov. Roy Cooper who refused to host the RNC in Charlotte, NC without social distancing, now enjoys a healthy 20-point lead in his race, which bodes well for Biden and Cal Cunningham.
Both Covid and the protests have put Trump in a precarious situation where he has fewer and fewer paths to 270 electoral votes, while Biden has multiple paths.
I've believed all along that debates would never come off. The Dems are scared to death that Biden's deteriorating mental condition would be exposed in any such forum. It's too bad, but they really should have him step aside to preserve his dignity. He deserves that.
If Biden doesn't debate, he loses. If he does debate, he loses...üòÇ
Simply put - if Biden doesn't debate, he loses. If he does debate, he loses...üòÇ
MI shouldn't be too hard after Trump got in a fight with Whitmer. And being that he was born in Scranton, I think Biden has a slight home team advantage.
If you added up all of Joe Biden's gaffes, you'd have the equivalent to ONE Trump press briefing.
While the lead WILL narrow, I think Biden can keep doing what he's been doing all the way until the debate. Why waste energy/time fighting with Trump for the airways, when Trump continues to tank his own political standing just by talking?
I know Biden isn't everyone's cup of tea, but fact is Trump is struggling against him in part because he can't easily attack or define him like with Hilary, Bernie, or the squad...
Biden doesn't need to convert all of those voters. He just needs to chip away at them.
Biden at this point has multiple paths to 270. Trump's problem is that he has fewer and fewer as the race progresses.
Never said he did? You asked for something and I showed you. I still have yet to see something similar from ardent Biden supporters
Perhaps. But it doesn‚Äôt make the point on Biden any less valid. It‚Äôs not mutually exclusive. It‚Äôs quite sad that we have these two idiots as our choices‚Ä¶..
Yes, if that is your summary, but the outcome is the same, #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  And if that gives me a Black female VP then absolutely that is what's happening. M'kay? Now vote Biden please. Or not. But don't pretend this is a regular election where we can choose.
Nowhere did it say the guy was an avid Biden supporter like this video shows.   Of course, you‚Äôll just start assuming because ‚Äúradical leftist Joe Biden ‚Äú or something like that
Seen a lot of videos. None have had people say ‚ÄúI love Biden and I‚Äôm a white supremist‚Äù then have the guy slapping a woman  If you show me a video even similar I‚Äôd be surprised, you likely can‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt yet
Show me a video like this but with Biden
And even after trump is gone, Prince and those like him will still be trying to undermine democracy in America. Assuming Biden wins, we'll be able to take a much deserved break, but the fight to preserve democracy will continue come 2022 and beyond.
Biden is a beard for the real POTUS. He will resign inside of a year.
2028 DNC: We believe that the overly idealist left-wing ideology of Biden lead to the victory of a man like Facerape Boneeater.  That is why our nominee is a moderate realist with a long track record of progressive policy.  Ladies and gentlemen, candidate Lindsay Graham.
- Sad your leaving.   You should not have been following the Clinton playbook.   Have a break in another country to clear your head.  Ask Biden or HRC for places to stay in China.

That won‚Äôt be possible until 2024 and Biden won‚Äôt remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
Until Biden is removed, you‚Äôre going to continue to forget.
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
In the Trump era, it‚Äôs quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the ‚Äúgaffe master‚Äù title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his ‚Äúgaffes‚Äù now that ‚Äúsays what he means‚Äù is important to the electorate

Neal- like many of my friends, I‚Äôm feeling pretty nervous about this one. We all need to put our heads together and figure out what we do next if Biden wins. I wish there was a way to get at our 401k and IRA money without feeding the potential next administrations. Leave USA???
Is it me? Or was it obvious to everyone, Biden pre arranged which reporters he would call on, what  the questions were going to be,  and was able to answer with notes. At his presser yesterday.
I'll feel safe if Biden has a national lead in votes of 4%+. Nervous between 3-4%. Anything within 3% and I think we see a 2016 repeat
Also. Not sure why people are getting mad at Biden for condemning people who take advantage of protests to riot and break shit.Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump.

Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.

‚ÄúIf you are have trouble deciding whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù -Joe Biden
No, he clearly talks now and always have down to that community. That is the very definition of a racists. Biden trues to act woke and cool to pretend he‚Äôs engrained within that community so it gives him a pass to say these things. To allow that is to enable a racists.
I‚Äôm gonna keep saying this til I‚Äôm blue in the face‚ÄîUse Biden as a stepping stone for radical change the same way he has used POC as a stepping stone for his political gain.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!

Tbh Dems can take black voters for granted. Biden will get 90% of black voters minimum.
This is undeniable true.  And still Trump may lose to a tired dementia patient.  How is this possible?  An endless stream of tweets.  And most recently the Axios interview which was Biden level incoherent.  If a CEO did what Trump has done they would have been fired long ago.
So wait, is Trump suggesting Biden is more powerful that God?
You guys think it‚Äôs all about money. Silver and The Economist and that MSNBC douche say it‚Äôs a Biden landslide
Wait! Doesn‚Äôt Quinnipiac have Biden up big?
Black lives matter but the support of that organization is basically paying Joe Biden &amp; the Democratic Party. Again, as before, the blacks have been hijacked &amp; used. I'm sure its Trump's fault...just ask
Why would someone be hiding their vote. The man is literally President. Feel like there‚Äôs more secret Biden voters than a trump voters
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
You know I never thought of that. I think he should run on that. Maybe he can blame Biden for COVID.  Biden made it in a lab and presto he did it. Yes and he did this at a Pizza place.
Basement Biden's latest brand of idiotic and insensitive racism...basically saying that Blacks all think the same, while Latinos are more diversified in their way of thinking. Totally false and insulting on a number of levelsüò©ü§•.  Biden keeps digging his own political defeat.
He said he supported redirecting the funds. Are you going to claim this is different. I've checked a bunch of your BS fact checks and you aren't really getting it done. I guess this is just for entertainment purposes. Your work on Biden vs Extortion 17 and outing the Seals is BS.
You know these are not Biden's words of apology bc he doesn't use the phrase "Man, you know..."
Wait, have you literally not listened to Biden this week. Good Gawd his almost gone.
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
Now do Biden‚Äôs zooms.
Joe Biden has the mindset of a Plantation Owner! How anybody can vote for him is inconceivable. He would confuse Russian people with Chinese people. So sad to watch this happen in real time!
They are digging their hole. They don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs all virtue signaling. Biden days y‚Äôall all think the same. He‚Äôs right with Pro sports.
I love this. Lol. Biden digging his hole deeper into dementia daily.
In 2016 MI Primary: 1.3M votes in Republican and 1.2M for Democrats. *i think Biden has MI locked
Hmm, I prayed to God, queried Her regarding this latest preposterous claim of Trump's - She was quite bewildered. She replied that Her servant Joe has been a most devout follower.   "Trailing in election polls, Trump says rival Biden is 'against God'"
It‚Äôs like they have us over a barrel! We‚Äôre sures hell not voting for Trump so all that‚Äôs left is Biden and he‚Äôs not right for America either. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unfair that 4 states decided who would be the democratic candidate for the whole country!  How are we ok with this?
You should run, man. F* the DNC. If Biden bails on the debates claiming it's because of "covid concerns", get back in and say you'll debate Trump. Trump will do it. You know he would.
Will be interesting to see how long Biden‚Äôs coattails are. Seeing this A LOT
He also inherited that economy from Biden. Also Biden has co sponsored bills that have helped many Americans such as Disablities act and finance regulations. Also made some mistakes but everyone does, senators aren‚Äôt high profile like presidents.
Like Biden starting a race war with his own base?  Like that behavior?
"Harris isn't as good a campaigner as people think, so Biden should pick someone who has never campaigned for elected office." It's a take, I guess.
Biden is not Catholic He believes in abortion

Democrats supporting Joe Biden.
Trump humiliated his religious followers, especially Catholics, by insinuating they are stupid enough to think that Biden will hurt God. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Repugs put the final nail in their coffin by rushing to get Kanye on the ballot, implying black folks would vote for him cos he‚Äôs black.
Biden NEVER had my vote  ‚Äê  SEE WHY below ‚§µÔ∏è Biden concluded ‚Äúthe President‚Äôs plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.‚Äù 1989
At least he noticed, and corrected it. Biden would keep saying it wrong to convince you, that you‚Äôre wrong.
After Biden‚Äôs comments the past two days, she‚Äôs got the wrong dude. Biden‚Äôs alwYs been racist. He just thinks he‚Äôs woke enough to be one of them. Good luck with this racists AF cat.
I don't think ANYONE will believe that Biden doesn't "have a Religion"or know the Bible
We need the debates so we can honestly look at where Biden is at. That way we go into a Biden presidency eyes wide open.
With Biden you get the far left agenda and a senile old coot.
Biden couldn‚Äôt get 1% of the vote the last 2 times he ran for president!  You  libs are gonna cry worse than you did in 2016!!!
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.
Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic will hurt God says this guyüëáüèº
The "point" of America as a melting-pot is all that historical crap is meaningless and is just politics to divide and victimize.  Jim Crow is not a "culture".  It is a historic fact.  Biden views minorities as mascots to pander to.  I would rather he consider us equally Americans
Is Joe Biden working for Kanye?
Apparently bein Hunter Biden also makes you a junkieü§´
Do you ever quit?  Relentless criticism. Has Biden uttered a coherent sentence today?
Biden‚Äôs has 6 less chins and normal sized pupils for starters.
Oh, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don‚Äôt question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, Americaüëéüèº
He literally is not running on his accomplishments. Please show me where‚Äôs he‚Äôs running on the economy (which is shit right now). The only thing that he possibly is running on is the wall (which isn‚Äôt built) and saying Biden has dementia but is also a left wing radical
I just don‚Äôt think Biden has it in him. Even w/o his dimentia, he has no passion.
I don't know why Yang doesn't come right out and say "fuck yall, I'm running with or without your endorsement".  I *guarantee* if Yang was to debate Trump, which we know Biden plans to avoid, people would immediately realize Yang is the actual candidate. Sorry, DNC.
OMG. When are MAGAs going to figure out their hero is Jim Jones  5 till midnight. Whatever cookies he had are gone. BTW, Joe  Biden is a lifelong Catholic.
If Joe Biden wins the election, BLM and ANTIFA will be running the country.
every time i hear one of the trumps call biden "sleepy joe" it reminds me of a kindergartener making fun of the kid who actually sleeps during nap time üò¥
If she cared about racism, she‚Äôd denounce Biden‚Äôs past 2 days of comments.
You actually know Joe Biden personally and have had a window to his soul. What‚Äôs wrong with YOU!? Put your party aside and show some fucking loyalty to someone who‚Äôs been nothing but loyal to your family. Shame on you.
There you go again fear mongering. Biden has not said he would take away guns.
Wait, if Biden can hurt God how does a mortal (trash) like Trump can win against him?!
So it seems we‚Äôre stuck with the lesser of two racists? Picking dumb or dumber? Biden was supposed to know how to stick to a script and not make these stupidly ridiculous off the wall comments on things he really shouldn‚Äôt be talking about! Can we just get Bernie? Is it to late?
Given Biden's lack of respect for us, I wouldn't be surprised at this point...
Biden just needs to run ads with him and prominent 80‚Äôs tv vehicles. Kit, Airwolf, A-Team Van, Magnum PI car, Chips motorcycle
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
They say laughter is the best medicine, I think this is Joe Biden's "improvement" to Obamacare. To his credit, it's a top tier bit.
This tweet wins Twitter today. DJ making fun of Biden for implying the black community is not diverse while simultaneously stating the result will be the loss of the entire black community.
Biden is just getting warmed up. Wait til the 70‚Äôs Biden really gets cranked up.
How do you square this against what Biden is saying?  Is he a bigot or senile?
Y‚Äôall better start covering Biden‚Äôs last 2 racists days. Unreal over there.
Biden: "Blacks lack diversity."  Me: "What. The F-ck".
I want just one dem, with a straight face, to tell me that they honestly believe Biden is writing these tweets.
More Jolt: Georgia's state labor commissioner nixes meeting with Senate Democrats over slow processing of unemployment benefits, claiming protests have been "near riots" and alleging threats to target his home ... #gapol
Yet Biden just keeps throwing POC gaffes right and left.
Sadly Trump and his team are not listening to you. And it wouldn't matter. Also sadly Trump has demonstrated over 3 1/2 year he is either unwilling or incapable of acting Presidential. The Axios interview was as incorrect as Biden. How about a write-in campaign for Ted Cruz?
"Racist Luray, Virginia Mayor Barry Presgraves urged to resign after saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP" #VaPol #Luray #Virginia #BLACKLIVESMATTER
Biden is a nut job. Must concur
You‚Äôre triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
She contradicted previous testimony, meaning she lied. She also lied to cover for Biden's role. And she, thankfully, rolled Comey under the bus. This ain't over, and you know it. The truth will be brought to light.
Have you watched Biden at all?  Its just mean to keep him around. He needs to live out his days fiahing or whatever. He's done.
No matter your color, race, sexual preference or gender preference a vote for Joe Biden will ruin your grandchildren‚Äôs future. Think about the ramifications of what the Democrats are proposing for our country... DON‚ÄôT BE STUPID!
If Biden had that control, he himself wouldn‚Äôt be quarantined in his own basement
Once Biden wins the virus will magically disappear
If Biden wins, the Constitution will be shredded, and BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in America, second only to the US military.
I cannot believe Biden is the democratic nominee. He is clearly losing his mind! I predict whoever he picks will likely fill his seat in the near future.
If Joe Biden wins the election, BLM and ANTIFA will become the most powerful organizations in the country, second only to the Military. BLM already owns the riot cities and professional sports. They are extorting money from Cuban restaurants in Miami. That will only spread.
I‚Äôm not a Trump fan. He‚Äôs an idiot. Not as big as an idiot as Biden, but an idiot. How does mask data not mean anything? If masks are the key to other countries success, and we wear them more, how does that work?
Yes, and I agree that can't be simply dismissed as "his style". My conspiracy theory... What I see is a man in decline enjoying his retirement. The DNC came knocking and convinced him to run after he said no. This is about the first woman POTUS and Biden gets POTUS in his bio.
They don‚Äôt need to know Biden, they don‚Äôt like you. #Hamilton
Maybe.  Biden also said he was going to an acceptant speech in WI.
I feel so bad for Biden. I wanna protect him like I would a grandpa üò≠ But he should definitely not be the President of the United States
Man people on the right really don't get it. Nobody is saying give Biden the nuclear arsenal. They are saying take it away from Trump. By any means necessary. I don't think you realize their seething rage towards him, but it is the cornerstone of their political position.
Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
Or with Trump taking action (e.g. China travel ban) in late January and all the left (including Biden) freaking out.
Tf is Biden supposed to do
Everyone in the public eye has ‚Äúnegatives‚Äù of some kind. There are always those who find something to pick at. Not endorsing either Harris or Rice, I truly don‚Äôt care. Biden has my vote if he picks a dauchshound. Trump must go!
Yet, Biden can‚Äôt speak. But sure, ok guys.
Are you  trying to give Joe Biden a gift? No, absolutely not, we need to see how a candidate can handle the pressure BEFORE he could be president.
Exactly. Time to dump  for not prepping Biden with this perfect response and hire a real street fighter.
We need Joe Biden more than anything NOW
At the last minute, President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, are searching for places to impressively yet safely accept their parties' presidential nominations as the spread of the coronavirus adds uncertainty to the campaigns.
That‚Äôs why Biden is getting 454 EVs. Orange Man Bad!
got a video idea for you. Mash up Biden‚Äôs video with the corvette and trump in play drive the semi-truck
Biden refuses to debate until there‚Äôs a COVID-19 vaccine.
I think Bernie could win. Trump has enough negatives. At least Bernie is coherent. Seriously, if you are trying to decide between not voting or voting for Biden I think that decision would be easier with Bernie. And really Bernie isn't a Democrat, so they would push back on him.
Trump will double the Black vote from 2016; 6% to 12%. Fact. #TrumpLandslide
Well somewhat you let Biden be "the voice" of the people so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ok
This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.
Biden at a virtual fundraiser with Atlanta Mayor  today: ‚ÄúIt would be a hell of a win. But if we come close in Georgia, we probably will help elect a couple Democratic senators.  We elect a congressman. We elect up and down the line. And we have to build our bench.‚Äù
You guys are trying everything you can to get Biden out of the debates, aren't you? Hey, we've seen him talk. We don't blame you.
You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs a shame Biden used that word.
Lol. Professor famous for correctly predicting the winner of 24 of the last 26 presidential elections, including Trump‚Äôs win in 2016, predicts Trump beats Biden 362 to 176 with a 91% re-election chance.
The Biden Effect? Sympathy vote

My fellow Sesame Street fans &amp; 90s guys with autism, I urge you to gather in Delaware to tell Biden that we want federal funding for Big Bird!  We want federal funding for Sesame Street‚Äôs initiatives, especially its autism initiative!
The people who believe Joe Biden is hiding need to be shown proof of his activity, otherwise they will believe Fox‚Äôs lies. I would be showing Joe walking down a long ramp, climbing a tree, climbing a ladder, a utility pole, etc., all with running commentary. Why do we do nothing?
I guess the rumors that Biden would pick Karen were ... off-Bass.  I will see myself out.
And this isn‚Äôt the first time they have used images of Biden praying or in quiet contemplation to infer that he is sleepy or lacks stamina. It is SOP for the Trump team.
I hope it fill the Biden team with a dread of what is going to happen should their be disappointment.
A fabulous call! Stay WELL, Mr. President-to-be so that you can get elected and get that asshole Trump evicted... "Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC because of coronavirus concerns"
Biden has COVID?
Some fundamental changes to the parties are needed. The party does not control who runs, the people select the candidate based on the rules. The candidate rights the platform. I know why Trump in 16 Why Biden in 20? Dem voters were going to send a socialist or a dementia patient?
Yes. We have no choice. If Biden is elected your freedom goes out the window
I think Biden has what is called pix disease it‚Äôs a very serious brain issue
Yet Biden does another disaster of an interview.
i‚Äôm shocked when I see cocky trump cultists that are genuinely excited about the debates between the cheeto and  All their boy knows how to do is insult and lie. He‚Äôs genuinely stupid. All Biden has to do is stay calm and let donny hang himself.
The media is t trying to convince anyone of an upcoming Biden blowout. They are reporting on poll results and always saying anything could happen.
Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP  via
I think Biden should agree to debates only if both candidates can be fact checked in real time. I know Trump would never agree to this because he can‚Äôt tell the truth
What usually happens with egregious Hatch Act violations is the person gets fired. That's not going to happen with this administration, of course. There's also the possibility of a $1,000 fine and it would be giggle-worthy for Biden's DOJ to go after Miller and McEnany.
Nope, definitely a Biden.
Seems no sane person would even say or imply that Biden is anything but demented.  That‚Äôs how utterly political everyone and everything is now.
How can I catch all of Carmen Sandiego‚Äôs crooks across the US if Trump keeps making the federal government &amp; even all of my fellow ACME detectives look bad?!  Biden, all of my fellow ACME detectives &amp; I need you!  #Biden2020 #TrumpPenceOutNow #RemoveTrumpNow
He was probably projecting about Hunter Biden. By the way, where is he?

Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on 0.
LOL have you let Biden know yet?
This had me so tickled I will be thinking of Mrs Thomas when I cast my vote for Biden!
During my lunch break today, I just got really angry thinking about what if Biden went with some other non-black non-entity, a Tim Kaine if you will.  The stress, it gets to you.
Hi Dawn nice to see you on line. Hope all is well and you are staying safe!
The smell of desperation in the Trump camp is palpable. All that President P*ssy Grabber's media loyalists can do is take missed jabs at Biden's character and it's just sad. I've yet to see one of these pundits take a legitimate shot at Bidens credibility or qualifications.
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency
Great debate between Gov. Huckabee, Judge Jeanine and Sean Hannity on the Democrats self-destructive plans for Joe Biden to potentially skip the Presidential Debates.
You have to be at least 150 feet away from any building where voting takes place. That includes wearing a Trump or Biden shirt or hat. Otherwise, I don't think they can keep you away. Same rule applies to weapons.
It‚Äôs hard to believe anyone at this point but vote Biden.
That you think Biden is the choices of two evils?
Democratic Party may be replacing Joe Biden you heard here first people.
If  was an ACME SenateNet agent &amp; helped us catch Carmen Sandiego‚Äôs crooks in the 90s, all of my fellow ACME detectives should vote for Biden!  Only Trump would make the entire ACME Detective Agency look bad!  #TrumpPenceOutNow #Biden2020
As President, would Biden welcome back people who were deported by ICE and separated from their families for minor crimes? Watching the ICE documentary on Netflix really makes me feel for these families.
No you have no clue how we think and that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre mind is closed to facts and truth. You‚Äôre candidate is suffering from dementia. There‚Äôs no way he should be president of anything. Name one thing Biden has accomplished in his 50 yrs in office!
Remember when Trump called the town of Paradise, Pleasure? Repeatedly. If you're going to play the Joe Biden game, be prepared for all the 1000s of remember when Trump...
I‚Äôm sure they will book Biden so they can ask him his favorite color.
DTJ, Biden can barley put a coherent sentence together, of course they don‚Äôt want debates. The DNC should face jail time for elder abuse! I sure hope reasonable people will see what‚Äôs going on and vote Trump 2020. May God Bless America!
Imagine this still being your only defense after that brain dead interview given by Trump.   Many crtisism of Biden would work if Trump didn‚Äôt fully embody every single one of them (not being mentally capable, pedofile, puppet for foreign leaders, ‚Äúthis is Biden‚Äôs America ‚Äú)
Biden will make this 1,000 times worse.

Democrats: Trump is so stupid when you hear him talk!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Also Democrats: We cannot let Joe Biden get on stage with that man.
It's the latest thing. Get Biden out of the debates but try to make it look like Trump's fault.
Same way some ppl listen to Biden and believe he is competent to lead the country. That is whenever he emerges from his basement to which he quickly returns.
Sounds like Joe Biden a wee bit does he?
A MUST!   I like Susan Rice. She is a smart, sharp, and classy lady!  I saw her on The View. They asked her about Benghazi. She gave the perfect answer.   She is a team player willing to do whatever it takes for Biden to be successful no matter what capacity that may be!
Biden will skip debates because Biden can‚Äôt debate.  I hate Trump btw.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Trump's base Does. Not. Matter. He can have his unshakeable 35% of the vote; Biden has a bigger base than that plus a huge anti-Trump vote. What matters are swing voters, the 10% persuadable. Right now it's 51-40, so Trump would need at least 80% and they favor BLM over the feds.

Explain what the Green New Deal would mean to loss of JOBS in effected states, Ronna.  THAT has more meaning to folks.  And above ALL, talk about the ONLY thing that really matters...the loss of freedom and the institutionalization of tyranny that Biden brings on his coattails.
Then no reason Biden shouldn't do an interview with Wallace, right?
Don‚Äôt forget that when Biden finally bows out for health reasons the Democrats may very well choose Andrew Cuomo as either the presidential or vice presidential candidate.
Joe Biden needs new advisors. You would be a great choice.
Joe biden couldn't debate a grape. He can't have a conversation. He can't even say a sentence clearly. He can't even read a teleprompter without help.  His seat in office has been for sale the last 4 decades. The Communist party is trying one last time but he's all used up.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Did Twitter tell you which rule? I always ask and they never tell me. Frustrating
You don‚Äôt have to close your app. Just wait about 1 min then you can follow a few more. At least that is what worked for me.
According to a blog   If you use up your 100 API calls in the hour then you will see the ‚Äúrate limit exceeded‚Äù   Twitter must be having issues as I know I didn‚Äôt make 100 API calls in hour as I just recently got back onto Twitter about 30 minutes ago
That‚Äôs exactly the message I am getting!
I keep getting ‚ÄúRate Limit Exceeded‚Äù then the message goes away and all is fine. Very strange.   I thought I might have still been shadow banned!
What?!? HRC has a brand like non other seen in modern day politics and a religious following! Biden doesn‚Äôt nearly have that.
Just look it up. Obama became the presumptive nominee in early June 2008 when Clinton finally dropped out so that‚Äôs a little more than 2 1/2 months to the VP pick. Bernie dropped out in early April so it will have been more than 4 months before Biden announces a VP pick
But when was it clear in 2008 that Obama would be the nominee versus when it became clear Biden would be the nominee this year. Keep in mind Clinton drug out the primary process for a while 12 years ago. Biden has clearly been the nominee for like 4 months now
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt running for office. He is simply a placeholder for Planned Chaos so Pelosi to step up once ballots aren‚Äôt counted.

Remember when you called Joe Biden a racist during the debates? That was awesome.
So a debate would be for 5) undecided between Trump and Biden I am convinced this group is a myth.   If Trump weren't a grade A jerk he may have had a shot at creating this group. But it doesn't exist today.
Who needs to be convinced of what?  No debate required for 1) will vote for Trump 2) will vote for Biden  What about 3) may vote Trump or 3rd party or stay home 4) may vote Biden... Well this group doesn't need a debate. They need the individual candidates to present their cases.

For decades, China has been paying off members of Congress (Feinstein), industry, education. When Obama came into office, the number of people being paid off grew (Biden, for one). The trickle became a flood.  Cut off the money, prosecute those bought - END this problem!!

TI got rich misleading poor uneducated minorities. Telling them they could never make the money he made off of capitalism. Rap music has been controlling the minds of youth and adult minorities for decade's. That's why Biden said "or u ain't black" they are used to this criteria
I'm still willing to bet you that it is Biden who doesn't show up to the debates. Why won't you respond?
If Biden had any potential to serve two terms, people probably wouldn't get so wound up about the VP pick. It's historically a much weaker role than the major cabinet jobs. Susan Rice hasn't run for anything, and I want somebody who can run HARD in 2024.
I still say Biden's main handler is Obama.
Somebody else is behind this. Biden is incapable of thinking this much. I suspect it's Obama.

No. We are not Marxist. We are not communist. If we are accused of being racist cause we support Trump, then every Biden supporter is a Marxist.

Obama was a high energy transformative, once in a generation, young candidate with an MLK like speaking capability. Don‚Äôt think Biden is remotely close.
Biden needs to just go ahead and pick a running mate already. He was effusively the nominee in late March/early April. It‚Äôs August now and he still hasn‚Äôt named his running mate and there are reports that he may delay the announcement by another week#StrongerTogether #ResistersUnite   Vet, follow and retweet! #Biden

Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.
My view is that Biden isn't a super exciting candidate, neither was HRC.. so maybe someone with a little more sparkle would be better than someone more "meh".  But the environment is different, so it might not matter.
I tend to agree that Kaine, while a great person, was a bland pick.  But Tom is likely right that it might not have mattered. However, someone more progressive might have smoothed the Bern Bros over.  Biden faces the same issue, theoretically, but the environment is different.

Biden may not be the best choice for Dems, but he is not crazy. Anyone who thinks so is an idiot.

I don't doubt it.  But if most are conservative they aren't really Biden voters anyway.  My point is there will be negatives for any of the VP candidates, and I don't think it will ultimately matter in the final analysis. The election is about Trump.

Meanwhile, Gov. Roy Cooper who refused to host the RNC in Charlotte, NC without social distancing, now enjoys a healthy 20-point lead in his race, which bodes well for Biden and Cal Cunningham.

While the lead WILL narrow, I think Biden can keep doing what he's been doing all the way until the debate. Why waste energy/time fighting with Trump for the airways, when Trump continues to tank his own political standing just by talking?
I know Biden isn't everyone's cup of tea, but fact is Trump is struggling against him in part because he can't easily attack or define him like with Hilary, Bernie, or the squad...
Maybe Biden waiting to interview with Chris Wallace when he is running for 4th time in 2024, but Chis may retire before 2024.
Biden doesn't need to convert all of those voters. He just needs to chip away at them.
Biden at this point has multiple paths to 270. Trump's problem is that he has fewer and fewer as the race progresses.
Far left Fauci is doing everything to help Biden stay in basement by keeping everything closed except street full of rioters.

Well, I disagree. I also don't care if he pronounces it "Bongomajingoland" as long as Joe Biden stays reliably OUT of office.
I watched Mr. Biden‚Äôs statement. That is precisely what he said.
Biden wants to take your guns &amp; dismantle our police leaving us defenseless to thugs roaming the streets in Democrat-controlled cities as they move to our towns. He also wants to ship your jobs back to China &amp; give the ones left to illegal immigrants. LET'S KEEP WINNING INSTEAD!

Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Let‚Äôs get Joe Biden in the White House before we scandalize him. We‚Äôve only  had 44 other racist elected as president.
I don't believe that God exists..  But I ALSO believe that Biden, a devout religious man, isn't gonna "hurt" God or the bible. (Because he is a believer of both)  So I dunno WTF  Is trying to do....
This is my timeline: Yall:You know Biden... Me: Independent Black political party Yall: Trump has a point Me: Use your vote on yourselves as black people. Yall: We got to choose 1 this is so hard... Me: If we don't get reparations let's build black town. Yall: Who tf are u again
I heard what #Biden said and they're taking it out of context in my opinion.
Biden makes God look bad in the eyes of others.  We are to bear and be good witnesses.  We are to have something about ourselves that others want.
Joe Biden  like that old southern democrat granpa that gets an old fashioned or two in him and starts dropping the hard -er around the supper table
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Like I needed another reason to vote for Biden!
If Biden can "hurt God" then God isn't as powerful as people claim He is.....
So THAT's what Biden was planning all those years in the Senate and as VP
If someone could explain what bashing Biden does for us at this moment I‚Äôd love to know. Humor me. Nobody is saying he‚Äôs perfect but if you haven‚Äôt been paying attentions our standards have been compromised. We‚Äôre desperate. But please let me know about this new plan.
If Biden has narrowed his ‚ÄúVP‚Äù pick down to Susan Rice and Kamala Harris, then in those two he has his VP &amp; AG. Nice problem to have going into a presidential election.
So Meghan are you saying you are NOT voting for Biden?!?!
Look him in the eye and say I'm for Biden good bye and get up and walk out
Weird....  As an Independent I don't see Biden in a position to be able to "take all the guns away" at all  Maybe you should learn how the government works?
I see yall picking between Biden &amp; Trump instead of using your votes on you or Buying communities up to create a self governing atmosphere. So when the whip cracks louder next year you can't complain.
I have never heard of Democrats going on a trip there good question. I think it needs to be looked into once #Biden assumes office though.
Gonna leave this here for everyone voting for Biden! He‚Äôs definitely got the tongue to destroy himself.
Wow so your questioning me a black woman are you crazy. I am at more risk than you how dare you even do that. You just did what your saying #BIDEN is wrong about. So you think any black person that supports #BIDEN  doesn't support #Blm you need to go take a time out.
45 was talking about a executive order because I just came off a thread and they're are going off on Biden.
What happened with Biden?
What the hell is 45 trying to say now about Biden before he departs to Ohio.
is slipping further &amp; further down Leftist hole.   Proof: Joe Biden comment today that essentially all blacks are same  Fox runs it 7th, downplays  If Trump said this it would be top line story in big red bold font  Biden has LONG history of racist comments. MSM silent
After the Democrats said nothing as Antifa burnt down black communities I don‚Äôt know why folks would vote for Biden.  And stealing votes?  Why the Democrats want mail in votes.
Something tells me that a debate will not help Trump. I think he underestimates Biden.
for Security reasons, VP Joe Biden SHOULD NOT conduct those final interviews for a Running Mate Virtually! Don‚Äôt underestimate the Cyber Resources available to
Biden, all of them old as shit and need to be laying down somewhere !!!!!
Every time I hear another story of Biden's incapacity, I think of the Biblical account of King Nebuchadnezzar! Daniel Chapter 4  Biden Walks Back Claims On Taking Cognitive Test, Rambles About ‚ÄòCocaine‚Äô During Bizarre Interview

Democratic challenger Joe Biden has joined President Donald Trump in scrapping plans to accept his party‚Äôs presidential nomination in a convention extravaganza.
Biden will not go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination
But hey, at least they were nice and polite as they royally fucked the American people. Not like the cruel, obnoxious Trump who passed the same policies, but is so personally toxic as a human being. THIS is the party of sociopaths Biden is so eager to work with.
According to Biden, Obama, and the Democratic establishment this is the GOP they want to return after Trump leaves. You know, that honorable party who was polite as they stole elections, started  illegal wars, and handed over government functions and tax revenue to big business.
Let get this done to save our democracy Biden 2020
Of course it will. Democrats do not care about working class Americans!  Biden says border wall construction will stop if he‚Äôs elected president
They just put out word Kanye suppressing the black vote for Biden lol they must not know we don't claim him! The black delegation been traded him off....
He want get my vote! I am with Biden all the way!
I will go on the record again. Biden will not be on the ballot for President. He will be replaced, most likely he skips the debates...the Dems install someone after that doesn‚Äôt have to debate Trump.
And Donna Brazil says as long as Biden selects a woman of color she‚Äôll support his VP pick. I thought we weren‚Äôt supposed to judge a person by their color?
Everyone pushing Biden is unfit to be close to anything related to our government. Wife is power hungry pathetic.
This is pretty wild. I read Biden wasn't going to debate Trump. True or false? The people deserve to know who they will truly be voting for cuz it won't be Biden.
How can anyone who names the name of Christ even consider voting for Joe Biden?
gonna be Biden as Placeholder for sure.. they have gone too far propping him up..but bigger question is who will be  the Real Power behind the throne.. who will THAT be is the Question?
Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns
Biden all the way follow back
It's going to be funny seeing all these Biden people constantly making excuses for his gaffes during his first year in office. You're delusional if you think Biden is going to be some kind of savior. Democrats establishment want him in there for a reason.
Biden - Democratic Trump
I‚Äôm manifesting that Biden will win and make Hilary his Attorney General and then we can all chant ‚Äúlock them up!‚Äù
Oh gtfoh. You know how many of rose Twitter called black people low info voters and shills because they voted for Biden. Y'all are full of it, led by Brie.
Interesting times in GA.   Read what  professor  has to say about it:    #WeArePamplin
Which joe Biden are you talking about? 1970-90s racist Biden, or 2020 can‚Äôt remember where he is Biden?
Well he said it.... physikal and mentl( in Biden‚Äôs head this is how you spell physical and mental).LETS BRING ON THE DEBATES!!! #Trump2020Landslide
That would be quite humorous.  Then we should try to get Biden to go for broke and attempt to complete three sequential sentences. 350 million people and these two cognitively damaged types are the best we can do?  The two party system isn‚Äôt helping America.
My wife asked me if Joe Biden picked a vice president because she thought he was supposed to do it on August 1. I told her not yet he probably forgot.
Let‚Äôs not forget the things happening that are distracting us from the upcoming presidential election...specifically, the lack of exposure of Joe Biden.  And no urgency for Biden to debate????
Mr. Biden seems like a nice person but it is strange how everyone pretends he is mentally ‚Äúall there‚Äù.
Not a big trump supporter or anything but you can‚Äôt honestly believe this? Biden has severe cognitive issues, bless him.
I do as well can't wait to see who #Biden chooses that when the battle is going to get intense. I pray he chooses a strong running mate that will help ensure our victory in #NOV.
Magat's a running a get the Biden supporters again
I would post it he's a multimillionaire playing with our democracy. Why hasn't his wife gone to court and sought a conservatorship so he can get the help that he needs. The whole family needs to do something because if #Biden loses because of this they won't survive the backlash
#KANYE is on vacation as we speak with his wife and kids #Tmz reported it yesterday. If #Biden loses from this little stunt and we lose our democracy how will you feel. I don't give a damn about what mental crap he's going through when he's playing with our freedom.
Are y'all ready for a new attitude and professionalism in Washington? Well get ready for Mr Joe Biden
Black peoples know he not fits! We are riding with Biden!
So if Joe Biden can say Latino Community Agenda...THEN WHY CAN'T I cant say THE BLACK COMMUNITY AGENDA without you black people being scared or other ethnic groups running their mouths about Black SELF INTEREST being racist!? Nobody can't tell me shit! Black Power ‚úäüèø‚úäüèø‚úäüèø
Are we Talking Trump or coked up debate Trump? üòÇ If Trump is Coked up cognitive decline Biden stands no chance.
If this weren't true it would actually be hilarious!  Biden Says He Can't Wait To Find Out Who He Picked For VP  via
Democratic plan - hold off admitting Joe Biden is incapable of serving as President as long as possible. Ask for additional time to choose new candidate.  President Trump's plan - mention moving the election so all Democrats scream the election must happen on time.  Checkmate
Biden has terrible tastes...imagine the very poor choices he‚Äôd make for this country.
No, 13 weeks from now, Joe Biden WILL win the biggest landslide ever!!

Joe Biden quit his 1st Presidential campaign because he plagiarized (stole) other people's thoughts, ideas and speeches. This time around he's a senile old man who hasn't accomplished anything in his 40+ years in government. Seems like a known liar would fit right in as VP.
Biden is too scared to appear on Tucker. Biden is too scared to even appear with Chris Wallace. Biden is too scared to go through with the debates.  Does this sound like someone with enough backbone to be President?
Joe Biden's announcement of his VP candidate delayed again. Every black women named so far has baggage that would have eliminated here quickly from the list in years past but Joe backed himself into a corner promising to name a black woman and now he doesn't know how to get out.
Kamala Harris could be Joe Biden's VP pick. Here's what you need to know.
The Democrats will do whatever it takes to get Joe Biden elected by any means possible. Liberals will destroy our freedom and liberty.
There is no way they'll leave Biden in there.  They're throwing the election.
You'll know if  nominates  as his running mate.  #Biden  #Biden2020  #MAGA  #KAG2020
Pay attention to strategy. Joe Biden‚Äôs health is in question and unlikely to be the nominee this coming November. The DNC will likely replace him with someone they feel more confident in like maybe a Michelle Obama, as the first transgender president. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Since when does David Biden French care about the constitution?
Biden/Harris together they can regain America's respect, and honor around the world. Make us the leaders again. Work together to cure covid-19, and prepare America for the next pandemic.
Great ratings for Joe Biden!
That is because Biden‚Äôs brains are total MUSH. He must have full blown dementia because he can not speak a coherent sentence or comprehend much anymore.
If the Dems are so sure of their Presidential candidate, then it should be a no-brainer for voters to go to the polls and cast their vote for Biden ‚Äúloud and proud‚Äù!!!  No one will ever hear them if they stay at home. Are they just plain ashamed of him?
Not one of these Democratic establishment drones, starting with Bill Clinton through to Biden, ran for what the job requires, to help create a government to meet the needs off ALL its citizens. FACT: Since Carter, not one ex president has sullied their hands doing menial work.
Kamala Harris is the latest in a line of ambitious establishment pols who ran for Pres for one of two reasons; 1. In the case iof HRC &amp; Biden, bc they felt it was their manifest destiny, or 2. In the case of HARRIS, Buttigieg, et al, to further their own personal advancement.
I want Joe Biden to win this election, but not because I support him. My reason: he‚Äôs not Donald Trump. It‚Äôs that simple. That‚Äôs where I am once again and I fucking hate it. I hate my party takes away my Democratic rights with their power brokering. But there it is.
Actually  you‚Äôve made the case FOR Kamala Harris, especially when you view her record in the context of the  post Clintonism. She‚Äôs a perfect fit for the also donor compromised Biden. As he reminds us daily, with big fat wet kisses to the donors all the time.
Obama and Biden had the FBI spy.  The DemocRAT party funded the Steele Dossier.  It was used for FISA warrants on members of the Trump campaign.  So get real!  The DemocRATs spied on the Trump campaign.
Demos want mail-in voting so they can spend months "counting" the votes, delay Trump's inauguration, and install their own dictator in the meantime.  #election2020 #trump #biden
Whats real don't gitta be explained i saw all this days ago! Trust me  you always on the money especially with this one! She was at the rep hearing saying yall don't need money just like biden do now and they for him too: down dem remember!?
You know that no New York Times writer or editor actually came up with the idea to write this. They were told to do so by Joe Biden's campaign staff. Everyone in the country knows he would wither in a live debate with President Trump.
But Biden has his fingers in the private parts of a 17 year old...  and everyone is O K  with that. Should be my daughter... he would not be here to run for anything !! VIVA PRESIDENT TRUMP .üåπ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüåπ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüåπ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
You need to be worried about your fathers, sisters, and brother in-laws impending arrest come 2021. Damn if where lock maybe #Mueller left a sealed charges for you waiting in the wings. If #Biden had a arrest record he never would've been #Obama #Vp so you sound extra obnoxious.
Well except climate science saying we need an aggressive approach to save the planet, and research studies on the efficacy and cost savings of single payer over the corrupt private insurance system. Just saying. Biden loves science so long as it doesn‚Äôt cost his donors anything.
By the time we reach November he‚Äôll be fully a Republican. The arrogance Hillary showed Biden is also showing. Let‚Äôs see who can serve the donors the best. At this point she was way more progressive than Biden is. Bernie might wanna take back his statement comparing Biden to FDR.
No doubts from me whatsoever. If  or any other Progressive thinks this near 80 year old leopard will change his spots, they‚Äôre smoking something. There are no indications Biden or the  has any interest in doing anything other than continuing to serve their donors.
Ok I‚Äôm going out on a limb, Bill Gates üñï the Democratic Party üñï if you want to live in a society that is controlled vote Democratic, but just know when JOE BIDEN gets into office you can‚Äôt control the outcome. And you have to suffer... it will be your fault country is destroyed
I've seen a retweet of you saying that Trump has said that companies will stop selling hand sanitizer if Biden wins. I've been trying to find Trump's original tweet. Can you point me to it? Thanks.
I'm excited about Biden because he seems sane.
You are a Loser! You would not recognize the truth if you were sitting on it! I wish Biden would choose you for VP! Two big losers could bring it on!
Progressives &amp; those who want a viable future for this nation &amp; the world, we have to resolve that Biden won‚Äôt get a moments rest. The #blacklivesmatter protests must continue. The fight sir a green sustainable economy fights on. The M4ALL, Fight for $15, &amp; clean money fights on.
There‚Äôs only one thing I‚Äôm certain of. If Trump wins, we‚Äôre done as a nation. If Biden wins, we‚Äôve got to be prepared to fight him every step of his presidency. We can no longer vote &amp; go home. The stakes are too damned high. With Biden there‚Äôs some hope, with Trump there‚Äôs none!
I am clear on my position in this election. I‚Äôm voting for Biden because he‚Äôs not Trump. He‚Äôs not a fascist. But I‚Äôm under no illusion of what Biden is offering, which in his own words, isn‚Äôt much at all. I‚Äôm not buying one word of the proposals from the unity commission.
People forget that it‚Äôs not a beauty pageant. Biden looks good until you look u look under the hood. That‚Äôs how the Dems fool ya. Looks great and they keep you there. They never let you look under the hood

Joe Biden will not save you. The Dem party is just Republican Lite. Joe is a like a smiling undertaker, fleecing your family while putting you in the grave. Rebellion is our best hope. Look at the example of EZLN and the Black Panthers. We have models for success.
This is Biden‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs choice alone to make.  Period.  We need to win, not make ‚Äústatements‚Äù or appease a group that represents 12% of the electorate.  If my house is on fire, I‚Äôm not concerned with what model fire engine shows up.  And I‚Äôm black.
‚Äî While there is good news in the presidential race, unfortunately Ossoff is currently trailing Perdue by 2 points.  Democrats get out and vote! #VoteDemocratic
I'm picking Biden to win in a landslide.  The biggest in a presidential election since 1984.
She brings nothing to the ticket.  Biden is going to win California's electoral votes anyway.  Gretchen Whitmer is the only pick that makes sense.
He is just as awful as Biden. And anyone who doesn‚Äôt think so is lacking history lessons. If you believe trump lies more than Biden, where have you been for the last four decades? #LetHerSpeak #letherdebate

Not so fast! Biden will lose in Nov.

How about Obama and Biden sending plane loads of cash to the Iranian Arab leaders who then used the money to kill US Troops with better IEDs.  The Iranians offered bounties but you did not mention it then.  Your comments are crap!
Opinion | Why would Biden pick a human lightning rod as VP?
My sentiments exactly. As a amatter of fact Biden told Wall Street and corporate donors on the phone recently he‚Äôs not proposing any legislation as he admits they‚Äôve screwed over Americans, then ‚Äúasked‚Äù them to deal people in. I‚Äôll wait for hell to freeze over before that happens
This won't work, Trump will make hay out of Biden's declination of debates
So you‚Äôre saying Joe Biden should shut up and accept the charges against him!!!
Why is it shocking? Biden is either so senile or desperate to be president that obama is calling the shots.
I thought you were Joe Biden for a second.
SPECIAL DELIVERY DOCS- Biden Campaign Platform is Trans-communism -
Oh how nasty can one become... Biden is a damn thief... with his son hunter who is no more than a old crack head. He is a child molestet... abusing 17 year old girls and have kids running his legs... and his hands on everyone‚Äôs wife.he has gone crazy, not know if it is Monday
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
The enthusiasm for Joe Biden is so low the hype for his VP selection is being dragged on as long as possible.
Agree the idea if the VP being the best match for Biden isn‚Äôt ours &amp; could hurt any progress if conflicts Pursue.
Biden won because the wealthy, elite leadership beholden to their donors, led by Barack Obama, used their might to get the corporatists in the race to step aside to prevent Bernie from ending their reign over our party. And they dutifully stepped aside in feilty to the cause.
Kamala Harris, is very competent, skilled and bright. Biden can‚Äôt make a bad pick. Stacy Abrams would represent a clean cut with the past &amp; a path to the Future. I‚Äôm excited by the prospect of ‚ÄúAG Harris‚Äù cleaning up 3yrs of corruption &amp; restoring Justice!
Just asking why fo you be so close to the camera? ü§Æ I just donate to the person that running against you! Iowa see you for who you are just like you said about Biden! Loser!
Biden picking Bass after seeing would be proof that he's failed his cognitive test. I would then guess the words he was asked to remember (and forgot) were: running mate endorse cult landslide
Last tweet of the night on this: I cannot imagine better ammunition for the GOP to sweep the conservative Christian vote than this. I hope Biden is calculating the inevitable damage this would cause.
You really should avoid tweeting while smoking crack, Sam. Your fever dreams and hallucinations have no connection to reality. Trump will receive millions more votes than in 2016 and Biden will be lucky to win over 6 states.
Dear  thank you for picking country over party. Biden isn't the best candidate but anything is better than the virus in office now.

That and Biden slightly ahead in Georgia to
"Surprise" in that Biden, delegates et al, Bernie has decided to give credit to what will not matter in the end, that was supposed to have happened last time around.   This has been on the table for years, but now Biden is given credit for it .

Right? At least biden had the good sense to get 5 deferments, and clinton got one too!
Awwww biden writing your tweets?
And they have a need to be "pacified" by the DNC or else their vote won't be "earned" for Biden.    It's like they all need a Binky so they'll be pacified, but they get so mad when you tell them that.
You're either gonna vote for Biden or help Trump get reelected.  That's 100%  on you.    So why should we waste our time trying to find the correct Binky to pacify you?   Your quest for pacification is what makes you irrelevant.
He took one so Biden would take one, he won‚Äôt take it so it adds doubt to voters.
I‚Äôm not sure what type of tests my father took , didn‚Äôt need to take any to be honest it was obvious. Kinda like Joe Biden, it‚Äôs obvious.
Who would win in a fist fight between Trump and Biden? I rest my case....
Sure hope so ! Biden is a üå∂ ü•¶ü•¨üåΩü•ï vegetable !
Biden can‚Äôt even spell ECONOMY...
I dont want either in power but mentally i rather trump than biden because at least we will stay on the streets with him but biden will lock us up with the swiftness...
Biden is a trojan horse. If he' get back in the White House he's going to be opened up and a bunch of little Communists will crawl out

If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden you‚Äôre not black not my words
Who are you talking about ?? BIDEN. And then he has his son help him steal... and he molest under age girls.  17 years old. Close ties with the K K K  and used the N word all the time... and now has serious mental issues...

President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden both promise sweeping progress over the next four years -‚Äì via starkly different paths.
What in the world! Of course they are going to say it was trump.. I guess if Biden was in office they would say he same thing!
Make her your VP! I‚Äôve donated, but will empty the piggy bank for a Biden-Warren ticket.

Can‚Äôt vote , need face shields , hazmat suits and safety goggles. Dude I have it on good authority that Biden can‚Äôt physically stand for more than a couple of hours, which means he won‚Äôt debate.
We need to vote this man out.  If he don't want to leave, we can drag him out. I don't want to vote for Joe Biden but we don't have a choice.
You don't have to be black only brain dead if you vote Biden for anything. Gaffs aside. He sold out this country committing treason with Obama giving a sworn enemy Iran $150 billion dollars used to kill Americans.

Biden can pick a Ghostbuster as his running mate, I'm voting for him!
They sure as hell didn't call me Biden all the way
It‚Äôs gonna tighten up before Election Day. We need to keep the pressure up and make sure folks show up to vote. Also, I think it‚Äôs time Biden got out there more- where he can.
Biden... you ain‚Äôt black
Biden should be in jail with his son... they are both damn thiefs . Biden putting in the private parts of a young girl.. and hunter with his whores and drugs..and do not even wants to support hil illigemate child. His niece steals over $100,000.00 and does not spend a day in jail
I don't recall anyone saying Biden was too ambitious when he was being consider for VP! #KamalaHarris has been my pick from the very beginning!  needs new allies! #KamalaHarrisForVP
Wow, everyday it‚Äôs like some new ridiculous shit. I honestly believe if Biden were our President we would be through this pandemic.
They were going to ask Biden to do it but when asked he said "I loved his music with The News".
Well, even if  crustal ball is correct, how does that change the race. More importantly, how will this impact Biden‚Äôs governing. Both are corrupted neoliberals in the pockets of their donors. So functionally nothing changes for the people who desperately need it.
Go figure.  I bet no Biden interviews nor the much wanted DEBATES!
New poll has Trump, Biden tied in Georgia
It's our vote  and we can "throw it away" If we want to. I just might vote for Dwayne Johnson. Anybody would be better than Trump or Biden
Seeing how you constantly talk about wanting certain people to die I figure I might add that Biden will most likely stroke out before elections and if he doesn't I hope he loses just as badly as Hillary did
If Biden gets in.. they would do it for another 4 years because he can‚Äôt remember if he paid his water bill last month or not.
A friend of mine said: "Biden could boil babies, and eat them on Daytime TV, &amp; he still wouldn't vote for "Agent-Orange!" I was like, Wow! üòµCardi B has doubled down on her support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
We are gonna be in deep üí© if this country elects biden.
I don't feel bad for the democratic party because everyone told them Joe Biden was a mistake. And its clear that after dems sabotaged capable candidates, biden is sabotaging himself......like everyone with common sense said he would.
There are only TWO viable 2020 presidential candidates (Trump &amp; Biden). DO NOT be distracted, divided, and conquered. The 2020 election is a referendum on America, and her future. As much as possible, vote: morality, justice, and equity. Deuteronomy 16:18-19. #Reformer
We have a better option than Biden or Trump
And you think it won't happen with Biden?
Ok smartass. You know damn well it was a typo. Republicans and Democrats are the same bird. Call them what they really are. Republicrats because they're all on the same team. I agree about Trump but Biden will be no better. Besides, we have much a much better option.
When did Biden say he was going to choose a black woman. He said a woman.
When did Biden say he was going to choose a black woman. I‚Äôd like to see the video. He said he would choose a WOMAN.

So she shouldn‚Äôt be VP if she didn‚Äôt plan to be president. There‚Äôs a strong possibility she could be President with Biden‚Äôs age.
Actually you are right cancel culture does not like Republicans which is actually funny where if you look at history it was the Democrats that have a history of racism. Biden has a history of racism and bigotry yet he suddenly found the light and is supposedly now not a racist.
It was celebrated until Obama decided to politicize his funeral to make a speech for Joe Biden that was not really truthful.Mail in Ballots are often loaded with voter fraud and lost ballots.Trump only asked how were we going to work out the kinks in voting. Use absentee ballotis
I agree with you. The Democrats, BLM, Antifa, Biden, ActBlue, Soros, China, Clinton‚Äôs and Obama have a lot in common. Money and the BLM movement. They are paying the Protestors, anarchists and Biden‚Äôs campaign The riots were planned but was George Floyd‚Äôs death planned as well.
Biden won't win. Our only hope is to vote gold
Yeah, you say that. We're gonna get stuck with him because no one wants Biden. We have other options. Better options #JoJorgensen2020
Mail in voting is less trackable. Honestly, it's only fraudulent to you if you lose. If either you or Biden win, America has done itself a disservice. #VoteGold2020 #jojo2020 #realchange
New poll has Donald Trump, Joe Biden tied in GeorgiaI didn't think the group, undecided between Trump and Biden existed. Now I am in that group. Perhaps for odd rationalization, but still.
Did some reflecting and rationalizing. I am convinced Biden won't make it to Thanksgiving next year, I would vote for his VP. If it's Kamala no way, but Rice is a contender. I was VP debates. I could care less about Trump and Biden.
I am waiting for the VP pick. And to be clear, if I vote for Biden, I am punishing the GOP. Get your s#it together and go pull your principles out of the trash can. Here's a hint, principles transcend the President. Act like a coequal branch not a frat party.
I really believe what they are doing to Biden is elder abuse!
This man knows just how to play his audience in order to win the evangelical votes.   When last were you voluntarily in church  #DeadWithDonald
This is undeniable true.  And still Trump may lose to a tired dementia patient.  How is this possible?  An endless stream of tweets.  And most recently the Axios interview which was Biden level incoherent.  If a CEO did what Trump has done they would have been fired long ago.
Basement Biden's latest brand of idiotic and insensitive racism...basically saying that Blacks all think the same, while Latinos are more diversified in their way of thinking. Totally false and insulting on a number of levelsüò©ü§•.  Biden keeps digging his own political defeat.
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
Hmm, I prayed to God, queried Her regarding this latest preposterous claim of Trump's - She was quite bewildered. She replied that Her servant Joe has been a most devout follower.   "Trailing in election polls, Trump says rival Biden is 'against God'"
It‚Äôs like they have us over a barrel! We‚Äôre sures hell not voting for Trump so all that‚Äôs left is Biden and he‚Äôs not right for America either. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unfair that 4 states decided who would be the democratic candidate for the whole country!  How are we ok with this?
You should run, man. F* the DNC. If Biden bails on the debates claiming it's because of "covid concerns", get back in and say you'll debate Trump. Trump will do it. You know he would.
Biden is not Catholic He believes in abortion
Democrats supporting Joe Biden.
Biden NEVER had my vote  ‚Äê  SEE WHY below ‚§µÔ∏è Biden concluded ‚Äúthe President‚Äôs plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.‚Äù 1989
Stay home! If not for Biden then you are for BunkerBitch!
Biden a clown.. the fact the democrats has 4 years to prepare for this and this the best they can give us???? üòÖ  time to get that Africa plan in motion
The "point" of America as a melting-pot is all that historical crap is meaningless and is just politics to divide and victimize.  Jim Crow is not a "culture".  It is a historic fact.  Biden views minorities as mascots to pander to.  I would rather he consider us equally Americans
Is Joe Biden working for Kanye?
I don't know why Yang doesn't come right out and say "fuck yall, I'm running with or without your endorsement".  I *guarantee* if Yang was to debate Trump, which we know Biden plans to avoid, people would immediately realize Yang is the actual candidate. Sorry, DNC.
Trump is going to brag about bringing these USA jobs back, so I expect short term boost from him, but long term, a Biden victory with all the Green Deals, will make these investments explode. I think by 2030 , 50% of all vehicles will be electric.
Wait, if Biden can hurt God how does a mortal (trash) like Trump can win against him?!
So it seems we‚Äôre stuck with the lesser of two racists? Picking dumb or dumber? Biden was supposed to know how to stick to a script and not make these stupidly ridiculous off the wall comments on things he really shouldn‚Äôt be talking about! Can we just get Bernie? Is it to late?
Given Biden's lack of respect for us, I wouldn't be surprised at this point...
This tweet wins Twitter today. DJ making fun of Biden for implying the black community is not diverse while simultaneously stating the result will be the loss of the entire black community.
Biden: "Blacks lack diversity."  Me: "What. The F-ck".
More Jolt: Georgia's state labor commissioner nixes meeting with Senate Democrats over slow processing of unemployment benefits, claiming protests have been "near riots" and alleging threats to target his home ... #gapol
Sadly Trump and his team are not listening to you. And it wouldn't matter. Also sadly Trump has demonstrated over 3 1/2 year he is either unwilling or incapable of acting Presidential. The Axios interview was as incorrect as Biden. How about a write-in campaign for Ted Cruz?
"Racist Luray, Virginia Mayor Barry Presgraves urged to resign after saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP" #VaPol #Luray #Virginia #BLACKLIVESMATTER
Yes, and I agree that can't be simply dismissed as "his style". My conspiracy theory... What I see is a man in decline enjoying his retirement. The DNC came knocking and convinced him to run after he said no. This is about the first woman POTUS and Biden gets POTUS in his bio.
I feel so bad for Biden. I wanna protect him like I would a grandpa üò≠ But he should definitely not be the President of the United States
Man people on the right really don't get it. Nobody is saying give Biden the nuclear arsenal. They are saying take it away from Trump. By any means necessary. I don't think you realize their seething rage towards him, but it is the cornerstone of their political position.
Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
You‚Äôll vote for Biden because you hate your country! üá∫üá∏
AND do NOT vote for Kenya West, this is his attempt to STEAL votes from Joe Biden
Biden refuses to debate until there‚Äôs a COVID-19 vaccine.
I think Bernie could win. Trump has enough negatives. At least Bernie is coherent. Seriously, if you are trying to decide between not voting or voting for Biden I think that decision would be easier with Bernie. And really Bernie isn't a Democrat, so they would push back on him.
Trump will double the Black vote from 2016; 6% to 12%. Fact. #TrumpLandslide
Well somewhat you let Biden be "the voice" of the people so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ok
This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.
Biden at a virtual fundraiser with Atlanta Mayor  today: ‚ÄúIt would be a hell of a win. But if we come close in Georgia, we probably will help elect a couple Democratic senators.  We elect a congressman. We elect up and down the line. And we have to build our bench.‚Äù
Lol. Professor famous for correctly predicting the winner of 24 of the last 26 presidential elections, including Trump‚Äôs win in 2016, predicts Trump beats Biden 362 to 176 with a 91% re-election chance.
Of which Biden's VP is the tie breaker.
The implication to Joe Biden can fix anything is beyond naive
"Fox News white supremacist Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president" #FoxNews #WhiteSupremacist #BlackLivesMatter #gapol
Some fundamental changes to the parties are needed. The party does not control who runs, the people select the candidate based on the rules. The candidate rights the platform. I know why Trump in 16 Why Biden in 20? Dem voters were going to send a socialist or a dementia patient?
I think Biden has what is called pix disease it‚Äôs a very serious brain issue
The media is t trying to convince anyone of an upcoming Biden blowout. They are reporting on poll results and always saying anything could happen.
I think Biden should agree to debates only if both candidates can be fact checked in real time. I know Trump would never agree to this because he can‚Äôt tell the truth
What usually happens with egregious Hatch Act violations is the person gets fired. That's not going to happen with this administration, of course. There's also the possibility of a $1,000 fine and it would be giggle-worthy for Biden's DOJ to go after Miller and McEnany.
Seems no sane person would even say or imply that Biden is anything but demented.  That‚Äôs how utterly political everyone and everything is now.
LOL have you let Biden know yet?
This had me so tickled I will be thinking of Mrs Thomas when I cast my vote for Biden!
Hi Dawn nice to see you on line. Hope all is well and you are staying safe!
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency
Great debate between Gov. Huckabee, Judge Jeanine and Sean Hannity on the Democrats self-destructive plans for Joe Biden to potentially skip the Presidential Debates.
Democratic Party may be replacing Joe Biden you heard here first people.
You don't get it do you? They arent expecting him to win, they are expecting him to get enough votes to prevent Biden from winning. They are literally using the black guy to get votes and rig the system and the black guy is fully going along with it...
Remember when Trump called the town of Paradise, Pleasure? Repeatedly. If you're going to play the Joe Biden game, be prepared for all the 1000s of remember when Trump...
new biden ads getting weird
From   Enviro backgrounds on 8 potential Biden VP candidates.
Democrats: Trump is so stupid when you hear him talk!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Also Democrats: We cannot let Joe Biden get on stage with that man.
We need to prepare people then. The count will take as long as it takes. Accuracy should be the goal. From what I‚Äôve read, Florida is very good with this stuff (really) and if they announce that night, and Biden wins, it‚Äôs over.
Same way some ppl listen to Biden and believe he is competent to lead the country. That is whenever he emerges from his basement to which he quickly returns.
Sounds like Joe Biden a wee bit does he?
"I'll get that one, just like I was right on the mortality rate."  "Chris, you've got to start studying for these."  Of course, Trump was wrong about Biden supporting defunding the police, too.
A MUST!   I like Susan Rice. She is a smart, sharp, and classy lady!  I saw her on The View. They asked her about Benghazi. She gave the perfect answer.   She is a team player willing to do whatever it takes for Biden to be successful no matter what capacity that may be!
Biden will skip debates because Biden can‚Äôt debate.  I hate Trump btw.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Trump's base Does. Not. Matter. He can have his unshakeable 35% of the vote; Biden has a bigger base than that plus a huge anti-Trump vote. What matters are swing voters, the 10% persuadable. Right now it's 51-40, so Trump would need at least 80% and they favor BLM over the feds.
Trumps TAX SCAM is also known as trickledown.   Basically DEFUND the average American citizen to FUND the wealthy!   Biden will be REVERSING that scam!   It‚Äôs about damn time someone took care of the working class!
Explain what the Green New Deal would mean to loss of JOBS in effected states, Ronna.  THAT has more meaning to folks.  And above ALL, talk about the ONLY thing that really matters...the loss of freedom and the institutionalization of tyranny that Biden brings on his coattails.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Did Twitter tell you which rule? I always ask and they never tell me. Frustrating
You don‚Äôt have to close your app. Just wait about 1 min then you can follow a few more. At least that is what worked for me.
According to a blog   If you use up your 100 API calls in the hour then you will see the ‚Äúrate limit exceeded‚Äù   Twitter must be having issues as I know I didn‚Äôt make 100 API calls in hour as I just recently got back onto Twitter about 30 minutes ago
That‚Äôs exactly the message I am getting!
I keep getting ‚ÄúRate Limit Exceeded‚Äù then the message goes away and all is fine. Very strange.   I thought I might have still been shadow banned!
So a debate would be for 5) undecided between Trump and Biden I am convinced this group is a myth.   If Trump weren't a grade A jerk he may have had a shot at creating this group. But it doesn't exist today.
Who needs to be convinced of what?  No debate required for 1) will vote for Trump 2) will vote for Biden  What about 3) may vote Trump or 3rd party or stay home 4) may vote Biden... Well this group doesn't need a debate. They need the individual candidates to present their cases.

If Biden had any potential to serve two terms, people probably wouldn't get so wound up about the VP pick. It's historically a much weaker role than the major cabinet jobs. Susan Rice hasn't run for anything, and I want somebody who can run HARD in 2024.
Well that‚Äôs funny, I thought you had the silent majority.....we Biden supporters are out there and you will be replaced. Keep opening your mouth.
Virtually all MSM's polls have Joe Biden leading/winning by a landslide, and instead of being celebratory all the way to election day, the "we will dox you, verbally and physically attack all who disagrees with us" Left has #DearMichigan trending, begging them to vote for Joe?ü§î
My FB account got restricted for 30 days for posting some meme with Creepy Joe Biden hugging kids. They called it sexually explicit content.
I want to let people know I would also add Alabama, Alaska, South Carolina to this list due to U.S. Senate elections there, as well as Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District centered around Omaha which Obama carried back in 2008 &amp; could be a surprise pick back up for Biden.
I am leaning towards Susan Rice. She is a very smart, articulate, caring and sharp! I saw her on the view. She was awesome! She is willing to do whatever it takes to help Biden in whatever capacity that may be.
That's like me, a music lover, so hoping in not so distant future after Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021, that there can be postponed 35th anniversary Live Aid concert celebrating scientists who discovered  vaccine for Covid-19 &amp; remembering 100's of thousands we have lost.
Hopefully Joe Biden's, the Democrats in Congress &amp; state legislatures, the American people starting from January 20, 2021, &amp; the Republican party that can free itself from the stench of Trumpism &amp; Trumpist &amp; get back to a party that has some conviction &amp; some ability to lead.
Hopefully Joe Biden's, the Democrats in Congress and state legislatures, the American people post January 20, 2021, and a Republican party that can free itself of the stench of Trumpist and Trumpism and get back to being a party that has some conviction.
At this point let them (the ever decreasing numbers) stay  home on November 3rd (&amp; many will probably still die from Covid-19 before them, I would say a lot fewer Democrats or those leaning that way due to the mask wars) &amp; then Biden &amp; Democrats can win in a landslide.
No one ever talks about a man being "too ambitious". Biden needs to select an all women cabinet to rid our culture of the "too ambitious" woman!  Time is up on that nonsense!
The idea that either "party" is Christian or cares about Christians is absurd. Christians are people, people vote.  Biden is Galatians 5:22-23 only because he is a dementia patient.  2 Timothy 3:1-5 is not Trump, it is the culture et al.  Politics is downhill from culture.
Oh I love America!   I don‚Äôt like the state of my country under tRUMP but that will soon end!   Many Republicans are voting Biden  because they want tRUMP out.   tRUMPS lack of action and a plan caused  4.74 Million Cases of COVID-19 157,000 deaths from COVID-19
At this point, this Warren lover would still vote for Biden even if he picked Dick Cheney as his VP.
Yes and it will be easy to add her name to my Biden yard sign
Instant 5 point drop for Biden. Really disliked outside of NYC and Cali. Was incompetent as AG and Senator. Disloyal and annoying. Joe Biden buries the hatchet and looks to bring in Kamala Harris as running mate  via
Sure, and questioning Obama‚Äôs birth certificate was just oversight by the loyal opposition. QAnon will simply apologize and tell Mr. Biden to forget about all that stuff they said about Trump fighting pedophile rings run by liberals.
With comments like that, you sure as hell won‚Äôt. I will support Joe Biden whomever he selects as his running mater, so you can get bent.
Thanks  for the shout out ! You are one amazing #Resister! I appreciate all you do to connect the #Resistance!
Biden should have an all woman cabinet!
You want Biden but split government. That didn't work out very well in the Obama years. I think we have reached a tipping point where extream begets extreme. There are enough liberal judges to shred the Constitution and you will give Biden 2 SCOTUS picks.

I missed the media lobbing questions at Joe Biden. When did that happen?
Its just going to get worse. He and barr will do something so far outside the norms after the election when biden wins im order to stay in office that I am very concerned. The damage this man is doing to our democracy is going to take decades to repair.

PolitiFact - The long history of racism in the US presidency
100% I stopped defending what he says &amp; tweets long ago. I will let Rush make money doing that.  Trump has done a lot right, I give him credit. Democrats as a group are less deserving. Biden is a dementia patient.  If I had a better option I would kick Trump/GOP to the curb.

That won‚Äôt be possible until 2024 and Biden won‚Äôt remember who he is by then. Can only remember now on occasion!
of more Fascism. Like I said, pushing the party left will be a gradual process. Having a fucking Fascist as president does nothing but slow that process down. We can bully Biden into conceding on 1 or 2 issues, with Trump we cant do that
Please tell me how we fight neoliberalism by saying he's equal to Trump. You make no sense. Neoliberalism leads to Fascism yes, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT FASCISM. Biden being in office at least guarantees us 4 years without fascism. Which is objectively better than 4 years
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
Isn‚Äôt this what the Biden people want? Rich and poor mixed. You got it

For covid, WWYD? Not one person in this country can answer that, not even Dr. Fauci. He‚Äôs still all over the place. I guess Biden would have the answers, he doesn‚Äôt even know where he is. ü§≠
Me, too!     And what a wonderful First Lady we will have in Dr. Biden.
Fumble the COVID response this badly, rollback healthcare protections for the marginalized, etc. Like I said, dont wanna vote for a war criminal then fine I dont blame you. But dont act like he wouldn't be an improvement. Is it a low bar? Yes. But we can actually push Biden left
what makes you think I'm unaware of that? Fuck Obama too. But if I had a choice between that and Fascism give me Obama. I'd rather have a war criminal that doesn't embolden hate crimes than war criminal that doesn't. You're kidding yourself if you think Biden would
Fuck Biden but we should be using the fact that he would be the furthest left president as fuel for shift the Overton window
Name a president further to the left than Biden. Try it. I dare you
Boomer? 100% sure I'm younger than you lol. But if you think Biden is a Fascist, will have open racists in his administration, take away protections for LGBT people in healthcare, deny the existence of climate change, idk what to tell you my guy. Biden can be bullied, Trump cant.
I will support Biden no matter who he chooses as VP. But, it strikes me as odd that critics of Senator Harris point to her hit on Biden on busing in the debate. Politics is a contact sport and shots like that are taken all the time.
Looks like it's a legit if hamhanded attempt to persuade bitter Bernie fans to do the right thing, knowing there's no way to sell them on Biden as a candidate they'll like. Grownup lefties who get the concept of half a loaf being better than none. No sense it comes from Biden.
Hey Donnie, come January 21st, 2021 we will all be so glad when you lose and have to vacate your one house  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  I'm sure the purely racist stench will be greatly cleaned and cleared out of their by President Joe and Dr. Jill Biden.
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden‚Äôs wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
I have sad his ability to win is about his VP (soon to be President if Biden wins).  I presume your decision is whether to vote Biden or not at all.
Who else makes fun of Biden from that angle?
It's not from the Biden campaign. It's from a bunch of lefty smartasses.
Don‚Äôt be discouraged. Register to vote if you haven‚Äôt, if you can vote by mail. Volunteer to make phonecalls for Joe Biden. It‚Äôs really easy, go to his website and click on action center and then make calls for Joe. They are easy calls to supporters. Do it! You will feel better!

Russia doesn‚Äôt stand a chance against Biden if he can hurt God and The Bible.
Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.
My view is that Biden isn't a super exciting candidate, neither was HRC.. so maybe someone with a little more sparkle would be better than someone more "meh".  But the environment is different, so it might not matter.
I tend to agree that Kaine, while a great person, was a bland pick.  But Tom is likely right that it might not have mattered. However, someone more progressive might have smoothed the Bern Bros over.  Biden faces the same issue, theoretically, but the environment is different.

Black People are not politically diverse, we are supermajority. Case in point, everyone on both sides trying to make a big deal about Biden's comments are wasting their time because he will still get 85-90% of the black vote no matter what. It's the reality no one wants to hear.
Biden may not be the best choice for Dems, but he is not crazy. Anyone who thinks so is an idiot.
I don't think ANYONE will believe that Biden doesn't "have a Religion"or know the Bible

The "point" of America as a melting-pot is all that historical crap is meaningless and is just politics to divide and victimize.  Jim Crow is not a "culture".  It is a historic fact.  Biden views minorities as mascots to pander to.  I would rather he consider us equally Americans
Is Joe Biden working for Kanye?
Somebody send Biden a crisis PR manager
This virus isn‚Äôt going anywhere, anytime soon; we will be in masks &amp; social distancing for another  1-2 years; WAKE UP and start leading!! If you don‚Äôt, Biden will win. #coronavirus
Oh, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don‚Äôt question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, Americaüëéüèº
I just don‚Äôt think Biden has it in him. Even w/o his dimentia, he has no passion.
Biden could have Hillary Clinton as his VP and I would vote for him at this point.
Yeah, because Biden is so very eloquent, HES an obvious choice #meh
Biden wants to meet God in a parking lot in Temecula.
No, I don't agree with Biden, I don't view all blacks as monolith.  We were used as a qualifier, to "advance" how "diverse" the Latinx community is.
Given Biden's lack of respect for us, I wouldn't be surprised at this point...
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Joe Biden really just called Blacks monolith. All the same, no diversity.   That old fucker really don't want our votes.
How do you square this against what Biden is saying?  Is he a bigot or senile?
Biden: "Blacks lack diversity."  Me: "What. The F-ck".

Sadly Trump and his team are not listening to you. And it wouldn't matter. Also sadly Trump has demonstrated over 3 1/2 year he is either unwilling or incapable of acting Presidential. The Axios interview was as incorrect as Biden. How about a write-in campaign for Ted Cruz?
Why?  Because according to Joe Biden all black people think alike.

why are news organizations giving Trump coverage for his  "coronavirus briefing" when he's using it to further spew his conspiracy propaganda?  give equal time to Biden for messaging his campaign #TrumpForPrison2020

Evidence of Biden's cognitive issues: - Trump says so - Stumbling over words sometimes (which I do 15x/day)  Evidence of Trumps cognitive issues: - Stumbling over words - Basic bizarre concepts (inject disinfectant) - Arm/leg loss of control  - Difficulty drinking - Paranoia
I cannot believe Biden is the democratic nominee. He is clearly losing his mind! I predict whoever he picks will likely fill his seat in the near future.

Yes, and I agree that can't be simply dismissed as "his style". My conspiracy theory... What I see is a man in decline enjoying his retirement. The DNC came knocking and convinced him to run after he said no. This is about the first woman POTUS and Biden gets POTUS in his bio.

I feel so bad for Biden. I wanna protect him like I would a grandpa üò≠ But he should definitely not be the President of the United States
Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.

Say what you will about Biden but he‚Äôs really good at reaching out to boomers
This is my point Joseph, only right media is telling you this.   Think about this in terms of common sense, okay? Be objective for a minute. In what world can you record rioting footage of your own America (Trump's) and then use that footage saying it would be Biden's America?
"Assault Rifles" have been banned since 1986. Biden's administration doesn't know the definition of Assault Weapons nor know anything at all.
That‚Äôs why Biden is getting 454 EVs. Orange Man Bad!
For those who believe these polls, they have tightened significantly. I wonder why? Be that as it may, maybe this is why the Left doesn't want Joe Biden to debate...ü§î
Biden refuses to debate until there‚Äôs a COVID-19 vaccine.
Joe Biden has narrowed his VP candidates down to two say inside sources. He just can‚Äôt remember which two?
I feel I should mention that I do actually like Joe Biden.
I think Bernie could win. Trump has enough negatives. At least Bernie is coherent. Seriously, if you are trying to decide between not voting or voting for Biden I think that decision would be easier with Bernie. And really Bernie isn't a Democrat, so they would push back on him.
Trump will double the Black vote from 2016; 6% to 12%. Fact. #TrumpLandslide

This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.
Biden at a virtual fundraiser with Atlanta Mayor  today: ‚ÄúIt would be a hell of a win. But if we come close in Georgia, we probably will help elect a couple Democratic senators.  We elect a congressman. We elect up and down the line. And we have to build our bench.‚Äù
Oh MY GOD enough with this sexist trope.  Joe Biden never registered in presidential primaries either!  FFS he lost two of them.. never got into the top echelon.  Please stop with this misogynistic trash.
Lol. Professor famous for correctly predicting the winner of 24 of the last 26 presidential elections, including Trump‚Äôs win in 2016, predicts Trump beats Biden 362 to 176 with a 91% re-election chance.

Should Biden win, he'll be running on the most progressive platform in modern history. None of this will be fixed overnight, but I'm confident in our ability to get things done.
Biden has a 97% chance of winning and is up big in polls
With Biden not getting anything significant done.
I hope it fill the Biden team with a dread of what is going to happen should their be disappointment.
If you added up every Biden gaffe, you'd still have the equivalent of just one Trump press briefing.
Safe to say that  is floundering badly in his reelection campaign. The fact that his staff doesn't care to see it, will only serve to help  win in a landslide
A fabulous call! Stay WELL, Mr. President-to-be so that you can get elected and get that asshole Trump evicted... "Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC because of coronavirus concerns"
Biden has COVID?
Some fundamental changes to the parties are needed. The party does not control who runs, the people select the candidate based on the rules. The candidate rights the platform. I know why Trump in 16 Why Biden in 20? Dem voters were going to send a socialist or a dementia patient?
I agree. Completely, It‚Äôs EXACTLY what Trump would do if he felt there were nothing to gain for him in a debate. Biden, however, is too classy a person to do what Trump would do. I do agree with you.
We need 5 seats to retake the senate (only 4 if Biden wins). North Carolina and Montana seem like good bets.
i‚Äôm shocked when I see cocky trump cultists that are genuinely excited about the debates between the cheeto and  All their boy knows how to do is insult and lie. He‚Äôs genuinely stupid. All Biden has to do is stay calm and let donny hang himself.
The media is t trying to convince anyone of an upcoming Biden blowout. They are reporting on poll results and always saying anything could happen.
"C'mon man........." Y'all know that something is not well with  However, I am really looking forward to the debates.....don't think they will happen b/c the #Biden camp may pull him out and not allow it......he'd get eaten alive provided his current state
I think Biden should agree to debates only if both candidates can be fact checked in real time. I know Trump would never agree to this because he can‚Äôt tell the truth
And all his cult is out there talking about how people are trying to hide Biden... odds Trump does another interview like this anytime soon?
Biden goes 2 hours on a debate stage-not a chance.

Hi Dawn nice to see you on line. Hope all is well and you are staying safe!
Oh, if you only knew the irony. Hey Maximus, tell me again how Joe Biden has dementia. Site some examples if you would.
The smell of desperation in the Trump camp is palpable. All that President P*ssy Grabber's media loyalists can do is take missed jabs at Biden's character and it's just sad. I've yet to see one of these pundits take a legitimate shot at Bidens credibility or qualifications.

The epitome of fragility.  via rawstory
How is Brain dead Joe Biden doing the correct campaign tactic that Trump should be following. All  has to do to win is SHUT THE HELL UP. Mr. President why is it so hard for you to stop talking!
I don't doubt it.  But if most are conservative they aren't really Biden voters anyway.  My point is there will be negatives for any of the VP candidates, and I don't think it will ultimately matter in the final analysis. The election is about Trump.
Look, whoever Biden picks articles like this will be written.  I do not think Bass is the strongest choice, but in the end, people are going to bitch about whoever it is.
And Biden is unknown?
‚ÄúTryin‚Äù to understand your incoherent tweet, but what i think you‚Äôre saying is stupid, lazy and mentally ill ppl vote for Biden, which I take offense to.
Why would call this energetic and enthusiastic candidate ‚ÄúBasement Biden‚Äù? How dare you!
Because if Biden is winning FL, he's also probably winning MI, PA, WI, and AZ.
If Florida is called on election night in Biden's favor, the race is essentially over.
One problem is that the enthusiasm to vote against Trump is significant. Biden appears to be suffering by significant cognitive decline and there is absolutely no concern about it at all.
The wars though. We need more wars. Definitely Biden will help with that. ü§ûüèº
I have 4 emails that proves Fox News is fake. Now, who told you Biden has dementia? Because he doesn‚Äôt. So help me if one of you says something stupid like ‚Äúlook around.‚Äù
A MUST!   I like Susan Rice. She is a smart, sharp, and classy lady!  I saw her on The View. They asked her about Benghazi. She gave the perfect answer.   She is a team player willing to do whatever it takes for Biden to be successful no matter what capacity that may be!
Why don‚Äôt you have concerns about Biden‚Äôs cognition?
If this bothers you (and I am bothered by it) but you are unconcerned about Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive issues then you are acting like a hack.

Don‚Äôt forget that when Biden finally bows out for health reasons the Democrats may very well choose Andrew Cuomo as either the presidential or vice presidential candidate.
You insist that Trump‚Äôs re-election wouldn‚Äôt be materially worse than Biden winning. There is no comparison. Trump is uniquely unfit - intellectually, morally, temperamentally and cognitively.
Come one! What could the Dems possibly be afraid of? Oh that's right, people who don't yet realize that Biden has dementia will no longer be able to deny it!
They are comparing Kennedy to Biden???? No comparison! This election is about keeping DJT in or voting him out. Either way, that‚Äôs a lot of power and influence. The ballot should just say: Trump: In Trump: Out.
You can understand then when we feel that way about Biden...  ..except for without the guilt of soon to be 200k deaths on my conscience.

What?!? HRC has a brand like non other seen in modern day politics and a religious following! Biden doesn‚Äôt nearly have that.
This is a big ask since Biden barely knows who or where he is at any given moment in time. Be honest with yourself and at least acknowledge that you are voting for Grandpa Simpson.

So a debate would be for 5) undecided between Trump and Biden I am convinced this group is a myth.   If Trump weren't a grade A jerk he may have had a shot at creating this group. But it doesn't exist today.
Who needs to be convinced of what?  No debate required for 1) will vote for Trump 2) will vote for Biden  What about 3) may vote Trump or 3rd party or stay home 4) may vote Biden... Well this group doesn't need a debate. They need the individual candidates to present their cases.

Sadly that is not how party politics work. You can try to pick someone different, if you like, but Clinton, Obama, and Biden have an outsized influence. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult (not impossible) to defeat the establishment. Whoever Biden picks as VP will have an inside lane.
üíØ  Biden is the avatar for Trump haters.
Delaware is not a swing state either, you could have argued the same exact thing about Biden in 2008.  I just don't recall those arguments about him.  Honestly, what is the difference?
Understood. But you are suggesting your vote is a reflection of values. So my question remains. Which of Trump‚Äôs do you identify with more than Biden‚Äôs?
Why should our guy debate when the election is over? I‚Äôm calling 444 EVs for our fearless, energetic, enthusiastic, transformative leader! Joe Biden. #ByeDon
The fact is, Biden is 77.  This VP really could become POTUS.  FFS we want one of our heavy hitters who is ready on day one, and that won't be a wallflower.  These men need to get over themselves.
Virtually all MSM's polls have Joe Biden leading/winning by a landslide, and instead of being celebratory all the way to election day, the "we will dox you, verbally and physically attack all who disagrees with us" Left has #DearMichigan trending, begging them to vote for Joe?ü§î
444 EVs for Biden, baby!!! His energetic, transformative, and enthusiastic campaign sends shivers down my spine. You too?
No.... it has to be Biden....
My FB account got restricted for 30 days for posting some meme with Creepy Joe Biden hugging kids. They called it sexually explicit content.
Obama was a high energy transformative, once in a generation, young candidate with an MLK like speaking capability. Don‚Äôt think Biden is remotely close.
I am leaning towards Susan Rice. She is a very smart, articulate, caring and sharp! I saw her on the view. She was awesome! She is willing to do whatever it takes to help Biden in whatever capacity that may be.
Rando polls huh?  Y‚Äôall go with that.   üëå.    Biden is coming.

*If True: It‚Äôll be a Trump landslide.  ** I‚Äôm still extremely cautious and believe Biden has the lead.
The idea that either "party" is Christian or cares about Christians is absurd. Christians are people, people vote.  Biden is Galatians 5:22-23 only because he is a dementia patient.  2 Timothy 3:1-5 is not Trump, it is the culture et al.  Politics is downhill from culture.
Oh I love America!   I don‚Äôt like the state of my country under tRUMP but that will soon end!   Many Republicans are voting Biden  because they want tRUMP out.   tRUMPS lack of action and a plan caused  4.74 Million Cases of COVID-19 157,000 deaths from COVID-19
Barack Obama chose Joe Biden to be his VP on August 23, 2008. Two days before the DNC. It's not atypical to wait for those things...
At this point, this Warren lover would still vote for Biden even if he picked Dick Cheney as his VP.
Meanwhile, Gov. Roy Cooper who refused to host the RNC in Charlotte, NC without social distancing, now enjoys a healthy 20-point lead in his race, which bodes well for Biden and Cal Cunningham.
Both Covid and the protests have put Trump in a precarious situation where he has fewer and fewer paths to 270 electoral votes, while Biden has multiple paths.

If you added up all of Joe Biden's gaffes, you'd have the equivalent to ONE Trump press briefing.
Soooooo True!!!
While the lead WILL narrow, I think Biden can keep doing what he's been doing all the way until the debate. Why waste energy/time fighting with Trump for the airways, when Trump continues to tank his own political standing just by talking?
I know Biden isn't everyone's cup of tea, but fact is Trump is struggling against him in part because he can't easily attack or define him like with Hilary, Bernie, or the squad...
Maybe Biden waiting to interview with Chris Wallace when he is running for 4th time in 2024, but Chis may retire before 2024.
Biden doesn't need to convert all of those voters. He just needs to chip away at them.
Biden at this point has multiple paths to 270. Trump's problem is that he has fewer and fewer as the race progresses.
Far left Fauci is doing everything to help Biden stay in basement by keeping everything closed except street full of rioters.
You want Biden but split government. That didn't work out very well in the Obama years. I think we have reached a tipping point where extream begets extreme. There are enough liberal judges to shred the Constitution and you will give Biden 2 SCOTUS picks.
As economy worsens, it becomes a bigger issue, which Trump beats Biden in. Ppl miss the strong economy of February 2020 and know Trump had his fingerprints all over it.
Excellent choice for Biden‚Äôs running mate!!!
Nope. I saw where Dems are requesting more VBM ballots in Kansas, so it‚Äôs a Biden lock.
Yes, if that is your summary, but the outcome is the same, #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  And if that gives me a Black female VP then absolutely that is what's happening. M'kay? Now vote Biden please. Or not. But don't pretend this is a regular election where we can choose.
Oh, bullshit.  If Biden reverses the HUGE tax breaks for the 1% wealthiest Americans....it will pay for tax cuts for the middle class.

I will vote BLUE no matter what they do. I wouldn't honor Trump by debating him, if I were Joe Biden. Trump is a con man and doesn't deserve the usual campaign rites.
I‚Äôve met a handful of Romney/Trump/Biden voters. A few Obama/Trump/Biden voters. A ton of 3rd Party/Biden voters. Have not met a Clinton/Trump OR an Obama/Trump/Trump voter.
I would vote for a moldy loaf of bread before I would vote for Trump. Biden can debate or not. He still gets my vote.
He IS the establishment. He's been in the Senate for 30 years, almost as long as Joe Biden.I didn't think the group, undecided between Trump and Biden existed. Now I am in that group. Perhaps for odd rationalization, but still.
Did some reflecting and rationalizing. I am convinced Biden won't make it to Thanksgiving next year, I would vote for his VP. If it's Kamala no way, but Rice is a contender. I was VP debates. I could care less about Trump and Biden.
How do y‚Äôall feel about this upcoming election ? I think it‚Äôs fucked either way ... trump or Biden ... but could be worse with trump... I think we all doomed
I am waiting for the VP pick. And to be clear, if I vote for Biden, I am punishing the GOP. Get your s#it together and go pull your principles out of the trash can. Here's a hint, principles transcend the President. Act like a coequal branch not a frat party.

Polls going bad? Looks like Biden still in landslide territory
This is undeniable true.  And still Trump may lose to a tired dementia patient.  How is this possible?  An endless stream of tweets.  And most recently the Axios interview which was Biden level incoherent.  If a CEO did what Trump has done they would have been fired long ago.
You guys think it‚Äôs all about money. Silver and The Economist and that MSNBC douche say it‚Äôs a Biden landslide
Wait! Doesn‚Äôt Quinnipiac have Biden up big?
Black lives matter but the support of that organization is basically paying Joe Biden &amp; the Democratic Party. Again, as before, the blacks have been hijacked &amp; used. I'm sure its Trump's fault...just ask
Why would someone be hiding their vote. The man is literally President. Feel like there‚Äôs more secret Biden voters than a trump voters
Basement Biden's latest brand of idiotic and insensitive racism...basically saying that Blacks all think the same, while Latinos are more diversified in their way of thinking. Totally false and insulting on a number of levelsüò©ü§•.  Biden keeps digging his own political defeat.
He said he supported redirecting the funds. Are you going to claim this is different. I've checked a bunch of your BS fact checks and you aren't really getting it done. I guess this is just for entertainment purposes. Your work on Biden vs Extortion 17 and outing the Seals is BS.
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
I love this. Lol. Biden digging his hole deeper into dementia daily.
In 2016 MI Primary: 1.3M votes in Republican and 1.2M for Democrats. *i think Biden has MI locked
Hmm, I prayed to God, queried Her regarding this latest preposterous claim of Trump's - She was quite bewildered. She replied that Her servant Joe has been a most devout follower.   "Trailing in election polls, Trump says rival Biden is 'against God'"
It‚Äôs like they have us over a barrel! We‚Äôre sures hell not voting for Trump so all that‚Äôs left is Biden and he‚Äôs not right for America either. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unfair that 4 states decided who would be the democratic candidate for the whole country!  How are we ok with this?
He also inherited that economy from Biden. Also Biden has co sponsored bills that have helped many Americans such as Disablities act and finance regulations. Also made some mistakes but everyone does, senators aren‚Äôt high profile like presidents.
Biden is not Catholic He believes in abortion

Democrats supporting Joe Biden.
I don't think ANYONE will believe that Biden doesn't "have a Religion"or know the Bible
The "point" of America as a melting-pot is all that historical crap is meaningless and is just politics to divide and victimize.  Jim Crow is not a "culture".  It is a historic fact.  Biden views minorities as mascots to pander to.  I would rather he consider us equally Americans
Is Joe Biden working for Kanye?
Oh, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don‚Äôt question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, Americaüëéüèº
He literally is not running on his accomplishments. Please show me where‚Äôs he‚Äôs running on the economy (which is shit right now). The only thing that he possibly is running on is the wall (which isn‚Äôt built) and saying Biden has dementia but is also a left wing radical
I just don‚Äôt think Biden has it in him. Even w/o his dimentia, he has no passion.
There you go again fear mongering. Biden has not said he would take away guns.
So it seems we‚Äôre stuck with the lesser of two racists? Picking dumb or dumber? Biden was supposed to know how to stick to a script and not make these stupidly ridiculous off the wall comments on things he really shouldn‚Äôt be talking about! Can we just get Bernie? Is it to late?
Given Biden's lack of respect for us, I wouldn't be surprised at this point...
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
How do you square this against what Biden is saying?  Is he a bigot or senile?
Biden: "Blacks lack diversity."  Me: "What. The F-ck".
More Jolt: Georgia's state labor commissioner nixes meeting with Senate Democrats over slow processing of unemployment benefits, claiming protests have been "near riots" and alleging threats to target his home ... #gapol
Sadly Trump and his team are not listening to you. And it wouldn't matter. Also sadly Trump has demonstrated over 3 1/2 year he is either unwilling or incapable of acting Presidential. The Axios interview was as incorrect as Biden. How about a write-in campaign for Ted Cruz?

Biden is a nut job. Must concur
Once Biden wins the virus will magically disappear
I cannot believe Biden is the democratic nominee. He is clearly losing his mind! I predict whoever he picks will likely fill his seat in the near future.
Yes, and I agree that can't be simply dismissed as "his style". My conspiracy theory... What I see is a man in decline enjoying his retirement. The DNC came knocking and convinced him to run after he said no. This is about the first woman POTUS and Biden gets POTUS in his bio.
I feel so bad for Biden. I wanna protect him like I would a grandpa üò≠ But he should definitely not be the President of the United States
Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
Or with Trump taking action (e.g. China travel ban) in late January and all the left (including Biden) freaking out.
Tf is Biden supposed to do
Are you  trying to give Joe Biden a gift? No, absolutely not, we need to see how a candidate can handle the pressure BEFORE he could be president.
That‚Äôs why Biden is getting 454 EVs. Orange Man Bad!
Biden refuses to debate until there‚Äôs a COVID-19 vaccine.
I think Bernie could win. Trump has enough negatives. At least Bernie is coherent. Seriously, if you are trying to decide between not voting or voting for Biden I think that decision would be easier with Bernie. And really Bernie isn't a Democrat, so they would push back on him.
Trump will double the Black vote from 2016; 6% to 12%. Fact. #TrumpLandslide
Well somewhat you let Biden be "the voice" of the people so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ok
This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.
Biden at a virtual fundraiser with Atlanta Mayor  today: ‚ÄúIt would be a hell of a win. But if we come close in Georgia, we probably will help elect a couple Democratic senators.  We elect a congressman. We elect up and down the line. And we have to build our bench.‚Äù
You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs a shame Biden used that word.
Lol. Professor famous for correctly predicting the winner of 24 of the last 26 presidential elections, including Trump‚Äôs win in 2016, predicts Trump beats Biden 362 to 176 with a 91% re-election chance.

I hope it fill the Biden team with a dread of what is going to happen should their be disappointment.
A fabulous call! Stay WELL, Mr. President-to-be so that you can get elected and get that asshole Trump evicted... "Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC because of coronavirus concerns"
Biden has COVID?
Some fundamental changes to the parties are needed. The party does not control who runs, the people select the candidate based on the rules. The candidate rights the platform. I know why Trump in 16 Why Biden in 20? Dem voters were going to send a socialist or a dementia patient?
i‚Äôm shocked when I see cocky trump cultists that are genuinely excited about the debates between the cheeto and  All their boy knows how to do is insult and lie. He‚Äôs genuinely stupid. All Biden has to do is stay calm and let donny hang himself.
The media is t trying to convince anyone of an upcoming Biden blowout. They are reporting on poll results and always saying anything could happen.
I think Biden should agree to debates only if both candidates can be fact checked in real time. I know Trump would never agree to this because he can‚Äôt tell the truth
What usually happens with egregious Hatch Act violations is the person gets fired. That's not going to happen with this administration, of course. There's also the possibility of a $1,000 fine and it would be giggle-worthy for Biden's DOJ to go after Miller and McEnany.
Nope, definitely a Biden.
Seems no sane person would even say or imply that Biden is anything but demented.  That‚Äôs how utterly political everyone and everything is now.

Hi Dawn nice to see you on line. Hope all is well and you are staying safe!
The smell of desperation in the Trump camp is palpable. All that President P*ssy Grabber's media loyalists can do is take missed jabs at Biden's character and it's just sad. I've yet to see one of these pundits take a legitimate shot at Bidens credibility or qualifications.
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency
Great debate between Gov. Huckabee, Judge Jeanine and Sean Hannity on the Democrats self-destructive plans for Joe Biden to potentially skip the Presidential Debates.
That you think Biden is the choices of two evils?
Democratic Party may be replacing Joe Biden you heard here first people.
If  was an ACME SenateNet agent &amp; helped us catch Carmen Sandiego‚Äôs crooks in the 90s, all of my fellow ACME detectives should vote for Biden!  Only Trump would make the entire ACME Detective Agency look bad!  #TrumpPenceOutNow #Biden2020
As President, would Biden welcome back people who were deported by ICE and separated from their families for minor crimes? Watching the ICE documentary on Netflix really makes me feel for these families.
Imagine this still being your only defense after that brain dead interview given by Trump.   Many crtisism of Biden would work if Trump didn‚Äôt fully embody every single one of them (not being mentally capable, pedofile, puppet for foreign leaders, ‚Äúthis is Biden‚Äôs America ‚Äú)
The epitome of fragility.  via rawstory
new biden ads getting weird
And Biden is unknown?
‚ÄúTryin‚Äù to understand your incoherent tweet, but what i think you‚Äôre saying is stupid, lazy and mentally ill ppl vote for Biden, which I take offense to.
Why would call this energetic and enthusiastic candidate ‚ÄúBasement Biden‚Äù? How dare you!
The wars though. We need more wars. Definitely Biden will help with that. ü§ûüèº
A MUST!   I like Susan Rice. She is a smart, sharp, and classy lady!  I saw her on The View. They asked her about Benghazi. She gave the perfect answer.   She is a team player willing to do whatever it takes for Biden to be successful no matter what capacity that may be!
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Trump's base Does. Not. Matter. He can have his unshakeable 35% of the vote; Biden has a bigger base than that plus a huge anti-Trump vote. What matters are swing voters, the 10% persuadable. Right now it's 51-40, so Trump would need at least 80% and they favor BLM over the feds.
Voter registration efforts haven‚Äôt stopped since 2016 for  &amp;    Meanwhile, in Georgia, Joe Biden hired his first staffers... last week.  #gapol #LeadRight #GeorgiaGrit
Trumps TAX SCAM is also known as trickledown.   Basically DEFUND the average American citizen to FUND the wealthy!   Biden will be REVERSING that scam!   It‚Äôs about damn time someone took care of the working class!
Explain what the Green New Deal would mean to loss of JOBS in effected states, Ronna.  THAT has more meaning to folks.  And above ALL, talk about the ONLY thing that really matters...the loss of freedom and the institutionalization of tyranny that Biden brings on his coattails.
Don‚Äôt forget that when Biden finally bows out for health reasons the Democrats may very well choose Andrew Cuomo as either the presidential or vice presidential candidate.
If Biden can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt debate, then he is not a legitimate presidential candidate.
Did Twitter tell you which rule? I always ask and they never tell me. Frustrating
You don‚Äôt have to close your app. Just wait about 1 min then you can follow a few more. At least that is what worked for me.

I keep getting ‚ÄúRate Limit Exceeded‚Äù then the message goes away and all is fine. Very strange.   I thought I might have still been shadow banned!
What?!? HRC has a brand like non other seen in modern day politics and a religious following! Biden doesn‚Äôt nearly have that.
is this a sign of desperation or a way to get Biden out if the basement?
So a debate would be for 5) undecided between Trump and Biden I am convinced this group is a myth.   If Trump weren't a grade A jerk he may have had a shot at creating this group. But it doesn't exist today.
Who needs to be convinced of what?  No debate required for 1) will vote for Trump 2) will vote for Biden  What about 3) may vote Trump or 3rd party or stay home 4) may vote Biden... Well this group doesn't need a debate. They need the individual candidates to present their cases.
Just one poll. State polling looks much better for Biden
üíØ  Biden is the avatar for Trump haters.
Why should our guy debate when the election is over? I‚Äôm calling 444 EVs for our fearless, energetic, enthusiastic, transformative leader! Joe Biden. #ByeDon
If Biden had any potential to serve two terms, people probably wouldn't get so wound up about the VP pick. It's historically a much weaker role than the major cabinet jobs. Susan Rice hasn't run for anything, and I want somebody who can run HARD in 2024.
Virtually all MSM's polls have Joe Biden leading/winning by a landslide, and instead of being celebratory all the way to election day, the "we will dox you, verbally and physically attack all who disagrees with us" Left has #DearMichigan trending, begging them to vote for Joe?ü§î
444 EVs for Biden, baby!!! His energetic, transformative, and enthusiastic campaign sends shivers down my spine. You too?
My FB account got restricted for 30 days for posting some meme with Creepy Joe Biden hugging kids. They called it sexually explicit content.
Obama was a high energy transformative, once in a generation, young candidate with an MLK like speaking capability. Don‚Äôt think Biden is remotely close.
I am leaning towards Susan Rice. She is a very smart, articulate, caring and sharp! I saw her on the view. She was awesome! She is willing to do whatever it takes to help Biden in whatever capacity that may be.
Ever walk down elongated stairs, like in a theater.  Yea, looks like that.  Im much younger than him and I go down them pretty much the same way, but nice try.  Now let's talk about why Biden can't ever remember where he is...

*If True: It‚Äôll be a Trump landslide.  ** I‚Äôm still extremely cautious and believe Biden has the lead.
The idea that either "party" is Christian or cares about Christians is absurd. Christians are people, people vote.  Biden is Galatians 5:22-23 only because he is a dementia patient.  2 Timothy 3:1-5 is not Trump, it is the culture et al.  Politics is downhill from culture.
Oh I love America!   I don‚Äôt like the state of my country under tRUMP but that will soon end!   Many Republicans are voting Biden  because they want tRUMP out.   tRUMPS lack of action and a plan caused  4.74 Million Cases of COVID-19 157,000 deaths from COVID-19
At this point, this Warren lover would still vote for Biden even if he picked Dick Cheney as his VP.

Maybe Biden waiting to interview with Chris Wallace when he is running for 4th time in 2024, but Chis may retire before 2024.
Far left Fauci is doing everything to help Biden stay in basement by keeping everything closed except street full of rioters.
Never said he did? You asked for something and I showed you. I still have yet to see something similar from ardent Biden supporters
You want Biden but split government. That didn't work out very well in the Obama years. I think we have reached a tipping point where extream begets extreme. There are enough liberal judges to shred the Constitution and you will give Biden 2 SCOTUS picks.
As economy worsens, it becomes a bigger issue, which Trump beats Biden in. Ppl miss the strong economy of February 2020 and know Trump had his fingerprints all over it.
Nope. I saw where Dems are requesting more VBM ballots in Kansas, so it‚Äôs a Biden lock.

Its just going to get worse. He and barr will do something so far outside the norms after the election when biden wins im order to stay in office that I am very concerned. The damage this man is doing to our democracy is going to take decades to repair.

Yup. Have to agree. It‚Äôs going to be a bloodbath of epic proportions that Canada will loan Saskatchewan and Manitoba as blue states. 450 EVs baby!   Love these accurate polls. Why even deep dive when Biden is consistently up 10-15?!?! They can‚Äôt all be wrong!!!
Biden isn‚Äôt on offense or defense. He‚Äôs not even playing
He is. He‚Äôll be crying when Biden wins Arkansas
This ‚òùüèøbut Biden is going to win by 10-15. Utah will be blue
Nah. 440 EVs for Biden bc his enthusiastic, energetic, transformative candidacy will bring out ppl in epic proportion. Utah‚Äôs in play too."IF you don't vote for me, you are not black"  Calling somebody at a town hall fat.  Challenging a worker at a plant to step outside over a discussion about guns.  Biden is not acting normal and the Media is trying to cover and hide for him.
Biden says he‚Äôll stop the border wall if elected. How about y‚Äôall stop playing with our tax money. Feed the poor! Shelter the homeless! Pay teachers more! Stop wasting our money!
In other words, right now people will vote for Biden and he wants to change that.
None of my weapons are assault weapons, they are self defense weapons. Biden needs to know the difference
It's astounding to see the Democrat party that constantly attacks racism is supporting a racist for President. They are using the Biden name for bait and switch vote.

This is an unfortunate truth. Unsure if the exact figure is accurate, but the basis is pretty solid. I had like three other candidates I preferred to Biden, but I'll vote along party lines as will others.
Trump is going to have his work cut out for him to get enough Americans to sufficiently despise Biden to engineer a rerun of the 2016 election.
Reported Biden later added,  ‚ÄúThese are the same people you  see putting clean fingers in their ears.‚Äù
Reported that Joe Biden said Dr. Fauci is right - no one has died from the virus who has placed Duck tape over their mouth and nose, then super glued their eyes shut.
is a wanna be authoritarian dictator.  He doesn't care what the US Constitution says. He wants chaos, violence &amp; power.  Does anyone think Trump is ever going to call Biden to concede the election?  He could lose 340 million to 1 and he would not congratulate Joe
If Biden won't go, Trump should still show up and debate an empty podium.  The podium might do better than Joe would have.
Biden, decency?  Ha Ha.  Sorry, but the only thing I can give him is empathy.  He is not a leader and he also lacks decency.  Calling somebody fat because they don't agree with him?  Yeah, really classy.

Wow. Apparently the same Joe Biden who Trump has accused of being weak and hiding out in his basement also has the power to "hurt God." Fascinating.
Nobody should be sending in ballots. Dems starting early on their fraud votes. They can't have Biden debate any1 Even if they try telling him what2say in a ear piece they know they can't control what comes out his mouth. All the bullshit going on is so they Don't have to debate.
Biden needs to select a VP and then go into hiding while they do all of the campaigning. He is just so bad at this.

The honest truth about Kamala Harris is this:  She completes Biden!  She is as phony, vacuous, empty, shallow, hollow, and mindless as him!  A perfect pair...of NOTHING.
What do Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, and Facebook all have in common?  OWNED by CHINA!!
America, this is Sleepy Biden‚Äôs selection for vise president!  She whored her way to Sacramento government with mayor Brown! Question, do you want her as your next president????? She will destroy this great nation anyway she can!!!!
Where have you been? Biden is on YOUTUBE, MSNBC, CBS, CNN, he's done alot of interviews
One silver lining if Biden wins, I‚Äôll finally be able to talk shit about the president with my parents.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
It's too bad for you Obama isn't the one running against Trump. Joe Biden is. He has 8.3 million followers. 78 million less than Trump. Bahaha!
If you‚Äôre going to go do hard against mail-in voting, you need to vote in person. That‚Äôs my opinion on the matter.  I honestly don‚Äôt care what Obama or Biden did or didn‚Äôt do lol
President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.
Tucker Carlson revealed the scariest truth about Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his VP  via
"I don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.‚Äù
You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
Trump is blamed for everything so if that rapist Joe Biden (someone that is the reason for mass incarceration of black people) wins I will blame him for everything. If the Braves lose. If my dog dies. If I break a bone.
Did Mike Pence just say that he‚Äôs going to beat Biden‚Äôs meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won‚Äôt take even softball question from the media.

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd put her country over her party. She knows Joe Biden well and knows that he‚Äôd be an outstanding President. She also knows that her father would have already endorsed him and would have likely been his Secretary of Defense.
I'll take a chance on the USPS. Images of the mailbag scene from Christmas on 34th St, all for Biden/Harris.
the fact that some people are choosing to not vote over both trump and Biden doesn‚Äôt sit right with me
Wow. Such desperation from the Biden camp.
She is a big part of their plans. What I see is Biden gets elected and takes demands from Nancy then he has to step down because of health problems Kamala takes over and appointments Nancy as VP then somehow Nancy takes over and then you have hell on earth.

Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we‚Äôve dodged a bullet.
And Biden mispronounced his running mate‚Äôs name. ü§î But then, maybe it was victory for him to even remember it.

Team Biden and Kamala let‚Äôs make history
I have an 8 &amp; 11 yr old girl. It doesn't take Kamala running for VP to make them feel strong and confident. I have raised them to know how capable they are. Kamala is not a good example. &amp; Biden definitely isn't.
Congratulations on your primary Keep up the good work Be strong &amp; tell America that the marxist left led by Biden/Harris (Obama etal r )in there too-gross!) r on a mission 2 destroy America &amp; our freedoms &amp; turn it into a commie nightmare where they have all power&amp; we r slaves!!
You are Dem operative and everyone knows it. To ever say you are a conservative is just a joke. You know Biden will be humiliated on debate stage
I don't think you people actually understand our rigged ass voting system.  Votes against Biden/Harris AND Trump won't have electorate pull.  Then what? He fucks us to death?  If you really wanted someone else, the work to be done was the last years - in a still frigged system üí©

Biden, because he overall has less to say; she never shuts up
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.
Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I‚Äôm all ears. Otherwise, I‚Äôd suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.
If you took just another minute to click that twitch link, you‚Äôd see videos clear as day with my face.   I‚Äôm not one of these bots you been dealing with, I have receipts. Do the math yourself if you need to verify my comments about just getting over Covid. Let‚Äôs stay on topic.
The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama‚Äôs VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you‚Äôre not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
The designation of who is fash is meaningless, it‚Äôs a bullshit term that gets thrown around to much. Also Biden‚Äôs been trying to and had bragged about cutting social security for ages. They‚Äôre not different. There‚Äôs a market reason the libs wanna cut it.
I just got over a stint with COVID. I can confirm children do have a high enough ‚Äúviral load‚Äù to infect others because that‚Äôs how we got it.
I am not sure what they are doing, but I suspect they are trying to maneuver for the House and the Senate and trying to make us look away with the obvious clown show of biden/harris
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate...what a winning hand...!!!

When you‚Äôre bashing Biden and/or Harris and conservatives start joining in like you‚Äôre allies
Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
Just watched the wonderful Biden/Harris acceptance speech. He was like our proverbial father figure and she was the favored first child. I am so happy to see intelligence, grace and reverence displayed. Thanks Joe Biden for offering Kamala Harris the position as Vice President.
You mean , ‚Äúcam-a-la‚Äù as Biden says and not Kam-a-la lol
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can‚Äôt let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don‚Äôt let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...
if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. You‚Äôre voting for Trump. If you don‚Äôt vote at all you‚Äôre voting for Trump. If you vote for Kanye, YOU‚ÄôRE VOTING FOR TRUMP
Kamala as Biden's VP pick?  What do you suppose she was thinking??
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
Imagine talking shit about Trump but ACTUALLY thinking Joe Biden is going to do a better job :( Imma just sit this one out.
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don‚Äôt hide under ‚Äúanti-Biden‚Äù.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn‚Äôt even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He‚Äôs a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It‚Äôs ok we know Biden doesn‚Äôt want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
Because Biden was gonna dunno matter what
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
‚ÄúHe (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they‚Äôre kind of in sync. Dick Morris
It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)
Intelligent people will research that video showing Joe Biden saying the N word and will learn that he was criticizing the words of a racist bigot.
This literally makes 0 sense, Biden and Harris are literally republicans wearing paper thin Democrat suitsüòÇ

Now, Biden, put   over education please.  needs to go. Senator Warren would be the best for education....she will rebuild the education system.
Wait, I thought Biden was fully fit for office? He rode a bike! Stelter said so!
Biden will not be the nominee. He will be gone.
Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
And now CNN is setting the stage to admit that Biden isn't fit for office in February. They'll begin pushing for him to step aside then.
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Fairly powerless VP? Have you seen Joe Biden? I don't give him a year before he's removed from office under the 25th. She will end up President if they win.  Better she be neither.
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain‚Äôt learn about biden‚Äôs crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain‚Äôt kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.

The suspense is over. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced on Tuesday afternoon that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is his vice presidential running mate.

It's interesting how rarely a presidential nominee chooses a primary foe as his/her running mate. In the past 60 years, I think only Reagan-Bush, Kerry-Edwards, Obama-Biden and now Biden-Harris.
Yeah, you scared me for a second that you were doing a surprise retirement, but I do worry about how, even in a Biden/Harris presidency, they might push for another SESTA/FOSTA-type law and how a lot of democrats will call us Republicans for criticizing &amp;"supporting sex workers"

Lee also trots out the socialist straw man but Biden and most Democrats are not socialists. If they were, Biden would not be the nominee.
üó£Ô∏èA VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS WILL=NO GUNS FULL TERM ABORTIONS DESTROY ECONOMY BECOME DEPENDANT FOR OIL AGAIN MEDICARE FOR ALL REMOVE OUR FAIR TRADE STOP BUILDING MILITARY DEFUND POLICE PUT CAR IND.OUT OF BUSINESS BUILD MORE ELECTRIC CARS OPEN BORDERS AND BUILD F""G WINDMILLS! KAGüá∫üá∏
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
BIDEN WILL NOT MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!!üò± HE'S ALREADY HAD A BRAIN STROKE! LOOK IN HIS EYES!
...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn‚Äôt the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn‚Äôt from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that‚Äôs a big reason why I personally don‚Äôt like Biden. So to say that the reasons he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She‚Äôs so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I‚Äôm damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden‚Äôs good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I am not trying to justify anything for Trump. I was however pointing out the hypocrisy of the original post of the media clipping parts of Biden's videos and using them out of context being wrong but the same is done to Trump and there is nothing wrong with that.
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She‚Äôs going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
He certainly is not Christlike. I think Biden is Christlike.
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Look, don‚Äôt vote for Biden just because you hate Trump. Biden is senile and is as corrupt as they come. Also don‚Äôt get me started in Kamala Harris. What I‚Äôm trying to get at is just vote for Jo if you hate Trump.
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?
I need this $400 unemployment to start coming asap so I can buy Biden/Harris Masks, Bumper Stickers, and Yard Signs ASAP!
Kamala: I believe the survivors of Joe Biden  Also Kamala: ‚ú®Joe Biden‚Äôs VP‚ú®
Biden needs to watch his food and drinks...it would be just terrible if someone slipped him something...
Mama doesn‚Äôt like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump‚Ñ¢ on Candidate Joe Biden's¬© naming of Kamala Harris¬Æ as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I‚Äôll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!
ü§îWell, Well, Well, between Biden saying "they gonna  put y'all back  in chains" and Kamala changing the way she speaks in front of black audiences, We have a COMPLETE RACISTS COCKTAIL!!üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fox news has been a platform for the democrats ALL DAY!! Democrats don't have enough guts to admit Biden is incompetent!!
BREAKING on #VP choice:  selects CA Senator  as his running mate. #KamalaHarris is the 1st black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Do you agree with Biden's choice of running mate? More details. &gt;&gt;&gt;
I couldn‚Äôt be happier!! She‚Äôs gonna be great VP. Damned proud of Biden
Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has ‚Äúbacked the blue‚Äù since it was a ‚Äústance‚Äù. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.
LMFAOOOO Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his VP. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs screaming ‚ÄúAJ don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù. DONT FUCKING WORRY
Joe Biden names Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket
i came to see what y‚Äôall had to say bout biden/harris ü§£
Does joe Biden know?
So she will run the country if they're elected. We all know Biden can't do it.
via  Yes. Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Vice Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden has just named Kamala Harris as his VP running mate. Now it‚Äôs time to really work and get this man to stop raging crazy stuff end get him in that White House
Love the Biden - Harris ticket. You have my vote and financial support. üëçüèø
JUST IN: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
More accurately, Joe Biden‚Äôs handlers tell him they have chosen a running mate for him
I would put nothing past Joe Biden, including that he's a sasquatch with a good waxing regimen.
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams Rips ‚ÄòRamblin‚Äô Joe Biden, ‚ÄòCome Here Joe, Sit ...
Amen. John Kasich is a damned Patriot. The real deal. The only true Republican left that doesn‚Äôt call themselves ‚Äúformer‚Äù . God bless him. We need a strong second party. I pray President Biden builds a bipartisan cabinet and really tries to heal our country from the bitterness.
Yep but every time he speaks it‚Äôs another Biden campaign ad
Mr. Woods,  Please help me understand. In what universe, does anyone or anything actually think Joe Biden would make a good president. I've had lunch with him a few years back. When he was VP. I've had better conversation with drywall.. thank you.
You got it all wrong. Biden goes to the basement and stays. Trump was whisked away but came back to finish Biden just stays in the basement and waits for the sky to fall
Jerry really needs to come out of the closets.
Of course they prefer Biden. Puppet.
Yeah if the league of women voters wasn‚Äôt good enough for you I didn‚Äôt think that would be I‚Äôm beginning to think that the only source you‚Äôll accept is Joe Biden‚Äôs website
Have you heard the way Biden talks about children?
The more we talk the more I think you‚Äôre just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn‚Äôt shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm not trying to rationalize anything I think you‚Äôre mad because there‚Äôs a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you‚Äôre right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she‚Äôs on enough ballots to hit 270 so let‚Äôs get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don‚Äôt believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he‚Äôs not Trump
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden anyways I‚Äôm not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you‚Äôre admitting that Jo‚Äôs policies are better than Biden‚Äôs but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
I am not comparing Trump to Biden. I am stating that the politicians that make the laws are the ones to blame since they promise the same thing every two and four years and never deliver what they promise. They were doing it before Trump and it will continue after
And it‚Äôs not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.
YES!!! Russia is responsible for all the Trump signs and flags I see everywhere!!  And they must be the ones taking down all of the Biden signs!! because I haven‚Äôt seen ANY!!
I AGREE VP BIDEN! WE WILL VOTE COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,SLEET,SNOW,STORMS,ECT.. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE DIED FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS TO VOTEEEEEEE !!! THE ONLY WAY WE DON'T VOTE IS DON'T GO TO THE POLLS! TRUMP IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION AGAIN, SUPRESSING VOTES,CLOSING POST OFFICES!
Ah, so it‚Äôs the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!
did you hear him trashing Trump and bragging on Biden??üò°

President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
love u your tweets movies I thought of good tag for Biden n Harris  Joe n Hoe
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

Did Mike Pence just say that he‚Äôs going to beat Biden‚Äôs meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won‚Äôt take even softball question from the media.

I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.

Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you‚Äôre not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.

Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
#jimmizetv  And you say MR Biden has a speaking problem  #BidenHarris2020   #Biden2020
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...
It‚Äôs a different between MAGA people and those who like Biden/Harris. Don‚Äôt give me that both are mean line. Do you then, sit it out.
Kamala as Biden's VP pick?  What do you suppose she was thinking??
I rather Biden then an Uncle Tom üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Jason Nichols  watching you on Fox and all I have to say is: "can you please get off the narrative that Trump is a racist" Look at the facts, he has done more for blacks than Biden or Harris has done and if he was such a racist why did he donate to her campaign?
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don‚Äôt hide under ‚Äúanti-Biden‚Äù.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn‚Äôt even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He‚Äôs a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It‚Äôs ok we know Biden doesn‚Äôt want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
They are going to have to be careful going after a black(?)female!  Stay on her record-Trump turn her attacks on him into him pointing out Biden‚Äôs many weaknesses-let Pence deal with Harris!  Just keep listing her record!
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
‚ÄúHe (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they‚Äôre kind of in sync. Dick Morris
John Kasich  you think Joe Biden is a man of deep faith? If he were he would not believe and support abortion, removal of prayer from school and wanting to teach Islam and so many more liberal views that go against God.
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I‚Äôm just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I‚Äôve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. üëàüèæ
Remember, Biden (and the Clintons) LOVED ol KKK Robert Byrd...he was their ‚Äúmentor‚Äù...proof the old bigots never ‚Äúswitched and became Republican‚Äù....nope, they decided best way to stay in power was to use minorities by keeping them down with government dependence #NeverBiden
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOTüî• today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOTüî•as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I‚Äôm not the one you want! üëèüèæüíØ
Rand is spot on!!! And it is funny (and sad) how the Establishment Obama/Clinton/Biden Democrats squashed Tulsi...Tulsi a military veteran who while I disagreed with on 90 percent of the issues at least was honest...even a bit Nationalist
5. Biden has shown he bows to pressure by picking Kamala. Biden claims to be a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù but a moderate would never pick Harris. And Biden‚Äôs plan is to ‚Äúwin‚Äù and then resign and let Harris take over. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
It‚Äôs not only that. They just wasn‚Äôt expecting the one woman that they did not want to see be his running mate become his running mate because they are fearful of the power/backing (support system) Biden and Harris will have together w/the ppl, &amp; now, Trump supporters hella mad!
4. Also, Trump despite being called since day 1 ‚Äúa dictator‚Äù has shown what federalism is, he‚Äôs let governors mostly run their states during the crisis and assisted them where needed which is how it is supposed to be! Biden would lock everything down permanently and hide
Claudia....THEY BIG MAD today! What shook them...a BLACK woman they don‚Äôt like is Biden‚Äôs VP candidate and they are fearing this is the end for them! You hate to see it! üëèüèæ
It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)
Just a reminder that voting for Biden and Harris isn‚Äôt just about the presidency. It‚Äôs also about getting better cabinet leaders. A neurosurgeon is head of HUD and the  current secretary of education doesn‚Äôt care about kids getting sick at school from COVID. We need better.
Intelligent people will research that video showing Joe Biden saying the N word and will learn that he was criticizing the words of a racist bigot.
Biden chose k harris thus assuring the re - election of Trump Pence.  Thanks for the Peace of mind. Sleepy joe.
Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
Did Biden have any chances???
Awesome choice, Biden! So happy for Kamala and my party.
Biden actually read a script on the Zoom call and held his phone upside down. This man is toast. This is not going to go well for y‚Äôall.
BidenHarris ticket will bring Donnie down, &amp; while Biden‚Äôs straightening out Donnie‚Äôs mess, Kamela will be putting him in jail!
Harris. Will. Eat. Pence. Alive.  ‚Å¶‚Å¶
To all you liberals who just bought weapons out of fear due to the riots will have to sell them back to the government under a Biden/Harris win. Whatcha ya gonna do then? Vote Trump/Pence and keep you‚Äôre guns!
Now, Biden, put   over education please.  needs to go. Senator Warren would be the best for education....she will rebuild the education system.
...what‚Äôs your re-election plan? (that‚Äôs not attacking Biden/Harris)
Biden will not be the nominee. He will be gone.
Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain‚Äôt learn about biden‚Äôs crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain‚Äôt kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.
Guess I can still vote for Biden/Harris- even though her stepson is a Tiger!!  ##ccsucks #dupioneers #nowademocrat #recoveringrepublucan

Biden/Harris is alright with me!!!
...because he‚Äôs shook now knowing Biden has Harris as his running mate. Trump was all over the place in the presser.
Trump (since he can‚Äôt campaign due to COVID) has taken these‚úåüèædaily #coronavirus briefings‚úåüèæ&amp; turn them into his campaign rally platform. Honestly, he looks like he &amp; his campaign doesn‚Äôt have a game plan to win re-election other than simply attack Biden &amp; now Kamala.
Y‚Äôall think Congress or Supreme Court would allow Biden/Harris to get away with as much as Trump/Pence? Idk, then again, we can‚Äôt trust them either lol.
Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate.

Biden/Harris......PeePads and KneePads 2020!! #notgonnahappen

Girl stop it!!!! Seriously? I‚Äôd file and HR claim  üòÇ My old 45 supporter coworkers were very hush hush but now everyone is very excited about Biden &amp; Harris. And I‚Äôm new, it‚Äôs definitely going to be a thing . I‚Äôve gotta prepare big time
It's interesting how rarely a presidential nominee chooses a primary foe as his/her running mate. In the past 60 years, I think only Reagan-Bush, Kerry-Edwards, Obama-Biden and now Biden-Harris.
Kamala, yall! I could not be happier. I'm about to cry. She will chew Pence up and spit him out at that debate. What a great partner for Biden and the future for MY PARTY!  WOOT!
Y‚Äôall niggas really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate?! Lmao FUCK HER!!
Yeah, you scared me for a second that you were doing a surprise retirement, but I do worry about how, even in a Biden/Harris presidency, they might push for another SESTA/FOSTA-type law and how a lot of democrats will call us Republicans for criticizing &amp;"supporting sex workers"
Someone picked Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate.  You can bet he didn't make the pick.  Someone took a no-win situation and made it worse! üòÇü§£ü§îüôÑ

No to kids in cages. Yes to doing something about the pandemic and the environment. I'd love more progress but we have to start by fixing the problems in this country. Biden/Harris have my support. We have to stop the bleeding to start healing.
If you're not going to vote for Biden because of his VP pick, you probably haven't looked into  running mate. I say this as a sad libertarian.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee  via
There is no better alternative. There is no time for anything less than urgently removing Donald Trump. I'm urging fellow progressives: take this as a partial win, vote Biden/Harris, and keep fighting after we've defeated Trump.
Announced from Biden‚Äôs basement?
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
I'm not going into this expecting every policy position that I want or even those I think are necessary. Still, two mature, experienced professionals like Harris and Biden are what I think this country needs to beat back the pandemic and start this country on a better track.
At least Biden ain‚Äôt pick that lady who own son don‚Äôt even like her
Will Biden come out of the basement for debates or just gonna tag his Indian Jamaican runningmate

Biden‚Äôs VP is trending... BRUH MAKE IT TREND WHEN HE ACTUALLY FUCKING PICKS SOMEONE
Joe Biden said that if he is elected he will load up every social security recipient onto buses and then drive them off a cliff to an explosive death. This is as true as what Biden the plagiarizer said about Trump.
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a rampClinton screwed up the party for two decades, and Biden is running on the platform of, "I'm going to open the flood gates and let all of those a-holes back in by the thousands."  If that guy wins, Democrat politics is done until I'm in the ground.
Biden is an empty vessel. Fauci is a ship with a foreign harbor.
brilliant explication of how K Harris became Biden‚Äôs pick.
Fauci corrects Biden and Harris.  Damn, Biden looks like crap.
All of my company dem friends just posted status that looks like it came out of a Biden camp press release.   It's all some form of:  The Presidency is a big deal. Get Trump Out. The Presidency isn't that big of a deal, so vote Biden out and work in local politics.
I know how we could have saved 80k lives. Lock up the Five Dem Governors who sent 80k to their deaths in Nursing Homes. Cuomo, Murphy, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom. Stop Biden and his mass murdering governors.
Trump has protected Social Security. Schumer, Biden, and the left want to print more money allowing inflation to take away your Social Security and other property of value. You will become their slaves in America‚Äôs Venezuela.
I don‚Äôt... which is partly why I supported Warren. But your perfect candidate doesn‚Äôt exist. The choice is between Biden and Trump, and Biden is by far and away the best choice and will make a fine President.
I don‚Äôt disagree that parts of it were bad policy. The bill was a compromise. Biden himself said it wasn‚Äôt perfect and went on record back then about not being a fan fo the sentencing. But the bill included an assault weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act. These are good
Yeah, we're voting for Biden!!
I‚Äôm not actually sure who I‚Äôd enjoy see suffer more, rich liberals fawning over Biden/Kamala or MAGAs.
Voting by mail, absentee ballot is safe. But mail-in-ballots are not verifiable. They are fraud waiting to happen from the mailbox to the vote box. Biden‚Äôs Dementia has made him stupid. He looks like crap.
Trump has protected Social Security. He will never defund Social Security. His economy will increase the value of your Social Security. Biden wantd to print more money to make Social Security worthless. Killed by Biden‚Äôs inflation.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
Such lies you tell I'm riding with Biden and I wouldn't vote for you if my life depended on it. And there's a lot of Republicans turning their back on you because you haven't done a darn thing you said you were going to do.
Biden wants to print more money so that he can make you poor and dependent with inflation. Give 2 trillion to the failing Dem sanctuary cities, and Biden will give you a 200 billion. Demented Joe Biden and Communist K-Harris need your vote to make you poor.
Biden will not provide security. Anything you put before security you will lose. Don‚Äôt let Biden fool you with DNC propaganda.

You could honestly say the same thing about Biden..
It‚Äôs a privilege to not have to care about Biden and Harris‚Äôs past racist policies and actions. It might not effect you directly, but it sure as heck has effected our society, even if you haven‚Äôt felt that, personally.
Biden can‚Äôt comprehend anything, he can barely read a teleprompter.
Joe Biden ended his first campaign for president?
You have to understand,  four more years of Trump Presidency doesn't screw up the Democratic party the way a Biden/Harris Presidency does.  Company Democrats are aggressively anti-Left.
I can‚Äôt believe Biden won‚Äôt stop mandating masks!! Fucking politics...
people posting "trump thanks you" in reply to posts holding kamala and biden responsible for shit they've done is beyond parody. they don't get a pass for being blue.

They don't like facts my friend. They were born stupid. They believe everything the TV tells them. They are too stupid to realize Biden is a true racist, the whole Democratic party are nothing but racist.

Biden has several hurdles. He‚Äôs physically and mentally challenged. He‚Äôs fragile. He could fall and break his hip. That would do it.
The skinny brain syndrome is well known. As Biden loses weight his brain shrinks exponentially. Biden‚Äôs condition is called hydrocephalus exvacuo. It would be nice to see a CT scan of Biden‚Äôs brain with an EEG.

Gives an argument about why you shouldn't elect anti-populist Dems. Empower folks like Neal-- and Biden/Harris will bring them in by the busloads-- you can't underestimate how many people will whack Left to get in their good graces.
And he won't have the House for the next 2 either... and not the next 4 if he starts doing to things you're talking about... Of course when Biden/Harris start doing those things, the #Resistance will cheer - and that's exactly why the oligarchs gave us these four years of Trump.

No, the reason Harris got the job is she is qualified. She has the resume and relevant campaign experience. Plus, Biden trusts her bc she worked with his son. The headlines about her race and gender are bc that is what makes the pick historic. See the difference?

In fact, (my mistake) there is data about Warren voters' second choice. It shows a similar number of her supporters would have gone to Sanders as would have gone to Biden.
Fwiw, we dont have data on who Warren voters would have chosen for their second choice. Many of them jumped ship to Biden when she quit because they didnt like Bernie. Evidence that all of Warren's supporters would have gone to Bernie is anecdotal and likely inaccurate.
If Trump‚Äôs immigration plan is -100, Obama/Biden‚Äôs was what a -70? And the best Democratic candidate on the Primary stage was maybe a +10? So is it better to have Biden for 4-8 years, or a wide open primary in both parties where immigration can be a central issue in 2024?

All this bs about Biden/Harris being so radical. You know what's radical? Fucking anonymous cops in the streets. Appointing fucking crooks and thieves to every possible govt job. Fucking firing inspectors general. Pardoning your fucking pals. That's fucking radical.
Biden is a lying Idiot. You are correct that he advised Obama not to take out Bin Laden. Just worthless, doesn‚Äôt he know it‚Äôs all on record?
I‚Äôm so dead that ppl think we are hating Biden Harris just to hate!! It‚Äôs not too much to ask to want a candidate who‚Äôs a genuinely good person who doesn‚Äôt have a history of creating or upholding racist policies to target the communities they swear to protect! I‚Äôll still vote tho
When my dog gets his ballot that Trump says he'll get...he's fucking voting for Biden üêæ #Dogs4Biden
You are smart enough to see the choices before you this November. DJT isn‚Äôt a choir boy, never has been, never will be, but when you see what Biden and the Democrats are proposing to do to this country your choice is an easy one to make.
My dog's fucking voting for Biden
The power has been out in Joe Biden‚Äôs mind for a long time. Let‚Äôs draw him out of the basement and see how he does.
The fix for a rigged election is already in motion. I bet they are planning on Biden stepping aside as his fitness for office is questioned. With DNC chairman pushing that she is ready to govern on day 1, something is up. Today was awkward
If you think Democrats like Biden and Harris are socialists starting a class war, just wait another 4 or 8 years, and you'll have the real thing. A real progressive tax structure will provide for this country's future.
She is ready on day one because Biden is unfit and mentally impaired, and the party will ask him to step aside? #MAGA
His brain must‚Äôve caught what Biden‚Äôs brain has. WTF???
Trump just said Antifa was virtually a part of the Biden campaign.
Levin: Kamala Harris is SUICIDE for Democrats and Joe Biden  via
Me too...it was unexpected and Biden was on it...RIGHT!!
Biden could have chosen Condoleeza Rice and the GOP would still be like...THE MOST SOCIALIST LEFIST EXTREMIST TICKET EVER.
Harris wants to step over Biden‚Äôs dead body to rule America with her iron BLM Bolshevik fist. She‚Äôll defund the police, take your guns, and let the peaceful Bolsheviks deliver historical justice. She won‚Äôt offer protection. She‚Äôll enjoy the carnage.
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for me,‚Äù Joe Biden said. ‚ÄúBlack Americans have no diversity.‚Äù
The confederate Dems have sided with the BLM Bolsheviks. They want to defund the police and burn America down, one community at a time. Trump is the Lincoln of our time. Biden looks like crap, Jeff Davis.
1/3  I wrote this bit on subjective freedom and late modernity, before Harris was picked as Biden's VP.
Harris is a witch that few would want to live under. Biden is in his last hour of life. Harris could become the next Xi or the next Hitler. It all depends how her Socialist party might devolve.
Out of all the great choices we had at the beginning of the primary race, I can‚Äôt believe we ended up with a Biden/Harris ticket. Casting my ballot is going to make my jaw hurt.
LIVE VIDEO: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together in Delaware
I‚Äôm really going to be clenching my teeth when I fill in that bubble next to Biden and Harris.
Has anyone else found the pro-Loeffler ads targeting Collins to be a bit... WEIRD? Collins is about as conservative as you get and it seems the pro-Loeffler folks are targeting people who don't know that. I dunno. It's like the same as trying to get socialism to stick to Biden.
That‚Äôs a strong selling point for Biden
Trump was nominated by the GOP which bent over backwards to gift him the nomination despite his lack of anything close to majority support from the party voters. He‚Äôs done nothing but continue the substantive policies Obama-Biden gave us.
What does a single vote for Biden change? How do you expect us to ever abolish the 2-party system (that is not actually a thing, and exists entirely a result of our unwillingness to use our voices to challenge it) if we continue to support it with the little power we wield.
Trump exists so that we will run into the arms of fascists like Kamala Harris. Everything Trump has done is the logical extension of the policies that Biden helped implement as VP. If we allow ourselves to vote out of fear, we‚Äôve already lost.
I‚Äôm not a huge fan, and probably won‚Äôt be voting at all, but she‚Äôs a far better candidate than Biden, Harris, Trump, or Pence, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about her failings because she won‚Äôt be elected. I have no faith in the LP, but we need to build momentum for change.
She never backstabbed him either? She didn't owe anyone an endorsement. She saw the writing on the wall before y'all and decided she could do more good advising Biden than in helping a sinking Bernie campaign.
Y'all are bad at politics. Bernie didn't lose because of Warren, but because the centrist candidates came together around Biden. Either Warren was never going to win so she should have dropped out, or her endorsement was important enough to help Bernie win. You can't have both.
To be fair, the hill isn‚Äôt much steeper than the one they climbed four years ago. But we all misjudge reality - like thinking this is a contest without a predestined outcome, or that there‚Äôs a difference between the people who gave us Trump and Biden.
So you‚Äôre suggesting that my vote for Biden can change things, but my vote for  or my decision to stay home can‚Äôt? Because that‚Äôs some serious sophistry for someone throwing around ‚Äúself-serving rationalizations for doing nothing‚Äù at others.
It‚Äôs not nonsense, it‚Äôs the way the system works, man. You can argue that libertarians shouldn‚Äôt actively campaign against Biden/for Trump, and I‚Äôd agree, but you can‚Äôt act like you support liberty, and then use your tiny voice to cast in with the lot and support the status quo.
Or maybe you recognize that Biden served in one of the worst administrations in the history of the world re: immigration and foreign policy, and you realize your lone vote has no impact beyond its value as a signal to others, and you don‚Äôt want to signal support for imperialists.
I agree with you in general but I did the same thing in 2016 and voted for Hillary. Four years later and I'd rather vote my conscious. I still might vote Biden but as of now I plan to write in Bernie. I really doubt Biden wins Georgia anyways, although it may be more competitive.
i know this isn‚Äôt the first time i‚Äôve said it, but i‚Äôd KILL for Biden to be the super scary radical leftist that Fox keeps trying to scare its viewers into believing he is. the dude said he‚Äôd veto Medicare for All. on god what the fuck do you think a leftist is
gotta say. it‚Äôll never not be amusing how hard Fox and Trump and all them keep trying to push that Biden is ‚Äúembracing the radical left‚Äù and that picking Kamala means he‚Äôs ‚Äúdropping the label of moderate‚Äù. bruh. he‚Äôs a centrist whose VP nom is a cop. fuck you mean?
I don‚Äôt think biden can convince anyone who‚Äôs red that he‚Äôs not a socialist through soundbites and messaging. He‚Äôs just gotta hope to drive up turnout and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs particularly good at that comparatively
I‚Äôm tired of the Trump bashing... is he the most experienced, qualified or educated president we‚Äôve ever had? Not even close. Is he a better option over Joe Biden.... yes. This is a pb&amp;j vs steak and mays conversation.
Y‚Äôall screaming ‚Äúvote blue no matter who‚Äù and saying that there are no better options than Biden and Harris are so pathetic to me. You would sacrifice your agency, ideals, and honor to a pack of old politicians because you can‚Äôt think of anything better? Disgusting
Good luck with second term trump! I'm sure that will be much better for you than Biden and the lady that voted with Bernie 95% of the time.
What I want to know is how many 2016 Trump voters or 2016 abstainers are voting Biden this time?  Otherwise you‚Äôre not a data point that gives any indication of how 2020 will be different from 2016.
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate

Can someone tell me why I should still vote for Biden after seeing this ad
You really think Biden will even make it to inauguration?
Important difference: that was Clinton‚Äôs chance on Election Day, while it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs chance today. If the election were held today, Biden would have a 93% chance
I‚Äôll translate Bill speak:  Biden is senile and can‚Äôt complete a sentence.  Trump will trounce him.  Let‚Äôs not have that happen
As for nothing tying Trump to Russia, don‚Äôt be ridiculous. He‚Äôs literally had business dealings and private meetings and private phone lines set up with them. There‚Äôs as many ties there as Biden has to China, so at BEST it‚Äôs a wash üôÉ
Hahaha what are you even talking about?   Are you saying private meetings shouldn‚Äôt exist by government leadership? Or it‚Äôs okay if there‚Äôs no wrongdoing found? If the former, Trump is in the wrong. If the latter, then you can‚Äôt blame Biden as no wrongdoing has been found.
A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote for damning yourself to Pete Buttigieg on television for the rest of your life.
I have never been less enthused about the options on offer. But I of course will be voting Biden/Harris regardless, because that shit matters for people's actual lives.   And we cannot survive another four years of 45.
The irony of someone saying we‚Äôll be lockdown forever under Biden when Trump hasn‚Äôt handled this pandemic in the six months he‚Äôs had to do so üôÉüôÉüôÉ
Nate still peddling his snake oil. "We predict that Clinton/Biden will win"*  * But if Trump wins, we are still the least wrong, which means we are really right too.
Saw . on TV. He‚Äôs totally SHOT, looks terrible, exhausted, fat, and weak. If there was ever a good reason to vote Biden/Harris 2020 it‚Äôs him. Check out this jerk. He never had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action! #TrumpIsLosing it.
Clinton had a 71% chance on Election Day. Biden has a 71% chance 3 months out. If the election were today, the model would give Biden a 93% chance

JOE BIDEN JUST GOT TRUMP REELECTED WITH KAMALA HARRIS PICK  via

Biden looks like crap. He‚Äôs in his last hour. He can barely make it through a five minute interview without a racist comment.
So-called ‚Äúpartial birth abortions‚Äù have not been legal since 2003, and Biden has never been a cheerleader for them.   Keep trying,
Interesting choice on Biden‚Äôs part. Seems as though he didn‚Äôt consider this well. As much as I like Harris, this pick will not get him the votes he is looking for. Moderates don‚Äôt like her for Green New Deal &amp; Bernie‚Äôs Boys don‚Äôt because Biden is too centrist.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket  via
Ah‚ÄîJust was reminded: Biden never SAID he doesn‚Äôt hold grudges with respect to Harris. That quote came from notes he had at a press conference in anticipation of a question never asked. The notes were captured on camera...
It will happen like this. October 10th, Biden will wake up not knowing where he is. He‚Äôll stumble and fall. They‚Äôll rush him to the hospital under Code Stroke protocol. His neurologist will diagnose as severe dementia. We‚Äôll never hear from Biden again.
Behold: As the King of Madness &amp; Queen of Duplicity insouciance subdues and atrophies minds of the feeble. A splendid show of contrition without any requisite of remorse. So let‚Äôs rejoice in this anachronistic matrimony and welcome Biden‚Äôs new Cajoling Consortium of Thaumaturges.
Calling kamala and biden socialists is like the final proof that American education does not teach political science
I‚Äôm only voting for Biden cuz Taylor told me to

‚ÄúCan Joe Biden sabotage this election? Find out tonight at 11‚Äù
Trump attacking Kamala is a joke...if the only thing he can say..is that she was nasty to Biden in the primary..well, he ain't got fucking shit about fuck
Sounds like you didn‚Äôt get the memo. Biden had new hair implants during the lockdown. They transplanted his curly leg hair. It took over a hundred hours to cover his bald head.
Poor Biden and the hate-based Dems. They can‚Äôt see what America‚Äôs children can see. Biden is an old man whose best days are over. He‚Äôs living his last days.
Biden wears depends. But remember incontinence is not an early sign of dementia. It‚Äôs a late sign.
Biden sounds damn bad, like crap. ‚ÄúBlack Americans lack diversity.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn if they don‚Äôt vote for me. They ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù
I need someone to tell me why it's going to be easier to organize under Biden/Harris, rather than Trump/Pence.
This makes no sense at all.  Obama chose a very unthreatening Joe Biden as VP.  Haig had already shown us that Sec of State is not ‚Äúin charge.‚Äù   SOS is a great job but not the #2 job.
Biden looks like crap and sounds like crap. There is no makeup that will cover his Dementia. Joe will never pass the Montreal Cognitive Test. He‚Äôs got to take the test. Remembering 5 things will be impossible. Go Trump! The best empirical mind of our time.
Biden looks like crap. He‚Äôs living his last hour.
They‚Äôll do the opposite. Biden is on record saying the 94 crime bill didn‚Äôt go far enough to lock people up and saying busting out of district kids would ‚Äúturn our schools into a racial jungle‚Äù Pair that with her record in Oakland incarcerating black people. That‚Äôs what they push
To be clear I do not like Biden or Kamala and this ticket IS trash but expecting Bernie to come out and bash it, risking dividing the left and further jeopardizing the chances of voting Trump out, is moronic
Really? Who was the Catholic during the Obama-Biden years?
Lol I‚Äôm sorry what did y‚Äôall want the man to tweet? "Biden sucks ACAB" like??? He‚Äôs a politician who votes left why would he sabotage the left‚Äôs only chance at getting trump out by tweeting anything other than support????
Because it's Biden.
In the last four days, I've seen more "elections don't matter"-style posts on my social media feed than I have in the last 8 years.  They all come from people trying to get folks to vote for Biden.
ok i know i said i wouldn‚Äôt participate in the discourse but i think it goes without saying that i didn‚Äôt need to see big tiddie Biden today üòî
Okay so if you‚Äôre a liberal going by your weird screech logic this means you can‚Äôt vote for Biden
That right there reminds us even more why we don't need to vote for Biden-Harris. Looking forward to watching brainless, clueless celebrities melt down with the other snowflakes after their pedophile presidental favorite and useless vice presidential favorite lose. #Trump2020.
I am a little bit curious about what the "defund the police" black feminists are going to do with the "Yaaassss Queen" black feminists over a Biden/Harris ticket.
Trump will only spew lies about Biden/Harris. Ignore it and focus on fighting voter suppression in your city/county/state. That is the real threat we're up against.
Rice will become the greatest political criminal in American history. By not choosing Rice, Biden gave the greenlight to scapegoat Rice for Obamagate. The question. Is Rice smart enough to save herself?  Durham‚Äôs door is open.
I agree with Mimi! Happy and with emotions that I had not quite anticipated! Biden/Harris
A Biden/Harris ticket gives us 4 more years of Trump I‚Äôm afraid. The Democrats can‚Äôt pretend to be for progressive policies with these two. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to appeal to moderate Republicans who don‚Äôt like Trump. Being anti-Trump isn‚Äôt enough. It wasn‚Äôt in 2016.
I don‚Äôt like anything about our current political system. I hate the Biden is a rapist. I hate that Harris was a prosecutor. But unless you have another way to start digging us out of the mire, then I don‚Äôt really want to hear it.
Stacey Abrams says she‚Äôs really Joe Biden‚Äôs pick for VP.
I‚Äôm pissed too, but y‚Äôall niggas still better vote Biden/Harris.
And if you‚Äôll justify Harris, is there anyone Biden could‚Äôve picked that you wouldn‚Äôt still vote for him?
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt pick shit. The dnc appointed their real candidate.
And if we being real.... Biden is older so... please tell me you know where I‚Äôm going with this so I don‚Äôt have to say it
If that‚Äôs the alternative, I‚Äôll take it over what Biden/Harris will bring for the next 12-16 years, possibly the next 2 with full control of Congress. (I‚Äôm not suggesting anyone vote for ‚Äúthe alternative‚Äù when there are actually multiple alternatives both on and off the ballot.)
Joe Biden really picked the worst VP there is lol get ready for 4 more years of trump

Biden/Harris 2020. Anyone but COVID N Chief Trump.
What is the alternative to voting Biden/Harris without being complicit in policies I disagree with?   I recognize this tweet isn‚Äôt speaking to me, but I like to think I consider other people/demographics and their livelihoods before I vote.
Yes. Vote Biden/Harris. We've learned that neoliberalism is better than fascism.
It matters to Black Americans who lack diversity according to Biden. It matters to the Monolith.
K-Harris has a problem. No one likes her. Biden has a problem. Harris knows he‚Äôs a demented old white guy who‚Äôs a racist at heart. Harris is no Obama. She‚Äôs the wicked witch of the West.
We need the Dems to have to negotiate with the left side of the party, rather than with the GOP. We need more AOCs. Leverage. Shift the negotiation table. Run left candidates in safe blue districts. If you don't like Biden/Harris, then pick a senate race to sponsor.
Perfect pick to neutralize the claim that Biden wants to defund the police. Since, ya know, Kamala is a cop. üôÑ
Cannot think of a worse female running mate Biden could‚Äôve chosen

Two-faced Harris agrees to wet nurse Biden‚Äôs second infancy. But she will not give up her Senate seat. Sounds like she knows what‚Äôs coming.

Good choice   will be an awesome running mate!
With #KamalaHarris now #Biden‚Äôs VP, lets hope she will honor her campaign commitment to #MedicareForAll and push Biden to give all Americans equal access to health care.  With millions losing jobs and what health insurance they had, Medicare For All is more crucial than ever.

Obama and Biden know what they did. Rice knows too. Their anxiety and hot water are related to how much power they have to control data that might expose them. Rice is their greatest liability. They have to keep her close.
I don't know what state you are in but if it's close, his vote can make a difference. I'm in Georgia. It's considered a toss up. If Biden wins the popular vote by 100, then he gets all 16 of our electoral votes. Tell him to please vote... for my transgender son's future.‚ù§

Best case for VP is Warren. She's progressive, has great policy chops, and we can organize around pushing both her and Biden to the left. More likely we'll get someone more moderate, like a Harris, in which case we'll still need to organize. The question is just who at.

Supporting Biden over Trump in the general election is understandable.   Supporting Biden in the primary was terrible.
I understand her argument but she didn‚Äôt explain how Biden and Harris will he forced left. She just said it will happen because more progressives are in congress and people will be calling for those policies. AOC/Ilhan don‚Äôt call out corrupt Democrats.
And we all remember how Lloyd Bensten EVISCERATED Dan Quayle in that debate and swept the Dems to resounding defeat. Biden's good debate against Ryan was a blip, probably didn't change a vote.
If only we had some in this administration.  Biden/Harris 2020
Generally, a Presidential candidate will select a VP to grab a voting block that may be the missing piece (Pence for the evangelical group). That made sense.  With Harris, she doesn't grab any additional votes for Biden. He already had minorities and the left.  It's perplexing.
2/2 While I agree with their messaging, the fact that this group of Republicans has become the loudest voice in the Anti-Trump movement, and if Biden wins the election, will become the voice of the DNC, should scare people.
There are so many amazing reasons why progressives and those that are educated about the justice system are disappointed w Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala and I was super quick to feel frustration with expression of that anger
I know you're probably sick of replies to this, but...  Since march, things here have accelerated to a degree that we're honestly worried that biden isn't up to the task. A biden win that doesnt enact major change has the potential to be more disastrous than 4 more years of trump

Please for the love of God, the Biden-Harris ticket cannot win in Nov.
Especially Joe Biden
I think they have decided that Trump has already lost so want to belabor Biden with the worst economy possible to help them come back.
Joe Biden is going have to reverse this. The USPS is falling apart. We just need to show up and vote.
Has him doing the whole "Riddin' with Bidden" thing been too much? I watch most of his streams and he's been pretty clear about not liking either Biden or Harris and is just putting up with them because they're our only options at the moment and for the jokes.
Reread those tweets again.  The first tweet for example. A lot of 30+ Twitter who are Biden supporters, do lie and act like the Crime Bill was some necessary evil bc crime was so bad.
His 30% is more enthusiastic than last time. The other 20% is not at all but may still vote for him anyway because Biden is a trainwreck.

I really want to support Biden, but these Biden Bros are just too toxic

Biden and Harris have to jump on this fast furious and also Obama and Michelle all hands on deck!
It's sad the things he is willing to do to stay in power! Election tampering, not trying to slow/stop a deadly virus, getting rid of the USPS, Always blaming President Obama, Joe Biden is old and Kamala Harris isn't born here, voter suppression! Oh, I forgot.. inject lysol SMH
All Biden cares about is pudding after supper.
I would literally be willing to die to cast my vote for Biden &amp; Harris in this election. We have to save the United States of America.

"Nothing Would Fundamentally Change" -Joe Biden, 2020
Joe Biden or John Lewis are better examples. Look at their districts. After 30 years in Congress nothing changed.
Cherish the moment.  The American people have never needed anyone more than you and Joe Biden.
This article clearly states that Democrats, Clinton and Biden, sold this bill as a cure to crime. I've read it several times before.  The author is wrong on some things as he clearly doesn't have the complete background though. Joe Biden had written two crime bills in the 80s.
I hope hope hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris end this stupid Twitter ranting by the highest office in the country.
Whether you like Biden or not like.....if Trump will do that why wouldn‚Äôt he do a third term
anybody who votes for biden is on drugs
She‚Äôs doing a really basic break down of the difference between a trump and Biden administration
Warren is speaking to progressive who wanted to big, bold, structural change and Joe Biden didn‚Äôt necessarily embrace.
Who's fucking surprised??? One of the FIRST things Biden-Harris needs to do, during Week 1 latest, is completely dismantle ICE and Border Patrol and, soon enough (with Congressional help), completely dissolve HHS.
So Trump, who demeans all those he doesn't care for w/ an insulting name calls Harris nasty" because she criticized Biden?  She didn't call Biden "Sleepy". Didn't say he's low cognitive.  Just criticized a policy.  But *she* treated him "nasty".  Yup. Old White-man privilege.
Get your facts straight. Trump sent in an absentee ballot which is completely different than a mail in ballot.  Absentee ballots are signature verified-mail in ballots are NOT. DONT LIE BIDEN
Biden already has a bartender.
He's Co-signing the Biden/Kamala ticket smh.
Deane Bonner has been recovering from an attack of vertigo over the last couple of weeks. When the former head of the Cobb NAACP heard the news that Joe Biden¬†asked Kamala Harris to be his running mate, she felt a jolt.
Vote for Biden. Be a hero.
And Democrats are the one‚Äôs who are working to legalize weed. Republicans still want to criminalize it. I agree that both have a problematic past, a major difference is the progressive liberal influence that can pull Biden to the left. Trump is completely regressive.

This is the problem.  It's why they cannot see what a repulsive ghoul Joe Biden actually is, or admit that he build the system Trump is just exploiting...
It‚Äôs like they think no one but Trump is ever accused.  I‚Äôve see countless photos of Biden in his weirdo fetish‚Äôs.  I keep asking for the proof on Trump.
I am not a Democrat so I have no issue with criticizing them, but to sit here and act like they is some moral equivalence between the two is nonsense. Yes Biden is the status quo, but Trump is regressive.

This is yet another insult...  You're insulting me because you think I can only disagree with you if I'm stupid or ignorant.  I'm neither.  I researched Joe Biden 18 months ago.
Are you?  Because, on every issue, Biden's the reason we have Trump.  That makes him worse.  You picked the first three.  My turn.  Biden on war.
My name for someone who deflects all the way to Biden when discussion was about Trump calling Kamala Harris "nasty".  Verbal tricks to avoid comparing Trump's behaviors to Harris.   So yeah, focus Trixie.   Asked how's Trump not nasty, saying "Biden" doesn't address the question.

Trump is openly trying to interfere with voting by mail, going so far as to speed up crippling the USPS. Everyone should have a problem with that. It's not just Democrats that will be affected. What has Biden done to try to interfere with voting?

You said on your podcast that if the current polling avg are the same on the eve of the election, your forecast would have a 90% chance Biden wins, exactly what the Economist is saying. Could this one fact that they are projecting based on the polls staying the same explain this?
Biden ain't doing that.  He spent 40 years creating it.  Trump has only been in DC for 3.5 years and is an imbecile.   This is what Joe built.

Progressives would have more sway and opportunity to pressure a Biden/Harris administration on reform. This shouldn't be hard to understand and yet we are. It's like they don't get that the parties are different bc they have different constituencies.

I think you know what Trump will do with another term and I don‚Äôt think democracy will survive it. ‚ÄúNot crazy about Biden‚Äù is no an objection compared to the former result. Biden or risk our democracy. I think you‚Äôll find the choice is clear
I‚Äôm a DEM and I love The Lord and do no want him removed from my daily American way of life.  I will voting for Biden and Harris.  Love ‚ù§Ô∏è you
She's the perfect compliment to lock em up Joe Biden. She actually enforced the wicked 94 Crime Bill that Joe takes credit for writing.  Kamala thought it would be a good idea (and funny)‚Ä¶

Got y‚Äôall! Have a great weekend fellow #Resistance Warriors!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #November3rd!
Listen, we gotta vote for her and Biden to get Trump out but yeah bro this is NOT it. And this is a video from 10 years ago. Some stances are inherently evil. I pray she pushes for more positive legislature during her tenure.
Joe Biden is the only Presidential candidate who supported the Iraq war, and you want me to believe he's progressive?  I'm not stupid.
Let's face it. Biden is not as unliked as Clinton was and why 2020 is looking a bit different.
Damn these biden voters!
I mailed a letter from Atlanta to Boston via USPS over 3 weeks ago, and it still hasn't arrived. This is the same kind of incompetence that will control your healthcare if Democrats get elected. #SaveTheUSPS #USPS2020VOTE #Biden #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
The tax hike we will endure with the Biden administration is staggering. Do we really need this?
Can the Biden/Harris criticism wait until after they win?
People in their zeal to defend Biden refused to read or think critically. They simply read one tweet or one sentence and responded. That's their fault.
Yes, because Biden's treatment of Anita Hill (Thomas's rape victim) (read: victim blaming) did SO much to rally opposition to Clarence Thomas.
The mayor has apologized for the comments
isn't actually worried about illegal voting, he's worried about more people voting. The more people vote the bigger the landslide is for Biden
Trump vs Biden Taxes; Important to share and understand  this before #Election2020 #November3rd
I wasn‚Äôt a Bernie supporter. I was a supporter of Bernie‚Äòs policy agenda.  In the exact same way that Bernie was a vessel for that agenda, Biden is a vessel for the corporate agenda.  People are going to have to rise up and fight back against his agenda. Policy, not politicians.
Let's all remember that Biden has not started talking yet..It can get to 3-4 points quick!
So, you take biden or trump?
This bill is why I will never vote Biden and because of the bill Harris was able to be so effective in her job  I can‚Äôt elect them they are too dangerous with no evidence of change
I think if you truly don‚Äôt want Trump destroying the nation for the next four years the only option is a vote for Biden-
You're voting for Biden.  Your vote is an endorsement of his agenda.  It's why you've been passively-aggressively vote shaming.  Shame on you.
I see more slander for Biden and Harris than for Trump and I‚Äôm just like ..... y‚Äôall know what counterproductive means right?????????

I ain‚Äôt gonna lie, this ish is üî•. Trying to get on some Zetas for Biden/Harris merch.
There's a stretch of road in a very liberal area that I've driven thru that has more Bernie signs still up than Biden signs
I‚Äôm just blown away in ‚Äúthe best country in the world‚Äù our options are Biden or Trump. Straight up baffled. I literally have 4-5 more capable, better leaders in my iPhone.
You wanna tell that to the little girls Biden has groped?
talks a BIG game when it comes to the #WuhanVirus BUT keep in mind that the Strategic National Stockpile was depleted &amp; never replenished under the Obama/Biden admin. It took a real world pandemic &amp; a REAL WORLD LEADER to build that back up üëâüèº  üá∫üá∏
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake
Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich expected to speak at Democratic National Convention for Joe Biden, AP source says  via
A Biden/Harris/Clinton administration would be like a Deep State Disneyland, a dream come true for Soros and other International Elites and a nightmare for America. Agree?
I promise this isn't political, just logical.  Joe Biden says he's going to mandate masks for 3 months once elected. So hypothetically, he wins on Nov. 3rd and is inaugurated Jan. 20th. If he mandates masks, we will be wearing them Feb, March &amp; April 2021?  Uhhhh, that helps how?
Also I have no respect for Biden‚Äôs running mate. She‚Äôs out hundreds of children in foster care for TRUANCY and laughed about it üôÑ
Niggas talk about holding Biden accountable like they finna send him strongly worded text message
Biden hope this helps!  This is how you pronounce Kamala!  ‚ÄúCOMMIE-la‚ÄùüòÖ
I‚Äôm not even talking about the Tankie shit. I‚Äôm more so referring to him calling out people who criticize Biden and Kamala.
So, why should I discuss something that's not there? As I said, and as Biden has said, her extensive record is as DA and AG, so why discussing her only record is off-limits?
His policy of stemming the tide of immigration, support of the second amendment, and ending Row vs. Wade is a direct benefit to the Black community. Now, do you support Joe Biden?
Biden TAX Proposal vs. Trump (Current Taxes) The #Election2020 will be about TAXES, not COVID
The honest truth about Kamala Harris is this:  She completes Biden!  She is as phony, vacuous, empty, shallow, hollow, and mindless as him!  A perfect pair...of NOTHING.
Tell them they're have even more regret it if they don't vote for Biden.
Okay... I know where this going so I'm just gonna say this: this statement operates under the assumption that Biden will choose a SCOTUS judge more "liberal" than BK, right? Well, history suggests that this isn't the case, seeing as Joe Biden indirectly caused Clarence Thomas's
they are going to sacrifice biden with 'covid' and blame Trump.
Wait liberals are seriously blaming Ralph Nader for Bush and the Iraq war? Y‚Äôall do realize that Joe Biden was one of the biggest supporters of that war right?
I could give a fuck about Biden.  Did you know Trump owns Ghislane Maxwell‚Äôs father‚Äôs Yacht.  He barely knew her. lol.
I dont see any way Trump can win the election - do you? 1) No Trump stadium rallies - due to covid19 2) No clear direction for country at moment 3) No live Pres debates where they are on the same stage (i.e. Zoom debate- Biden/Trump remote loc) 4) many jobs lost not coming back
why you so scared of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that you would shut down the post office to try and win.  All that shows is why you shouldn‚Äôt be president, you‚Äôre to scared.  We need some adults in the White  House.
Who is the designated arranger of marches?  I think one needs to be planned for Jan. 21, 2021, to either celebrate Biden‚Äôs inauguration or to ensure it.
Plan on being in DC on January 21, 2021, either to celebrate Biden‚Äôs inauguration or to take back the White House.
It‚Äôs evil that Biden and Harris are lying about Social Security. Trump wants to cut the taxes for 4 months, not defund it. They are twisting his words. They are liars and just want votes for power and control. They are evil and they cannot be elected.
He didn‚Äôt endorse anyone until after only Biden remained in the race. Does that change your comment?
Biden would need to win Georgia by at least mid single digits in order for Dems to win the GA House. That's not too unrealistic, but it's not gonna be easy.
It's on point Biden talks like that.
Thousands of fake IDs recovered coming into the country, now Biden wants masks. Maybe the left is preparing for multiple voting with masks and fake IDs.
Put the Biden 2020 flags on my car today...got two thumbs up at the grocery store and one guy flipped me off on the highway...let the games begin.
I mean if Trump wants to go to the mat over college record that's a conversation I'd bet Biden is more than happy to have...
We're waiting for Joe Biden to get in. Then we'll apply pressure. Surely we'll get him to capitulate.
Why are you afraid to take questions? Do you not think the people deserve to hear from you, not just prepared statements?    when will you call out Biden and Harris for not taking real questions from the media? Stop protecting them.
Biden warn of 'gun apocalypse' under Biden.

Remember when  jumped on twitter a few weeks ago and pretended to be offended by Biden‚Äôs comments tho? Yea he‚Äôs a weak pos too!
It really is so hilarious to me that liberals think they can just push Biden and Harris to the left.  They actually think Biden/Harris actually represent them or give a damn about their opinionsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
In 2016 Dems vote shamed &amp; openly bragged about Hillary's substantial lead. We all know how that ended. Y'all Biden/Harris supporters better humble yourselves, get your asses off of Twitter &amp; actually work this election cycle. Having Khive next to your name changes nothing.
I wonder if Biden ever has moments when he's lucid enough to realizes he's just a puppet?
Centers for disease control is responsible for so much more.  I am sure they had people on the team and were part of the design for pandemic response.   killed the team, and buried the plan.  Because he thought it was superfluous or because Obama/Biden created it.
Another damn biden voter causing problems.
What do Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, and Facebook all have in common?  OWNED by CHINA!!
You go President Biden!
Y‚Äôall really finna go out there and vote for Biden....
I will like Biden to win but if people like you help elect Trump then it‚Äôs just something we will have to live with. Regardless of what happens there‚Äôs no president Sanders so you can save any tweets you wish, you‚Äôll be crying more than anyone else in November
Lol. As per Bernie bros there‚Äôs no difference between Trump and Biden so no matter who wins you are gonna be crying for decades to come! So it‚Äôs gonna age just fine!
You have ZERO intentions to ever stop lying.  It's disgusting.  If Biden is such a non-threat why are you doing all you can to cheat in this election.  I sure hope America can now see how much of a conman you are!  A loser!  And a lying dangerous and completely unqualified mess!

I guess you are refering to President Elec....Joe Biden........nothing but lies.
I'm sure if Biden wins and Trump refuses to step down. Liberals will just blame the following   #JillStein, Russia, black people, and "Bernie Bros". Instead, getting into the streets and burning it down. Not for Biden, but for the people.
Absolute monsters. Wisconsin is lucky they're polling for Biden right now or I'd invade.
then we can‚Äôt vote trump or biden
America, this is Sleepy Biden‚Äôs selection for vise president!  She whored her way to Sacramento government with mayor Brown! Question, do you want her as your next president????? She will destroy this great nation anyway she can!!!!
Webb trailing in his own internal is not a promising sign. But Biden improving on Clinton is a trend that we're gonna see in a lot of places.
Biden wasn't my first choice, that is for sure, but he has increasingly leaned into the progressive side of the party through the campaign. I don't know which one will steer the ship, but at least it will be fucking somebody unlike the sinking ship we are currently on!

Biden back to double digit leads in many of these polls and I don‚Äôt forsee it getting worse for him post-convention.  Trump has doubled down on authoritarian desparation instead of pivoting and everyone around him knows its clearly a bad sign.
Go back to sleep. We‚Äôll wake you when Durham is finished and ready to expose the ‚Äúgrand anti-Trump conspiracy at the FBI‚Äù as well as Obama/Biden‚Äôs part in it.  Of course, those of us who can read know this to be true already from source material while lefties keep going...
Unfortunately it seems to work.  Biden and Harris are both left-center, but calling them far left seems to rouse people.  Calling them the most ‚Äúpro-abortion‚Äù ticket in history does, too - even if it is a complete lie.
When I see that Biden/Harris meme with them as Mom and Dad all I can think is, "Based on the leather events I've been to, Kamala looks much more like a Daddy than Biden ever has."

IF you vote for Biden/Harris, picture Portland &amp; Seattle, year-round, EVERYWHERE in America.... with NO police and plenty of MS13 thrown in for good measure..
Reading Biden‚Äôs political positions, and not only are they all clown-like hypocrisies. His ideologies have failed numerous times throughout that world. Plus he a pedophile, a liar, and a cop. If we can just take the senate and retain the house. We win. Nominate someone else 2024.
No i will shame them because not voting is a vote for trump. biden sucks but we can‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs not a step up from trump. we don‚Äôt have a choice and have to do what we can with what we have. not voting is selfish
Millennials I know a lot of y‚Äôall wanted Bernie, but we need y‚Äôall to unite with us &amp; vote Biden/Harris!
Biden and Heels up Harris have not said one word against the riots and massive destruction.  And of course our corrupt media won't ask.  Despicable.
biden voter strikes again.
So moving past the "anyone but Trump" that placed the highest job app in the land in Biden's lap for no reason at all, and got us cheerleading Kamala today when, in the ghost of primaries past, we were enthusiastically cheerleading her exit from the race, WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?
Vote for Biden. To do otherwise is the end of our democracy!
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris - CNNPolitics #factsfirst
Anyone want to have a mature discussion about how only 4 more years of trump MIGHT not be as destructive to our country as 8 years of Biden?   No?, I didn‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm here if you do.
NO Biden's not up to any of this, and what he's suppose to do will now become Kamala Harris job &amp; Joe will just go along with her plan &amp; lay it out to the public thru is basement townhall's/campaigns as if it's "his plans".
I don't know that someone who equates Trump with Biden can make that logical journey.
Joe Biden stated he would veto Medicare for All and that nothing will fundamentally change. So what emoji for centrist Dems who put their corporate donors‚Äô interest over other people‚Äôs literal well being? üêò
Republicans are actually making an issue of Kamala Harris not being black. For the party who says race is never an issue cannot stop talking about it.  If race isn't important, shut the fuck up about it and defeat Biden and Harris on the issues. You're falling into their trap.
I‚Äôm just wondering, if President Trump plans to defund social security, why hasn‚Äôt he done it over the past 3 1/2 years? Also, what benefit would he derive from doing so? More Joe Biden and the Democrats lies.
"I'll put you back in chains " - Joe Biden
Why are people upset about what that aging bitch said? She wants the spotlight on herself.  Put a sock in it hag.
I think an easy way to see if the election is over is obviously going to be Florida, if Biden wins Florida, trump is probably gonna lose and we will know the next morning. If trump wins Florida, election count is gonna take a 2 or 3 days at least.
The most frustrating thing about this presidency (to me) is not that he‚Äôs a total jackass (which he is) but that he continues to commit offenses that would impeach literally any other president with no consequences.   I dislike Biden but we won‚Äôt survive another 4 years of Trump.
I could say the same for you. I saw/watched what you said about Obama for years, and what you tweet about Biden and other govt officials now. Trump, whether president or not, is a disgusting human being. A title or an office doesn‚Äôt change that.
One silver lining if Biden wins, I‚Äôll finally be able to talk shit about the president with my parents.
No candidate is great, but I‚Äôm 100% voting for Biden. No vote = A vote for Trump
Georgia hasn‚Äôt voted for a dem since Carter  If it‚Äôs a teeterer, Biden doesn‚Äôt need my vote, he‚Äôs already blown past 50%+1
A Biden/Trump debate would be comedy gold. The amount of memeable content would be absurd.
That sounds like a good Jacobin article, actually--explaining with straightforward analogies (e.g. to an alternate timeline where we had a clause in the Constitution requiring Presidents to be white and conspiracy theorists said Biden wasn't) why other responses miss the point.

Did #Biden answer any questions today? Yesterday? Last week? Last month? ......speaking of the the greatest hits and all.
all of the ‚Äúnever Biden‚Äù folks I know are all edgy contrarians who have been unaffected by Trump being in office. The handling of Covid alone should be enough for you even if you‚Äôve been in a coma for four years
Biden voters.
Joe Biden gave us the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, giving $150B to the mullahs in Tehran to attack Israel through terrorist proxies. Trump have us the Israeli-UAE peace agreement.
To me Biden is a blue Trump and Trump is a red Biden. So many claim we have to get "45" out of office but I contend biden policies have hurt black America much more trumps rhetoric but overall they both open racist although bidens neoliberalism is much more dangerous.
I‚Äôm tired of y‚Äôall whining about Biden and his pick of Kamala. No politician is squeaky clean including Obama, Warren or Sanders, so just stop with the bullshit! Y‚Äôall need to research these individuals running for Congress, especially the Senate.

you people have no idea how long i‚Äôve been waiting for this article. if obama‚Äôs white house was structured as a modernized camelot, biden played the role of lbj, shut out of power and derided

Do you know who I can contact in the Biden camp for Georgia GOTV efforts? I've got a band of coworkers that are ready. Any GA contact will be helpful.
Yeah if you want to be ineffective at getting people to switch you can 'draw the line' and 'hold people accountable' but it doesn't work well. People will get defensive and shut down. I'm voting Biden so we are clear.
EXACTLY - everyone bitching is getting into a frenzy over something that is easy to fix.  Clearly they r voting for Biden so why r they waiting?  Get your ballot, fill it out, put in your mailbox or drive it to the post office.  IF THAT is too much to do, your too lazy to matter.

I say on the same day Joe Biden proposed mandated masks, President Trump brokered peace between the UAE and Israel, and he also sold $1 billion worth of missiles to Hungary. You decide the importance of the actions of the two men.
Some people don‚Äôt understand the difference between a command and an analysis.  I‚Äòm not commanding anyone to vote or not vote for Biden. That‚Äôs their personal choice.  I‚Äôm giving an analysis that says this is why some are not voting for Biden. This  is how Biden can fix it.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Joe Biden about to have major problems. Can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn them. Folks do not like Kamala Harris.
civilians, and while the protests have been huge, they don‚Äôt have the kinds of numbers needed to combat that long term. I don‚Äôt think Biden, even with Harris as VP, would have done that, if only because even he would realize how bad that looks. It‚Äôs a superficial difference, but
Despite his shortcomings, Trump was a 50/50 shot before coronavirus, now, not so much. Perhaps he'll recover and win, but either way, Joe freaking Biden won't be the end of the greatest country this world has ever known. Stop that BS.
I don't like liberals running the country either, but this shit about the country ending is as tired as liberals calling all white cons bigots. It also belies the fact that if con Presidents did a good job, the citizenry wouldn't wanna elect ppl like Joe Biden &amp; Barack Obama!
It's too bad for you Obama isn't the one running against Trump. Joe Biden is. He has 8.3 million followers. 78 million less than Trump. Bahaha!
it‚Äôs very much Not True, because no one who worked on the campaign has seen any of the ‚Äúpushing Biden left‚Äù that keeps being discussed, but never actually happened
Those are fair points. Like I said, I understand if you can‚Äôt bring yourself to vote for Biden, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm looking forward to doing. I just don‚Äôt see a viable path forward for the country if Trump wins. He‚Äôs made it clear he‚Äôs willing to use federal forces on
oh I have no doubt that biden prefers kids alive.
Well I prefer the ones that will keep my freedom.  So it‚Äôs a hard no for Biden/Harris.  I don‚Äôt trust them.  AT. All.

Biden calls for Americans to be patriotic and wear masks for 3 months
Biden should be demanding Sec. of Labor issue emergency OSHA order to employers that, to protect workers from hazard, no one shall enter or remain in a US workplace without wearing a mask. If the Secretary won‚Äôt do this, the President should order him to. cc
Translation: Smart, educated people are voting for Biden. Morons, racists and zealots are voting for Trump.
Maybe people are a week behind, but Biden's lead has actually grown from +7.5 to +8.5.  I'll be interested to see the polling update!
USPS to suppress votes, Kanye West to dilute Biden's chance, using Kamala birther conspiracy and plotting with AG Barr to get some juicy fake news. He will not stop! Because he knows that jail is waiting for him, if he loses.
A sign of how Biden would govern: liberal overreach, regulating every facet of our lives and jobs.
that being said, I'd loved Castro, Abrams, and Yang to have been on the initial list to speak.  but if Abrams isn't on there (she's been campaigning with Biden), I think then it's not too surprising Castro and Yang were left off.

Biden needs the ADOS vote to win. Biden wrote the crime bills which decimated the Black Male population and led to our overagressive police state. INSTEAD OF PRESSURING BIDEN TO REPEAL THE CRIME BILLS...black liberals are shaming ADOS for being mad about it. Useless as fuck.
The difference between Biden and Trump.  Trump say he‚Äôs for America but his actions speaks volume that he‚Äôs not.  Biden say he stands with America and his actions echo with true volume!!! I‚Äôm with
President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
Where has Biden said anything about the cages? Last I checked, there was no mention on his website.

She has zero credibility.  Unfortunately, the liberals that watch don‚Äôt understand. She talks about his lies and then mentions children in cages.  Those cages were built under Obama and Biden.  The photo the lie is based was published prior to Trump announcing his run. Pathetic
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

Me seeing people on my timeline adamantly say that Biden x Kamala need our support.
I'm voting for Biden/Harris to bring sanity back.
That‚Äôs what #BLM is for though right? Speaking out for the unjustified in seek for justice. We‚Äôre pushing away a lot of tools because of our egotistical behavior. We‚Äôre doing the same with Biden. They can only help us the best way THEY can help us. Not the way we want them to.
Apparently you don't remember the first step Act that Trump signed into law that got many African-Americans out of jail, the ones Biden put there. Lowest African American unemployment rate. Trump is championing school choice. That would be great for the African American community
can you please tweet the Biden tax increase numbers?  So important. I nearly ran off the road hearing them this morning!
Vote for Biden. You're not voting for your soul mate. You're voting to save the soul of America.
Im not buying it. Biden hasn‚Äôt cited any specifics. Plus the soonest he can do anything about covid is like January 2021 maybe? He has done nothing that gives me confidence that he can do what is needed to help with covid and/or future pandemics.
I have to use ur semi catatonic to describe Biden that's priceless
Yeah Biden is the chief of all racists in this campaign. Racial jungles, 94 crime bill poor kids are just as bright as white kids. To go into a Dunkin Donuts you have to have an Indian accent. Black community is not diverse. You ain't black. I could go on but you get the picture
Vote Biden!!! Lock this idiot up!!! Drop your mail in ballots to your local city hall or voters location.  Just vote this malignant narcissistic psychopath out!! Let‚Äôs gain the strength and power of our democracy back!! We are not Russia and don‚Äôt need or want a dictator!!
I‚Äôve never been a big fan of the guy but Biden clearly had an undiagnosed learning disability. It makes his perseverance and coping skills to make it through graduate school and then get elected to the US Senate before the age of 30 all the more impressive.
Biden Expands Lead is good news, but this poll also exposes how Trump can win.  Three quarters of Trump voters intend to vote in person. Only about a third of Biden voters plan to.  You think nothing will happen to your mail-in votes? Vote in person.
Person: My mother died of Covid-19. Person: My brother was shot in the back while walking down the street. Person: My child was a victim of sex-trafficking. The President: Oh yeah? My shower head doesn‚Äôt have enough water pressure. Let‚Äôs fix my problem first. #Biden
And yes the ideology the Biden/Harris ticket represents isn‚Äôt the best BUT it‚Äôs way better than Trump/Pence. They must go.
Even if covid didn‚Äôt happen, we would still be told to suck it up and vote biden harris as the lesser of two evils.
Crazy how many people are cool with elected representatives outright refusing to do their only job. Represent the will of the people.  Somehow I‚Äòm the radical and divisive one for criticizing Biden because he doesn‚Äôt support proposals that nearly 90% of his own party does.

Yup, Biden winning doesn‚Äôt mean much if GOP hold onto the senate
1.  Biden/Harris should have a press briefing 1 hour after every Trump briefing, just replay every trump lie and counter it with facts.  2. UPS/FEDEX should create a purple envelope to carry ballots to the precinct.  A clear window reflects the address when you insert your ballot
Why were there no articles like this about Tim Kaine, Joe Biden or Al Gore when they were running for VP?
81% of people planning to vote my mail are voting for Biden. 67% of people planning to vote in person are voting for Trump. He doesn't even *try* to hide the corruption because there's no need to--nobody in Congress is doing anything about it.
that is a black pill shill.  suggesting trump and biden are anything alike in policy is beyond stupid and well into propaganda territory
You must be kidding! Majority are voting for Biden!
Congress left and try to put people in the White House who are the most likely to be pushed left. I could see Biden/Harris bowing to popular opinion on leftist issues of it makes them look good. I don‚Äôt see Trump doing that.
whataboutism.  remember when obama got a peace prize and sent 30000 more troops to the middle east the next day and dropped more bombs than any previous president since ww2 .  remember when he said we could keep our insurance.  remember when biden molested kids on STAGE ON TAPE
You will destroy the postal service to try to win the election .  You are inspiring all Biden/Harris supporters to go to the polls, stand in long lines and VOTE to GET RID OF YOU!
I'm not even sure they try and justify their views anymore, man. My mother in law told me wife the other day that there's no way Biden would be elected. My wife generally avoids politics bc they rarely agree on much. But my wife responded by pointing to the economy &amp; pandemic...
The Biden campaign is starting out with inaccurate data.
Fair compare is not Sanders to Harris,but to Biden,since hes at top of ticket that Harris is proudly serving under.  So we have racist a$$ Joe Biden as nom.  If u think Warren is gold standard of CJR, guess what,Bernie prob wldve made her VP.  So JB/KH is trash compared to BS/EW.
Don‚Äôt forget to wash those hands and keep wearing a mask when possible! We all need to do our part. Biden said, it‚Äôs not about your rights it‚Äôs about your responsibilities.

Nice to see them move GA-07 to Lean D, it makes perfect sense. Biden will most likely win the Gwinnett portion by double digits and win decrease the margin in Forsyth enough to easily win this district. Gwinnett and Forsyth have shifted way to the left this pass decade.

So you wouldn‚Äôt care about your tax dollars being used to fly a Biden flag? SURRRREEEEE. Guess what? I would be mad about that too. I know legal comprehension is clearly hard for you, but this violates Mo. Ann. Stat. ¬ß 36.157. Poor, poor Joe.
Have you ever noticed Sara throws the grenade in the room and walks away. CNBC is all about division.   You should hire the best from the supply pool. A company shouldn‚Äôt be judged based on the makeup of the BOD and/or C-Suite.  Biden was bullied into that choice.
Let‚Äôs say I became a huge Biden bro today.  Is he going to stop the wars? Is he going to treat healthcare as a right? Is he going to legalize weed and release all nonviolent drug offenders? Is he going to dismantle ICE?  No, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm fighting for. Why should I stop?

This was a VERY interesting read! Interesting point is that Stacey Abrams wasn‚Äôt listed as a top finalist, although she campaigned so hard for the gig.  **  How Joe Biden Chose Kamala Harris as VP - The New York Times
I could see DeSantis sweating if Biden wins Florida in November. Dems have an abysmal turnout problem in Florida. Also, if Biden wins, that could bode well for the opposition party that DeSantis is a part of.
I am in for honest reporting which sadly we do not have. When is Biden EVER going to have a Q&amp;A? He and Harris didn‚Äôt take one question.
If Biden wins GA in November, I will believe this.
I‚Äôm glad Biden didn‚Äôt pick Stacey Abrams because she is a President not a vice. Biden can hold court while congress gets cleaned up then.. here come President Abrams in the house. 4 more years ages a lot of old racist folks out is all I‚Äôm sayin.
I agree but also not the best agruement since the party refuse to take the issue of m4a up to a vote and Biden had promise to kill the bill
You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
Joe Biden voted numerous times to defund social security.  It‚Äôs really about the only thing he DID do in his 50 years in government.  Well, and push to keep segregation...

This makes it sound like the majority of people supporting Biden are motivated by a personal dislike of Trump, rather than a fundamental opposition to behavior and policies that have eroded Constitutional rights, undermined democracy, and killed more Americans than World War I.

Again, this race isn‚Äôt 2016 and its obvious Trump has no consistent messaging for Biden or Harris even this far out. The convention will solidify what she‚Äôs about.  I‚Äôm not worried about them. The campaign has been solid. I‚Äôm far more worried about voter suppression.
Just because Biden picked you up as a token oh, does it mean you have the Black vote locked down. You should be ashamed of yourself backing the man that helped set up black mass incarceration in this country. You should be ashamed. I will be voting for
I don't think Biden is kicking anyone's ass! LOL and Harris is like the black night in the Holy Grail without arms or legs...
Good points both parties have extremes. I‚Äôm more moderate and conservative and neither candidate has what I‚Äôm looking for. We really don‚Äôt have a great choice. But I‚Äôm still voting for Capitalism over Socialist. Biden and Harris are just to far left for me to vote for them.

Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?

I'm pro-Bernie but am voting for Biden. The issue that progressives have is that Harris may be treated as the inevitable nominee if she runs for Pres after being incumbent VP with the "how dare anyone primary her" mentality even if she is technically not the incumbent. Same as 16
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Do Biden/Harris want to abolish the police or do they want to ‚Äúmass incarcerate America‚Äù? This is such terrible messaging it‚Äôs laughable
You have Biden winning?
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Sounds like Biden also disrespected his socialist VP as per WP
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
What Republicans see = True  What Democrats see = False  it‚Äôs a Conservative meme so they truly think Trump is their Messiah but never work through their shadows in therapy so they project their faults onto others  my lefty feed contains MUCH Biden criticism but I‚Äôll vote for him

The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
Fact check... Clinton (and Biden) were the DIRECT catalyst for Mass Incarcerations.

Hillary called trump supporters deplorable. Biden said if you have a hard time deciding between me or trump then you ain‚Äôt black. Idk about the Harris quote haven‚Äôt heard it before.
How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She‚Äôs actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
So excited to support our Biden/Harris dream team!!
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!

I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
I didn‚Äôt know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.
Ronna McDaniel lies as much as Trump. Obviously they fear this Biden/Harris ticket.
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
Republicans are clearly worried about the Biden/Harris ticket. The ridiculous assertions being made by Trump &amp; Ronna McDaniel are lol pathetic.
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
God is calling on you Joe Biden to make the fabric of America right! To show people from ALL walks of life that the United States of America is a beacon for those seeking a better life! I proudly stand behind you and pray for you daily that you will have STRENGTH to GET IT DONE!
Isn‚Äôt Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
Biden's Catholic
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Btw, Fig Newton, how are Trumpy‚Äôs golf cart rides going?? Biden was out riding a bike to stay in shape while Trumpy rode around a golf course while hundreds of thousands are dying. I guess Trumpy knows ‚Äúwhale‚Äù is a shape, even though actual whales are in better shape than him.
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls

The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020
Everyone knows Biden is the beard for Harris. He‚Äôs gone in less than 12 months.
Did she not call joe Biden a racist? Ah I forgot we can just throw around that term nowadays.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.

If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Not crazy about Biden, but the fact he‚Äôs actually listening to progressives and changing his policies for them hasr thinking that he‚Äôs definitely better than Trump
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can‚Äôt determine is he is or isn‚Äôt Catholic. Plus, you‚Äôve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that‚Äôs... Sad.

She‚Äôs no joke, she just thinks Biden supports segregation, believes he sexually assaulted those women, oh and she was smoking weed in college while listening to Tupac and Snoop, despite graduating at least 6 years before either released their first album.
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You‚Äôre so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.

But when majority of voters don‚Äôt think Biden will finish a first term, it‚Äôs a play that could work.
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick üòÇ
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!

Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian

This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.

Looks like the post office is dead while these fools are still debating about a crime bill. If Donald Trump win again remember you said you couldn't vote for Biden because of a crime bill and Harris is a cop who locked up criminals but wasn't supposed to lock up black criminals.

Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for Mandate. He doesn't get it. Not every situation requires a mask. Expert review reveals social distancing and using masks when distancing not feasible, plus wash hands. The best defense for COVID19
So Biden is Right wing? How far Left are you?  As for Dems, there are 2 kinds: The corporatists (think establishment), as you mentioned, and the communists (think AOC).

The only war being lost is the Biden Campaign's floundering around looking for an issue...
Biden is a Moderate like I'm a Host at a Cheesecake Factory. (I haven't worked there in years.)
The USA will be rejoicing when VP Biden is elected President on Nov 3,2020
He is just looking for cover. He wants to hide out in the basement until the election is over.
The polls showing Biden ahead are laughable!
WoW! Hopefully they can avoid ole pervs like Chicken Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris exacerbates Biden‚Äôs existing problem with religious voters. He must work to reassure them.  there are many religions, &amp; we all don't vote b/c of our religion. I belong to an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, does that make me a "religious voter"?
Democratic Party Nominee: Joe Biden
Does it really matter, of all the vile things he‚Äôs done, it still doesn‚Äôt make one bit of diffrence. Nothing gets done, nothing will. I‚Äôll vote for Biden, hopefully he wins, and trump will write a book, and make more money, and laugh in our faces.
Why are you attacking Joe Biden. SMH
So I guess Trump is gonna win again since it‚Äôs apparently so morally corrupt to vote for Biden. Nice.
How does Biden‚Äôs policy make him equally dangerous??? Where are his ties to the KKK??? What are his conflicting billionaire-business-owner interests??? What are his connections with foreign governments??? What bigoted hateful misinformation is he promoting to our country???
Well that wasn‚Äôt part of the metaphor for a reason. By that logic you‚Äôre insinuating that a Biden presidency could potentially make everything worse than it would be if we stuck with Trump.
Because with Biden there is at least a CHANCE for something better than this!!!! If you were sick and someone offered you a pill, saying, ‚ÄúThis may make you feel better or it may do nothing at all,‚Äù are you gonna turn it down simply because it‚Äôs not a guaranteed cure???
At the very least, even if Biden ended up being the exact same as Trump, at least we tried to get something better. If we end up with Trump again we already know what we‚Äôre stuck with.
I‚Äôm confused why you‚Äôre asking me to give a specific outline of why or how Biden is different than Trump as if it isn‚Äôt completely obvious???? I obviously can‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything to you, we‚Äôd both have to wait and see.
We can only either have Biden or Trump. Choosing to have Biden rather than Trump does NOT mean that I fully support and agree with everything Biden/Harris say and do, it means I‚Äôm just choosing one over the other. But not choosing IS choosing to let others decide for you.
Again it seems like you‚Äôre insinuating that Biden is JUST as bad as Trump which doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me and if that‚Äôs really how you see it then idk what to tell you.
Joe "HITLER" Biden calls for Nationwide MASK Mandate. Fuck Him !!!! Have you forgotten Obama &amp; his Joe Biden. The Swine Flu for you dummies. They ignored it &amp; people died ????
If you really don‚Äôt see any difference between electing Biden versus TRUMP I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. True, voting is not going to fix our problems but if Trump is our president for 4 more years it‚Äôs going to be a LOT harder for us to make the radical changes we need.
Biden and Trump are the only candidates that have a possibility of winning at this point. Either your vote supports Biden or your vote (or lack there-of) is indirectly supporting Trump. Regardless of everything else, ONE of them is going to be elected and you can‚Äôt not choose.
I‚Äôm not asking for general explanations, I‚Äôm asking for the people saying they aren‚Äôt going to vote to explain why they‚Äôre ok with letting Trump win again and why that‚Äôs apparently a better option than electing Biden.
The Corporate Media have made so much money hounding Trump for 4 years. Do they want that to end? CNN will collapse. MSNBC will collapse. WaPo will lose half their readers. Will an October Surprise actually come in AGAINST Biden?
I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand. Do you really believe that electing Biden is no better than passively electing Trump for 4 more years??
I'm confused. Is  a radical leftist secretly pulling  strings to further a socialist agenda, or a moderate that's going to alienate the base and cost Biden the election? #BidenHarris
PENCE ON OFFENSE: ‚ÄúMore jobs under Trump-Pence since May than all of Oba...
Which tweet writer wrote this? Have you been close enough to the Biden for a hair sniff or a weird grab type hug?
Her best friend is Jill Biden?
Hillary &amp; Harris, only better chance, Biden will back out at convention. We‚Äôre just talking about swing states, but I think Trump Pence will still win electoral.
But when Biden did it, the Very Next day, it was just a gaffe. Just ol Joe being Joe.
What is your plan, for everyone to not vote??? Ok then what happens when Trump wins again??? You won‚Äôt elect to hurt our people but you will let Trump get elected again??? Biden would hurt our people but Trump won‚Äôt continue to??? I‚Äôm just trying to understand.
How is the Biden accusation credible but not the 25 allegations against Trump not?
Sounds like you hear only what you want to hear.  Biden listens to others. He evaluates and he's not afraid to change his mind if their ideas are better.
But Biden has a cognitive decline?  What the f is he talking about?
Universal Basic Income and Medicare for all if Biden gets elected.    Democracy dies with the DemocRATs.  Mail in voting, it's not who votes that count it's who counts the votes.  Always was, always will be.
I don't see why it can't be both. Its not like they are stopping Biden by making the world know progressives exist in the party.
Wow. You might want to read what I said again and note that I am a actively trying to help Biden and get people not to vote 3rd party. The DNC isn't making it easy. They added Yang to speak at the DNC convention so it looks like the actual goal of this tweet has been achieved.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Y‚Äôall are so sanctimonious and insufferable      ‚ÄòRescued Again By Joe Biden‚Äô: Tucker Carlson Thanks Biden For Saving Him On Kamala Harris Name Mispronunciation  via
I got cousins who has been in and out of jail since they were 14. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn't force them to go around robbing people and stealing cars. At some point we have to stop blaming other people for decisions that we made.
Sounding nervous, Donnie! Biden for the win November 3! 81 more days!
That's what happens when you buy a Biden ticket
The thought of Biden winning is beyond my imagination.  We somehow survived a President who hated America and was a radical Marxist/Communist, but Harris is far worse!
VP Biden and Sen Harris are the folks to do that. They will remind our partners in the world they are our friends and allies. They will and do embrace diversity and the amazing strength it brings to our nation. I will not sit by and ignore your hate, I will vote Blue.
You mean you can vote for Kamala Harris? Biden's days are clearly numbered. I expect a William Henry Harrison presidency from him.
Aw he appreciates yours too‚ù§Ô∏è blue MAGA and their constant harassment every time someone posts a truth that they‚Äôre willfully blind to, will be the main thing to blame if Biden loses.
‚ù§Ô∏è I can‚Äôt stand the people who think all of these problems started with Trump. That‚Äôs just when a lot of them woke up bc of the excitement that came with hating trump. They‚Äôll just go back to sleep if Biden wins and that‚Äôs worse than having Trump for 4 more years.
I‚Äôm gonna be pissed if any second of it is telling us to vote for Biden.
another Lie by Biden
I‚Äôm really in twitter jail for following dumbasses who ended up being Biden supporters in disguise. Fuck all the way offüò°
He thanks you for yours. Blue MAGA is causing Biden to lose more votes than the ones criticizing him ü•¥
It makes her Indian!!! She was a horrible choice... Lots of Black people will not vote this year because of that pick... Biden lost the electionüòÇüòÇ
So they need to stop saying she‚Äôs African American... She was a horrible choice and this will lose the election for Biden
Biden is the lesser evil but still evil.
I‚Äôm pissed just waiting 3 weeks for a book sent from within my own state. If I was waiting on meds or a check, and I wasn‚Äôt already voting for Biden, it would be enough to change my mind. #TrumpKillsUSPS
It definitely is a slap in the face. You‚Äôd rather another 4 years of a literal Anti Christ instead of just sucking it up and voting for Biden/Harris. I personally don‚Äôt like her views but as VP she won‚Äôt have that much power.
I do. Fuck Biden/Harris. I mean that in the most disrespectful way possible. Sniffer and sniff-ee
homophobic and taken America back in policy virtually faster than any president. There‚Äôs no telling how much damage can be done in another four years. Biden *also* sucks but we just gotta keep holding ppl accountable to that for the next elections (at every level) we can elect-
Bruh!  Kamala Harris is getting so much more scrutiny because she is a woman. I *DO NOT* agree with what she has done and she should be held accountable while in office by us paying attention to what she and Biden are doing. But guys... trump and pence are racist,sexist-
Biden-Harris, Osoff, Blackman, Bryant are your leaders for a real future and everyone in Georgia should vote these names on November 3rd #gapol
He clearly wasn‚Äôt talking about us, but YES! I am voting for Biden Harris.
- you gotta give up the title of ‚ÄúSlow Joe Biden‚Äù I thought of a new name for him because he‚Äôs easily manipulated so it‚Äôs gotta be ‚ÄúPlay-Doh Joe‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Do yawl really think Biden made the selection for his VP? Really? Come on now . He probably saw the selected name the first time he read his queue card script he read from whil talking with her.
Wings n things and I went big for 9.97? Biden ain‚Äôt gonna have prices like this ijs
You must be young.... I'm guessing 20s lol the she was enforcing a crime bill that the cbc help write along with Biden
Biden thinks he picked Elizabeth Warren as VP. ASK HIM WHO HE PICKED.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?  You libs would have no standards if not for double standards!
Let us not forget she made it tougher for miniorites and put a lot away just like biden did with his 1994 criminal justice bill.
The weak are starting to show their true colors. Vote for who you want, but don‚Äôt start vote shaming and telling us we HAVE to vote for Biden when you were against him two days agoüôÉ
Hating Biden bc hes a rapist pedophile has nothing to do with BernieüôÉ
What is sad is someone who is a pimp for the DNC acting like he has any morals or integrity?  Note your channel has no news of Biden's many gaffes - why? Because you are in the anal cavity of the DNC?
Stop worrying about the Dems and pack your boxes! We putting u out as soon as the counts r in! U sold your vp slot to the KKK, Biden &amp; Barris have a true work ethics behind them. History in the making #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #DumpTrump2020
Fake Flake will be irrelevant after Trump destroys the Marxist duo of Chicken Joe Biden &amp; Kamal-toad Hairasz?
And I keep seeing all these people talking about how seeing Biden/Harris renews their faith in America and makes them feel pride in their country again. Really?? Seeing 2 corrupt cops being morons makes you feel more patriotic but the riots and protests of the last several months
It‚Äôs time for the right wing, extremist, fascist reign of  to end. Vote Biden/Harris &amp; end the carnage inflicted by Trump.
Joe Biden is a sexual predatory and almost as corrupt and incompetent as Trump. We should not be excited to vote for him. Kamala Harris imprisoned thousands of Black people on non-violent marijuana charges and she keeps them in prison for as long as possible to use them as slaves
You realize Biden is only 3 years older than Trump right?
Hey y‚Äôall. I am so tired of seeing all these tweets praising Biden/Harris. Like they don‚Äôt give a shit about you. We don‚Äôt have to love the democratic nominee the same way the right does. We need to hold them accountable for their action the same way we do with the right.
This is a tactical error. Soaring rhetoric from Biden-Harris followed by Trump languidly reading statistics.
Joe Biden Selects Kamala Harris as Running Mate -
Why would the stock market crash if Biden was elected President? It didn‚Äôt crash when he was elected Vice-President.
Biden introduces VP choice Harris; much history, no crowd
I never listen to never politicians; definitely not a combo like Biden and Harris.
Biden and Harris finally shut up.
We've been starved for this. Leaders, actual leaders.
Joe Biden is Presidential.
Biden is talking to us right now. Trump reads to us lol.   Seriously, he‚Äôs looking into the crowd &amp; we feel more confident that it‚Äôs genuine.  take notes on how to address your people my friend!
This suburbanite is voting Biden/Harris 2020
HAPPENING NOW: Biden and Harris have finally stepped out, in matching blue suits too.
WHEN Biden wins.
LIVE: Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris TOGETHER for the 1st time as running mates
Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden V...
Former  US  V.P.  &amp; US   Senator   Joseph   R.  Biden   made   a   excellent  decision   to  pick  U S  Senator  Kamala  Harris (D-CA)  for  his  running  mate !#BIDENHARRIS2020
Biden is forgivening student loans. They slow as hellüò≠
Media shows its bias &amp; hypocrisy by refusing to as ‚Å¶ health related. questions
Yeah Fr it‚Äôs pretty sad Trump and Biden are our two options. But ig #SettleForBiden
Harris released a detailed plan to invest in HBCUs and black entrepreneurship. She formed a task force to combat racial and ethnic disparities in COVID. Biden says he will provide $300 mil in grants to cities that reduce discriminatory zoning regs. There‚Äôs much MUCH more too.
If any one person could give me a viable alternative to Biden/Harris I would immediately voice my support for it but the reality is that they are our ONLY option other than Trump. I hate it just as much as everyone else but that‚Äôs the reality.
Believe it or not I have the exact same feelings as you do towards the corrupt democrats, but as much as I hate it, Biden is the ONLY alternative option to Trump, no one else is going to be elected. We have to choose one or the other.
One of my biggest foreign policy questions about a Biden presidency would be whether he‚Äôd reintroduce ‚Äúthe pivot‚Äù away from China like Obama started to do at the end of his term. Foreign policy side of Twitter, let‚Äôs discuss. üëçüèº
I can't believe you fell for that LIE!!! Biden does NOT support defunding.   Do you even know what defunding means?!?
A day care center minutes before Joe Biden arrives ....
I just think we need more than 3 months to organize in support for a third-party candidate if it‚Äòs to be successful. I‚Äôm sure that will be exactly what we do as soon as this election is over and we‚Äôll have years to plan, but I‚Äôd like to be doing so under Biden rather than Trump.
You‚Äôre SO woke that you‚Äôre not voting for Biden/Harris but not woke enough to outline an alternative plan when people ask???? Ok so how about instead you just shut thE FUCK UPPPPPP!!!!
I don‚Äôt really want Biden/Harris either but until one of you geniuses can make an actual PLAN of action go viral rather than a complaint, they‚Äôre our only option other than Trump.
To say the election is over now is like saying the baseball game was over after the 1st inning.  Wait till Biden is Live and Uncensored on the debate stage.
I can't wait for Biden live and uncensored at a debate stage near you!!
Hey, all of my people (#Team43 ü§†) came out in support of Biden... and that‚Äôs a known known!   ü§£üçª
If you vote for joe biden unfollow me thanks
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
You know thats who the Dems are really putting up there...right? Biden didn‚Äôt choose her. Lol
Biden-Harris(Obama) sees this and thinks, "Hiw can we send the mullahs MORE CASH?"
Breakfast Club Reacts To Joe Biden Picking Kamala Harris As Running Mate
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick--&gt;&gt;
me: biden and harris are great indicators of how little people in power actually care about those they claim to represent neoliberals:
This is bull shit on it‚Äôs face, Biden is a life long Catholic. What pray tell is Trump Bishop?
No I will not! Biden/Harris 2020 #RidinWithBiden
Good luck with this Lola but I fear it‚Äôs like spitting in the wind. Can you find some that aren‚Äôt regular voters to come to the Biden side?
You were my first choice, but Kamala Harris was my 2nd. Look forward to campaigning hard for Biden/Harris 2020 and Abrams for Governor 2024!
i support whoever i vote for. it‚Äôs wild to me that you‚Äôd ‚Äúblame‚Äù voters instead of the oppressive system biden does not care about progressivism unless it‚Äôs convenient. what about him implies he listens? choosing a cop vp or saying ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs pres
ü§î Misogyny from where? Certainly not the same people who were willing to accept Palin as VP.  Unless just standing against a Biden/Harris ticket is now equal to misogyny.
Oh Liz, you already had your talking points ready to go before Kamala Harris was named Biden‚Äôs running mate. All you had to do was insert her name Grade for you = F, for thoroughly lacking originality.
Just because the Biden Campaign controlled press does not report it, doesn't mean it did not happen.  Every DemocRAT supports this terrorism.  Every one of them.  If they live in your house, kick them to the street.
Notice how the wording has changed. The fake NYT diverging from the "African American" necessity to "Person of color". Their nuance is telling.  Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
It makes you wonder about the principles of the left.  Another example would be Harris herself calling Biden a racist and an abuser of women, but then accepting the nomination. Accusations only matter during the primaries ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Defund  another article which proves it is just the propoganda wing of the Biden Campaign.  Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for this crap.  The DemocRATS need to fund their own crap.
You'll be waiting a long time since you refuse to accept any new information, like the covid plan from January or the fact that Joe Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain ran point on Ebola virus.  Remember when there was a scary disease you didn't get because they did their job
What is Trump doing (and not just talking about doing)  One thing Joe Biden would do is open up the Obamacare exchanges for a special enrollment period for the newly unemployed.  Trump has not done that. Lynnie-Karen
I am currently quarantined in my house because my MAGAT father had a fever and I don't want to give this disease to the people I love.  I am a suburban housewife who is unsafe and Ridin' with Biden
You have to win first: What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden
Yes!  I don't see any boat parades for Biden!
This women was just accusing Biden of felonious crimes and now she‚Äôs praising him. Why I‚Äôll never care for these political figures..
It may be snark, stating Biden is not catholic because of his stance on abortion?  Maybe.
i‚Äôm with you on that! all candidates deserve a place on the debate stage. she‚Äôd probably tear biden &amp; trump to pieces. she‚Äôs super smart and well spoken
You ppl are just the Nazi party of the US, it‚Äôs fine cause I know you already know this. But America is tired, so tired. I hope Biden doesn‚Äôt pardon Trump. He won‚Äôt be President forever and trump foundation will be what sends him to prison.
Ummmmm, Biden is as Catholic as the Pope.
Kamala hates Biden and you know it. Come back with something witty..The left‚Äôs hypocrisy knows no boundaries..
HRC was and is rotten to the core, Biden is gonna piggy back on 8 years behind obama to win it all just watch lol
In Biden's defense, if you had to pick your VP among all the Dems, who is a good choice?
That sounds like Biden.
Fuck #KamalaHarris and anyone saying to ignore her past. Same people who ignore or make excuses for the videos of Joe Biden groping children
Uh because not every survivor wants all of that publicity. Especially the negative ones who will accuse her of lying. Look how it turned out for the poor woman who came out about being raped by Biden.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Would a President Biden put #KamalaHarris in charge of the gulags he's pressured to open up?

We aren‚Äôt enemies, my dudes. But we are in an aggressively boiling melting pot that‚Äôs going to bubble over any minute now. I don‚Äôt know if Biden or Kamala are going to be our wooden spoon, but I do know they aren‚Äôt our saviors
There‚Äôs a reason the left isn‚Äôt excited about Biden. Mans ain‚Äôt it
Biden will make the order to arrest us if we don‚Äôt take the vsccine
It could have been a Joe Lieberman rebooted, I would still vote for Joe Biden!
Tulsi should‚Äôve been Biden‚Äôs VP pick. #VPHarris #BidenVP
Biden and Harris=Birris or #BirristheVirus
Right you are. I‚Äôm not a fan of either Biden or Kamala, but they can‚Äôt do much worse than the current administration...we REALLY got screwed on this and the last election...
Warren is too fake and soft. I can't get over warren lying her way through life about the Indian stuff. I don't see how Biden stands a chance. The debates are gonna be a total shit show
My homie that works in DC was telling me she was the one they didn't want Biden to pick because it gonna be hard to attack her.
Kamala was an absolute dumpster fire as a presidential candidate and an unpopular AG in a liberal state. People in her own Party can‚Äôt stand her. Tulsi Gabbard was the move. Biden screwed up.
I think this analysis goes to the exact point for the Dems having picked Kamala as the VP. Biden is clearly unable physically and mentally  to campaign and even less of running the country. It‚Äôs now basically Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris for president
Vote your conscience! I gave into the vote shamers last election &amp; voted for Hillary &amp; regret it now after learning more about her. A lot of people are choosing to vote green or libertarian this year bc Biden and Trump are both pedophile rapists. Just vote your conscienceüòå‚úåüèº
‚ÄúThe current president is a science denying, racist, pedophile enabling, drug addicted murderer responsible for over 150,000 deaths BUT I am not happy about voting for Biden/Harris.‚Äù
biden better not drop out before the debates..
Don't get the Kamala choice. Tulsi would have been a much better choice. Still a bit too radical for me. Can't see this working out for Biden at all.
Biden's late to THAT party.
Ma‚Äôam, So proud of you and happy for your selection. Way to go, you will make a great team. I know you and Joe Biden will return our nation to the right path.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Yes, President Obama, let‚Äôs win this thing!  Our country needs healing and it needs healing fast!  I pray God uses Biden and Kamala in a mighty way!
She did accuse Biden of racism.  It was harsh.
I am guessing Secretary of State.  It will be a Kamal + Abrams ticket when Biden steps down.
Abrams will be the Secretary of State. So when Biden steps down in 2021, Kamala, P and Abrams, VP

Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris!! You and VP Biden will certainly get my vote!!
Neither did Biden‚Äôs the first two times. In fact, now that I think of it, the first two and a quarter times.
I‚Äôm on auto donate to Biden but I donated some more!!
So Soros finally told Biden who his replacement is.
Biden probably forgot about it üòÇ
In a move designed not to expand his base ‚Å¶ taps #KamalaHarrisForVP....
Truth: I was anxious. Worried Biden would choose wrong. I am so relieved and happy!!!! #BidenHarris2020
I first knocked doors for Michelle Nunn. I gave to Hillary's campaign. I knocked doors again for Stacey Abrams. I gave more than ever before to Warren in this primary. I'm progressive as fuck and I am telling y'all, Biden/Harris is a ticket we all can support without reservation.
I feel you bruh but the overthrow won't come until we are old n gone...it will be MJ (my 5 year old) that will be apart of that revolution. Biden cabinet will say another about what the nxt 4 going to be like...Sanders and Warren from what im hearing will be apart of it.
your ratings are so bad you didn‚Äôt even get live coverage of your daily lie fest. The celebration of Kamala being named Biden‚Äôs running mate was much more important &amp; news worthy.
Flashback: ‚Å¶ said she believed women who accused ‚Å¶ of inappropriate touching
I think its a solid win...funny enough its blk men thats not happy with this pick smh..we are the lowest voting block anyways....as long as the black women vote in high number like they been doing Biden wins.
Thanks for reiterating what a great choice this is! I can‚Äôt wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris - by mail!
Oh you misunderstand me. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt plan to rely on Biden for much. Restructuring our elections process imo is going to have to be something the people do, trickle up change if you will. I just think the priority is to get Donnie gone if we want any sort of positive change.
BREAKING: Harris selected as Biden‚Äôs VP pick
Still think Biden doesn‚Äôt have the black vote?! Think again  And, please stop digging around in the mud and throwing it at them. They‚Äôre a great ticket and YOU KNOW IT! The higher they go, THE LOWER YOU GO! ü§¢

Too bad Biden can‚Äôt speak though

and joe biden choosing a black woman just to prove he‚Äôs not racist or sexist when he‚Äôs said so much racist shit and i 100% believe tara reade.....like what the fuck
I really enjoyed Woody Harrelson's Biden, too.
Joe Biden made the perfect choice with this pick. She‚Äôll be an awesome VP, inspiring heir apparent and brutal campaigner. We saw her eat Biden‚Äôs still beating heart on the debate stage. Now we get to see her go after Donnie.
i am so sad,,, i have to unfollow you bc the shittiness of biden has increased by so much,,, thank you for the jokes back when it wasn‚Äôt reality üíó

Representation matters #BlackLivesMatter #BidenHarris2020
Weird. Red MAGA says if I vote third party or not at all, it‚Äôs a vote for Biden. I guess it just depends on your perspective.
Of course. Of course. Of course. Biden picks the only person as his running mate that would make me even less excited to vote for him.
Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate ??? Oh baby trump finna win
Joe Biden really picked Kamala Harris I think he trying to lose because as a black man Joe signed that war on drugs bill in 90s and now picks a woman that was locking black men up for sport in the 2000s. Bernie I need you bro ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden/Harris huh!? Let‚Äôs go black women!
Right pick for the nation VP.  Joe Biden has done his part. Now it‚Äôs our turn to do ours by cleansing and reclaiming peoples house (White House) in November 2020
Good....got my vote   In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Outstanding pick! No question that  on the ticket helps Biden win down here in Georgia! #gapol
Biden chose Kamala Harris, whom I have read up on, and she is a lawyer, has a long record of respect for the law, and I think she wants access to the law to be more universal.

Preparing for Biden announcement. Some people already know. We have to wait.
Kasich - I use to admire your stance on many issues but to now think you'd support Biden, who hasn't anything left in his head, for president is too much.  Now, if you will forgive me as I forever turn my back to you.
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams Rips ‚ÄòRamblin‚Äô Joe Biden, ‚ÄòCome Here Joe, Sit ...
Oh come on, people. Biden could pick a Chia Pet as his running mate and it would still be a better option than the alternative.
The VP probably picked her own team. I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden already made his decision seeing as the announcement is coming as soon as today.
Trump: 'Some men are insulted' by Biden choosing female VP
Now I know you're not writing this nonsense. Perhaps you need to tell you aide to roll it back a bit.  Perhaps, just say elect Biden because he's the only one we got left.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the whole cast of The View
If those numbers are even halfway accurate, then Trump will trounce Biden.
'Joe Biden, Nana and Chuckie have fled the country following President Donald J. Trumps landslide re-election."  'Champaign dreams and caviar wishes'...
Endorsing Biden.  Speaking first night of convention.
He said WW2 instead of WW1. That's a verbal slip. It did impact the war's resolution. And it got going in early 1918, not late 1917, but that's minutiae. 90% of Americans can't name the years around WW1. And a high % of Biden supporters are willfully ignorant of his dementia.
These are Biden's leading VP contenders? I haven't seen this much baggage since the last time I was at an airport...
You really think Biden groping children is better than trump saying ignorant shit and being divorced? That‚Äôs very concerning. He‚Äôs not just overly affectionate.. when some of the kids tried to move away, he grabbed their waists and forced them back. That isn‚Äôt decent at all.
There‚Äôs multiple videos of Biden groping children. I really don‚Äôt understand how people hate trump for all the disgusting shit he did, but are somehow blind to the fact that Biden is a pedophile. Especially when there‚Äôs visual proof of it.
I keep seeing #blueMAGA make fun of Q believers like they aren‚Äôt just as delusional thinking Biden will be this country‚Äôs saviorüôÑ
That makes voting for Biden sound even less appealing.
Oh sure, keep bringing up Trump's "grab em by the pussy" line like it was literal yet make every excuse for Biden saying nigger years ago. What hypocrites. Btw, Ben Shapiro's joking about that stupid song was one of the most hilarious things I've seen all year! üòÇ
I saw the video too.  Don't know why the agent didn't empty his sidearm into the guy.  'Death by Cop' is what the Biden voter was looking for.
Even Biden doesn‚Äôt think so
It's self-evident that Biden is a shell, a ruse, a mentally-deficient patient (and not a true candidate).  VP for the Dems IS their pick. And it will be Michelle (Barack-is-back-YAY!) Obama.
Biden‚Äôs VP pick matters. If he wins, his pick will very likely finish his term. He is not well and everyone knows it. Voting for Biden is voting for his VP to be president.
Trump‚Äôs campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden‚Äôs knocks on zero.  via
People are tracking flights to Delewate to find out who Biden‚Äôs running mate is.
Biden is pretty sure Joe Biden fought in World War 1.
Isn't Biden your candidate?  Not appropriate to ask a few questions about his, ahem, fitness for ANY job, much less president? He couldn't pack a box in an Amazon sweatshop-warehouse.
If Biden doesn't pick Michelle (Barack! Shhh!) Obama as his VP, it will be a huge letdown.  #Biden
Haha, OK. You'll only have to deal with Biden for a few more months.
LOL, really? "Struggles" is what you're going with?  Biden has dementia. He is unfit. It is sad and tragic.
I have two relatives that apologized for voting for Trump and are voting for Biden.
She unfollowed the Biden Campaign?   Wow, that escalated quickly...
Disrespectful $###  He is still your president.  I accepted Obama/Biden which were the 2 worst ...They encouraged racial divide, not equality, police disrespect, sent my healthcare from $850 per month for 3 to $2491 per month and the list goes on. #Trump2020 #MAGA
Now do Biden's verbal mistakes. Go!
I‚Äôm sure all the Right Wingers concern-trolling about Biden‚Äôs brain will be chastising Trump‚Äôs family for keeping him in the race now, right?
Just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt possibly love Jill Biden any more.   And it‚Äôs when she‚Äôs First Lady, not if.

Last time I checked mainstream media giving Biden a pass on everything
I just want a VP who is competent and can step into the posits POTUS at any given moment if something happened to Biden.  I‚Äôm voting Blue down the ballot in GA were we have a chance to flip 2 Senate seats.  ‚ù§Ô∏è

I saw a Biden sticker on a car a few days ago. There is no enthusiasm for him but there is plenty of enthusiasm to vote against Trump.
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden and Harris at their first joint fundraising event spoke without telling a lie.  How is that for a change!   O'Donnel -The last word.
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Kamala Harris said she believed Biden's accusers, she is now forever tied to a sexual assaulter.
With all due respect. Why can't  biden finish his term?? Who has made this determination?
wake up America!! This guy wants a Nationwide Mask Mandate and won‚Äôt even answer press questions! This is what a Biden presidency looks likeüò≥ Biden is weak!!
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Do Biden/Harris want to abolish the police or do they want to ‚Äúmass incarcerate America‚Äù? This is such terrible messaging it‚Äôs laughable
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
Sounds like Biden also disrespected his socialist VP as per WP

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front

Okay, so what is Joe Biden's excuse? That's exactly how he pronounced it today...

you accuse Senator Ron Johnson of being in cahoots with Russia for denigrating Biden... are you in cahoots with Biden? Because all you do is spread his propaganda!

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
This.  You can appreciate the Lincoln Project without funding them. Help Democratic candidates out instead. Let the Lincoln Project use Never Trump GOP dollars to push Republicans to vote for Biden.

The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

Hillary called trump supporters deplorable. Biden said if you have a hard time deciding between me or trump then you ain‚Äôt black. Idk about the Harris quote haven‚Äôt heard it before.
So excited to support our Biden/Harris dream team!!
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
Pretty much is the plan‚Ä¶ Biden is just a front.
I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
I didn‚Äôt know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.

D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.

Biden/Harris makes Mondale/Ferraro look exciting..not a compliment btw.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

I think she's saying the Democratic nominee is the most racist presidential candidate since Wallace, not that Biden is the most racist Democratic nominee since Wallace, but it's not as if either of those are defensible claims

The honest truth about Kamala Harris is this:  She completes Biden!  She is as phony, vacuous, empty, shallow, hollow, and mindless as him!  A perfect pair...of NOTHING.
What do Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, and Facebook all have in common?  OWNED by CHINA!!
America, this is Sleepy Biden‚Äôs selection for vise president!  She whored her way to Sacramento government with mayor Brown! Question, do you want her as your next president????? She will destroy this great nation anyway she can!!!!

One silver lining if Biden wins, I‚Äôll finally be able to talk shit about the president with my parents.
It's too bad for you Obama isn't the one running against Trump. Joe Biden is. He has 8.3 million followers. 78 million less than Trump. Bahaha!
President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

Yea so your answer choices don‚Äôt even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don‚Äôt trust GOP/conservative polls.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no liberal snowflake‚Äù is by no means an indictment on Biden. You‚Äôre a disgrace
You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we‚Äôre all too stupid to see it.
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Did Mike Pence just say that he‚Äôs going to beat Biden‚Äôs meat??
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won‚Äôt take even softball question from the media.
‚ÄúIn a fund-raising email about Ms. Harris‚Äôs selection, Vice President Mike Pence -‚Äúthis is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS,‚Äù he wrote.
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd put her country over her party. She knows Joe Biden well and knows that he‚Äôd be an outstanding President. She also knows that her father would have already endorsed him and would have likely been his Secretary of Defense.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
I'll take a chance on the USPS. Images of the mailbag scene from Christmas on 34th St, all for Biden/Harris.
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

Wow. Such desperation from the Biden camp.
She is a big part of their plans. What I see is Biden gets elected and takes demands from Nancy then he has to step down because of health problems Kamala takes over and appointments Nancy as VP then somehow Nancy takes over and then you have hell on earth.

Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we‚Äôve dodged a bullet.
Real question. Asking cuz I‚Äôd like to know. Why is this president so afraid of mail in ballots? If everyone is eligible, why would it be harmful to HIS campaign &amp; not Biden‚Äôs?
I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front
I was surprised to see some of your base coming onto my Facebook page after I put Biden/Harris 2020 signs. I let them know in no uncertain times that you will not RUN MY PAGE! They are mostly white, poor, uneducated, gullible, ignorant people. These are the ones you CAN CONTROL!

The fact that you think Biden will win is laughable. You‚Äôre a complete clown show.

You should work harder, find a better job. It‚Äôs not trump‚Äôs fault or job. If you think it is, then you‚Äôre a liberal. Get it? It‚Äôs called capitalism. Vote for Biden if you want the government to help. Remember this is where they get high on power like they‚Äôre doing now, re masks
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.

I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama‚Äôs VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you‚Äôre not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
Pretty sure you would have said this about whoever Biden chose.  It's sad that conservatives are so unoriginal these days.

That‚Äôs all the Biden campaign could afford to pay!
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
well if you go to search bar and type  it takes you to Biden s website. Wow #RIGGEDELECTION
Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it‚Äôs recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can‚Äôt let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American

Biden is going in..... I‚Äôm excited to vote for him in November. He‚Äôs serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.

No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.

Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
It‚Äôs ok not to like trump. But I believe he loves his country more than you hate him and he will do what he thinks is best for me and you like it or not . I couldn‚Äôt imagine Biden at the wheel . His problem would be , he wouldn‚Äôt know he is at the wheel

The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere

Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
‚ÄúHe (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they‚Äôre kind of in sync. Dick Morris
I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
You don‚Äôt have to very smart to be smarter than  So we‚Äôll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them
Bottoms. Why don‚Äôt you do your job as Mayor of Atlanta and quit worrying about Joe Biden. You‚Äôre responsible for an eight year old females death. If you are so smart and we know you are. Straighten Atlanta out
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I‚Äôm just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I‚Äôve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. üëàüèæ
They both won though. Biden won the D primary and Trump won the R primary. It's not actually big news.
AMEN, Madam Vice President indeed. We Biden/Harris supporters have a fight on our hands, but what sacrifice came without one! TIME FOR CHANGE! WE ARE READY! ONE LOVE Gabrielle Giffords, Stay safe! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.

I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don‚Äôt. So I find it intriguing. It‚Äôs others that feel the same way as you do.

It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Haha pop your Sh√¨t! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)

Brilliant.  In Biden‚Äôs own words...
Biden chose k harris thus assuring the re - election of Trump Pence.  Thanks for the Peace of mind. Sleepy joe.
Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
Did Biden have any chances???
Biden actually read a script on the Zoom call and held his phone upside down. This man is toast. This is not going to go well for y‚Äôall.
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.

This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

Joe Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris, is a Westmount High graduate | CBC News
I was ready the first time around. I was ready when Biden won the primaries.
To all you liberals who just bought weapons out of fear due to the riots will have to sell them back to the government under a Biden/Harris win. Whatcha ya gonna do then? Vote Trump/Pence and keep you‚Äôre guns!
Next: Biden will be replaced be Kamala Harris at the DNC convention, and a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù white male will become her running mate - John Kasich?
Now, Biden, put   over education please.  needs to go. Senator Warren would be the best for education....she will rebuild the education system.
Exact opposite happened to me. I was agnostic when involved with religion. I doubted because of hypocrisy.   Found my Higher Power I call God in AA. It was the personal stories of recovery I called miracles that helped me connect. My spiritual awakening. Incredible experience!
...what‚Äôs your re-election plan? (that‚Äôs not attacking Biden/Harris)
Biden will not be the nominee. He will be gone.
Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
I taught Catechism to school kids several years ago.   Left because of hypocrisy too!  Got tired of being told was going to hell if didn‚Äôt follow Catholic dogma.   Love, honor and obey? Hah my ex took it literally. It should be love, trust and respect.   Never looked back!
Watch ‚Å¶ reaction to Biden's VP pick
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
So everybody wants this debate but not trump/biden?
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
That time when being the Governor of Georgia was your backup plan. #gagop #beentherelostthat
They changed it to Slow Joe for some reason. Cue infinite footage of Trump creeping down a ramp and Biden jogging up it.
As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain‚Äôt learn about biden‚Äôs crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain‚Äôt kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020
Guess I can still vote for Biden/Harris- even though her stepson is a Tiger!!  ##ccsucks #dupioneers #nowademocrat #recoveringrepublucan

I wish someone who knows everything to make list what President did I last 5 months and what Biden did for country. Trump: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12......##
Nobody is crazy about Biden we all had other candidates in mind but four more years of Trump we can‚Äôt survive that. There is no perfect candidate but this election is too important to not not vote or third party. Bite the bulletin vote Biden and them him accountable to policy.
That clip right there is full proof that Biden didn‚Äôt make the VP pick...
‚Äúpersonally spent time with leaders of both Israel and the UAE,‚Äù Michael Doran scoffed that ‚Äúthe biggest memory the Emiratis have of their time together with Biden‚Äù was when he had to apologize after accusing them publicly of having funded and armed jihadists in Syria.
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don‚Äôt have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!
History has been made! Congratulations Kamala Harris on becoming the VP nominee. You represent every woman of color. I know you will do us proud!!!  #pwreign #politics #BlackWomen #BlackWomenLeadVP #BlackGirlMagic
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn‚Äôt know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Ah, come on, let‚Äôs make it fun. Let‚Äôs say 67-18 Biden with Kanye pulling 15...
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
And Biden still leading. WTF
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
It‚Äôs a condensed convention and not everyone could be up there. Beto isn‚Äôt there either or Katie Porter so many I would have loved to see or hear. They had to pick key ones that would be most impactful to Biden and Kamala to win. It‚Äôs nothing personal.
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You‚Äôre only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
I only listen to real leaders who believe in science and follow advice of experts. That‚Äôs why I am ignoring this  IMPOTUS Dotard and listening to Biden and will also be voting for him to take over for this ü§° in November.
Only Trump could kill 160,000+ Americans. Biden wouldn‚Äôt do that
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Stop this already! ‚úãüõë The condensed convention roster has been chosen this isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs first rodeo. Move on! We have an election to win enough of the nit picking. Over this noise!
I don‚Äôt want to hear any more whining about convention it‚Äôs condensed &amp; this isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs first rodeo they know who they need to speak to win. So either get on bored &amp; back the current nominee, or get the hell out of the way! We have an election to win no time for this noise! üëä
I would vote for Joe Biden as often as I can.ü§£
Kasich is a much loved past Governor of Ohio which is a key swing state for this election him swaying even one GOP vote to Biden is needed to flip it Blue. Bloomberg is a key gun advocate and very popular in many states also very influential in business world. It‚Äôs about winning!

You have Biden winning?
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.

Disagree. As someone who has lived in Ohio Kasich is popular with both Dem &amp; GOP. If him talking can sway voters in this very key state it could be the thing we need to get Ohio blue. Biden knows what he is doing. This is about the whole party beating Trump in Nov.
I missed the Biden &amp; Harris debut today.  What did I miss?
Honestly he should be. Having a GOP at the convention going to vote for the Dem is huge and he is popular in a very key swing state of Ohio. Him speaking to explain why he is picking Biden over his own party in hopes of swaying others is very important and deserves time.

You were saying,
This.  You can appreciate the Lincoln Project without funding them. Help Democratic candidates out instead. Let the Lincoln Project use Never Trump GOP dollars to push Republicans to vote for Biden.
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.

How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She‚Äôs actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!

I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
Isn‚Äôt Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.

The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls

the fact that people are bragging abt not voting for Biden-Harris üòí it‚Äôs the not knowing/caring enough abt the electoral system and the importance of this election and young voter turnout for me
‚ÄúNormalcy‚Äù back to today‚Äôs America. Especially when their own choices are completely erratic and turbulent. This election is gonna be such a mess and I was sure Biden would win before but now with Kamala with him, they‚Äôll be ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùlucky‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù to win.
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúreturn to normalcy‚Äù is just atrocious, tone deaf, and ignorant. Besides the fact that America has never been good, it is naive to just say ‚Äúall of this will go away‚Äù when trump is gone. He has impacted media so insanely that there is no ‚Äúgoing back‚Äù everything will-
-transparent. People aren‚Äôt fucking stupid they see that the two had no chemistry, they‚Äôre gonna see this as her trying to get into the WH, they‚Äôre gonna see this as Biden trying to save face with moderates. Because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs not hard to read. It‚Äôs so nasty
She lsaid on stage that she believed in the woman who filed sexual assault charges on Biden. Called him a segregationist. Called him out on his racism. And then proceeds to run with him, because morales don‚Äôt actually matter to her, what matters is getting into the White House
He‚Äôs always stood like that. Unless he‚Äôs had dementia since he was 18, there‚Äôs not really any evidence to support that crazy theory...Joe Biden on the other hand...
Brilliant.  In Biden‚Äôs own words...
I know right, she must think a lot like Biden. She‚Äôs basically saying black people can‚Äôt be politically diverse. Incredible. The hypocrisy, the racism, so obvious.
Biden literally could not have picked anyone worse. Of course the fact that he picked a woman of black and indigenous heritage is a good thing, but she literally is so flippant, put thousands behind bars, and a complete hypocrite. I hope whatever they‚Äôre going for works but ffs

The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.
If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can‚Äôt determine is he is or isn‚Äôt Catholic. Plus, you‚Äôve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that‚Äôs... Sad.
A brave, bold choice for sure. This should encourage Americans from any background to run for office and make their voice heard! It will be interesting to see how this campaign pans out. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Biden/Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump/Pence  Voting third party is the same as voting for Trump. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a conversation
I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You‚Äôre so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick üòÇ
I guess #phonyKamala doesn't ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù Joe Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers anymore...ü§î
What‚Äôs wrong with Kamala Harris? Probably better than Biden himself.
Yes. But now they are best friends. Just like Obama and Biden.
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. üò∞üëäüôèüí™
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.

Nah. This is a great and logical choice.   Rice had too much Benghazi luggage.  Not worth it.  Biden can find plenty of very qualified AGs with principals in this country.   And Cali will elect another Dem Senator. Kamala can spar  with Trump.  It‚Äôs all good. üá∫üá∏

If you think we were doing any better economically before Trump your a retard. That‚Äôs the tweet. Kamala Harris is a fraud do your research she might be worse then Joe ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make sense‚Äù Biden.
Old but true. Not sexist. Biden is also a phoney, painting himself as a Progressive AND a Moderate like he can actually be both.
Which means a quicker demise w/Trump or the continual, slow march off the cliff w/Biden. That‚Äôs the choice we face in November. We know this bc Biden has told us nothing will fundamentally change under his administration except better decorum. Almost time to say good night Lucy!
This is the continued future of America with Trump or Biden. This is the predictable result of decades of neoliberal policies by both parties. But as I‚Äôve said many times we deserve this corrupted government and all of the damage we get. We are the architects of our own demise.
Ok. After not voting for Biden/Harris &amp; leaving to chance that Trumpandemic might be re-elected, what‚Äôs the move? Not necessarily your plan but the plan of someone who is thinking this way &amp; spewing misinformation about this candidate? Are you voting for Trump by default?
Kamala Harris was hand picked by the Democratic establishment so she can become president when Joe Biden dies in office if he gets elected. I don't have facts to back this up, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
Biden is such a beta donk
Vote Biden.  45 must be defeated no matter what. Not voting or voting third party just helps 45.
Some one will be in office in November. A knee will be on our neck in November. Biden doesn‚Äôt have the thirst for murder like Trump. He‚Äôs lost too much( family). We‚Äôre faced to look into a man‚Äôs eyes &amp; see his heart. Or do nothing. For our children. Not even for us.
All that I can say is that I‚Äôve seen Trump. Forget about him being racist &amp; his lineage to the KKK he‚Äôs radically incompetent. With that being said by the process of elimination I‚Äôm voting for Biden &amp; Harris so as to not leave open the possibility that #Trumpandemic continues.
Doug....do you include your 3 children on calls of a political nature?  Please remind me....what office/position in the US Govt does Hunter Biden hold?  Attacking the child of a candidate...hmm, definitely not Christian. So...your kids are fair game also?  #gapol #GAsen #GAGOP
Birds of a feather lose together. Biden could have picked the Pope as a running mate and he would still lose because he sold out his country when he committed treason giving Iran a sworn enemy billions of our dollars.
Its the truth tho isn't it? Biden made a big deal about wanting to pick someone based on their gender and race. Why? Its also obvious that the  is counting on ppl voting for her instead of him.

So does anyone else think that #BidenHarris2020 is merely a Democrat ploy to get her into the White House and then have Poor, Creepy ol' Joe Biden deemed unfit for president? #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
And if she fails to respond to our demands &amp; push Biden hard for concessions she‚Äôll all but know she need not even suit up for ‚Äò24. As  said on  show, progressives are on the rise. The monied interests are scared shitless now. 3 or 4 more big wins  &amp; they‚Äôll fold
has this exactly right. I‚Äôm not Voting in support of Biden, but hand the office to the person who can be accountable and will respond to pressure. Harris wants to run for Pres. The more and relentless pressure will have a definite impact on her in 2024.

Didn't Ms. Harris go after Biden for being racist during the Democratic candidate debates?
They very okay w/t Biden‚Äôs, Clinton‚Äôs, &amp; Obama‚Äôs of the world who maintain the empire, but give a damn about poor people, hell no. After all we might need to put in place more stringent laws to control them once they figure out we‚Äôve fucked them hard. Compassions not allowed.

Biden has yet to explain why it‚Äôs safe for Jill to fly all around making appearances (even on Fox)?  Is t she ‚Äúfollowing the science?‚Äù
I do not have to believe that Trump is a saint to judge that Biden is much the worse sinner. I detest Franklin Roosevelt, but I would never support Hitler against him.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Trump is Satan as far as I‚Äôm concerned and HAS to be removed. But that doesn‚Äôt mean this country was all daisies and roses under the previous 4+ decades run by Democratic and Republican neoliberals, which includes Biden‚Äôs policy influences as well.
If you don‚Äôt believe Biden is a bait &amp; switch guy I suggest you take off the rose colored glasses &amp; do some research on his 40+ year political career. Your children‚Äôs future depends on you being a more informed voter. Anyone taking these people at their word in 2020 is troubling.
Young people backed Bernie over Biden for a reason, because they‚Äôre informed on the issues affecting their present &amp; future. After witnessing 30+ years of Clintonism running this party, and understanding Biden as a full throated supporter of Clintonism, my cynicism is warranted.
Now you understand where I‚Äôm at in this election. I‚Äôm cynical because the facts dictate I be. The money &amp; power in the Democratic Party didn‚Äôt line up behind Biden &amp; against Bernie because they believe he‚Äôll do the right thing &amp;:pass progressive policies. We‚Äôll have to make him.
I will vote for Biden because he‚Äôs not the Satan in the White House. Would I love it if he fought for the policies hes putting out, yes. But I‚Äôm prepared to go to battle with him if he doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no more going home the day after the election, the stakes are way too high.
Dude, you just said that "Obama is a idiot". Go back and look at your comments. As far as Joe Biden, I don't give a rat's ass if he chose Roger Rabbit as his VP, I'm voting for him!!

I really like her, so it sucks to have to say this: She‚Äôs not the right choice for this election.   Biden has a shot at the presidency almost solely because of the African-American demographic. They want true representation in office and that needs to happen with a black woman.
No one can believe your lies; Biden &amp; Obama were in the White House eight years (2009-2016) and nothing happen to your guns or the 2nd amendment. It would take a real dumb ass to believe Trump‚Äôs BS.

Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks
As  said on #seeingamerica , she‚Äôs voting for the person she wants to hold accountable. Make no mistake, with Biden‚Äôs well documented affinity to neoliberalism and general conservative disposition on, we‚Äôre going to have to fight like hell to win this battle.
I want Biden to win. But if we think that‚Äôs all it‚Äôll take to correct the fundamental, structural problems this nation faces, you‚Äôd better think again. As Hannah Nicole Jones said on Megan Rapiopnoes new show, Seeing America, her worst fear is people will go home if Biden wins.
Now, predictably, the establishment came together to force in the nation a Bidendy nomination to try and restore the system as it existed before 1/20/17, as Biden proudly proclaims that his only goal as president. And the failure to understand THEY caused Trump continues.
Joe Biden‚Äôs controversial remarks about race this week risk alienating young Black voters who despise President Donald Trump but are not inspired by his Democratic rival.

Yeah, right...Russia would rather have a very strong Donald Trump in office rather than a weak, addled, puppet like Joe Biden.  Have a hard time believing that.
Biden is a big supporter of abortion .. this is against the teachings of his church,Strong supporter of same sex marriages,and all this transgender stuff, against the teaching of the church..Had his fingers up in the private parts of a underage girl... he should be horse whipped

I think both push narratives. Also Obama had 8 yrs without any problems. Pelosi and Biden 40-50... so why can‚Äôt Trump have 8? November is around the corner. Vote him out. I will still support your president because at the end of the day I am an American. Peace to you!

I heard what #Biden said and they're taking it out of context in my opinion.
Biden makes God look bad in the eyes of others.  We are to bear and be good witnesses.  We are to have something about ourselves that others want.

From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut. But there was that debate-stage attack on Biden's busing record to consider.
There is no such thing as a perfect political candidate...it‚Äôs a lot not to like about Biden and Harris but don‚Äôt let that keep a mentality retarded president in office...I‚Äôm just saying

Holy shit. This is probably the smartest move Democrats have made via this election. Which says a lot because it's the most sensible play and again, Biden should have never been the presidential candidate
If Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Harris or Rice he might as well drop out the race.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.

What if Trump and Biden are the same bird?
Yes, but she‚Äôs right before Biden. That seems to suggest something. I get letting others speak who might not be chosen, but isn‚Äôt it customary for the VP nominee to basically introduce the presidential nominee?

I don't feel bad for the democratic party because everyone told them Joe Biden was a mistake. And its clear that after dems sabotaged capable candidates, biden is sabotaging himself......like everyone with common sense said he would.
There are only TWO viable 2020 presidential candidates (Trump &amp; Biden). DO NOT be distracted, divided, and conquered. The 2020 election is a referendum on America, and her future. As much as possible, vote: morality, justice, and equity. Deuteronomy 16:18-19. #Reformer
We have a better option than Biden or TrumpWhat I find funny about the situation is Dems that simply cannot fathom another legitimate Trump victory. Doesn't matter how much you say that Trump voters are silent until the booth. All they know is what the media tells them, which is Biden is a guaranteed win. It's crazy/sad.
No, he picked Joe Biden. Such delusional poppcock. That and your statement on USPS

Yea so your answer choices don‚Äôt even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don‚Äôt trust GOP/conservative polls.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no liberal snowflake‚Äù is by no means an indictment on Biden. You‚Äôre a disgrace
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we‚Äôre all too stupid to see it.
‚ÄúIn a fund-raising email about Ms. Harris‚Äôs selection, Vice President Mike Pence -‚Äúthis is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS,‚Äù he wrote.
Biden and Kamala gave away the secret.  Authoritarian Government over reach resulting in a totalitarian tyrannical police state
Genuinely curious, what about Biden do you think would classify him as fascist?
I mean what‚Äôs the better approach? I can keep talking about leftist ideas and convincing people I know and online that they‚Äôre the way to go until a revolution/collapse happens and vote Biden to reduce harm in the meantime. Or what? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a better option
Dictator want to be? Biden and Karen....I mean Kamala want to have a national mandate on mask. There is no Constitutional power to mandate this or enforce it and reeks of fascism
I basically agree with this. But when that system does get torn down, we‚Äôre going to need a new system that‚Äôs better rather than worse. That‚Äôs why we need to keep pushing society left until it happens. If electing Biden is a step left, then I think it‚Äôs one we have to take
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's
Thank you and I too appreciate the respectful conversation as well! I wish you and your family the best and especially in navigating the school year and hope things go well!
Biden is taking no prisoners..... #SpecialReport #BidenHarris2020
Biden is going in..... I‚Äôm excited to vote for him in November. He‚Äôs serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Lol. Last time I seen this poll Biden was up by 20 points
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.

Why Trump may struggle to run against a Biden-Harris ticket  via
Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
Bottoms. Why don‚Äôt you do your job as Mayor of Atlanta and quit worrying about Joe Biden. You‚Äôre responsible for an eight year old females death. If you are so smart and we know you are. Straighten Atlanta out
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I‚Äôm just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I‚Äôve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. üëàüèæ
They both won though. Biden won the D primary and Trump won the R primary. It's not actually big news.
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOTüî• today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOTüî•as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I‚Äôm not the one you want! üëèüèæüíØ

I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don‚Äôt. So I find it intriguing. It‚Äôs others that feel the same way as you do.

Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.

Did Biden tweet his VP pick? No live announcement, no cameras, no media? Is he really even alive?
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.

That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.

I still believe that the most likely scenario is that Biden's lead in the polls narrows to ~5% by Election Day, and although he wins the popular vote (and I would predict more than Hillary did, maybe 4 instead of 3 million votes) Trump is still re-elected.
Hoping Biden's choice is a big hit and makes Trump jealous, so he dumps Pence for a dollar-store version of Biden's pick.
They've got Kamala Harris scheduled to speak at the convention on the same day as Biden, so not sure what that means. Warren is on Day 3, so it looks like she's out of the picture.
Hate to say it but at this point, if Joe Biden does NOT select a black woman VP, he will lose this election.

Can Biden just announce the Veep already, so  will cut away from this campaign speech?
Also, due to the *monumental* amount of garbage coming out of the NYT, I can guarantee this is at least partially garbage. The only reason Wall Street isn't fully against Biden is that when GND and "free everything" policies cause the $ to lose value, investments may hold value.

In 1960, 67% of Americans identified as Protestant (potentially anti-Catholic). Today that number is less than 50%. Kennedy had to convince Protestants he was trustworthy. Ironically, Biden faces more suspicion from (white) Catholics than from mainstream Protestants.

Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don‚Äôt have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!
History has been made! Congratulations Kamala Harris on becoming the VP nominee. You represent every woman of color. I know you will do us proud!!!  #pwreign #politics #BlackWomen #BlackWomenLeadVP #BlackGirlMagic
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn‚Äôt know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
And Biden still leading. WTF
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You‚Äôre only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
Real question. Asking cuz I‚Äôd like to know. Why is this president so afraid of mail in ballots? If everyone is eligible, why would it be harmful to HIS campaign &amp; not Biden‚Äôs?
People want it to rhyme with Pamela, but that‚Äôs WRONG!   Even Joe Biden sometimes says it Camela.  says it wrong EVERY TIME man! Time to get it right!  Comma-La Karma y‚Äôall.  Kamala isn‚Äôt hard to say. So say it right.
If Biden stays in his basement why do we need masks.
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
I would vote for Joe Biden as often as I can.ü§£

You have Biden winning?
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front

Holy Shit! üò≥
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
Nobody in the media will question anything she or Biden say. The MSM does a better job of campaigning for the Dems than the Dems do themselves.
Phony Senator Harris Comparing Ebola, and Biden‚Äôs response to , the eleven people infected. And prosecuting Trumps handling of Covid that is a world wide pandemic infecting hundreds of millions, and millions killed, is dishonest, something that comes naturally for the senator
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it‚Äôs recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH

Biden is going in..... I‚Äôm excited to vote for him in November. He‚Äôs serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
links you directly to Joe Biden‚Äôs page. If Biden wins Soros and anarchy win. It will be the downfall of America
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
This.  You can appreciate the Lincoln Project without funding them. Help Democratic candidates out instead. Let the Lincoln Project use Never Trump GOP dollars to push Republicans to vote for Biden.
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
Fact check... Clinton (and Biden) were the DIRECT catalyst for Mass Incarcerations.

I think Biden/Bottoms is too vulnerable to memes.
Biden didn‚Äôt select Kamala fat left told him to pick her since she is real far left. Remember she said she wants to destroy Second Addendum  in first hundred days.
Because, Biden is much better for this country than Trump is.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She‚Äôs actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?

I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
dems are not gonna fuckin do shit.  biden's gonna make a law saying "it's okay to kill someone for protesting" and headlines r gonna be like "AT LEAST MR JOE MADE A LAW BEFORE BRINGING IN THE FEDS GOD BLESS AMERICA GOD BLESS DEMOCRACY"
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
"In this dystopian world, Kamala Harris sails above the presidential bar. Harris reflects something we take for granted in this circling of the drain we call politics in the Trump era: she looks and sounds presidential because she is" #BidenHarris2020
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere

Isn‚Äôt Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls
I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.

She was def the best candidate for presidency,  i predicted this from day 1. Too bad Biden will get slain in a debate. He doesn't represent the party. Party should run the best candidate that represents the following, Good night sleepy Joe, Landslide , good night!
Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.

Haha pop your Sh√¨t! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
the fact that people are bragging abt not voting for Biden-Harris üòí it‚Äôs the not knowing/caring enough abt the electoral system and the importance of this election and young voter turnout for me

Biden/Harris makes Mondale/Ferraro look exciting..not a compliment btw.

The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can‚Äôt determine is he is or isn‚Äôt Catholic. Plus, you‚Äôve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that‚Äôs... Sad.

It was an honor to be on Senator Kamala Harris' Georgia Leadership Team.   It was an honor to support her then and is an honor to support her as VP. She is extremely qualified for this position and makes an amazing team with Biden.  Let's do this! #BidenHarris2020 #gapol

Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
This is a big deal. I want to be in a Democratic Party where candidates aren‚Äôt afraid to be challenged on their record, including on race issues.  The fact that Biden chose Harris after their conflict during debates signals that we are a party committed to reflection and growth.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You‚Äôre so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.

tRUMP will NEVER resign unfortunately. There is talk that he will refuse to leave the WH if he loses. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to contest the elections if he loses. Biden can send in the same guys who went to Portland to GAS and shoot tRUMP with RUBBER BULLETS!

This is why people don‚Äôt trust conservative polling...the answers choices‚Äô wording and neglect to be unbiased by not even saying Biden‚Äôs name makes this so skewed and biased it‚Äôs unusable.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no liberal snowflake‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúIts West or Trump‚Äù? Give me a break.
Yea so your answer choices don‚Äôt even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don‚Äôt trust GOP/conservative polls.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no liberal snowflake‚Äù is by no means an indictment on Biden. You‚Äôre a disgrace
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we‚Äôre all too stupid to see it.
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

I'm pro-Bernie but am voting for Biden. The issue that progressives have is that Harris may be treated as the inevitable nominee if she runs for Pres after being incumbent VP with the "how dare anyone primary her" mentality even if she is technically not the incumbent. Same as 16
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You have Biden winning?
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.
I see the hate Biden campaign program is shaping up. It is hilarious, though, that the Cultists latch onto an imaginary defect while ignoring Trump‚Äôs obvious mental deficiencies.
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it‚Äôs recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
We are ALL IN Joe Biden! LET'S GO! BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!

The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?

Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?

Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
You don‚Äôt have to very smart to be smarter than  So we‚Äôll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them

Haha pop your Sh√¨t! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
Brilliant.  In Biden‚Äôs own words...
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
Yikes.  This can‚Äôt help their relationship...
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

Exact opposite happened to me. I was agnostic when involved with religion. I doubted because of hypocrisy.   Found my Higher Power I call God in AA. It was the personal stories of recovery I called miracles that helped me connect. My spiritual awakening. Incredible experience!

They changed it to Slow Joe for some reason. Cue infinite footage of Trump creeping down a ramp and Biden jogging up it.
As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

She‚Äôs no joke, she just thinks Biden supports segregation, believes he sexually assaulted those women, oh and she was smoking weed in college while listening to Tupac and Snoop, despite graduating at least 6 years before either released their first album.
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
We love Kamala, thank-you Joe!!!  "Why Kamala Harris is a historic VP pick for Joe Biden. Presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen California Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate" #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #WeLoveKamala #gapol #Dunwoody
Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
This is a big deal. I want to be in a Democratic Party where candidates aren‚Äôt afraid to be challenged on their record, including on race issues.  The fact that Biden chose Harris after their conflict during debates signals that we are a party committed to reflection and growth.
Biden was only able to pick one candidate. Not everyone is going to be happy.   Please remember ...  When #ResistersUnite  We grow #StrongerTogether  United as #OneVoice1  Committed to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  And to #FlipTheSenateBlue  #BidenHarris2020

But when majority of voters don‚Äôt think Biden will finish a first term, it‚Äôs a play that could work.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!
That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.
LMAO!!! You sound scared as hell!!! #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #Kamala
Proposed: Make the second of the three debates Prez vs. VP. Biden-Pence would put everyone to sleep, but Trump-Harris would be something you'd record and burn onto DVD.
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.
Dang, Biden announces his VP pick, and almost immediately I see people who aren‚Äôt happy with it being told they need to fall in line. The Democratic party isn‚Äôt owed the progressive vote, y‚Äôall.
You were never going to vote for Biden anyway. Sit all the way down.
End of the day. We have to be on they side anyway. Our lives will be better with her and Biden
Desperate Trump...  I bet Biden knows that the 2nd world war ended in 1945.. #thickasshit

"IF you don't vote for me, you are not black"  Calling somebody at a town hall fat.  Challenging a worker at a plant to step outside over a discussion about guns.  Biden is not acting normal and the Media is trying to cover and hide for him.
In other words, right now people will vote for Biden and he wants to change that.
It's astounding to see the Democrat party that constantly attacks racism is supporting a racist for President. They are using the Biden name for bait and switch vote.
EEOA. Equal employment Opportunity Act. Passed by Congress years ago. Isn't Joe Biden breaking this law by stating only a black woman will be his running mate instead of the best qualified person no matter the color or gender?Please vote early so you can‚Äôt see Biden and Harris‚Äô dumbfuckery on displayüòÇ
Biden/Harris not taking questions because they don‚Äôt have original plan on Covid 19. They copied and trying to take credit and blame Trump and lied. They framed their attacks well, though. Most people are smart enough to see through the lies.
I‚Äôm sure hose who forced her onto Biden will cover it!

ALMOST LAUGHABLE, that BIDEN wants to bring to ALL OF AMERICA, the BS IN SAN FRANCISCO by NAMING ONE OF ITS LEADERS as HIS VP!  #NOTHANKYOU!!
AMAZING how the DEEP STATE ALWAYS picks the DEEP STATE! Biden Deep State since 1972! Picks Harris, Deep State since 2017! DC NEVER CHANGES! #DRAINTHEDAMNSWAMP! VOTE  &amp; ALL REPUBLICAN down ballot candidates!!
To those people who say they are surprised that Biden picked Kamala after the way she went after him during the debates I say that speaks to his character, that he's able to overlook personal grievances to do what's best for the country!
Biden is entering the ‚Äúracial jungle.‚Äù #KampalaHarris
Harris destroys the ticket. She‚Äôs a bigger joke than Biden. Farewell, Democrats!
Trump will win for sure. No one likes Kamala. She has already been rejected by her own party for President. Biden will have to step down for mental incompetence so she‚Äôs who they‚Äôre pushing to run the country.
Democratic Party said Bernie couldn‚Äôt win cause Trump would say he Radical Left...Now he doing it with Biden and Kamala lol....We tried to tell y‚Äôall that they would spew that regardless
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his VP running mate!
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
Looks like a Biden-Harris ticket!
I just thought you were quoting things you don‚Äôt like about Trump. You want to talk about Trump‚Äôs mental state but Biden is truly in the throes of an actual mental breakdown. We all know it. It‚Äôs sad.
Just like Joe Biden ‚Äúslipped‚Äù about Obama‚Äôs new view on gay marriage. Calculated.
Funny how you analyze every single word he says, looking for a mistake. Yet Joe Biden speaks nothing but mistakes and you ignore it completely. You people are a joke.
Exactly.  whiffed on the perfect set-up today when he didn‚Äôt zing her about the fact that Biden will need the questions prior to the debate!!
"1.2 billion. So you go ahead and you stack spaghetti sauce at a store‚Äî at at at a supermarket. You control the guy or the woman that runs the run run run‚Äî brings out the carts on a onaonaona on a forklift. What happens?!" -Joe Biden
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now ‚Äî those who can't find a job or pay the bills: Joe Biden‚Äôs party will do nothing for you. They need you suffering so that they can gain power‚Äî they will forget you as soon as they have your vote. Same as always.
While we are on POTUS candidates making sense, can you make sense of anything Hidin‚Äô Biden says?
What if Trump officiates some special marriages like Biden did?

Kamala Harris looks to be the choice for Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. She is showing how far left tactic. She is not someone in the middle. Not a great pick. You want a VP pick that is a moderate.

Pure racism
I spoke with an independent today who said he is undecided and the debates will probably make his decision for him.  He also stated if Biden wimps out his vote will go to Trump.  For millions of independents, the debates matter.
"What you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things." OMG. PLEASE MAKE IT STOP.
Nobody should be sending in ballots. Dems starting early on their fraud votes. They can't have Biden debate any1 Even if they try telling him what2say in a ear piece they know they can't control what comes out his mouth. All the bullshit going on is so they Don't have to debate.
