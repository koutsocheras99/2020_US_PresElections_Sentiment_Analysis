Do who have any evidence at all that anyone is going to vote for him? Who are the people that we assume are stupid enough to do this? Seems potential Trump supporters are more likely than Biden supporters.
So obv you‚Äôre an idiot but I‚Äôll engage. 1. Will never impact you (no 1 is proposing forced abortions for you) 2. Is made up Trumpian fantasy that all the ppl Biden beat are somehow now his puppet masters. Joe has been a mainstream Dem his whole career who shifts w party &amp; country
Joe Biden is not progressive leaning.
your ad demeans joe Biden‚Äôs faith a lifelong Catholic; u accuse him of being ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and wanting to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù. Sir, I assure that the Catholic faith is not against God nor in favor of hurting him. This is your most dispicable and hurtful utterance yet.
So I guess since the  is fine with accepting help from foreign entities, Biden should get in touch with China right away.
Biden Vows To Never Stop Fighting For Black Community After Questionable Remarks On Diversity
I'm not sure what Biden could possibly do to loose my suport, especially considering most anything the right comes up with is complete bullshit. The same applies to Russia propoganda.
I can't wait to vote for Joe Biden!
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?
The "Hill" is a pile of BS, and we all know it! Just like Joe Biden claiming he's a devote Catholic.  Right!
Biden should call upon our allies with the ability to do so,  to shut down foreign interference since Trump is currently not willing to
The current president abandoned the black vote months ago and started dog whistling to the Klan about heritage and history of slave owners and this guy is focused on a Biden slip up.
There's a difference between not having it and not being diagnosed yet (that came 5 years after leaving office). But some of the things you read are disturbing for such an important position.  And you do see some of that with Biden, but in fairness he's also always had this issue

BIDEN WAS NEVER WORTHY OF THE BLACK VOTE, ALL OF HIS 50 YEAR CAREER A RACIST.  VOTED AGAINST MINORITIES WITH  KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS.  GAVE THE EULOGY AT SENATOR ROBERT BYRD'S FUNERAL.  DEMOCRAT PARTY IS PARTY OF LYNCHING NEGROS.  REPUBLICANS FREED SLAVES.
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, Stone...  If Biden chooses Kamala he will win in a LANDSLIDE.üëç
If Biden keeps making these foolish comments about black people, he just might get some of those votes. Don't give this away Joe!
Even Rasmussen has Biden up by 3.
Donald Trump -- DONALD TRUMP (you know, the pathological liar with all the extramarital affairs) -- is questioning Joe Biden's faith.
Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines  It's not inconceivable that he would pick a woman that satisfies none of the various Democratic constituent groups but one only he relates to.
Pretty sure Biden doesn't need the Russians to make a complete fool of himself almost daily at this point. Race to the bottom this election.
This is bullshit! Biden is not seriously considering Karen Bass for VP. Someone submitted her name so he has to go through the motions because she is a black female. It was probably the Trump Campaign that secretly submitted her name in the first place.
BIDEN ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, HAS NORWEGIAN DEMENTIA PSYCHIATRIST CLAIM.  DIAGNOSED WITH ANEURYSM, HAD BRAIN SURGERIES.  PRIMARY RIGGED EXIT POLLS SHOWS FRAUD.  RACIST BIDEN SAID LATINOS ARE DIVERSE &amp; BLACKS ARE NOT.  DEMOCRATS WANT THIS RACIST MAN TO BE PRESIDENT
My contribution to the "Is the Race Tightening?" debate. Here's a 30 day moving avg using top quality nat'l polls (538 B or better grade). Biden's lead has shrunk by ~1% since it peaked in early July, but his margin's stabilized a couple points above early June with Biden at ~51%
Whew! That eliminates a lot of pressure!

Joe Biden is such a joke üòÇüòÇ
Biden has stood on numerous stages in the past year and debated a massive Democratic field.  Every single candidate makes mistakes. You can pour through hours of video and find ANYBODY getting lost in a thought or phrase or, god forbid, pausing to formulate a thought.
Have the media never seen  talk before? The thing that Biden has ALWAYS been is an off-the-cuff, extemporaneous speaker who sometimes doesn't say the "right" thing.  So no, it's not cognitive decline   et al. That's just Biden.
Trump got "black vote" trending knowing that liberals would say some racist shit in response to turn off black voters  Great play. If he actually was smart like that instead of pretending Biden is some sort of secret grandpa antifa agent he wouldnt be getting destroyed üòÇ
I am speechless...come on Joe. And yes this election 'Bout to be Long AF.
I‚Äôm not trying to argue with you, I just think that leftists who decide not to vote for Biden or use their deep red/blue state status to make a point aren‚Äôt ignorant or hateful the way you‚Äôre saying. Most of the people I‚Äôve talked to have weighed the decision carefully.
Yeah you don‚Äôt want Biden to take away your being black card
Biden is a staunch supporter did abortion, therefore, he is not a ‚Äúdevout Catholic‚Äù. Saying he is a devout Catholic is like saying a member of ISIS is a devout Muslim
On that same note, Biden has championed a LOT of disgusting legislation and is in general a shitty person, so others could take that farther and say that supporting him in any way is to align with fascists

Dude, I‚Äôm. Going for Biden and I agree with you totally!
And I am not a bot. I'm just someone that wants people to be educated and informed about the candidates, and it takes more than just my word. It takes research on everyone's part, we all have to know the candidates as best we can. Biden is just the better man for the job
Dear President Biden. Do not under any circumstance, pardon Donald Trump. Signed Karma
replacing red trump with a blue trump seriously risks ensuring we end up with something *worse* than trump in 2024.  Four years of no meaningful progress and president biden insulting people the way he does will erase the memory of Trump enough for R's to refurbish themselves.
The issue at hand is, who is better for the country to get us out of the crises we're in. At this point, Trump has proven himself incapable of taking control or even seeing that there are crises. Biden is the obvious choice because at least he has a plan and he acknowledges 2/
Especially when we actually know the Candidate FOR THE Democrats is in know way fit to be President &amp; the Majority of both Parties know it. Even Mail in Ballots as (crooked as they are) Could not help Biden.
Dems: Biden and Pelosi are devout Catholics, Trump is a heathen! Orange man bad!  Also Dems: *support abortion up to and even after birth*
No, Biden did not say that. He actually said if Trump is prosecuted for anything he won‚Äôt interfere. Tweet reported for posting bald-face lie about a presidential candidate.
Anything other than a reluctant vote for Biden is a vote for Trump unfortunately
Thank you!!!
It's uncool--"moderate" even--of me to agree with this, but he's right. I will add a caveat: there will be legitimate criticism from smart people against any pick, just as there has been legitimate criticism against Biden...
Its not to sell music it is to take votes from Biden for Trump

Plenty of Catholics support/have supported abortion in the past. Church teaching said a fetus didn‚Äôt have a soul until the ‚Äùquickening.‚Äù Anyway, we aren‚Äôt a Catholic nation, so even if Biden‚Äôs personal faith is against it, he shouldn‚Äôt push his faith‚Äôs doctrine on the rest of us.
Ask yourself if #HidenBiden is likely to do anything to roll back the regulatory state, or lower taxes, or appoint originalist judges, or work to secure the borders, or resist China's attempts to undermine our economy.  Biden has made his leftist intentions abundantly clear.
So, are you implying that Biden wouldn‚Äôt have beat Bernie if it weren‚Äôt for the media? We have 90 days and a pandemic, so I am inclined to give Biden time. But, I am a white female, so he just needs to be breathing to satisfy me this election. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There is NO doubt that if Biden is elected, Millions of law abiding citizens will become legislated felons! It has already happened in several states. Nearly every Democrat candidate pledged to ban guns &amp; even strive to end the 2A! Nothing like making 1/3 of population criminals!
I did hold my nose and vote for him over  but I would have voted for any GOP nominee over Obama.  Just like you should vote for any GOP nominee over Biden.
Please see my above tweets. Regardless of whether it is Trump or Biden in the White House, eventually the Tax Acts that are active will expire. Eventually, new relief acts will have to be written just as they were by Obama, George W, and somewhat by Trump.
Trump campaign has nothing real on Biden so they have to make it up:
No but he‚Äôll refuse to answer it and he‚Äôll spew lies, propaganda and hate comments about Biden so fast nobody can keep up.
Maybe but trying to see what kind of hoops he can get Biden or Obama to jump through is classic Donald Trump behavior.

Bernie Sanders is literally campaigning for Joe Biden yet liberals are still attacking him  In a middle of a pandemic and economic collapse that's their focus. Instead of hitting the phones they are attacking Bernie Sanders   These people are deeply unserious
Maybe Biden was right???
We love you president Biden
The only reason you say that is because Biden was Obama's VP and claim everything Obama did for the black community Biden did too. Obama didn't do anything for the black community, they only claim that he did because Obama was black.
Can't we do better than our own blue trump? Replace Joe biden at the convention with someone who isn't racist and demented. We don't have to walk off the cliff like this
No one believes him. Bullshit. Plain and simple. Quit giving Biden a pass because he slips up all the time. Grow a pair and understand that what you say can sometimes have consequences.
I live in a swing state and I am incredibly not voting for joe biden
Here is all you need to know about Biden‚Äôs values Vs Trump‚Äôs  Biden affairs 0 Trump affairs too many to count
Trump is full of shit   He's not anti war   This Afghanistan ploy is desperate move for his reelection   He dropped record amounts of bombs in Afghanistan   Even if he scales back troops, when Biden wins the military industrial complex will have their way

Can we get Joe Biden to just say as little as possible for the next 3 months?
Biden probably has no idea about this statement smh
Even my grandfather who had his own ridiculous beliefs regarding race and segregation would tell us even he knew what Biden meant. You can keep twisting though. Then try to defend Trump. üëçüèª
I actually grew up with republican parents. I had hoped Romney would win because Trump was such a buffoon. But if Biden winning means that all this crap stops, we get a gentleman in office and a VP who can SPELL VP!! and can return dignity. Let‚Äôs GO!
This is as big as Biden incinuating black people are on cocain, what are your thoughts on this and his declining ability to hold a conversation
Get a grip Michelle. The problem is you were used to being in control &amp; having your way for 8 years. Now your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter &amp; you have no control over President Trump &amp; Biden is your only option. Now that I think about it that low grade depression might be justified.
...is (are) a piece of shit. My list for today: The Obamas, Pelosi, Biden, The Bushes, The Clintons, All of the Pedos.
Biden, someone who is a great advocate of abortion, is not a man of faith. Let‚Äôs quit acting like there are many, if any, politicians that are true men/women of faith

CNN avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test #SmartNews
I'll check with a few hospitals and see if they accept "Joe Biden can pronounce words" as payment and get back to you.
I remember four years ago Donald Trump said he made the baby he may not. When you're in the lead in the polls you do what you want. You know how you know the polls aren't fake, all the Republicans are scared Joe Biden won't debate
trumps can spread any lies but we are voting Biden for president to bring ethics and class back to the White House.
If Biden's got that much power, then you should definitely vote for him!
Another fart out of Trump‚Äôs mouth: Biden is against guns. Listen to what Biden says: he supports the 2nd Amendment and wants to reduce gun violence. Who wouldn‚Äôt support that? Trump?

Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican
My mother told me yesterday that the best way to get progressive policies enacted was to elect Joe Biden.
No one is surprised this is bat-shit crazy. And #Trump's strategy of branding Biden a puppet of the "far left" will fail. What #Trump &amp; the GOP have peddled for 40 years is toxic fear -- of POC, immigrants, LGBTQ, liberals, strong women. #TrumpIsNotWell
Why can't Democrats offer a viable alternative to Biden?   They've wasted too much time already, it's too late.

Biden keeps saying racist stuff and the Main Street Media keep covering for him whilst lynching Kanye West, who said nothing untrue or that he doesn't believe. Double standard!
I'm sorry, but you can't use racism against Joe Biden, or claim that you're choosing Trump because Biden's racist. First of all, there's a difference between misunderstanding what someone means and someone saying something flat out racist. Trump IS A RACIST and a XENOPHOBE.
Oh my god that‚Äôs fucking hysterical. And people say Biden‚Äôs mind isn‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm dyingüòÇüòÇüòÇ He‚Äôs so desperate. That‚Äôs like something Jamm would say about Leslie Knope

CNN: Swing Voters Are Overwhelmingly Supporting Trump Over Biden
I don‚Äôt disagree with you. But the choice is easy if you ever want it to change. There is zero chance if Trump extends his dictatorship. We need a landslide victory to send him back to the hell he came from. Then we go after Biden and establishment dems to get what we deserve.
in 2018 majority of US voters, by population, voted democrats in to be the majority into the house. which aligns with biden. a majority of the US does align with biden policies even if they dont vote biden. red stated and trump won districts rejected the GOP in tons of districts
You really believe this? Trump has done more for minorities than any previous president.   Biden is out there making one racist gaffe after another. He helped write the 1994 crime bill which has incarcerated millions of African Americans. He is the real racist. Wake up, man!
I don't worship Trump, nor Biden ... I worship Jesus Christ. In my view, the Republican platform more closely matches my beliefs. In particular, the pro choice stance is a major issue for me. I'm also against socialized government ... and completely opposed to communism.
Finally a Biden position I can get behind.
I hate to say it, but any state Kanye gets on the ballet, i think will be an issue for Biden.
A vote for a third party is a vote that neither Trump or Biden gets.

Yep. He wants to beat Biden. And get the W for Trump. Because he knows he can manipulate the blacc vote enough cause Trump's only Presidential competition to fail.
Biden said he wanted to ban certain guns
You do have a choice what do you think is going to happen? HOWEVER, do voting is equivalent to voting for Trump! And yes we should ABSOLUTELY vote for Biden to get Trump out of office. Are you new?

I think that Biden is an airhead and all the VP candidates are better suited at the top of the ticket.  I'm still voting for him because Donnie has go.
Ironic that you accuse those who support the president as "cultists" yet you merely parrot hollow talking points from  because you can't support Biden on substance.  Real Republicans are actually capable of clearer thinking than that...
Now they are going to vote for a reality show star. Can you imagine the discussions they've had about having a Kardashian in the WH?  They need to do something to weaken the D/Biden support with young voters. This is a hail Mary. One of many they'll likely try.
They did while pushing racist, rapist, sexist Biden.
Joe Biden should fight Kanye if he thinks he can get away with all this slang he says
On another scroll through Twitter that Biden video reappeared, immediately before a video of Trump pronouncing Thailand as Thighland.... üôÑ
Excellent post. Thank you, Mr. Biden.
Serious question, if old ass Joe Biden can hurt your God, why are you worshiping him? Sounds like a weak ass God to me.....
According to  if you don't know who to vote for, #YouAintBlack. You just might be Latino...   #BidenGaffe #BidenIsARacist
Beto almost beat Cruz... it was within 2%, I believe, in 2018. If the voter turnout increases again (in favor of blue) then Texas could swing for Biden.
That's odd considering  has done more for freedom of religion and pro life than Obama, Clinton, or the Bushes. Biden does not seem to have learned from life's tragedies.
now circling back, I doubt trump can fix this mess. The extreme GOP is also enabling him, and support is slipping.  Biden isn‚Äôt no angel for us either, but I trust his policies he is proposing more than Trump
Exactly! Who is hurting God?! Biden? Hmmmmm.... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this is the man who couldn't name one bible verse saying biden is going to "hurt the bible".  girrrl, the bible you grabbed by the pussy for that photo op is still in pain.
Especially if it comes up in a debate. Trump won't be ready, because he has no fall back. Biden could forget, and fall back on his knowledge and life as a Catholic.
The President is right, Biden has failed to honor oaths made to God, the Catholic Church, and to the Nation in trust with God, he does attempt to "hurt" God by persecuting those who believe in Him, and by refusal to adopt policies which agree with life, and "you know the thing".
Can‚Äôt even imagine. The rally‚Äôs on twitter still get me excited. Biden just feels like politics as usual. Let‚Äôs hope he does his part and brings in some young blood in the cabinet.

If Biden‚Äôs mental fitness is an issue, the last 3 years of Trump more than outweigh anything Biden has said or done.

Joe Biden: 'Unlike the African American Community ... the Latino Community Is an Incredibly Diverse Community'
still voting Biden though. Sadly, no public education funding is a dealbreaker.
Biden didn't choose the candidate that was 4th place in her own state and had to drop out before Iowa?  Lmao, shocked
What an idiotic statement.  Joe Biden has integrity.  I know that's hard for you to understand, but most of us in America miss the days of integrity in the WH.  Certainly not the only reason I'll vote Joe, but the embarrassment in the WH now has to go.
Some of us just need to see if Biden can hold an intelligible conversation or if his Veep will overthrow him and run the Country.
Trump is talking to inbreeds when he says Biden is against God and guns.
I mean Joe Biden is a racist about what he said about the African American community.
Racist Biden: Blacks Are All the Same, Have No Diversity of Thought  via
President Trump supports policies that are in agreement with America's Constitutional trust in God, Biden never has.  Biden is not a man of "deep faith" nor even in alignment with the policies of the Catholic Church, let alone the Bible.   Biden lives this one verse, Romans 1:21!

Well that's not Biden because he's not historically unpopular. But anyway, sucks you don't like the candidate but apparently whoever you like didn't have enough people vote for them so by those standards they were even more "evil" so would be even shittier candidates and do worse
Biden hates God.
Two big differences: 1. This has been Biden‚Äôs average lead margins while it was the biggest margin HRC ended up having.  2. Biden is near 50% in most polls while HRC seldom broke 48%.
I wonder if your asked to do Interview  I would love to see you destroy those guys.  why don‚Äôt you ask Biden the tough questions to  or  Like did Bill hang out on Island with Epstein. Hey Joe why are you running? Truth
Better.  Now to the issue at hand.  I am bigly confident that this kind of police behavior will not change at all under the current administration.   Hence, my post. Biden himself may not do much,  but his VP and AG would help.
Fuck Biden and fuck Trump. Only things I agree with Biden is pro-choice and equal rights. Only thing I agree with Trump is we need to stop relying on other countries for stuff. They both not fit for president. Biden is unhealthy and Trump is a hater.

well when they see Biden can't stay focused over the period of time of the debate with many rambling answers it likely could change many votes.
Black Folks waiting to misread anything Biden says so they can have an excuse not to get off their Asses and Vote.
My prediction is that Biden chooses Susan Rice as VP. Has a great prior relationship with him and the Obamas. Lots of foreign policy experience. Neither too moderate for progressives or too progressive for moderates.
Trump is such a fucking idiot! Can‚Äôt even make an argument against Biden when he‚Äôs not even there! ‚ÄúHurt the Bible, hurt god‚Äù??? What is he even talking about?!
I will feel better once Biden consistently polls ahead of Trump and past the margin of error in Ohio.  Ohio is one of our most reliable bellwether states.
Thanks for the update, Jim! We the people who voted for him, like it! He doesn't take a salary from us taxpayers, and then break his oaths and promises, like Biden does.

This. Susan Rice is arguably more qualified and closer to Biden but you can‚Äôt have republicans bitching about Benghazi for 90 days. Put Rice as Secretary of State or Chief of staff.

also a reminder that biden agreed to rejoin the paris climate agreement and provide healthcare reform that would help with the climate change and virus issues that trump denies even exist
Is this the same Joe Biden that made over a 40 year career of policies that put thousands of Black Americans in prison? The same who has on multiple occasions tried to cut social security which a majority of Black Americans need? The one who's against reparations for ADOS?

Hilary you know Biden threw you down the steps
When do we get the Biden that Fox News is talking about?  I like this guy.So obv you‚Äôre an idiot but I‚Äôll engage. 1. Will never impact you (no 1 is proposing forced abortions for you) 2.

The "Hill" is a pile of BS, and we all know it! Just like Joe Biden claiming he's a devote Catholic.  Right!
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, Stone...  If Biden chooses Kamala he will win in a LANDSLIDE.üëç
This is bullshit! Biden is not seriously considering Karen Bass for VP. Someone submitted her name so he has to go through the motions because she is a black female. It was probably the Trump Campaign that secretly submitted her name in the first place.
Joe Biden is such a joke üòÇüòÇ
Were you paying attention during the Clarence Thomas hearings?  The way Biden treated Thomas was dispicable.
Plenty of Catholics support/have supported abortion in the past. Church teaching said a fetus didn‚Äôt have a soul until the ‚Äùquickening.‚Äù Anyway, we aren‚Äôt a Catholic nation, so even if Biden‚Äôs personal faith is against it, he shouldn‚Äôt push his faith‚Äôs doctrine on the rest of us.

Despite the fact that its not true and Biden will give the Republicans everything they want and then soon I find it funny that a supposedly all powerful and all knowing god can apparently be defeated by just not giving a shit about him
That's been the go to mantra of the right for decades. Bill Clinton was going to take all their guns. Then Obama was. then Hillary was. And they were already going to say the same about Biden, so it doesn't really change much.
Extra Credit- What has Joe Biden accomplished for America in 50 years in D.C.? (Anything pertaining to Obama doesn‚Äôt count)

"Moral Leadership" by DNC hacks? Hell, Biden has insulted Blacks, Hispanics and women just this past week.  Someone needs to get him some help, this is elder abuse at this point! #GruberLibs
After the election Biden will need to set up a separate, well staffed division in the Justice Dept (criminal &amp; civil) just to go after Trump &amp; his ilk for unprecedented crimes and profiteering to loot the US government &amp; its people. Will probably take over ten years to unravel.
This is great but Biden better not say, "It is time to move on"

That would be asking for trouble. Trump lies about literally everything. There would be no way to catch all and then some lies would be treated as true. And then they will nit pick at something that is subjective that Biden says and call it not true to both sides it. Just debate

Its hilarious how right-wing most of Biden's views are yet they're still trying to paint him as some uber communist progressive
I just RSVP‚Äôd for Jill Biden‚Äôs keynote speech at Gun Sense University. Join me and thousands of my friends from  this Sunday at 3:45pm ET!  #GSU2020
Biden would be better off marketing his campaign messages than a verbal spat with Trump. These aren't true debates.
"It'll go away, it's going away, things go away, absolutely." Similarly to Covid, Biden doesn't have to do much and the Trump virus spreads on its own.
Sean King, as a part Irish American, thank you for joining in on commentary concerning Biden behavior that needs to be checked.    How can this situation be made better - now?  Could have nominated Bernie then passed torch to so many other worthy Dem POC's in next few elections.
Not that they are trying to stack the deck against Biden in any way. . . .
Sounds like a good reason for Trump to refuse to debate. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to debate after some people have already voted. It would probably give Biden an advantage. Cancel the debates.
I don‚Äôt even know if Jesus Christ can save Biden

Joe Biden has no business running for President. He is a liar and quit trying to cover from him. And tell Acosta to get his bottle and pacifier.
Any takers on the bet that the DNC replaces Biden last minute?
You are a fool. Biden is a complete joke he is like a comic book to see so many people following him shows how the dumbing down of America is working
Biden confused cognitive decline with covid. For real.
I took it to mean Biden
Biden voted against 1964 Civil Rights Act. Supported Segregation . Public Servant 47 years . Done zilch for Black Communities. Wanna vote for him??

BS he‚Äôs running against Biden.

I really like Karen Bass. She has represented her district extremely well, and would bring a lot of pluses to the WH. VP Biden has many great choices.  "Bass surged up Biden‚Äôs VP list. Is she ready for the national stage?"
Jill Biden said in an interview with Fox News that ‚ÄúJoe is a moderate, not left or right.  It‚Äôs what he has always been.‚Äù  VP Biden has stated his administration will be the most progressive ever. These two statements seem incompatible.
Like Biden, we know that Bollier supports giving free healthcare to millions of people who are not US citizens. No thanks.
I find it odd when people say that Joe Biden has dementia and is not fit for office. This interview should have been called ‚Äúrantings of a paranoid idiot‚Äù. So states that vote Republican are good for mail in voting but ALL democratic states will cheat?
Kamala, but Biden could nominate a toad as his VP and I‚Äôd support it.
Their game?:  have Repubs register as Dems and vote for Kanye to take votes away from Biden. These are operatives.
Why are we sooo worried about Hunt Biden‚Äôs Ukraine dealings but the GOP doesn‚Äôt give two shots about the man sitting in the chair at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave with his fing finger on the ‚Äúbig‚Äù button?  And you know what button I‚Äôm talking about!!!

We have over 1000 people a day dying from opening up too damn early and your solution is to open up more? Just 6 months more of your stupidity and hopefully we can get this country back on track again. I'm no huge Biden fan, but anyone else besides Trump will be an improvementü§î
Lol.... it‚Äôs awesome! Great thread! Barr will influence Biden voters if he indicts and will negatively influence Trump voters if he doesn‚Äôt. Either way, he will influence it even thou he doesn‚Äôt want to
I keep hearing what a tough decision Joe Biden has in selecting a running mate. But, really, how difficult can it be to find someone better than Mike Pence? If the person's lips aren't attached to an ass's ass, voila!
you seem to think Biden has never undergone a Wallace interview...here‚Äôs one from 2020. Seems like a pretty normal interview when the interviewee isn‚Äôt a psychotic moron...
I don't take any comfort in the polls that say Biden is leading by small margins in key states. But THIS month- by-month continual downward trend in general satisfaction is SIGNIFICANT.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY Mr. President!! ‚ô•Ô∏è  Wishing you a wonderful year ahead. And, hopefully with a President Biden at the helm.
Biden's already said he'd do three debates.
Don‚Äôt forget if we elect Biden they‚Äôll be no hand sanitizer or toilet paper! Sigh
Man, Biden agreed to the debates back in June, but if he's having second thoughts, its probably because he's not the type to beat on the disabled
Where do they get this crap?
I guess that's because Basement-dweller Biden can't be trusted alone?
Yes,vote before Biden self destructs in the debates.
Does this mean Trump has already conceded the election to Joe Biden?
When was Hillary Clinton ever Joe Biden‚Äôs boss?
When was Joe Biden president? Never.

Big money people!!! That is all trump cares about. He put all of his big money friends in his administration. He cares more about money than his country.  Biden, Biden...Joe 2020
Thanks for the guidance you have shown and the empathy toward opening our schools nation wide...NOT! You couldn‚Äôt GAS how they are opened as long as you get elected. Well all I can say is Biden, Biden, Biden, Joe will get the job done with class and grace...Biden 2020
There is no reason for Biden to debate Trump. Trump has proven in past debate performances he will not answer direct questions, he will lie, obfuscate and insult his opponents. The election of a president should not force anyone to endure this type of abuse by Trump.
Do you trust the Biden campaign not to be next to him offering the answers to the questions?
Does Biden even know that there is a hurricane coming?
Six weeks democrats.  If you are so sure that Biden will win why would you want mail in ballots?
And also, the only reason you say this is because Biden is the nominee instead of Sanders.
Her only experience is riding on Willie Brown's back.  That's how she got her political jobs.  Plus ballot harvesting in Orange County made her a SenatorOn her own, she's been a disaster. Plus her nasty attack on Joe Biden bussing will surely stop her from jumping in as VP....
The point seems valid but the example does not prove it. Biden was never on the senate floor talking ‚Äòwith pride‚Äô about cutting social security and Medicare
The best suggestion I heard was to have debates but have Biden yield his time to Trump and let Trump just talk and destroy himself.
Thank God you tweeted a picture of Joe Biden so people knew who you were talking about #personwomanmancameratv #grabthembythepussy
Biden is a flat out coward if he can not debate Trump. If he can not debate Trump, he does not have the ability to be president. Plain and simple.

Biden said he would name his VP candidate during the first week of August. This is the beginning of the first week. There is no delay-it just seems that way because you‚Äôve been speculating about it for months.
Joe Biden is an avatar of the anarchist, Democrat party!
has held more press conferences about Covid-19 than Biden has hello press conferences since he announced his run for president.   Who's more qualified??
Biden needs to retire
Remember he can run again in 2024 if Biden beats him. He can campaign for 4 years. He can Tweet all sorts of batshit crazy ideas for 4 years. We are not close to over.

Presidential candidate Biden will make a VP selection soon. [If] he chooses Kamala Harris, who do you think he will nominate for AG?
My thoughts at first..... but he said a woman of color. Biden closed the door for an unknown transgender as candidate.
Trump Warns That 'Jobs Will Disappear' If Biden Is Elected. Jaws Drop.  #SmartNews  "says the guy who wiped out all of the job gains since the Great Recession."
As he said, the question was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù.  It‚Äôs an insulting question.  Why weren‚Äôt the VP candidates asked that question?  Better yet, why won‚Äôt Biden go on his show?  What is Biden afraid of? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I can not believe that Biden has narrowed his VP list to these three clowns
The only way this is possible is if Biden sniffed the candidates, picked the three who smelled the best, or picked out of a hat
If the economy hasn‚Äôt been fixed, then why hasn‚Äôt Joe Biden fixed it in 50 years?
Joe Biden says he is so close to naming his VP he can actually smell her....
It‚Äôs so important to study all aspects of the VP choice. Not only do they have to be ready to step in to the presidency, they have to be able to draw in more voters. Seal their state for Biden. Have as clean of a background as possible. And yeah, be tough.
You can‚Äôt so Biden willüòé
Photo OP for Biden and racists
trump supporters saying biden would be an embarrassing president really makes me question reality
I have met some real strange people here. A lot of one-way communication too. Had enough of that in my a fam. Yes the overconfidence with Biden is too much like last time. Ugh sh*t here we go again.
This is complete crap. Biden promised to pick a woman. He said nothing about race. One of the rumored front runners is not African American. Her father is Jamaican and her father is Indian.
why do republicans point out to leftists how Biden sucks like it's a gotcha moment. We are impenetrable to your attempts to prove anything, because we all already know Biden sucks. We just know Trump sucks more.Biden Staffers Contributed 20 mil to a Protester-Bailout Fund  via
What trump appointee is in charge of the FDA? I don't trust the safety of a vaccine until Biden's people say it's safe.
idk man Biden has appeared confused and delivered constant gaffes and it hasn't seemed to matter so far...
The presidential debates are terrifying; the cards are stacked against Biden. He must NOT ONCE appear confused or have a verbal gaffe. Trump can continue to display his constant inability to comprehend words or speak coherently and that's just Trump?
Is Biden gaffe-prone and says foolish, entitled crap? Yup. I read his Latinos comment as Dems taking black voters for granted. Should he be much more careful? Yup. Does perniciously racist, &amp; hate-mongering, privileged current president have any grounds to criticize Biden?! NO!
Okay. Two tweets. I‚Äôm a bad patient. The poll also shows Trump up 50-43 over Biden. And Trump only +3 on job approval in KS (48-45). All in the ballpark of the limited polling we‚Äôve seen so far this year in KS. We‚Äôll be a Trump state, but maybe not as strongly as 2016, I‚Äôd bet.
My favorite news program. It's worth staying up late to hear wit like his.
Media: We know Biden sucks but TRUMP IS HITLER.
Not sure who's the brainiac behind Trump's strategy in this. I think West's presence pulls at least as much from Trump as Biden.
Biden will soon show how lost he really is.
The media will have a conniption when Trump is awful in the debates but starts closing the gap in the polls with Biden.
The media has run a few kind of generic stories like this one. But they refuse to say what should be obvious. We're taking a significant risk electing a 78 year to their first term.
The lead story on  was Biden's dumb comment about Black Americans. They spent four minutes on it, including a montage of 15 years of Biden gaffes. "Nobody is watching Biden screwing up" (because of the pandemic). Has Trump ever not said dumb things every day?
The media refuses to acknowledge that age is an issue with Biden. I‚Äôve been called an ageist for even bringing it up on twitter.
Um, the whole Russia thing...made up. Obama, Biden, Rice, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, Comey, Strozck, Paige, and more...about to be in the news. Not in a good way.
no u, but yeah fuck Biden
I agree they‚Äôre bullshit. But they worked last time. Harris is my pick. I don‚Äôt think Biden will run for a second term given his age. She‚Äôd be able to pick that up after 4 years as VP.
lies. I'm not excited at all, screw Joe Biden
Yes, it was a boneheaded comment, but if the expectations for both candidates include not making boneheaded comments, I think Biden is going to be OK.
Klobuchar for Biden Nancy 2020 would be who I vote for
I mean, it does actually matter tho... quoting someone‚Äôs shitty words to make an impact to prove a point is different from saying the words themselves.   Also, I hate Biden so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre point is in bringing up shitty things he‚Äôs actually done.
I'll never vote Trump but Biden keeps trying to be funny and little bits of indecisiveness and lack of judgement are creeping in.  This is not the time to be stupid  We need you to step up not down.
If you mean we are more fucked if Trump wins a second term, agree.  But this is Biden‚Äôs stutter.  It‚Äôs not new to anyone.
Wow, Biden is more powerful than God (in Trump‚Äôs head).  Amazing.
I love how the Dems have spent months debating and picking their fave/least fave VP pick for Biden instead of having an actual primary after everyone decided we don't really need primaries and dropped out to give Biden the nomination.
I‚Äôve reached out to God for a comment regarding Trump‚Äôs assertion about Biden and He gave it 5 Pinocchios.
i can‚Äôt believe i have to vote for biden. we live in a hellscape.
I expected joe Biden to say dumb stuff and many more!
So is Biden going to kick God in the nuts or something? Maybe poke him in the eyehole?
Remind me who‚Äôs the president. Obama, Biden, or tRump?
Thighland‚Äôs Prime Minister has confirmed that Trump wanted dirt on Biden for official recognition from the US government.
If I was Biden, I would not Debate Trump. The truth is no where near his lips ! Truth
I would want NC and AZ because they seem the most conservative of the four. If they're trending towards Biden that tells us a lot about what's going to happen in states with bluer PVIs.
I mean, I see your point, Hillary was extremely hawkish, but some of the criticism against her was also based on Bill's decisions whereas Biden made these choices on his own as Senator and VP.  Biden is also older, has his dementia allegations, sexual assault reports, etc.
Biden had connections to segregationist senators.  He wrote what became the PATRIOT Act.  He previously had to drop out of campaigning because of a plagiarism scandal.  He opposes M4A in the middle of a pandemic. The only time we see or hear him is during cringe ads
ABSOLUTELY!
The Washington Post: Opinions | If Biden wins, the post-Trump corruption purge will have to be epic
How is Biden correct that black people lack cultural diversity?  Have you gotten so close to Biden that some of his dementia is rubbing off on you?
Please Biden put this piece of shit on the ticket.
That's absolutely true. I guess I've already had my reckoning with supporting Biden. And now I'm just anticipating doing the same w/ Harris. I'm also being (foolishly) hopeful that Harris can take a different path than Biden has.
Has there even been a presidential campaign with so little focus on policy?  Trump doesn't have an agenda outside of "I'm great and let's make America great again. Again."  And Biden? Can ANYBODY articulate his policy priorities? Joe sure can't. It's basically "Obama Part 2".
If Harris is the VP choice, and if Biden wins, I hope she can finally have an honest reckoning after the election about her criminal justice policy history. I still am a little bit grumpy about her self-portrayal as a progressive prosecutor. That's politics, though. ü§∑
Guiliani, in support of Trump, bashing Biden for his strange non-sequiturs and inability to utter coherent thoughts is the ultimate in irony, no?
Ok. I'll vote for Biden.
Biden should not debate.  He should listen to Mark Twain: ‚ÄúNever argue [debate with] a fool; onlookers may not be able to tell the difference,‚Äù i.e., who is who. And certainly never debate with a constant liar who‚Äôs lies will not be checked by the moderators.
pretty much the story of Lincoln project types reallyyyyy excited to make their "principled" Republican choice by voting for Biden haha
She says she has no desire for higher office and has indicated she will not seek the presidency, post Biden. I do not want a woman VP who doesn't have ambitions, beyond one's current position. IOW, she's not ambitious enough!
Joe Biden said, and I QUOTE, "you're not black if you don't vote for me"....you cannot be real
Let's start impeaching Biden, and his "Jane Doe" VP, now - just to be on the safe side. Of course expelling Pelosi simultaneously is a must, so might as well get that underway too!
It's the best Biden ad I've ever seen.
Hmm‚Ä¶ So, Joe Biden responds to a question about a test for cognitive decline by saying that's like asking someone to take a drug test. Who's gonna tell him that all the other people who work for the federal government do exactly that?  Like, has this guy ever had a real job?
A big difference people overlook between Hillary and Biden is that Biden isn‚Äôt unlikable.
2012 Biden has left the building.
You really think an east coast progressive (Warren) helps Biden more in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, N Carolina plus Arizona and Florida than Amy? I don't.
"The polls"  State polling is notoriously bad and unpredictive. The left is going to vote for Biden. Minorities will vote for Biden. To win he's going to have to appeal to swing voters in swing states. IMHO Amy would have been his best VP to do that.
I watched Scent of a Woman this week and I feel like there's a Biden joke hidden in there somewhere.

What did Warren decline in 2020? She ran until it became clear it was down to Biden v Bernie.
Not even remotely better than anyone.  The man has rapidly progressing dementia.  Expressing TDS is a scary reason to say Biden is even remotely able to execute the duties as President.
It‚Äôs so funny that kamala stans on here think it‚Äôd be a huge dub if joe biden picks her as vp. It‚Äôs like they think it means she got 2nd place in the primary, as opposed to say, never polling above 3% and then completely selling out
Trump negates all of Biden's worst tendencies.
That's what's fascinating about Trump v Biden. Most of the things that would normally make Biden unelectable still pale compared to what Trump does and says. So you just shrug them off now when Biden does them. The media sure ain't going to hold him accountable for these gaffes.
Not if they hold off charging him until AFTER Biden takes office.
He's 77. He's not going to get a handle on his temper.  But this is part of what makes the Biden v Trump matchup interesting. The types of things that would normally make Biden unelectable like this pale compared to Trump's personality issues. Trump negates all of this from Joe.
Agreed. I voted third party as a protest vote in 2016 because Trump and Hillary are terrible people who should never be president. And Biden might still force me to do this again depending on how things play out. But as of today I lean towards voting Biden.
Biden wins the WH by winning the electoral college. His best path to winning the EC is by winning swing voters (many are moderates) in swing states in the Midwest and Rust Belt. Amy absolutely helps him do that more than any progressive would.
Biden has never received the criticism he deserves for such a pandering position on picking a VP. From day one he should have said "We'll pick the best candidate for the job." And then if they pick a black woman, he can say it was the best person. Our news media is trash.
That was WAY cringey! Yikes!  He really should never be president, and yet I'm going to have to vote for him over Trump. Lord I hate these two parties for making me vote for Biden.
I agree with most of what you said here, except the final sentence. If Biden hadn't pandered his way into this VP box, Harris would STILL be among the top five contenders for the job. But probably wouldn't get it. I would have gone with Amy K if I was Biden.
Biden is going to end up picking her as VP (mostly because they've pandered themselves into a box where Harris is their only choice). And she's going to do fine.
Biden insiders are doing everything they can to find an alternative to Harris, but there isn't one. They've pandered their way into a tiny box. Harris is their only legit option. She will be the pick. And I've been saying this for months.  Amy K would have been the wiser choice.
just saw a tweet that said ‚Äòis it me or does Joe Biden seem queer?‚Äô might be time to publicly support homophobia
After the Garland nomination failed (older moderate didn't succeed) and Trump really emphasized youth in his overall judicial nominations, I think 56 is going to be too old for Biden to nominate a judge to SCOTUS.
You must be a top phone banker for Biden and #BlueMAGA "democrats"  "Hey vote for this person, who opposes all you believe in?  No?  IDIOT" &lt;blocks number&gt;
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Tucker Carlson Claims It's 'Probably Illegal' For Biden To Consider Only Black Women For His VP
Why do I see all these stories about what the GOP might do if RBG retires? She's. Not. Going. To. Retire. Before. Biden. Takes. Office.
Biden ran for president before Obama picked him as VP. I don‚Äôt recall anyone telling Obama Biden was ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù to be a good VP candidate...
"Tucker Carlson: In Biden's hunt for a VP Susan Rice takes the lead ‚Äì and she's a threat" via FOX NEWS
My gut feeling for 2020.   Minnesota was winnable with a good economy. Putting into the D column for this reason.   Trump basically conceded NV. Solid blue.   Wisconsin is labeled blue by experts, I see it as a tossup.   16 possibilities for Biden. 5 for Trump.  23-35% Trump win.
Basically, if Trump wins the electoral college but Biden wins popular - Biden will call on his electorates in Wisconsin &amp; Michigan to go to the House. Regardless of the votes.  In their wargame, Biden wins traditionally or Biden will strongarm win.
Biden should never even sniff the White House (see what I did there?) but he's likely going to be POTUS because he's running against Trump, who is a truly awful person, a moron on policy, and a terrible, terrible president.  Deserve is a relative term. And I'm voting for Biden.
Mr. Stephen is RIGHT, We want to see how old and crazy Biden is.
Bill Kristol got the Biden memo to push the 'no debates' narrative.   You can see them trying to shift the Overton window in real time.  Will the public accept an *unprecedented* no-debate showing by Biden?
I think the PSA guys are right. Anyone who cares that much about Benghazi is very unlikely to vote for Biden. Especially since she had nothing to do with it. Any of the people listed have pros/cons but any of them would also be a great VP.
I got a good feeling that Susan Rice will be Biden's VP. Good value on Rice right now at +300 on
Joe Biden has more likes on his response to this tweet than your actual tweet got. You are so screwed.
To be fair, they are likely concerned with Biden evoking memories Clint Eastwood's RNC speech to an empty chair. Dementia is really hard to conceal on live TV.
I think Trump has made a strategic error by lowering the bar so much for Biden, who basically just needs to show up and be semi-coherent to get over that bar.  I don't want either of these guys to be president. But I will indeed cringe and vote for Biden over Trump every day.
Biden just has to show up and appear moderately competent. Trump has created a low bar for Biden to cross.
The Washington Post: Politics &amp; Power | Shirley Chisholm blazed the way for every Black woman Biden is considering for VP
The 2020 election is principally about mail-in ballots, voter fraud in key counties.  If the Biden team has infrastructure (Union workers counting votes, etc), they can easily pull of a win.   Biden doesn't need more people to elect him in the Electoral College  Just more votes.
But she is wrong. Biden will win. Trump will say stupid shit. But the transfer of power will be just fine.
Biden up because of more polls.  So I told my people ‚Äòlet‚Äôs have fewer polls.‚Äô
Some really crappy takes on VP.  Best take?  STFU and wait for Biden.
Clinton Aide suggests Biden NOT debate Trump.   We all saw this coming.   The framing started with the NYT oped "Biden Should Not Debate Trump Unless" setting impossible conditions and framing the possibility in the public mind.   Debates aren't happening
Bass is 66 years old. She's been in Congress since 2011. And her excuse for praising Castro in 2016 was that she didn't know better? LOL  I can't believe Biden is considering putting a Karen on his ticket as VP. Karen's are the worst.
It‚Äôs going to be Harris. And the longer Biden delays this decision, the harder it will be for  to rally around the pick.   #leadership

Since the research evidence is pretty overwhelming that VPs don't help presidential nominees, and given that Biden will be in his 80s for much of his presidency, hard not to select "best skills to govern."
But what is the likelihood of a candidate other than Biden winning against Trump in this election? I understand the moral disincentive to vote for him, but we‚Äôre also voting for who will decide the replacements for Betsy DeVos, William Barr, Jerome Adams, etc.

If they'll say that a Democrat who explicitly denounced an actual Marxist live on stage, and on video, is "for Joe Biden" and "the Marxist Socialist agenda," then nothing matters  Wonder if  notices this. At all.

I said early on she ran in the wrong lane. She was never going to win over progressives compared to Warren and Sanders. She was inauthentic as a progressive. She should have run against Biden in the more moderate / old school liberal lane. It was largely a strategic mistake.
Under the rug? He closed the borders Jan 3 and Biden called him a racist , the CDC and WHO said that as well. You tell me how he tried sweeping it under the rug.
Not a black Woman in sight. None of the Black women want to be Biden's Slave.
Biden built himself into a tiny box with his pandering. This is his fault. Nobody else's.  And having said that, Harris is a very decent choice. They are over-thinking this.
It's still gonna be Harris. Many in Biden's circle don't want her. They keep looking for a better choice. There isn't one.   Actually. There is. Amy K. But her skin is the wrong color.
That's how Joe Biden tweets!
1. Trump is a moron.  2. I can‚Äôt believe that Biden hasn‚Äôt taken ANY heat from the press for limiting his choices only to black women. Why not a Latino woman? Or a minority man (Booker or Castro)?   He SHOULD be saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pick THE best person!‚Äù And then pick a black woman.
It feels like they‚Äôre looking for a public reason to oppose Harris, and that‚Äôs become ‚Äúshe‚Äôs too ambitious‚Äù and ‚Äúshe won‚Äôt be loyal to Biden‚Äù. Which is all hogwash. They don‚Äôt like her and believe she‚Äôll hurt the ticket (past as prosecutor).

I'm so confused as to why her being ambitious is bad. Biden is 77 years old, one term is all he needs and then hand it off to a competent AMBITIOUS Vice President.
Can you elaborate... I listed joe Biden evil and you completely ignored it.
A child pedo? A person who jailed all types of minorities? ( 1993 ) crime bill. What did trump do that was so evil? When people say lesser than two evils, they Have to realize joe Biden have been a politican for over 40 years with no change.
Bill Clinton! Hilary Clinton Obama and joe Biden!! Let the sheep know!
People that support biden don‚Äôt watch his debates. I know for a fact.
joe biden is FAR from the ideal candidate. i am aware of that and agree with that. but ANYONE is better than trump. there are so many more problems with trump than there are with biden. open your eyes
But Biden will be President in name-only Josh. He's "old and not all there". The real puppetmasters will be the Bernie Sanders/BLM/Pelosi (she's so progressive....) cabal. Don't you listen to 1440 anymore?
Here‚Äôs my prediction of next week:  Biden: ‚Äúmy vp is Kamala‚Äù  Trump: ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a cop! ACAB!‚Äù
Biden Believes the Virus will get him elected.
Benghazi and Biden and Rice and Obama.
And DEMs won't be able to help themselves. They will stuff TONS of pet projects into the "stimulus" bill. But they'll get it passed and Biden will sign it. The vote will be purely on party lines. Maybe a few nervous DEMs will defect. 5/
Let's play out what happens if the DEMs dump the filibuster.  The scenario is this. Biden wins (I think likely). And DEMs win a small majority in the Senate (definitely possible).   DEMs still can't pass "meaningful" legislation. Their agenda is largely shutdown. 1/
Republicans:  Herman Cain, dead after attending Trump rally.  Ari Fleischer, Henry Olsen &amp; "Trump War Room", who slammed Biden for saying Trump would try to delay the election.  Trump destroys everything he touches -- including your lives, careers &amp; reputations. Save yourselves.
Kamala Harris called out Joe Biden for actions that he took while in the Senate that had a direct racist implications on her life as a young black girl and yet it‚Äôs HER that‚Äôs supposed to make nice?
So....I thought you said you were beating Biden in the best polls? I‚Äôm sorry bub but there will be no delay come November 3rd. I think you just made your own case that you‚Äôre unfit for office and a wee bit scared that you‚Äôre losing #bigly. #Trumphaslosthisgotdamnmind

That there's little meaningful difference between Trump blowing by the exit at 90 mph whereas Biden is going to miss it while doing 55 in the left lane doesn't seem to register with these people.
Biden can't get distracted by the 100s of other things that Trump has done wrong. He needs to focus on the U.S.'s relative failure to handle COVID-19 when compared to every other nation. Discussing issues like troops in Germany, the suburbs, or Portland plays into Trump's hands.

Biden isn't going to be around forever. We need someone who is ambitious to take over.
This article says "But the reality is that Mr. Trump has far more pathways to 270 electoral votes without Michigan than Mr. Biden does. " Playing around with 270towin, Biden has 76 paths without MI, Trump has 37 paths without MI.
"Whatever you do, it is paramount to keep down-ticket races in mind," opinion columnist  said. "Turnout isn‚Äôt just about the presidential election."
Trump morons trying to drag Biden for his speech is the height of irony.Do who have any evidence at all that anyone is going to vote for him? Who are the people that we assume are stupid enough to do this? Seems potential Trump supporters are more likely than Biden supporters.
Joe Biden is not progressive leaning.
your ad demeans joe Biden‚Äôs faith a lifelong Catholic; u accuse him of being ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and wanting to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù. Sir, I assure that the Catholic faith is not against God nor in favor of hurting him. This is your most dispicable and hurtful utterance yet.

I can't wait to vote for Joe Biden!
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?
Biden should call upon our allies with the ability to do so,  to shut down foreign interference since Trump is currently not willing to
The current president abandoned the black vote months ago and started dog whistling to the Klan about heritage and history of slave owners and this guy is focused on a Biden slip up.

BIDEN WAS NEVER WORTHY OF THE BLACK VOTE, ALL OF HIS 50 YEAR CAREER A RACIST.  VOTED AGAINST MINORITIES WITH  KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS.  GAVE THE EULOGY AT SENATOR ROBERT BYRD'S FUNERAL.  DEMOCRAT PARTY IS PARTY OF LYNCHING NEGROS.  REPUBLICANS FREED SLAVES.
Even Rasmussen has Biden up by 3.

Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines  It's not inconceivable that he would pick a woman that satisfies none of the various Democratic constituent groups but one only he relates to.
Pretty sure Biden doesn't need the Russians to make a complete fool of himself almost daily at this point. Race to the bottom this election.
BIDEN ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, HAS NORWEGIAN DEMENTIA PSYCHIATRIST CLAIM.  DIAGNOSED WITH ANEURYSM, HAD BRAIN SURGERIES.  PRIMARY RIGGED EXIT POLLS SHOWS FRAUD.  RACIST BIDEN SAID LATINOS ARE DIVERSE &amp; BLACKS ARE NOT.  DEMOCRATS WANT THIS RACIST MAN TO BE PRESIDENT
My contribution to the "Is the Race Tightening?" debate. Here's a 30 day moving avg using top quality nat'l polls (538 B or better grade). Biden's lead has shrunk by ~1% since it peaked in early July, but his margin's stabilized a couple points above early June with Biden at ~51%
Whew! That eliminates a lot of pressure!
Bernie was a likely lock until candidates dropped out and supported biden.  You cant predict that with polling
WASHINGTON (AP) - US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
No matter how you spin what Biden says, it will never be as bad as what spews from Trumps mouth all day, every day

Well being a Past Democrat I don't see how voting for a Person that outright dislikes Blacks like Biden does is a better choice. Not to mention looking at these Democrat run cities that now look like 3rd World Countries. Not 1 Democrat voted for a Tax break for workers NOT ONE!
on CNN, you said you didn't think the LA party goers on the news lately were Republicans... Why is that? Because they were primarily Black? Because there was gunfire? Odd that Biden is being demonized for saying what I think you just said
Amid reports Republican and Trump-affiliated operatives are trying to get Kanye West onto various state ballots for November‚Äôs presidential election, Kanye admits he isn't really running to be president for real. It's solely to siphon votes from Biden.

Maybe Biden will come out of his basement.
What's funny is there's no way the reporter can follow up to allow Biden to clarify, because they are terrified he would make it even worse.   And no reporter wants to get the blame for torpedoing Biden's chances.
Biden has stood on numerous stages in the past year and debated a massive Democratic field.  Every single candidate makes mistakes. You can pour through hours of video and find ANYBODY getting lost in a thought or phrase or, god forbid, pausing to formulate a thought.
Have the media never seen  talk before? The thing that Biden has ALWAYS been is an off-the-cuff, extemporaneous speaker who sometimes doesn't say the "right" thing.  So no, it's not cognitive decline   et al. That's just Biden.
Trump got "black vote" trending knowing that liberals would say some racist shit in response to turn off black voters  Great play. If he actually was smart like that instead of pretending Biden is some sort of secret grandpa antifa agent he wouldnt be getting destroyed üòÇ
I am speechless...come on Joe. And yes this election 'Bout to be Long AF.
I‚Äôm not trying to argue with you, I just think that leftists who decide not to vote for Biden or use their deep red/blue state status to make a point aren‚Äôt ignorant or hateful the way you‚Äôre saying. Most of the people I‚Äôve talked to have weighed the decision carefully.
Yeah you don‚Äôt want Biden to take away your being black card
Biden is a staunch supporter did abortion, therefore, he is not a ‚Äúdevout Catholic‚Äù. Saying he is a devout Catholic is like saying a member of ISIS is a devout Muslim
On that same note, Biden has championed a LOT of disgusting legislation and is in general a shitty person, so others could take that farther and say that supporting him in any way is to align with fascists
Today, on Unintended Consequence Theater, Petulant Man-baby and High King Dumbass  makes a mortal enemy of every single e-sports player and fan in the US.  To win the 18-35 demographic, Biden need only promise to ease off of Tencent.

Joe Biden honoured Robert Byrd.
Dude, I‚Äôm. Going for Biden and I agree with you totally!
And I am not a bot. I'm just someone that wants people to be educated and informed about the candidates, and it takes more than just my word. It takes research on everyone's part, we all have to know the candidates as best we can. Biden is just the better man for the job
Dear President Biden. Do not under any circumstance, pardon Donald Trump. Signed Karma
replacing red trump with a blue trump seriously risks ensuring we end up with something *worse* than trump in 2024.  Four years of no meaningful progress and president biden insulting people the way he does will erase the memory of Trump enough for R's to refurbish themselves.
The issue at hand is, who is better for the country to get us out of the crises we're in. At this point, Trump has proven himself incapable of taking control or even seeing that there are crises. Biden is the obvious choice because at least he has a plan and he acknowledges 2/
Especially when we actually know the Candidate FOR THE Democrats is in know way fit to be President &amp; the Majority of both Parties know it. Even Mail in Ballots as (crooked as they are) Could not help Biden.
Dems: Biden and Pelosi are devout Catholics, Trump is a heathen! Orange man bad!  Also Dems: *support abortion up to and even after birth*
No, Biden did not say that. He actually said if Trump is prosecuted for anything he won‚Äôt interfere. Tweet reported for posting bald-face lie about a presidential candidate.
Anything other than a reluctant vote for Biden is a vote for Trump unfortunately
Thank you!!!
It's uncool--"moderate" even--of me to agree with this, but he's right. I will add a caveat: there will be legitimate criticism from smart people against any pick, just as there has been legitimate criticism against Biden...
Its not to sell music it is to take votes from Biden for Trump
Joe Biden is still in the lab, putting the final touches on the vice presidential candidate.
Were you paying attention during the Clarence Thomas hearings?  The way Biden treated Thomas was dispicable.
Biden for 2020. He won't gas your grandma.
Now replace Joe Biden with Donald Trump
Plenty of Catholics support/have supported abortion in the past. Church teaching said a fetus didn‚Äôt have a soul until the ‚Äùquickening.‚Äù Anyway, we aren‚Äôt a Catholic nation, so even if Biden‚Äôs personal faith is against it, he shouldn‚Äôt push his faith‚Äôs doctrine on the rest of us.
Can you tell your uncle and his daughterWife(which is really creepy the way he acts around her)to just give up? Resign? Walk away? Take McConnell, Pelosi, and Biden in tow and allow The USA to right itself, kick covid19s ass, and move on from this 4 year dark age nightmare?
Ask yourself if #HidenBiden is likely to do anything to roll back the regulatory state, or lower taxes, or appoint originalist judges, or work to secure the borders, or resist China's attempts to undermine our economy.  Biden has made his leftist intentions abundantly clear.
Oh shut up. These are Biden oatmeal brain concerns ONLY. What could possible be the excuse for cancelling these things when it‚Äôs 3 ppl: 2 candidates and a moderator? They literally could all be 60 feet apart!

There is NO doubt that if Biden is elected, Millions of law abiding citizens will become legislated felons! It has already happened in several states. Nearly every Democrat candidate pledged to ban guns &amp; even strive to end the 2A! Nothing like making 1/3 of population criminals!
I did hold my nose and vote for him over  but I would have voted for any GOP nominee over Obama.  Just like you should vote for any GOP nominee over Biden.
Please see my above tweets. Regardless of whether it is Trump or Biden in the White House, eventually the Tax Acts that are active will expire. Eventually, new relief acts will have to be written just as they were by Obama, George W, and somewhat by Trump.
No but he‚Äôll refuse to answer it and he‚Äôll spew lies, propaganda and hate comments about Biden so fast nobody can keep up.
Maybe but trying to see what kind of hoops he can get Biden or Obama to jump through is classic Donald Trump behavior.

Right. He‚Äôs just testing to see if he can manipulate Biden.
Trump's debating is a force of bullshit. If I were Biden I would stipulate beforehand that Trump must discuss actual policy issues in a mature way or the debate is over.

Donald Trump is also a nightmare horror. It's incredible that not only is the only thing demd can offer against him now as bad as biden, but that bill clinton enticed him into running in the first place thinking he'd be an easy opponent

This is by far the best vote Biden stance I've seen   I won't, but can't get mad at the reasoning here
Joe Biden has my VOTE.
I would argue that Biden would be worse on immigration, afterall the administration he took part in deported the most. Biden already said he wants to give police more funding. He's against #m4a, he's against Marijuana, he's against against #gnd.  I'm not voting for him.
And Biden will win Nov 3
Shorter Biden: I didn't mean all blacks act and think the same way yesterday when I said they lack diversity. And again a few weeks ago when I said they should all vote the same way. And again when I said black students shouldn't be integrated with whites. Help me out, Kamala.

There is quite a difference In leveling accusations of racism, which Dems do to Trump constantly and pointing out real racist comments. I hate to break it to you but your monoculture comment is a racist one just like Biden‚Äôs comments were.

Based on polling data  Joe Biden is set to do worse with African Americans than any Democratic nominee in decades   Since the Democratic Party embraced a racist Dixiecrat, do you think this is a beginning of a trend?
No one with any sense concerns themselves that much with Biden's VP pick. Biden knows what a VP can and should be. He can be trusted to choose wisely.
Debates don't scare Biden... Trump has a much more serious issue than he's let on. "Frontotemporal Dementia" is a cognitive dysfunction disorder that has some very unique and interesting side effects, behaviors and physical issues
Weird how Joe Biden has never had an abortion or entered into a marriage with a man! Practicing one‚Äôs own faith and legislating it into public policy for everyone including people who don‚Äôt believe the same things as you are two different things.

President Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden.

Can't we do better than our own blue trump? Replace Joe biden at the convention with someone who isn't racist and demented. We don't have to walk off the cliff like this

Here is all you need to know about Biden‚Äôs values Vs Trump‚Äôs  Biden affairs 0 Trump affairs too many to count
Trump is full of shit   He's not anti war   This Afghanistan ploy is desperate move for his reelection   He dropped record amounts of bombs in Afghanistan   Even if he scales back troops, when Biden wins the military industrial complex will have their way
Joe Biden is going to kill God? What is he, a teenaged hero from a Japanese RPG?
Partial list of people for whom I would vote, if selected by Biden as VP candidate:  1) Kamala Harris 2) Liz Warren 3) Susan Rice 4) Karen Bass 5) Lance Bass 6) Joey Fatone 7) The "Joey" Concrete Blonde was singing about. 8) Blondie  9) Roger Staubach 10) Any Cowboys Cheerleader

Get a grip Michelle. The problem is you were used to being in control &amp; having your way for 8 years. Now your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter &amp; you have no control over President Trump &amp; Biden is your only option. Now that I think about it that low grade depression might be justified.

trumps can spread any lies but we are voting Biden for president to bring ethics and class back to the White House.
If Biden's got that much power, then you should definitely vote for him!

I'm sorry, but you can't use racism against Joe Biden, or claim that you're choosing Trump because Biden's racist. First of all, there's a difference between misunderstanding what someone means and someone saying something flat out racist. Trump IS A RACIST and a XENOPHOBE.

CNN: Swing Voters Are Overwhelmingly Supporting Trump Over Biden
I don‚Äôt disagree with you. But the choice is easy if you ever want it to change. There is zero chance if Trump extends his dictatorship. We need a landslide victory to send him back to the hell he came from. Then we go after Biden and establishment dems to get what we deserve.
in 2018 majority of US voters, by population, voted democrats in to be the majority into the house. which aligns with biden. a majority of the US does align with biden policies even if they dont vote biden. red stated and trump won districts rejected the GOP in tons of districts
You really believe this? Trump has done more for minorities than any previous president.   Biden is out there making one racist gaffe after another. He helped write the 1994 crime bill which has incarcerated millions of African Americans. He is the real racist. Wake up, man!
I don't worship Trump, nor Biden ... I worship Jesus Christ. In my view, the Republican platform more closely matches my beliefs. In particular, the pro choice stance is a major issue for me. I'm also against socialized government ... and completely opposed to communism.
Finally a Biden position I can get behind.
I hate to say it, but any state Kanye gets on the ballet, i think will be an issue for Biden.

I think that Biden is an airhead and all the VP candidates are better suited at the top of the ticket.  I'm still voting for him because Donnie has go.
Ironic that you accuse those who support the president as "cultists" yet you merely parrot hollow talking points from  because you can't support Biden on substance.  Real Republicans are actually capable of clearer thinking than that...
Now they are going to vote for a reality show star. Can you imagine the discussions they've had about having a Kardashian in the WH?  They need to do something to weaken the D/Biden support with young voters. This is a hail Mary. One of many they'll likely try.
They did while pushing racist, rapist, sexist Biden.
On another scroll through Twitter that Biden video reappeared, immediately before a video of Trump pronouncing Thailand as Thighland.... üôÑ
Excellent post. Thank you, Mr. Biden.
Serious question, if old ass Joe Biden can hurt your God, why are you worshiping him? Sounds like a weak ass God to me.....

Beto almost beat Cruz... it was within 2%, I believe, in 2018. If the voter turnout increases again (in favor of blue) then Texas could swing for Biden.
now circling back, I doubt trump can fix this mess. The extreme GOP is also enabling him, and support is slipping.  Biden isn‚Äôt no angel for us either, but I trust his policies he is proposing more than Trump
this is the man who couldn't name one bible verse saying biden is going to "hurt the bible".  girrrl, the bible you grabbed by the pussy for that photo op is still in pain.
Especially if it comes up in a debate. Trump won't be ready, because he has no fall back. Biden could forget, and fall back on his knowledge and life as a Catholic.
Can‚Äôt even imagine. The rally‚Äôs on twitter still get me excited. Biden just feels like politics as usual. Let‚Äôs hope he does his part and brings in some young blood in the cabinet.

What an idiotic statement.  Joe Biden has integrity.  I know that's hard for you to understand, but most of us in America miss the days of integrity in the WH.  Certainly not the only reason I'll vote Joe, but the embarrassment in the WH now has to go.

Well that's not Biden because he's not historically unpopular. But anyway, sucks you don't like the candidate but apparently whoever you like didn't have enough people vote for them so by those standards they were even more "evil" so would be even shittier candidates and do worse
Two big differences: 1. This has been Biden‚Äôs average lead margins while it was the biggest margin HRC ended up having.  2. Biden is near 50% in most polls while HRC seldom broke 48%.
Better.  Now to the issue at hand.  I am bigly confident that this kind of police behavior will not change at all under the current administration.   Hence, my post. Biden himself may not do much,  but his VP and AG would help.
Fuck Biden and fuck Trump. Only things I agree with Biden is pro-choice and equal rights. Only thing I agree with Trump is we need to stop relying on other countries for stuff. They both not fit for president. Biden is unhealthy and Trump is a hater.
well when they see Biden can't stay focused over the period of time of the debate with many rambling answers it likely could change many votes.
Black Folks waiting to misread anything Biden says so they can have an excuse not to get off their Asses and Vote.
My prediction is that Biden chooses Susan Rice as VP. Has a great prior relationship with him and the Obamas. Lots of foreign policy experience. Neither too moderate for progressives or too progressive for moderates.
Trump is such a fucking idiot! Can‚Äôt even make an argument against Biden when he‚Äôs not even there! ‚ÄúHurt the Bible, hurt god‚Äù??? What is he even talking about?!
I will feel better once Biden consistently polls ahead of Trump and past the margin of error in Ohio.  Ohio is one of our most reliable bellwether states.

Yeah, obviously this election is not the time. I‚Äôm not one of those I‚Äôm not voting for Biden types. But, we need change. We need a party that listens to the majority of the American people - young people.

Trumps god is Trump.   And there‚Äôs an easy Biden ad here people:
Trump‚Äôs god is Trump. And damn right Biden will hurt him.
Short version - Trump‚Äôs god is Trump, and Biden will harm him in November
Is this the same Joe Biden that made over a 40 year career of policies that put thousands of Black Americans in prison? The same who has on multiple occasions tried to cut social security which a majority of Black Americans need? The one who's against reparations for ADOS?
Funny that  just wrote that Biden is doing better than Clinton at her peak, and in particular out performing her in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Yep.  Can‚Äôt call yourself the ‚Äúlaw and order candidate‚Äù then bash Biden‚Äôs awful track record there.
You may not like it but A. Biden can be influenced by progressives that push him. B.  His platform is the most progressive democratic platform of any GE nominee. And C. he‚Äôs likely going to be a 1 term president. So consider it a bridge presidency away from pure evil.
Yeah. They stopped polling Bernie vs Trump when he dropped out.   Historically Biden did better in polls in purple states than Bernie. Bernie was very close if not under in many.   That‚Äôs a huge gamble when a Trump second term is on the line.

It's always on the third party canidate who is "stealing" votes, but it's never up the D or R to go out and try and earn  them. Biden is obviously in mental decline, said he would veto medicare for all during the same pandemic. We're screwed either way.
I would be disappointed but Biden will get my vote regardless. #Biden2020
Biden is for redirecting police funds!
No. They didn‚Äôt. I kept watch on the polls. There were several purple states where Bernie was consistently behind Trump while Biden was ahead. There were plenty of Blue collar unions in those states that wanted Biden to win but would have pushed for Trump if Bernie was the nom.Biden bros
Russia is denigrating Biden and we are supposed to believe that Trump has ‚Äúno ties‚Äù to Russia even if it‚Äôs just through his Family/Close advisors?

Joe Biden‚Äôs Statement on Faith. Like so many people, my faith has been‚Ä¶ | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
What I just gave you was literally Biden's stance from the primary. It's weird, because the "Biden wants to abolish charter schools" is a debunked claim made by Trump.
"After serving in an administration that promoted charter schools, former Vice President Joe Biden walks a fine line on the topic. He has said he‚Äôs opposed to for-profit charter schools, saying "it siphons off money for our public schools, which are already in enough trouble."
FAIR: As Biden Mulls VP Pick, Pundits Vie for Most Substance-Free Forecast -
There is a difference between charter schools and for profit charter schools. Biden is against for profit charter schools...which is about 10% of charter schools.
Wait, are we calling Yang and his UBI campaign "moderate?" Biden is about as center left as you get.
Romans 4:20...And the Lord hath a glass jaw. Let not the Biden striketh him.
Here's the deal; if Biden gets something wrong, he corrects it. If he misspeaks, he doesn‚Äôt claim he's still right. He listens to his staff &amp; takes advice from reliable people. He vale‚Äôs diversity &amp; their opinions. Joe listens, he thinks, he's honest &amp; he cares about us, his fam.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I don‚Äôt think anyone who would vote for Kanye was seriously going to vote for Biden.
That‚Äôs all you have to do to beat Donnie lmao shut up and stay hidden and trump will do the leg work. People will vote for Biden just because he‚Äôs not trump.

Let‚Äôs correct this - Trump will continue to condone abuses of power and racism systemic in the majority of law enforcement departments whereas Biden will listen to the movement of the majority of Americans asking for police reform and cleaning house of racists within their ranks!

Sometime soon, Joe Biden will choose his Vice Presidential running mate. His shortlist contains very impressive and exciting talent that‚Äîregardless of his pick‚Äîwill play a key role in the future of his administration, the Democratic Party, and the country.That seems to be exact reason it's presented as it is, especially considering trump &amp; his campaign have already been trying to tie Biden to China. Interestingly Xi himself said he prefers trump as Dems care about ethics (&amp; trump has handed China wins on Hong Kong, WHO, &amp; trade).
Don't believe the bit about China for one minute. Ratcliffe is simply trying to hand ammo to trump to use against Biden. Xi has already said he prefers trump because Dems care about things like ethics &amp; trump is transactional (he's already handed China wins w/Hong Kong &amp; WHO).
Joe Biden is still so much better than your outwardly, in your face prejudice! #Biden2020Landslide

Think long term, far beyond Biden. The next president could possibly nominate up to three Supreme Court justices. On a court that is (arguably) equally divided, any side that gets to pick secures the advantage for at least 10-15 years. We have a DACA decision coming, Roe v. Wade
Yelling this statement does not make it true.  Neither does not addressing Mr Biden‚Äôs statements because other Americans want to know your rebuttal as well Mr Trump. This is how my children act, ignoring statements they don‚Äôt want to answer, grow up...
You can thank Bill Clinton and Obama for that.  They were the ones that signed the trade deals that gave foreign countries all our manufacturing.  They also increased taxes on American Companies.  Same tax rates that Joe Biden wants to use.  Biden means death.
Oh it looks like Ted has scared those guys.  Good God.  Let‚Äôs make this last through the election and people will be so pissed off Biden won‚Äôt stand a chance.
(meaning i am considering between voting third party and biden, thus be alright with biden losing, which i'm not sure i am)
but the reason i'm undecided is that i'm weighing the negative change with trump with the stagnation of biden; i'm not so sure i can take another four years of maga chuds. (2/2)
i'm a leftist who is undecided, but i'll tell you that i think most leftists (including myself) think that voting for biden will just elongate the politics that gave us trump, and that the moderate dnc platform won't really give us effective change. (1/2)
I‚Äôm with you - totally sucks.  The hardest thing to hear - and argue with - is ‚ÄòA vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äô.   Horrible but probably true -
They only pointed out that VP Biden is Catholic.  They made no implication that they are Catholic. As a Catholic who used to be Southern Baptist, I will occasionally say services instead of mass so chill.

Funny the o lot dirt you can dig up on Biden is a cspan video from 1993. All you gotta do to see this kinda nonsense from Trump is to look at his twitter posts from yesterday. Stop comparing two pieces of shit, thinking one piece of shit is better than the other. It‚Äôs foolish.
It‚Äôs hilarious how people are more focused on the President and his mispronunciations of a word yet are silent about the fact that every single lie they‚Äôve spoken about Donald Trump and his motives is what Biden ACTUALLY is. This impending judgment is turning into a good tv show!
If the ORANGE P.O.S. gave his cult a steamy pile of shit &amp; told you it was the cure for the virus you people would eat that shit up no pun intended! Now he's saying Biden wants to hurt GOD! YES GOD! you know who talks like this a CRAZY PERSON! Your wannabe pres. I A CRAZY PERSON
Why would Biden want to debate someone who can‚Äôt even read?
Biden really said the second one yesterday I CANNOT find it anywhere on twitter! If you think social media isnt covering stuff up you‚Äôre wrong and idk how you can still vote for Biden that shit is RACIST!

Hahaha. Are you living in America? They don't let Biden got away with racist remarks you said? Please come back again!
I am not sure what you are talking about but we are talking about Joe Biden and his racist remarks.  He just made another one today! He doesn't think we the blacks can come together as one but he believes Hispanics communities are.
Joe Biden does not want any Debates.  People will see the cognitive capacity loss.  Near Alzheimer Conditions?
Black people are not a monolith, which is why I think the Biden video is so problematic.
"polling shows Biden's support with younger Black voters trailing significantly behind that of older Black voters... polls show the majority of young Black voters support Biden over President Donald Trump, many are unenthusiastic at best or hesitant"
Joe Biden is TRASH! Donald Trump is TRASH! We fucked up as a country.

If Joe Biden simply stands there and answers every question, "Well, I'd certainly do better than this muther f* here!" Would he be penalized for that? Cause, that's the honest truth right there.
But can Joe Biden tell us all what covfefe means????
Show me a pic of Trump going to a church service, other than a wedding or funeral -- never seen one, and doubt any exist.  Trump is the Anti-christ, not Biden.

If he went public, we would have a hard time distinguishing him from Trump. You know,  senile dementia,  verbal gaffes, opposes universal healthcare, opposes legal pot, allegations of sexual assault  lies about educational achievements. Maybe Biden should pick Trump for his VP.
If the Trump vs Biden debate were a Pay-Per-View I would buy it in a second.
That is pretty harsh Elizabeth I have seen about 3 different videos of Biden interviews and I felt the same way and I am black. Even just yesterday my and my friends were talking about it so I think you are being judgmental by not facing Bidens interviews remarks.
Truth? Did you watch the CBS interview yesterday? How about today? Biden said Black people have no diversity! So do you not read or do you not care about the Truth?
The race isn‚Äôt tightening, that narrative is absurd. Biden‚Äôs lead is steady at an average of 7 to 9 points.
So iow Joe Biden is more powerful in his sleep than the average mortal? Sounds like it's time to put him in charge!
No it doesn‚Äôt it.  The Biden campaign should be feeling it by now.

Praying in church what a scandel something trump has never done i think this ad actually helps Biden more than trump looks like it backfired.
it's WRONG to have a trump supporter on to campaign and repeat attacks on VP Biden under the false guise of being just a random CEO. Allowing partisan lies with zero pushback helps spread disinfo and hurts our democracy.

Hope this is the mind changing issue that results in Black Voters voting for Republicans. Vote R√©publican and Trump will stabilize your community in short order. Vote Democrat and Biden has already said he will reallocate police budgets; and then you are on your own for 4 years.
Late night thoughts before bed...  - Why haven‚Äôt Trump and Biden debated or is that not a thing?   - Why hasn‚Äôt Biden announced a VP with elections only 3 months away.  Genuinely curious.

Well, now we have proof that CV19 causes severe brain damage.  Igor and Fusilli, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, so sorry for your loss.
I‚Äôm ok with agreeing to disagree here, but Biden has literally used the N-word on the congressional floor. And just recently, he said ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you have to think about who to choose between him and Trump, which is actually super racist
The point I‚Äôm making is that anyone who votes for Biden surrenders all right to call Trump supporters racists and pedophiles when more proof of the same exists for Joe Biden
Sure, and I don‚Äôt think Trump‚Äôs a good human being either. I was discussing this with someone earlier, I‚Äôm just tired of being gaslit and called a racist for voting for Trump, knowing there is more proof that Biden is racist and I‚Äôm called racist by people who will vote for Biden
There is something definitely wrong with Joe Biden. I can‚Äôt help but wonder who controls him....
BBC News - Coronavirus: Three Biden claims about Trump fact-checked
If you think Biden is "extreme" then you are hilariously uninformed. The Democratic establishment is moderate in its views when compared to other developed nations. Biden is literally the middle of the road. To say he is in any way equivalent to Trump has no basis in reality.
Feels as though Biden is the Trojan horse for the Dems. If Biden were to win the approaching election his running mate will become President once Biden is investigated/deemed mentally unfit to serve.

I‚Äôm not sure there will be any debates. If so, parameters will be set strictly to benefit Biden at all costs. It actually would stir up more angst among Dems if he doesn‚Äôt debate after this commitment to do so.

It's too late.  The election is over.  More than a million counterfeit ballots have already been printed, "signed", and distributed to the proper counties.  The election is a Biden victory by a margin of 54 Electoral votes, and 2,000,000 popular votes

If you're trashing Biden at this point I'm blocking you. We've got the Tasmanian Devil in the White House and we need to rally behind Biden. We can hold his feet to the fire when he‚Äôs elected and believe me, I plan to.
It's impossible to have a debate.  Biden can't string two sentences together.  And the Democrats have no intention of letting him be President.  Even if "elected", they will replace him with a black woman and Nancy Pelosi within 6 months.
It was only a matter of time.  The Biden campaign really can‚Äôt afford to let Joe off the leash.
Biden can't put two sentences together.  The Dems will never let him stay in office if he ever gets there.  Personally, I think Joe Biden should run for basement, not President.

Probably the most gutless thing I‚Äôve heard. If he is too weak to debate  then slow Joe is going to get destroyed when he goes toe to toe with Xi, Putin or any other world leader. Truth is Biden can‚Äôt make whole sentences. He‚Äôs worse than Clinton in 2016.
One month of minimal time on social media and it was great. Going to keep this rolling. Trump sucks. Biden sucks. Masks suck. But we‚Äôre rolling on. Bigger things to do in life than join in the commiseration for the sake of it.

Biden should just name his entire cabinet before he is elected.   Then we will all know he will have smart, educated, "people first"  cabinet members who can get our country back on track.
Funny, he didn't say anything when VP Biden was being mocked by trump's campaign &amp; administration for wearing a mask. He's stayed quiet over the same people mocking Biden for social distancing &amp; not holding rallies. Guess he's lying about praising 'anyone.'
This idiot will believe anything.
Considering how ineffective Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúprime‚Äù was, only 90% of ...THAT... is unacceptable. You‚Äôre right about his character though. His opportunistic, delusive, perverted ways have not changed in nearly 50 years of being in public office and they will not change. Ever.
There you go. Deflection. You refuse to acknowledge trumps association with Epstein, or his well wishes to Maxwell. Even after i acknowledge bidens terrible language. And again, you're the big pedo supporter. You dont see me campaigning for Biden. You're disgusting.
But yet...you're the big trump supporter. TRUMP 2020! On your page. Care to point out all my support of biden? Ill wait.
Incredible deflections. Could you produce more biden video? Last i checked, he isnt in office. Our level of testing has nothing to do with trump. How are you going to praise his job during the pandemic, and then put all the blame on governors? Absolute clown.

If only you would act Presidential, accept responsibility and treat all people equally and civilly I would vote for you. Biden is a poor option but I can no longer support you.
I would guess that there quite likely would be a job for Vindman in the Biden administration, if he is interested. He represents the kind of people we would want working in our government.

Of course we can. Bye Bye Biden. You wouldn't even last an 8 year run. You haven't even picked your VP &amp; the vote is in 3 months!! You don't have your shit together. You need another applesauce &amp; nap grandpa.
I wasn't paying attention and that Biden commercial sounded a lot like a Trump commercial....   Yeah the country screwed.
Biden will NOT defund the Police! You are GUILTY of using scare tactics trying to make people believe the Police will be defunded if you‚Äôre not president! As usual it‚Äôs another lie of yours!
In an ideal world? I'd like to see Biden carry Kansas. Its a long shot, given historical patterns, but I think its in the realm of possibility. Reducing the spread to single digits would be surprising, flipping Kansas would be shocking. KS-04 flipping would be a nice bonus.

Ha, 12 people showed up. Biden will own you in Florida.
I didn't vote for Clinton, I don't know what this has to do with this election.  And no, Biden does not have a DNA rape case on hold or DOZENS of actual lawsuits.  He's not on tape talking about grabbing pussy.
The polls weren‚Äôt wrong. They had Clinton with a steady +3 lead, she won by that much, technically. They just didn‚Äôt account for swing voters in the states that flipped. This year, the margins Biden us leading by in those states is outside of MoE.
Is Biden looking into picking Governor Cuomo as his running mate?
He deleted it, but  suggested that Biden nominate a reality TV personality to be his running mate, and suggested The Situation as a possibility.  Not so far-fetched as you might think: The Situation already has some national security experience . . .
If you had run against Barack Obama, you would not have stood a chance, you freak!  Barack Obama is so powerful, you are about to lose to his second-in-command.  If Joe Biden had not lost his son, and had run for president, you would still be cheating people in NYC.  173 days.

That's been the go to mantra of the right for decades. Bill Clinton was going to take all their guns. Then Obama was. then Hillary was. And they were already going to say the same about Biden, so it doesn't really change much.

What has Joe Biden done for America in 40 years without looking anything up?
I actually grew up with republican parents. I had hoped Romney would win because Trump was such a buffoon. But if Biden winning means that all this crap stops, we get a gentleman in office and a VP who can SPELL VP!! and can return dignity. Let‚Äôs GO!
Biden keeps saying racist stuff and the Main Street Media keep covering for him whilst lynching Kanye West, who said nothing untrue or that he doesn't believe. Double standard!
He didn‚Äôt even write it. If this were the president, everyone would be on his ass. But when Biden apologizes, everyone forgives him immediately. Please stick to football man.
Potential Biden Presidency?
All liberals incoming to save Biden.
Joe Biden should fight Kanye if he thinks he can get away with all this slang he says
Exactly! Who is hurting God?! Biden? Hmmmmm.... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What did Biden say today?
Are you serious? So just to clarify...if you don‚Äôt like the VP pick you refuse to vote for Biden aka, democracy, justice, integrity, compassion and competence?? Any of the women are totally qualified. What‚Äôs your end game here?
I mean Joe Biden is a racist about what he said about the African American community.
What is wrong with us?  If Biden is really having health issues why are his handlers allowing him to be denigrated, brunt of jokes and ridiculed? Surely something can be done about this.  Politics be damned.  I will be voting for Trump and praying for Biden.
"(Biden has) lived it with dignity his entire life, and it's been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship," campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.
So is Biden a demented fool cringing in his basement or a behemoth monster who has the capacity to hurt god? ü§î #TrumpIsALaughingStock
If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be president. Plain and simple.
An Jesus even save Biden?
2020 has been Kobe, COVID and cancelled. 2021 will be Biden, Vaccine and Bring it back.
Now, THIS is desperation and also complete crap. Biden is a devout Catholic. As far as I can tell, Trump practices no religion at all.
Funny that  just wrote that Biden is doing better than Clinton at her peak, and in particular out performing her in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
If your God is named Donald Trump then I suppose Joe Biden is against him.
Biden is for redirecting police funds!
Nope. Trump is far worse at confusion than Biden will ever be or ever has been. No comparison.
No one really wants Biden to win they‚Äôre just desperate for Trump to lose. Huge difference. It‚Äôs hard to rally behind a candidate no one truly believes in so all the energy is being thrown at attacking any threatening opposition
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I hope the Biden vs. God match is two out of three falls.
Biden won‚Äôt stop there! He‚Äôll be going after the tooth fairy and Easter bunny.
I went out on 810 some time ago.  Too much negativity.  So does Anderson remind you of Biden?  Sounds like it
... drinks. He forgot to say ‚Äúdrinks‚Äù. Biden is against Red Bull, Monster etc.
Despite the fact that its not true and Biden will give the Republicans everything they want and then soon I find it funny that a supposedly all powerful and all knowing god can apparently be defeated by just not giving a shit about him
I always figured Biden was against the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object to do work.
If Joe Biden can hurt God then I'm pretty sure it won't matter which way you vote anyway. I mean, you think a dude who can fuck God up is going to respect the vote?
That's been the go to mantra of the right for decades. Bill Clinton was going to take all their guns. Then Obama was. then Hillary was. And they were already going to say the same about Biden, so it doesn't really change much.

Serious question- Has Joe Biden been to church as of late or are they still closed?
He‚Äôs trying every evil angle to discredit Joe Biden but it just makes him look more pathetic and desperate.
"Moral Leadership" by DNC hacks? Hell, Biden has insulted Blacks, Hispanics and women just this past week.  Someone needs to get him some help, this is elder abuse at this point! #GruberLibs
This is great but Biden better not say, "It is time to move on"
I wish Biden was this cool
Joe biden literally makes people become worse versions of themselves simply by existing and putting an onus on them to defend him as nominee
Nice try. Trying to make everyone forget about Joe Biden and his mistakes and lack of leader ship. New York just keeps screwing up
I'm a Bernie girl and don't care for Biden, but I don't think Biden was being racist. The Latino community is diverse because of our backgrounds. Not all Latinos come from one place. our ancestors come from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, all the way down to South America.
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
Maybe she is voting for Jo Jorgensen. That is the most rational choice. Biden is senile and Trump is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Trump apparently is not a war monger but the idea of Biden with the nuclear football is truly frightening.
That would be asking for trouble. Trump lies about literally everything. There would be no way to catch all and then some lies would be treated as true. And then they will nit pick at something that is subjective that Biden says and call it not true to both sides it. Just debate

Folks are just getting to comfortable with speaking.  And you know who you are.  Virginia mayor who said Joe Biden picked Aunt Jemima as VP faces calls to resign
Not gonna lie. No nominating conventions is kind of a good result of the pandemic, in my book.
Big year for Deleware.   #Royals relocate there and the Biden basement White House
Blog King Alert: In the event he loses the election, President Donald Trump is threatening to use ‚Äôemergency power‚Äô to stay in the White House; mainly because he has no ambition to ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù transfer authority to Joe Biden. For the report, visit:
How can all of these people ignore Biden clearly being a pedophile. Oh yeah I forgot they are stupid enough to be manipulated by the media. üòÖüòÖüòÖ

Yeah, let‚Äôs go vote for 77 year old, Joe Biden!
Get ready for Biden to declare we must move on from the past and forget Trump ever existed.
59 percent of people are totally fine with giving Joe Biden a one way ticket to the presidency when Joe has done absolutely nothing.
These are considerable points unless October surprise is gonna happen; Biden will beat Trump, says historian who predicted every race since 1984  #OctoberSurprise
Bad take comrade. Hopefully Biden doesn't adopt this nonsense. You definitely should not tax unrealized gains. You want a property tax on stocks???

This is great we will have 47 press conferences tomorrow:                      Joe Biden‚Äôs a loser, Mail in voting is a fraud, Kanye west and his wife are good people and on and on and on.
This is a great commercial.  Joe Biden is so likeable and down to earth.  Can you imagine Trump trying to do a commercial like this?ü§£
I‚Äôm scared to death Biden is going to fuck this up. He needs to be isolated in quarantine. Stay off social channels. Decline media requests. Let Donald bury himself. #holdingmybreath
I‚Äôm confused. In one tweet you say Biden spent 47 years in Washington and accomplished nothing. In the next tweet you give him credit for destroying jobs, moving factories overseas and negotiating China‚Äôs entry into WTO. Which is it - he‚Äôs done nothing or lots of bad things?
Like shit I WISH Biden was trying to defund the policy or implement M4A
Its hilarious how right-wing most of Biden's views are yet they're still trying to paint him as some uber communist progressive
Biden said we could train coal miners to Code.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have issues, the US has an issue.  Biden is simply doing his best to make sure the issue doesn‚Äôt go home with his supporters by going to a speech in a crowded arena.  Know who doesn‚Äôt care is his supporters catch a potentially deadly virus so he can ego masturbate?
This is Biden. His administration will be perfectly capable of multitasking.
I just RSVP‚Äôd for Jill Biden‚Äôs keynote speech at Gun Sense University. Join me and thousands of my friends from  this Sunday at 3:45pm ET!  #GSU2020
Biden would be better off marketing his campaign messages than a verbal spat with Trump. These aren't true debates.
"It'll go away, it's going away, things go away, absolutely." Similarly to Covid, Biden doesn't have to do much and the Trump virus spreads on its own.
Sean King, as a part Irish American, thank you for joining in on commentary concerning Biden behavior that needs to be checked.    How can this situation be made better - now?  Could have nominated Bernie then passed torch to so many other worthy Dem POC's in next few elections.
Not that they are trying to stack the deck against Biden in any way. . . .
Sounds like a good reason for Trump to refuse to debate. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to debate after some people have already voted. It would probably give Biden an advantage. Cancel the debates.
I don‚Äôt even know if Jesus Christ can save Biden
DJ jr making fun of Biden stumbling on his words exemplifies the extent to which DJ jr has inherited his self-awareness (and stupidity and denial) from his father

Joe Biden has no business running for President. He is a liar and quit trying to cover from him. And tell Acosta to get his bottle and pacifier.
If you want me to vote for your guy have him offer a single bite of policy to the left. Universal health care/m4a is my single issue. If biden wants my vote, he can say he supports it. That he refuses to, shows he doesn't want it.
Any takers on the bet that the DNC replaces Biden last minute?
You are a fool. Biden is a complete joke he is like a comic book to see so many people following him shows how the dumbing down of America is working
Exactly why the hell would he.  The test would prove conclusively that he has mental issues.  It is telling that Democrats actually still support  Biden as their candidate.  The world is upside down and we are caught in the vortex that the Left has created.
Biden confused cognitive decline with covid. For real.
I took it to mean Biden
I thought he told reporters that he was tested all the time, Jill Biden on Tuesday said he was tested. He‚Äôs lying or he literally can‚Äôt remember.
Video of Politico reporters running to twitter after a Biden interview to twist themselves into pretzels to faux outrage over a Biden comment to turn this into a real horse race
Biden agreed to holding three debates months ago. Trump has not agreed to any.
BS he‚Äôs running against Biden.
Jill Biden said in an interview with Fox News that ‚ÄúJoe is a moderate, not left or right.  It‚Äôs what he has always been.‚Äù  VP Biden has stated his administration will be the most progressive ever. These two statements seem incompatible.
Like Biden, we know that Bollier supports giving free healthcare to millions of people who are not US citizens. No thanks.
I‚Äôm not normally one to get political on here, and I‚Äôm not really one to support Biden either for that matter. That being said, Trump is a fucking lunatic.
I find it odd when people say that Joe Biden has dementia and is not fit for office. This interview should have been called ‚Äúrantings of a paranoid idiot‚Äù. So states that vote Republican are good for mail in voting but ALL democratic states will cheat?
Kamala, but Biden could nominate a toad as his VP and I‚Äôd support it.
Their game?:  have Repubs register as Dems and vote for Kanye to take votes away from Biden. These are operatives.
Why are we sooo worried about Hunt Biden‚Äôs Ukraine dealings but the GOP doesn‚Äôt give two shots about the man sitting in the chair at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave with his fing finger on the ‚Äúbig‚Äù button?  And you know what button I‚Äôm talking about!!!

We have over 1000 people a day dying from opening up too damn early and your solution is to open up more? Just 6 months more of your stupidity and hopefully we can get this country back on track again. I'm no huge Biden fan, but anyone else besides Trump will be an improvementü§î
Lol.... it‚Äôs awesome! Great thread! Barr will influence Biden voters if he indicts and will negatively influence Trump voters if he doesn‚Äôt. Either way, he will influence it even thou he doesn‚Äôt want to
I keep hearing what a tough decision Joe Biden has in selecting a running mate. But, really, how difficult can it be to find someone better than Mike Pence? If the person's lips aren't attached to an ass's ass, voila!
you seem to think Biden has never undergone a Wallace interview...here‚Äôs one from 2020. Seems like a pretty normal interview when the interviewee isn‚Äôt a psychotic moron...

yes, we must do everything in our power to support Biden and get him elected. but can we also talk about his belt choice here?

Biden's already said he'd do three debates.
Don‚Äôt forget if we elect Biden they‚Äôll be no hand sanitizer or toilet paper! Sigh
Man, Biden agreed to the debates back in June, but if he's having second thoughts, its probably because he's not the type to beat on the disabled
Where do they get this crap?
GOP are the cowards here. Biden would mop the floor with Trump and everyone knows it. Trump would go off the rails and make him and the GOP look even worse. STOP pushing that narrative. GOP is getting killed in polls and this is all YOU GOT......LOL
I guess that's because Basement-dweller Biden can't be trusted alone?
There's a real danger that Republicans will refuse to sign up for mail-in voting and then use their own low participation rate as a basis for challenging Biden's victory.
Yes,vote before Biden self destructs in the debates.
Does this mean Trump has already conceded the election to Joe Biden?

The Biden Basement Strategy Backfires
There is no reason for Biden to debate Trump. Trump has proven in past debate performances he will not answer direct questions, he will lie, obfuscate and insult his opponents. The election of a president should not force anyone to endure this type of abuse by Trump.
U.S. effectively in a war with China, just not kinetic (yet?). Political crisis appears likely with a choice of Trump or a brain addled Biden. Unsure how many hyperinflation events involved the world's reserve currency, but Zimbabwe and South Am nations don't pass that test.
Do you trust the Biden campaign not to be next to him offering the answers to the questions?
Does Biden even know that there is a hurricane coming?
Six weeks democrats.  If you are so sure that Biden will win why would you want mail in ballots?
And also, the only reason you say this is because Biden is the nominee instead of Sanders.

Her only experience is riding on Willie Brown's back.  That's how she got her political jobs.  Plus ballot harvesting in Orange County made her a SenatorOn her own, she's been a disaster. Plus her nasty attack on Joe Biden bussing will surely stop her from jumping in as VP....
The point seems valid but the example does not prove it. Biden was never on the senate floor talking ‚Äòwith pride‚Äô about cutting social security and Medicare
The best suggestion I heard was to have debates but have Biden yield his time to Trump and let Trump just talk and destroy himself.
Thank God you tweeted a picture of Joe Biden so people knew who you were talking about #personwomanmancameratv #grabthembythepussy
Biden is a flat out coward if he can not debate Trump. If he can not debate Trump, he does not have the ability to be president. Plain and simple.

People who vote for third party candidates have no interest in a one sided argument. They don‚Äôt care how much you hate Trump or how much better you think Clinton/Biden will be. Neither arouse the change those voters want. A vote for a third party is not a vote for Trump
Hillary was running away with it until she fainted on September 11, 2016. Random events can change everything overnight. Must keep consolidating and extending Biden's lead. Focus on Trump's failure to handle the virus, his failure to support his own doctors.

Biden said he would name his VP candidate during the first week of August. This is the beginning of the first week. There is no delay-it just seems that way because you‚Äôve been speculating about it for months.
Joe Biden is an avatar of the anarchist, Democrat party!
has held more press conferences about Covid-19 than Biden has hello press conferences since he announced his run for president.   Who's more qualified??

If you were a never Trumper you would do everything you could to not get him re-elected. You have 2 choices; vote for Biden and beat Trump or don‚Äôt vote for Biden and help Trump win. But I‚Äôll say it again, there are no good republicans. Always party over country. So GFYS!
I don't have IG, but how many negative hashtags is Joe Biden's account actually posting?
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden , including if you don‚Äôt vote, you are voting for Trump. It‚Äôs that simple.
How can he hear he wants to get out when he admits Biden never said that?
You mean Joe Biden. Mr. Touchy Feely
Take stock in Joe Biden - he kept his promise on stocks
He won't keep the office, just the building.   Once Biden is inaugurated, the Presidency is his.  He may have to operate out of temporary offices, but he will still be President.
Um wrong again!! Mr president Biden‚Äôs plans will improve our economy plus we are still 6.6 trillion dollars in debt because you refuse to tax big corporations and the rich
So when should Biden pick her?  Before or after she eats her bowl of sh*t?
I trust Biden‚Äôs decision. However, I don‚Äôt trust the majority white male journalists not to do a Hillary Clinton style hit job on Biden‚Äôs pick.
"I'm not a pedophile I'm just voting for one." The right can say the same shit about the left. I don't get why we continue to rip Trump like Biden is any better. Both are horrible individuals that SHOULDN'T even be running for president.
So are you ready to jump in the race to help your party? I‚Äôm sure you can handle losing 3 times. Twice to Trump. Nobody will go for the Biden/Harris ticket tho. Only you can save the day. You need to do it before your court date on Sept.9th tho.

In all fairness the guy I‚Äôm voting for did pronounce Yosemite, yosemight. But as far as cognitive decline is concerned Biden wins hands down. I do admire your faith we will maintain our Republic though.

Debate Joe Biden. Being in public, whether debating or crowds, is very much in your favor, Mr. President. Go out there and say hi to America and force Joe out of his basement. You don't need to crush him. Just bring him into the sun light.
‚ÄúWell Trump is racist and sexist‚Äù, I will match you point for point why Biden is legitimately racist and a creep. It just really blows my mind that someone would vote for him.

Why would Biden supporters appear to see you.
That isn't proof. That is YOUR leftist bias. Generic insults, no facts, Alinsky-ish attitude. A true leftist sheeple. That you're touting Biden, who doesn't know who/where he is along with a slag who got her promotions by screwing a man 2x her age says more about your 'values'.
As do all Christian Conservatives,we love our country and culture, unlike you,Trump isn‚Äôt a Dictator the Dictators are who the liberal socialist Democratic Party in America support ! China Iran Venezuela Cuba pure pig vomit! Biden, AOC,Talib, Omar, these are the lousiest!

the fact that you think daddy is less of a threat then Biden is priceless
Don't worry... Biden will
Isn‚Äôt that the truth, Hidin‚Äô Biden, he will raise the corporate taxes, capital gains,bring the Obama mandate back, Paris Peace Agreement, Iran Nuclear Deal, WHO, kill Fracking, the Pipe Lines, Clean coal, kill the Tariffs on China and try to get out of the Debates. China Joe,Sad.

Breaking: Sen Harris is going to be selected as the VP choice for Biden!
Let's say some foreign information meant to damage Biden comes out. It will most definitely be some innocuous normal scandal that would barely make a blip in government circles but this administration will make it out to be the biggest political scandal ever. Don't fall for it.

Then do what the Obama/Biden team did. Quit testing!!
Exactly, Biden should go away!
You promise to repeal and replace all you did was repeal so that makes you worse than Biden or any other former presidential official ever in the world. Mr. Comrade mashed potato head Trump

Unless they do mail in‚Äôs. Then Biden might have a million billion
Is Biden speaking at the funeral today? Is he even there?
shows how ignorant he truly is every time he calls it the "China Virus". What a mess this dick is leaving for Biden to clean up!
POTUS already planting the seeds of contesting the election if he loses. This is why we have to make sure Biden wins by an overwhelming margin so there is zero doubt who the people have elected.
I‚Äôm sure it helps Biden that he‚Äôs been involved in something like this before. They passed along a playbook and a team of people to Trump administration it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for Biden to get that set up again/
Joe Biden is a pathological liar, he will turn on the far left within moments after elected, praying that never happens. He represents the most pathetic politician and candidate ever to be nominated for President!
Or what? Vote Trump? It‚Äôs obvious to me Joe Biden can take us down a path to clam..we won‚Äôt have constant worry everyday..we won‚Äôt have an idiot in the WH..if that‚Äôs not enough to vote for him..then vote for your buddy in the WH..

Jeff, Most of us learn&amp; progress as we get older. Trump has evolved in to a savvy businessman. Are you joking? Surely, you Dems know Biden isn't going to improve the economy? 38% of the country must be laughing? They've voted saying Biden has dementia. He's all you have to offer?
Yep! He may not live to even be elected? If Hillary wants the job Basement Biden will resign or be gone?
Kamala Harris or Susan Rice as my second pick for VP, both have baggage. Should be interest? Is Hillary going to step in &amp; edge Basement Biden out? Garner women's vote?
Your voters know this very well- it's the other side that are blind as bats. Mr. President we cannot in any way shape or form let Biden win. There is no way he can win legitimately, you're the best, but the far left will cheat up a storm, as you already know. üá∫üá∏
When Biden‚Äôs AG indicts Trump &amp; any of his appointees, it won‚Äôt be a political stunt/move. They have been repeatedly breaking the law, in plain view of the world, documented in countless tweets, phone interviews, and ‚Äúpress conferences.‚Äù 2/2
Lol, so much Russian Collusion, let‚Äôs impeach him on a Ukraine phone call! And Not one person was charged with the Russian Collusion hoax. But again, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black!‚Äù
Trump is playing chess. It is not the position, but the threat. Threaten the postal service. Democrats must position them selves to counter act. Play the game. Reverse the roll. Take charge and attack Trump. He is beatable. Biden knows this.
I think Biden/Harris will win Georgia.
Believe in the Biden team. We came this far. Trump is pulling his bull shit. So what? His strategy does not bother me. It motivates me to beat him more. Vote early. Tell your friends. Problem solved.
And do does Biden.
What‚Äôs sweet sweet Jill Biden‚Äôs payoff
Probably.  But the irony of black women being Biden‚Äôs firewall when he has done more to decimate black families than any other living politician is galling.
The only question remaining in this election cycle is, what are the Republicans going to do when they are the minority in DC? It's over. Trump will not win. I am that confidant. Biden's team has got all Trump's plays covered. Trump knows he is done.
Biden's team is very aware of Trump's treasonous actions with the post office. Don't you think there will be lawsuits before the election? I am not worried. This will be an ass kicking on Trump.
It is not my problem that you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.  [It is within the realm of possibility for one person to loathe both Trump and Biden.]
Think about this. Biden is from Delaware. Democrat win. Harris from California. Democrat win. Pence from Indiana. Repub. Win. Trump from Florida. Democrat win. Trump is the odd man out. Biden-Harris 2020.
Relax Democrats. Biden will win. Breath. Trump late night election steal will not happen again. One reason, people are tired of the lies and treasonous acts against America. DC will be dominated by the Democrats.
Only number Joe Biden needs is 270. The electoral college has myriad options for Biden. Biden is neck and neck with Trump in red states. This speaks volumes. Trump's road is so narrow. Biden 2020.
Truth üé¨ domino Biden almost down!
If Trump is really for America, he wouldn't cut Postal funding. This is near treasonous behavior. Go for it Trump. Add to the unemployment line. In the end, you still lose to Biden.
BIDEN IS NOT GOING TO GO, YOU KNOW, SILENTLY INTO THE NIGHT IF HE LOSES.  TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN LANDSLIDE.
Still waiting on someone to explain to me how the Biden vote is a vote against fascism considering he wrote the Patriot Act and supports it wholeheartedly

dude, not voting is a vote for biden... not cool man.
From  I make no apologies for Biden's untenable position on abortion, but the reduction of the Catholic faith to this one issue has been a pastoral as well as a political dead-end, a distortion of Catholic moral teaching that must stop.
So Joe Biden is really not President? So I am assuming their are about 20 Co-Presidents?
Ebola killed 2 people here.  Obama and Biden stopped it before it got here.  And you KNOW this.  You look very smart.
That does not address the question at hand? How is it that you can blame those problems on a Biden election if it‚Äôs currently happening under a Trump presidency?
This comes from knowing no one wants her. Biden &amp; Harris don't even want her she embarrasses Obama every chance she gets .

Sadly, our lives do depend on it. Biden / Harris 2020
The ONLY President to do this. And the only candidate for President who didn‚Äôt become a multi-millionaire as a career politician and crony foreign deals like Joe Biden did.  Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years. FIFTY.
Lowest black unemployment, investment in impoverished communities, highest rate of black owned businesses, historic investment in traditional black colleges, justice reform, most new black business loans.    I antied up.   Now you do Biden/Harris.
Fairly encouraging numbers for Trump.  If Biden is so low now, after successfully hiding for months, what is he going to be in another two months?
OK....Can we get past the "woman" thing. We all know she is a woman. But she is a person and the most qualified person Pres. Biden could have picked. AND she can reach more people because they can relate to her.

Obama condemns Trump for trying to 'actively kneecap' the US Postal Service ‚Äì live
You really believe that? Biden mentioned gender and skin color months ago as his criteria for the veep selection. That‚Äôs the main reason pundits had the insufferable nincompoop Abrams high on the list of choices.
The blacks will still vote for the racist Biden and brownie hound Harris, after all blacks kill more blacks than any other race yet they started BLM.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they vote for the two people that care the least about their race.  Harris = slimiest in office.
You must never tell blacks that Biden is not their friend.  I have been called a ‚Äúracist bitch,‚Äù and told to stay in my own lane.
I‚Äôm a white person without a collage degree and I would walk barefoot through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden. It doesn‚Äôt take a collage degree to despise a lying, cheating evil man and his grifter family.
We didn't vote for Trump because he's a really nice guy, we voted for him because he can get the job done.  Search 'Biden accomplishments' vs 'Trump accomplishments.'  Trump is the best by far.
Poll: Voters approve Harris VP pick, Biden gets image bounce Democrats and Black voters broadly approve of Harris' elevation, as do a plurality of independents.
We‚Äôll need four years of introspection and healing after this election, and Biden‚Äôs done nothing if not offer that service to Americans his entire adult life. He‚Äôll use his personal tragedies to empathize with all of us. We could all use a Grandpa Joe in our lives right now.

Joe Biden isn't a sensitive little bitch like Trump so he was able to put his big boy pants on and move on.
He said it at a campaign rally in February, dumbass! The entire month he did nothing to prepare our country for the worst pandemic in 100 years. Called it a hoax by the Democrats. And for the record, again I am not a Democrat, not a Biden supporter, but Trump has got to go.
How many days before the election will Barr announce an investigation into Biden and Harris?
Right? Bernie is a bit too crazy now for me. But Kamala and Biden are hardly an answer either.

It's 2020 and the Republican party is strongly warning me that Joe Biden is coming for my meat.
Trump and Biden are polar opposites when it comes to policy.

Their original plan announced in Feb was to vote for the underdog and prolong the primaries, which was expected to be sanders. Then sanders won the first three, so they changed track to biden. Then dems latched on to biden's one win to consolidate with unprecedented intensity.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.
It‚Äôs OK. Biden and trump are tied for the white people vote which means Trump has lost.

The disappointing thing was Craig Melvyns indignant question as to when Biden/Harris were going to start "answering questions." They know they are co-conspirators but feel entitled to do Trumps dirty work for him
Alot of people call themselves anti imperialist but they are telling people to vote for Biden  Very confusing
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Why do they think will have leverage over Biden when Biden already said he will be a one term president?  Obama did all the shit he did while worrying about reelection  Biden is to his RIGHT and doesnt have to worry about it plus you pledged your vote. Makes no sense
But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
Essentially what I just heard on  is: Trump moves the news cycle Biden/Harris have not followed that tactic , and remained laser focused on their agenda because they are not answering reporters questions That leads to the inescapable conclusion, the news media enables Trump
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.
Do you really not remember biden and Obama championing pipelines and incentivizing the massive expansion of fracking wells for natural gas?  Wells which are currently vomiting super-greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, totally uncontrolled, as they are abandoned?
A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC OF HIM.  RASMUSSEN REPORT SURVEY POLL: 59% THINK BIDEN IS UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM.  HIS VP IS NOT BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.   NOBODY WANTS THE JOB OF SELLING BIDEN DOOR TO DOOR.
Overconfident. Biden is neck and neck in 3 traditional red states. Kicking ass in all other blue states.
You know Biden wins Florida. Trump has zero chance at reelection. Bet you a good cigar.
I want him to explain how we push Biden to the left after pledging out vote to him when he's going to be a one term president anyway and dont have to worry about reelection  Very interested in hearing it
I have issues with the woman that basically called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers jumping at the chance to run with him.
Dude. Trump can't win. End of story. Biden is so prepared. 600 lawyers ready at his response. Done deal.
As we all knew, SHE‚ÄôS the one running and doing all the talking for Hidin‚Äô Biden!  Sorry, but I‚Äôm totally sick of her, already!!!
punching left accomplishes what exactly?  He is a fucking grifter  He is pissing more people off than convincing to vote Biden
If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.
If Joe Biden were president, we‚Äôd already be past the worst of this. Instead we have record-setting unemployment and 200,000 deaths projected through next month. Please look at reality. Or just keep quiet.

To put it bluntly: biden and the democrats explicitly aren't even offering bread and circuses and have rejected doing so for costs. They're at best just promising that the prison guard kicking you in the stomach might not be a white man, perhaps, someday.
Can we get Biden to take some questions for Christsakes
Vote AGAINST Trump!  Vot e Biden/Harris2020 #DumpTrump2020
I mean... Biden is going to sustain all of the brutal trump policies about protest responses. This federal escalation was literally out of a playbook biden and Obama wrote! None of the tear gas and beatings and punitive arrests will stop or even slow down.
We can‚Äôt get Biden even to take ANY questions. He forgets where he is.  Creepy Joe
We need to add 10 points to Trump and take away 10 points from Biden with every one of these polls we see. That‚Äôs the advantage Trump gets from the cheating, the suppression, the screwing with the postal service, and Russia.

lets watch trumps train go by using coal to continue ruin the atmosphere because he doesn‚Äôt care at all about Mother Earth. Then let‚Äôs watch Biden put all his power into MAN POWER to get any where he wants. #biden2020
Yeah, Politico does love a good ‚ÄúDems in Disarray‚Äù story but this is interesting. A lot of gossip but this is why a lot of people like Biden. He‚Äôs just a regular guy whose accomplished a lot and always faced adversity including ‚Äúelites‚Äù who have never accepted him
Vote Biden/Harris unless you‚Äôre in a sure-thing blue state. And hold them accountable for their despicable bullshit.
There‚Äôs a lot of groups who have room to criticize Biden bumbling like an idiot and Trump supporters are not one üòÇ y‚Äôall have the King idiot please pipe down
There are so many "progressives" with Stockholm Syndrome over the two party system to the point where they repeat their political fanfiction as if its fact   We couldn't push Obama to the left, and Joe Biden is to his RIGHT
Those people aren't Biden voters anyway.
Adding to a long list of exs in which he manipulates faith for pol gain the¬†pres‚Äôs rant in Ohio¬†last Thurs also undermined yet another sec of the Constitution ‚Äî¬†Article 6, Section 3¬†‚Äî which quite specifically states that there is no relig test for office.
Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'
Biden lies about what Trump says, makes it the centerpiece of his campaign, and you can‚Äôt see who is creating racial division in pursuit of power? Instead, you suggest someone you don‚Äôt know is racist. Cognitive dissonance. More important, Biden hurts America.
We Catholics should be able to explain how our faith informs all of our decisions, including our political ones. Biden's decision to lean in to the discussion, and not to avoid it, will be good for Catholicism, whether or not it is good for the Democrats.
WTF is Pence talking about??? Biden &amp; Harris r now going to ''cut America's meat?" How and where do they come up with this nonsense anyway???üò≥üëá
He won't. Perhaps we should focus our imagination on Biden and Harris taking office in January 2021.üëç
POST OFFICE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE. TRUMP IS. LET THAT SINK IN. TRUMP IS DONE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. BIDEN WILL STILL KICK HIS ASS. TRUMP IS GOING BYE BYE.
If and/or when Biden/Harris win in a landslide victory, the Senate will naturally flip.  Then we can finally get things done and Mitch will lose all his power, even if he wins re-election, which I don't feel he will...not even close. The Turtle's time is up too.
Yes, this IS our last stand, James. And WE THE PEOPLE are drawing a line in sand and we chose Biden and Harris on November 3.   Why u ask?üò≥ Bc we've fucking HAD it with this sociopathic LUNATIC.üëá  So, ya know, you've LOST. ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden looks so ready to take our country back.
America, tell my friend John Fox to vote Biden.
The American people are seeing how frail the Orange ass is. Biden looks vibrant and ready to roll.
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat". Mike Pence..
That would require senile old Joe to speak without a cue card or teleprompter &amp; we all know that is no longer part of Biden‚Äôs skill set.
Looks like the Democrat‚Äôs get-out-of-Biden-nominee card was to allow him to appoint an ineligible running mate par for the course after all BO was never eligible to serve as POTUS either
I had some steaks in the freezer last night but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris snuck in and stole all my meat.
BREAKING: New FOX poll says that Biden is leading Trump 50 to 36% on who Americans think who would do a better job handling coronavirus.  That's a 14 point lead...which is astounding, considering our ''divisiveness."   Doesn't look like we're that divided any longer.üò≥

Ineligible to serve as either VP or POTUS anchor baby Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in her First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate She MUST be disqualified &amp; replaced or Trump wins unopposed by a Constitutionally qualified Democrat ticket

Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
The awful Israel-UAE deal that Trump oversaw would have been overseen by Biden too, and Hillary - absolutely. But we have leaders in Congress now who are finally speaking up about Israeli apartheid. They are better positioned to grow influence without Republicans in charge.
God it would be cool if the people who made up 82% of america‚Äôs wealth saw a higher Rex percentage cut under Joe Biden tax plan but unfortunately he won‚Äôt do anything üòî
For those that are interested here's the source of this
You keep shifting to your hatred of Trump.  I'm trying to focus on Biden and D's lying about what he said and thereby creating further racial division in their pursuit of power. I don't think people should be okay with it. I assume, you would not be, if you did not hate Trump.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
You can hate Trump (as you obviously do) and still criticize Biden and D's for lying about what he said.
My main question is that if Biden wins and he raises taxes on the top 1% and Fortune 500 companies who will provide jobs for Americans when they take their factories to other countries? Please explain. I‚Äôve never ever got a definitive answer on this.
To state the obvious, Biden and D's are lying about what Trump said that day.  To create racial division to achieve political power. And you are okay with it.
I‚Äôm sorry, but no. Neither Biden nor Harris are socialists, &amp; they haven‚Äôt called for abolishing police.  However, Trump is actively hollowing out the government, profiting from it, is a white supremacist, and has let Covid completely overrun the country while calling it a hoax.
And this.
If you are honest and open minded, read this and let me know your thoughts.  Put Trump's flaws to one side for a moment.
Tom, any concern about Biden and D's doing this -- smart liberal honest former law school professor sees Biden creating racial division in the pursuit of power.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
How will usps get them to and from with Trump slowing the mail system, purposefully.  I bet she votes Biden.
Biden is a pedo Harris got her job on her knees great choice!
Trump was dumb, not racist, to say anything other than Harris eligibility not an issue. But which is worse, a dumb "I have no idea" statement by Trump or a calculated false racial division political strategy by Biden and D's?
Again violating my vow to stay away on political stuff. Other day you  questioned if D's falsely created racial division to pursue power. See below by smart liberal honest former law school professor. You seem interested in truth.
The 2nd amendment was not about owning guns it's about the right to over throw a government that no longer had the best interest of the people. That's what will get with biden/ Harris #takemycountryback
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
I loved the words that Biden had: "you could set your watches to it'' bc Trump is actually the most PREDICTABLE person on the planet if you've been paying attention.  And once u figure out the psyche of a sociopath, they're really not that complicated and therefore predictable.
There's go that theory that they will hold Biden accountable LMAO
Liberals are fighting and pushing back against a #GeneralStrike when fucking Trump is president   And y'all think they will have our back trying to force Biden to the left?   Clown shit
Hell yes... I'm loving that he says he's going to hold Biden accountable for the Green New Deal... you don't see that often!
These Biden commercials are eh just saying
Joe Biden is really in ‚Äú Dire Straits ‚Äú now!!
If and/or when Biden and Harris win on November 3 in a landslide victory...  it'll be the imminent END of the Republican Party as we know it.  Why? Bc the American people are simply TRAUMATIZED from the last 3.5 years and will vote blue for at LEAST the next 12.  Just sayin'.üò≥
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don‚Äôt miss it.  #DemConvention
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô

A DNC spokesperson told The Hill that Yang was among a list of former 2020 candidates who would be speaking during two segments about the status of America and how they will work with former Vice President Joe Biden.
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
I swear some of these people are proletariats straight out of 1984. Most of these people probably don't vote anyway, but criticizing and telling people they shouldn't vote for Biden

I don't think Claire has many open minded followers, but for any who are here, look at how liberal former law professor Ann Althouse views Biden's and D's intentional creation of racial division to pursue political power.
I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
If you consider yourself on the left and you are busy pushing and holding water for Joe Biden instead of helping with a #GeneralStrike, you are a fraud  Sorry, not sorry
If you are annoyed that Biden isn‚Äôt exactly who you want to vote for, so are unexcited about participating in this election: I have good news!    If you vote some random third party or sit out the election, you won‚Äôt have to worry about voting ever again.
If Trump wins but Democrats retake the Senate and the House  What exactly could Trump get accomplished that Joe Biden wouldn't already do?

I can‚Äôt imagine there are many Catholics who would change their vote from Trump to Biden because Biden was denied communion.

I thought the way biden put his hand at the small of her back while walking across stage was inappropriate. Something like that my husband would do to me, not a stranger.
not sure if you answered this question but just curious, if Biden had chosen Tulsi would you have definitely voted for him?
LMAO at libs who think they will be able to go back to brunch under a Joe Biden administration   We should #GeneralStrike when he's in office to for Medicare for All   Completely evil not to support it in the middle of a pandemic
Ben Shapiro: Democrats slammed federal presence in US cities, but they want to 'send the feds to yell at you about masks?'
The number one priority for progressives should be organizing a #GeneralStrike, not holding water for fucking Joe Biden and the Democratic Party who are complicit with this shit
The reason why I know you are a deeply unserious grifter is because if you really believed Trump was this existential threat, instead of punching down at people with no money or no power, you would have hit the phones to actually help Biden win  Who's chasing clout now?
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DOESN'T THINK IT IS FAIR THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T COVER BIDEN'S HEALTH &amp; FITNESS.  VOTERS NEED TO KNOW IF A CANDIDATE CAN DO THE JOB.  TRUMP SUCCESSES ARE TAX CUTS, ECONOMY, UNLEASHING DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, &amp; THE COURTS.
Very concerning ticket... I just don't see how progressive Democrats will be able to vote for Biden/Harris... Though I also though Christian conservatives wouldn't vote Trump. So wtf do I know.
Joe Biden wants to shut down ice cream parlors, close amusement parks and put a complete ban on board games.

As part of his bid to scare white suburban voters into supporting President Donald Trump in November, his campaign falsely accused Biden‚Äôs campaign of freeing from jail a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù a ‚Äúserial rapist,‚Äù a ‚Äúviolent fugitive,‚Äù and an ‚Äúattempted cop killer.‚Äù
Shitty progressives like  can easily pitch Joe Biden because he is fucking ignorant about how trash the Obama administration was  He was part of the class who wasnt devastated by their policies  But he thinks he can shame black leftists to vote for a racist? Fuck you
Oh ask Joe Biden what he thinks?? He gives credit to the Obama administration almost 4 years ago for Trump's hard work
Because of his opponent. Did you notice how Biden never accepts extemporaneous questions? Why do you think that is?
I have 2 daughters...I don't want them living in Biden's America! I'll die for them. Trust!
Biden / Harris 2020~ !!! Let's bring honesty, CLASS, respect, and intelligence back to the White House.  America misses those qualities in a President.
"I was one of the people who publicly expressed concern about Harris during her presidential campaign. A few key things have changed since then ... my politics have changed."  Translation: I went from critic to bootlicker within 2 changing seasons.
Libs: Trump wants to be a dictator! An autocrat!! Trump: The governors should make decisions. They know what works for them. Libs: He is not a good leader!  Biden: All governors should require people to wear a mask. Kamala: That's what leadership looks like. Libs: Yay!!
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
Don the con is going to raise taxes to the middle class to pay for his failed reaction to Covid. Biden will tax billionaires which means trump will pay more. Trump is going to spread any lies to get reelected to pay less in taxes and to stay out of jail for tax evasion.
Biden has his downside being an old white man and an establishment Dem. Kamala being selected shows the progress. This ticket is the best Dems have to beat the current GOP. But u don't beat GOP voter suppression without the black vote. After that women will lead the country.
So Biden‚Äôs not winning then?
I love the convo. But the Dem party has been making strides since 2018 w/ black women and other minority women (AOC, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley&amp;Rashida Talib) beating out old establishment Dems. While introducing new ideas and bills. Biden is to appease old Dems. Party unity.
Biden picks Harris for running¬†mate
Seems like all of the Biden press is positive and the Trump press is negative.  Who would have thought that?
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
I agree! She threatened Biden.
Biden mumbled and was zoned out today- ü•±üò¥ü§§.  Would you explain to Marie the importance that I know WHY JOE HAS NEVER had a covid test? Marie, hasn‚Äôt he gotten the COVID test ‚Äúout of the goodness of his heart?‚Äù
Best President ever. Biden/Harris cannot even come close
Wrecking the post office to interfere w/ mail-in voting &amp; set it up for privatization is 1000x more terrible than refusing to help Ukraine w/ its proxy war w/ Russia if they don't investigate Biden (or whatever the impeachment was supposed to be about)
No, we're not. It's coming back up because folks who haven't paid attention during the primary are now looking to get caught up for the general.  These folks that haven't any clue about Biden or Harris beyond the headlines of articles they've been scrolling past in the last year.
I would trust Biden to do a better job than Trump with the virus anytime
Bernie‚Äôs volunteers [as opposed to paid staff, a/k/a Jeff Weaver] and donors deserved better.  I know unpaid volunteers who gave up at least two years of their lives because they believed in the urgency of M4A.  And then immediately endorsing Biden?  WTFF?
I hope she and Biden don‚Äôt give it the time of day. Sadly, I think one of Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes was releasing his birth certificate rather than dismissing the accusations as nonsense
I will never vote for Biden, but I will admit you make a good point.
He‚Äôs accusing Biden of HIS approach...so he should be VERY familiar with it.
Exactly! As the saying goes, as Ohio goes, so does the country or something like that. Biden is actually faring well in OH. Let‚Äôs turn it blue!
Don‚Äôt get the rambling(see Joe Biden), thought he was well spoken and very thoughtful!
Harris has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  And she's just as determined as he was to be POTUS. Biden won't last long.

So what you're saying is you race by, pay no attention to citizens, don't even bother to care about anything but yourself based on your speed while Biden goes by at a reasonable pace to speak with people and doesn't race past them? Cool
Know who I think should speak at the DNC convention? Fuckin, whoever the Biden campaign thinks should speak. They have made zero mistakes so far so let‚Äôs just trust the process, folks.
Have you turned over to the FBI the anti-Biden material you received from Ukrainian/Russian sources according to US Intel ? To not do so might be construed as criminal, even treasonous.
Can you please provide specifics on how the Green New Deal would "end Kansas agriculture"? Also, can you please provide documentation where Joe Biden endorsed the Green New Deal?
VP Biden has years of experience in government and can spell, unlike you. Your point?
I cannot believe the anti-mask idiocy. Biden takes a stand to call for a nationwide mask mandate, and the MAGAts come crawling out of the muck exclaiming, "But my freedom!" Please. It's not about freedom. It's about saving American lives! If you're a "patriot" then act like it.
KAMALA HARRIS BRINGS NOTHING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, SHE ISN'T BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.  MALES BLACK,  WHITES, &amp; LATINOS ARE UPSET WITH BIDEN FOR NOT BEING CONSIDERED.  IT IS ASTONISHING HOW BIDEN WAS ABLE TO PICK A RUNNING MATE HAS DONE MORE DAMAGE.
The onion is right! Biden really did need more centrist to even out all the centrism on the ticket
AOC hasn‚Äôt officially endorsed Biden. Juli√°n Castro went after Biden on the debate stage w/out properly sucking up to him later.  The DNC is punishing them for not properly kissing the ring while simultaneously rewarding Bloomberg w/ a platform b/c they want his money.
Neither one really like each other. Waiting for a Biden‚Äôs dementia breakdown, Referring Harris to the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word.  Dementia patients revert back to early years in life.
Biden has already said that he wants Bloomberg in his cabinet.  And Jamie Dimon.
Who would you like to see as Attorney General, once Biden-Harris win??

I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden will have a dog in the White House. Although I agree he probably won‚Äôt want a cow.
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚ÄùSo Joe Biden is really not President?

The ONLY President to do this. And the only candidate for President who didn‚Äôt become a multi-millionaire as a career politician and crony foreign deals like Joe Biden did.  Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years. FIFTY.
Your argument also applies to Obama/Biden replacing previously lost jobs, not creating them.
I‚Äôm a white person without a collage degree and I would walk barefoot through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden. It doesn‚Äôt take a collage degree to despise a lying, cheating evil man and his grifter family.
Make it official and hold him in contempt.  People need to start going to jail NOW for what's happening, not "maybe" later if Biden wins.
The photographer posted an edited version of Joe Biden's 2020 campaign logo.

Right? Bernie is a bit too crazy now for me. But Kamala and Biden are hardly an answer either.
Just been listening to CNN and Trump answering questions from reporters? I can‚Äôt believe how they allow this clown to lie and not one of them challenge him? Bashing Joe Biden with false statements and blaming Dems, non stop?  This is the worst country in the history of America
She has 1/4 mixed white and Jamaican. 1/2 Tamil. 1/4 white Irish slave-owner.  Biden has insulted American blacks with this choice.
Biden insulted blacks by choosing her to represent blacks..  Biden insulted women by choosing her to represent women.
Biden has insulted blacks with his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äú. 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave-owner, 1/4 mixed white/ Jamaican.
Biden has insulted blacks by his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äù who is 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave owner, 1/4 mix Jamaican + white.  Biden has insulted women by his choice of an arrogant Hoe who used sex to get jobs.  Biden himself is an insult to America.  Corrupt.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.
Sometimes you just have to scratch your head and wonder where all of this is leading us.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden‚Äôs VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
As we all knew, SHE‚ÄôS the one running and doing all the talking for Hidin‚Äô Biden!  Sorry, but I‚Äôm totally sick of her, already!!!
I‚Äôm also not going to let Joe Biden cut my meat.
Yeah, Politico does love a good ‚ÄúDems in Disarray‚Äù story but this is interesting. A lot of gossip but this is why a lot of people like Biden. He‚Äôs just a regular guy whose accomplished a lot and always faced adversity including ‚Äúelites‚Äù who have never accepted him
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat". Mike Pence..
If Biden is elected, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt seen nothin yet!!!!‚Äù
Hey King Biden wanna be. .how about NO! #BidenIsARacist
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
Idk anyone who isn‚Äôt voting for Biden, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre out there but they probably wouldn‚Äôt vote anyway
not sure if you answered this question but just curious, if Biden had chosen Tulsi would you have definitely voted for him?
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
He‚Äôs accusing Biden of HIS approach...so he should be VERY familiar with it.
Harris has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  And she's just as determined as he was to be POTUS. Biden won't last long.
Biden's "black"  VP.   1/2 Tamil, 1/4 white Irish slave-owner, 1/4 mixed white-Jamaican. Biden insults blacks.
And yet there are still more unemployed right now than when President Obama and VP Biden left office. Hmmmmm
Who would you like to see as Attorney General, once Biden-Harris win??
For President?  This time?  Yeah.    I‚Äôm voting for Biden.  Republicans have sold their soul to Trump.  I don‚Äôt feel good about it, and I think Biden‚Äôs corrupt, but it‚Äôs the lesser of 2 evils.  I‚Äôm voting for Marshall in the Senate.  I haven‚Äôt decided between Davids/Adkins.
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden will have a dog in the White House. Although I agree he probably won‚Äôt want a cow.
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù

I love the people who are like  ‚ÄúPLAN: Nov 3 - get Biden and Harris elected.  Nov 4 - push them to be better!‚Äù  Then they provide a laundry list of policies that they would essentially want from a candidate who isn‚Äôt worthless/ACTUALLY progressive. It‚Äôs so sad.
Harris has done more pressers and answered more questions than Biden did since the pandemic started. That's just what I'm looking for in a POTUS - delegation until it's time to stand up and read something my babysitter wrote for me.
The obvious counter to this is the Biden campaign can tweet mugshots of criminals from the Trump administration.

Prove it with real numbers. I believe that you could say, with all honesty, that your inaction on #COVID19 has killed more in 3 months than Obama/Biden did in 8 years.
Joe Biden LIES.
170,000 people are dead thanks to the incompetence of you and this WH. Do you have nothing else to do? You should be scared of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They will save our country and our democracy. It will take decades to fix what you have destroyed. GFY
So what? Biden is so out of it he hasnt sent his own tweet in ages.
All those things you said about Biden were.....  Just politics?
You all miss the point here.  The Pence(anti-glbt)  loving supporter whos openly gay is questioning Biden as a possible homophobe. The hypocrisy here is ridiculous &amp; reveals his loyalty to the political party is way more relevant to him than his concern for glbt rights.
Kamala has the criminal mind of LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as he did.  So Joe Biden will not last long.
Kamala has no integrity.  Neither does Tara Reade,  who has stated that she is still going to vote for Biden
Kamala has the same criminal mind as LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as LBJ did. Joe Biden knows that he is just a temporary placeholder for Kamala.  George Soros has picked Kamala.
George Soros has picked her to be the next POTUS. He‚Äôs ordered his son Alex and all his open society foundation‚Äòs to get her into office. Biden is her place holder.
Yes, The latest orders of George Soros.  He‚Äôs now put his son Alex and all of his ‚Äúopen society‚Äù foundation ordered to support her and make her POTUS. Joe Biden knows he is just her temporary placeholder.
Kamala has no integrity. What do you expect????  She wants to be POTOS and has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  Biden won‚Äôt last long, he‚Äôs her place holder.
Yep.  We‚Äôve got another LBJ here.  Lbj got together with Hoover and they took out JFK.  Joe Biden won‚Äôt last long.

She plans to get rid of Biden and become POTUS.  Willie said 8/11/20:  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll work her backside off for Biden‚Äù.  He deliberately said ‚Äúbackside‚Äù.
All your disparaging comments are falling on deaf ears.  We are thrilled with a Joe Biden Kamala Harris ticket. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Watch rude Kamala attack Joe Biden.    For Joe now to choose her as his VP tells me that Joe lacks self-respect....
You do realize that people see Trump almost every day make up something out of thin air, lie, do nothing with Covid, spin conspiracy theories, etc and in the middle of the worst pandemic we've seen in generations, I think Biden will have enough material to hold his own.

100% agree. RCV would change thing dramatically. I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting Biden as my 2nd choice. I think RCV is possible down the road. We just need greater dem presence in the state legislature
A mean, nasty Liar.   Biden should lose millions of votes for choosing her. I think he wants to lose.
Duh, Biden has dementia but I actually wanted Kamala as President from the jump

Hmmm. Interesting, that would do very little unless Biden were to put that money into title 1 and change the formula of school wide funding to targeted funding. I am sure that plan also has very little to do with CTE in minority districts. Throwing money doesn‚Äôt create solutions
You just described Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lol
And they want to say Biden has trouble speaking! Give me a break! This guy massacres the English language. üò©
I love that this guy also bashed the impeachment proceedings as, among other things, somehow unconstitutional.  See you at the Biden/Harris inaugural events!

Hey Kellyanne Obama and Biden left donnie a plan for this but he threw it out because of jealousy. What is his plan? #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoPlan #WhereAreTheTests #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus
How long until Biden and Harris say, "We need to move on and not live in the past" when asked why charges not happening with Trump.
Still amazed that Biden was appointed by the DNC and we all pretend and go forward like it never happened.

Have Biden take one. Trump already has.
Even Democratic voters said so too!
So every one of these voters need to have the FBI called on them to Karen?
Yep. As this happens more and more people will tune it out. Biden should fade to background and let her take this. America will have to get used to a mature response instead of our kindergarten teacher.
Face reality. Joe Biden is more than likely is going to be a one term president. And some of those think Joe won‚Äôt even make it through his first term. Face the facts.
I mean she‚Äôs right. His cognitive health isn‚Äôt the best. Almost 50 percent of voters believe Biden won‚Äôt make it through his first term. He is going to be more than likely a one term president.
Pretty clear a current terrorist organization in the United States supports Biden

Hillary shot herself in the foot by not campaigning in Wisconsin Michigan and PA. And it could cost Biden too if Trump makes up ground, which appears he is starting to a bit.
Pretty clear with Biden being not able to speak without a teleprompter, and the debate being Trump, Biden, and the moderator, that these debates need to be on PPV!
Everyone is afraid of trump but not realizing that the neoliberal Democratic policies pushed ppl to vote for Trump. Biden isn‚Äôt as disliked as Hillary but he also has 0 excitement behind him.
Fuck nudes send your vote for Harris/Biden
Watch to see what the tone of the reporters is for the Biden/Harris Press Conference.  I'll bet it is a liberal media "love in" totally unlike the treatment of President Trump.
Read This: "Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris"
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
I agree with you 100 percent. No politician is going to be perfect.  My hope is that Kamala and Biden will listen to the people. Biden choosing Kamala proves he‚Äôs willing to put differences aside for the good of America.  We the people need to give them a chance to bring change.
Biden has been in office forever and only done bad things
(Polling isn‚Äôt everything but)  I don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall realize how big of a deal it is that Trump is only 7 points behind Biden in Kansas. Hillary lost Kansas by TWENTY-ONE points in 2016. If we keep trending in this direction, Kansas could go blue (!) in 2024.
You can criticize Kamala Harris without being sexist or racist.  You can also criticize her while planning to vote for her.  You can also criticize her and not attack her with sexism or racism.  Joe Biden is a putz tho.

Anyone else get the feeling the GOP is adding him to the ballots to take away from Biden getting more votes, like how KS GOP added Bob Hamilton to the primary to steal votes from Kobach (helps Dem win)? I feel like they're leaning heavily into this now that Harris is the VP nom.
If Biden wins we lose.

I‚Äôm convinced niggas is just scared and voting for Biden is the nice little white pat on the back they need to make sure everything is okay.....FOH they‚Äôre all white supremacist.
Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
If asked, I wonder if Trump would say ‚ÄúMary Magellan.‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúLove your God. Love your neighbor.‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúI loved my neighbor- she became my 2nd wife!‚Äù
Take it to the extreme of every vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump...but at this point, it is what it is. Vote 3rd party for Congress. We putting Biden/Harris on a count down as soon as they are in office. Like...better act like yall know
And all of this, although troubling, is still not as as bad as the slippery slope to fascism we‚Äôre riding. We have a clear choice before us-only one destroys the US. We have the luxury of looking at these things after Trump &amp; his cronies are out.  For now, I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me &amp; maybe I‚Äôm a little off, but even if that were true, it creeps me out &lt; Pence‚Äôs over the top evangelical bit.  (Shrug).  Either way, I still think both she &amp; Pence are far better human beings from what I‚Äôve seen than Trump or Biden.  But that‚Äôs a low bar.

Maybe that's why Biden waited so long
Introduction of a 3rd party isn't realistic at this juncture. Getting Cheeto Jesus and his corrupt asshats out of office is vital to America at this point. We can then put Biden/Harris on a timer. I will vote 3rd party, have before in local elections, just not right now.
Great vote for her in 4 years...right now isn't the time. Every single vote not for Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump. There was enough people that choose not to vote last election to put him into office...people already on the same, I don't like either candidates.

Idk how realistic this is because Idk much about politics tbh but do you guys think Bernie sanders would have won Biden the election if he was the vp? I kinda do.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala as the VP pick.   I also hope Biden finds a way to include more women in his cabinet. Let‚Äôs get Warren in there. Susan Rice and Amy Klobuchar, too.   It‚Äôs time to let women run this country for a while.
#ohLiz  I'm old enough to remember when candidates ran on their records, not trying to blame opponents for stuff going on NOW, under their watch, especially Biden who's not currently in office or Harris for stuff not in her state! The Gop seems very scared!
2. The report reminds that the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy and its precedent, both include highly conditional language committing the USG to restrain arms sales only on the basis of knowledge of intent. A Biden admin should make a much harder commitment.

Excuse me - I‚Äôm Roman Catholic and so is Joe Biden. What the hell is your problem?
So far my Twitter timeline this morning is full of Progressives slamming more moderate liberals over Biden/Harris, who are busy quickly backtracking earlier slams of Harris, while right wing people are saying at least they have morals, while backing Donald Fucking Trump.
There‚Äôs enough wrong with Biden/Harris, that resorting to sexism would be lazy. Just research Tulsi‚Äôs rant at the democrats debate  unreal that we as a natuon have come down to these four!

And by the way, she never called Biden a racist.  You only read that in the letter from the campaign that went out earlier today.  Facts matter and that is nothing more than a fabrication.  I'd be happy for you to send a clip proving me wrong.
Should have a bike race and they have to use a map to find the finish. If Trump can get his fat ass on one he'll have a heart attack within minutes, and Biden will be doing laps still trying to find the finish line pointing at birds. We'll see a cognitive test in the debates.
Holy shit!!! I was thinking the same! Not only that, but I was thinking Biden may "step down". Just a couple of years ago he said he had NO INTEREST in running for pres.. yet here we are ;)
Dear Liz go promote Trump obviously you think he is a better man than Joe Biden? Party over Country when even President Bush would probably disagree with your vote!
I'll be voting Joe and Kamala for obvious reasons (especially climate change) but I think it's important to acknowledge that Biden was basically an author of mass incarceration and Harris's record as a prosecutor is really punitive and regressive. I think we can do both.
yeah like Biden has, wait a minute, Bidens don't serve either!! losers!! haha!
Well, it needs a clarifying rewrite. So, good! Let's go! Biden?Harris 2020!
Maybe while she‚Äôs trying to undo Trump‚Äôs mess...she will simultaneously kick Biden in his ethics and make him understand.
Exactly...not saying I won't support a 3rd party...however, this isn't the time for that. Get Cheeto Jesus and his cronies out of office. Biden Harris got 4 year clock.
Great pick for VP! Unfortunately we are probably only minutes away from hateful and racist rhetoric from DJT,  Carlson and Hannity. DJT has already said Senator Harris is a nasty person. Really? Has he ever listened to the trash coming from his own mouth?
Maybe I'm being crazy, but is everybody just ok with the fact that Kamala labeled Biden a sexual predator, and now, everything is just all good??Well as a private sector union member I can tell you the Ds are about 5 years away from being completely alienated with us. We have just enough Biden types holding on but, things are changing. You can't steal the #2a, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness form working class

David Friedman: Joe Biden Helped Middle East Peace Deal Only by Being So ‚ÄòHostile‚Äò  via
It means Biden's words have no rhyme or reason to them  So pretty much "an excuse for his dementia"
Biden believed that it did not make up the majority of the party, and continued to run as an old school liberal. Did not embrace #M4A for instance. And I continue to believe that he's right, and that this is why he won the nomination. 4/
People like Biden and Pelosi used to represent the leftwing of the DEM party. I describe them now as old school liberals. There was always a more extreme group further left, but they were largely ignored by the party and the media. 2/
That‚Äôs not what I said. For clarification I‚Äôd estimate about 20% on the far right and 20% on far left engage in this behavior. I know plenty of good people who voted for Trump. And plenty who will vote Biden.
This is what Congress should have been doing (minus the specifics in #3-4) for Trump's entire term. Who knows how many daily Teapot Dome-level scandals they could have uncovered by now?  That impeachment was over a phone call about Hunter Biden, and not this, was negligence.
If the DEMs win the Senate, there will absolutely be pressure to nuke the filibuster. I've tweeted this before. I think it would be shortsighted and a terrible mistake. And I'm not sure where Biden is on the issue.  I don't think they'll really expand the court. I could be wrong.
Correct. Though she certainly never came across well trying to be a hardcore progressive either. Progressives certainly didn't buy it. I suspect she's pretty much inline with Biden philosophically.
I largely agree with you. Biden is not a moderate. He's just more moderate than the rest of the field. I've repeatedly described him as an old school liberal.  I'm just hoping that being a former legislator he understands the need for the filibuster. Has he been asked about this?
OMG another lie. Show us EXACTLY where Trump said he'd defund Social Security if reelected.  Team Biden has so many legit areas to take on Trump, but I've seen MULTIPLE lies coming from their accounts this week. BE BETTER THAN THIS!
The DEM party has basically split into three groups: moderates (yes some exist), liberals and the progressive / activist wing. Basically every candidate but Joe ran in the progressive lane. Biden was only available choice for libs and moderates. IMO
Clyburn certainly helped Biden in SC, but Biden was always going to win SC. I was still predicting that Biden would win the nomination (before SC) after not doing well in Iowa and NH.
So who represents the 80% of blacks better who still support the police: Biden/Harris or the activist wing who want to defund the police?  This is why Biden won the nomination. He understood where the base REALLY stands. 3/end
The activist wing of  continue to believe that they are the base of the party. They are not. Biden won the nomination largely because he understood that the party voters are NOT as progressive as the activist wing. 1/
While I almost certainly won't vote for Biden, I think it's folly to write off anybody legitimately interested in building a conservative, center-right future in America solely based on a single vote.
Biden has all but stated that he doesn't want progressives.  He wants moderate Dems and non-Trump Republicans.  Why don't you go after the undecided voters and convince them to vote Biden?    Biden isn't giving us anything and we're not giving him our vote.
Imagine saying that you should vote for the person who ripped babies from their parents inside the border, kamala harris, instead of the person who ripped babies from their parents outside the border, because you're personal friends with joe biden like ava duvernay is
But what worries me the most is that the Durham investigation findings will be used by Trump to invalidate some or all of the election results (by connecting the findings to allegations of fraud by Biden in 2020). I know that sounds paranoid, but I don't just Trump at all.
The media is going to be so busy covering what Kamala says that they're going to ignore that Biden isn't doing much, aren't they?
She knows this is NOT an answerable question. NOBODY IN THE WORLD knows the answer to this question. OMG she's going to make me regret my tweets saying she was the right choice for Biden. SMDH
Senator Harris said she believes the Women who said they were Raped by Biden. Print that because that is that's the Truth.
When Obama blames Biden for Obamagate America will get it's proof.
One thing that Warren really brought to the table was a clear anti-corruption vision. It would be good to see Biden and Harris make this is a priority. It could have important long-term effects and is good politics for creating a contrast w/ Trump.
Biden is remembering CARTER?
I'm 99% sure of two October surprises: a vaccine announcement (even if it's not really ready) and the Durham Investigation. I could see a 5-10% surge for Trump from those. Combine that with voter suppression and other surprises and I don't feel that Biden's lead is near safe.
I've never been an enormous Biden fan. But governing is a skill that Trump seems allergic to. Unlike many conservatives, I feel that our gov't institutions are very important. And the damage done to the Dep't of State, EPA, USPS, etc. might take decades to recover from.

True. We will.  Biden is more popular among black voters than Hillary. Hard to imagine Trump getting much more than about 10% of the black vote.
Senator Harris also said "SHE Believed the Biden RAPE Victims" Print that because it's the TRUTH.
Did anyone ask the Biden Rape victims what they thought about Senator Harris as Bidens Choice for VP?
She did say she believed the raped women's account of  Biden Rapes in his Washington office.. Print that because it is the TRUTH
Over the Hill Both Biden and Hill. Soon to be under the Hill
She did say, "Biden had sex with the 10 women who worked in his office in Washington DC and she believes them All. oh and the 200 Slaves her Dad had would be something more to talk about.
Agreed. Biden also lied (I think yesterday or the day before) about Trump defunding social security.   There are so many LEGIT reasons to go after Trump. It's dumb to just lie about stuff like this.
Oh, sorry to confuse you.  I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôll probably be done trading for at least 12 years.  4 years Biden, 8 years Harris.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  also, the trick to getting good grades in college is ... take easy classes.  Trust me.
While I proudly vote for Biden to do my part in removing a racist tub of Cheetos from the White House.
Hell YES to Biden-Harris 2020 taking down trump-pence!!!  Damn right, we're nasty, willing, and ready to SLAY the enemy on November 3rd!!! Anxiously awaiting the return of üóΩ, ‚öñÔ∏è, and reuniting üá∫üá∏!!!
What is the comparison to 2016? Is Biden doing better than HRC was at this point? How do Trump's August 2020 numbers compare to his August 2016 numbers?
It‚Äôs schizophrenic to simultaneously pitch Trump as ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù and ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù, when the chief criticism of Kamala is she ‚Äúlocked up too many criminals‚Äù.   Can we please pick a lane?  Consistent messaging will give Trump re-election. Confusion elects Biden.
At least the train didn‚Äôt run over Biden...I was expecting that...
Obama &amp; Biden: Look at these jobs we created coming out of the worst recession in recent memory!  Pence: Hold my beer.
The original and the edited photo.   They tinkered with it to pop the the contrast, which makes Harris's skin look darker and more haggard and her hair look kinkier.  But they didn't do the same thing to Biden.   Huh, what's the difference between those two people?
Kamala Harris has a full endorsement of the largest abortion provider in the United States.
What about the sex claims of the women that work for Biden?
BREAKING NEWS! Senator Harris has received information from all the 10 Women who Presidential Candidate Joe Biden had sexual relations with in his office in Washington DC over the past 12 years. He is reported to be having a National Press Conference in the next few hours.
The context is, M4A gets passed, except it has to be a perfect bill that doesn‚Äôt raise taxes more than a public option (spoiler it won‚Äôt) and then Biden vetoes it lmao that is such a bad faith ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù response to the reality of what M4A is.
So Biden is using the Black woman. Shame on the sex offender Senator Harris claims she believes more than Biden's bull shit stories.
The whole playbook of the right is to say "leftists/liberals LOVE this" because their fanbase will then go "OH. So I will oppose that! I won't support that shit!"  That is why they are saying Harris and Biden are radical leftists. Not because they believe it.
My earliest memory of Biden is him being the Vice President with the finger gun.
Other KS tidbits: Biden: 41% favorable, 56% unfavorable Bollier: 44% favorable, 31% unfavorable  Marshall: 41% favorable, 40% unfavorable Gov. Kelly: 64% job approval, 29% disapproval Sen. Moran: 42% job approval, 33% disapproval Trump Covid response: 46% approve, 51% disapprove
Kamala Harris, Gen X Vice President - Rolling Stone
I'd like a world government... Just not one backed by Biden or his cronies.  Maybe one day we'll have a set of laws worthy of our beautiful world.
I'm confused. Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
VP Candidate Senator Kamala Harris said she believes all the women who said Biden Raped them. Sleep on that.
BREAKING NEWS!    Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden Announced today His Vice Presidential Candidate, Senator Harris has agreed to Pay Her Families Ex-Slaves 14 Trillion Taxpayer dollars in Slave Reparations.
I mean I‚Äôm still voting Biden, I‚Äôm just pissed off about it.
I will wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support Kamala Harris as the VP candidate. But a little piece of me still wishes Biden picked Duckworth. She doesn't mince words.
For me the biggest factor is biden at least has 2 trillion dollar climate plan whereas trump is actively cutting funding for environmental protections. Plus if trump replaces RBG, there is a very high possibility Roe v Wade will be overturned.
Trumpists: Biden isn't Catholic. Harris isn't African-American.  But it's liberals who are obsessed with identity politics.
‚ÄúDefending the constitution‚Äù üôÑ. In the debates she was asked about gun control and said she would use executive order to bypass congress and ban all firearms. Biden said you can‚Äôt just go over the constitution. She rolled her eyes, laughed, and said yes we can.
I'm sure this has nothing to do with Biden selecting Kamala,  a prosecutor, for VP.
The New York Times: Trump and Fox News Hosts Attack Kamala Harris: Live 2020 Updates.   via
Keep in mind Biden has stated multiple times he would veto M4A if it reaches his desk, and the institutions being protested right now were created by both of them.
I made the point in 2016 that we should all have a minimum threshold of what we're willing to vote for. And for me, both Trump and Hillary were below that threshold. I voted third party.  I have to admit Biden isn't far above that threshold, but he is at the moment. Barely.
Maybe if Biden wins  If Trump wins, no chance
Agree. They are trying to attack her from every side  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the real racist‚Äù ‚Äúshe slept her way to the top‚Äù ‚Äúshe was too tough on black crime‚Äù ‚Äúshe won‚Äôt be tough on crime in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a socialist‚Äù ‚Äúshe‚Äôs loved by Wall Street‚Äù   Too many messages. We need focus.
Have you decided what race you are this time Heels up Harris?When you were campaigning against Biden you were just an ‚ÄúAmerican.‚Äù Now, you‚Äôre black. But that‚Äôs not entirely true, now is it?
No Hillary will soon be VP when Biden dies and Harris picks Hillary as VP. And You know what happens when Hillary wants something. Poor Harris is a goner too.
Correct. None of us have ANY idea what Rice's underlying policy preferences would be if she were POTUS. And while Harris ran as a progressive, she didn't do so convincingly. She's probably MORE inline with Biden / old school liberalism.
Moderate to liberal. I think that's the problem virtually every DEM candidate had. Biden was the ONLY one who understood that the party's voters were NOT as far left as the activist wing. I tweeted repeatedly that Harris and Booker were running in the wrong lane.
You must be a bot because you follow people who share similar interests and viewpoints as you.  Might we suggest you slow down and accept your slow death via the Biden/Harris ticket? - Twitter, probably
Biden is the guy that will soon die and Harris and BLM will have their way.
I voted third party in 2016. My second time to cast a protest vote. While I'm leaning Biden it's not impossible I end up back at a protest vote depending on how things play out.
Anyone who is not a Marxist is now a centrist. üòÇüòÇ  The goal post shifting is nuts. Biden is an old school liberal. They keep calling him a moderate. He's not. Harris is harder to pin down. She ran as a progressive but didn't sell it well. I tend to believe she's just liberal.
Harris said she believes the sex charges against Biden are true.
Call them what they are. These racists weren't voting for Biden anyway.
Harris said she believes the Sexual Charges against Biden are True. Now what.
Interesting that Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon w/ no experience in housing policy, was the only African-American appointed in Trump's cabinet, as the Secretary of HUD.  And now, Corey Booker is the 1st name that Trump thinks of for Biden's public housing Secretary. ü§î

I'm already tired of #HotTakeTwitter over Biden's pick of Harris for VP.
&lt;shrug&gt; Biden was never going to excite the left wing extremists. Many of them don't vote anyway. Vast majority of DEMs, moderate and liberal, will unite just fine behind this ticket. And this ticket won't scare moderate independent / swing state voters. It's the right pick.
To all the people tweeting that Harris will hurt Biden with blacks because of her past as a prosecutor, you're wrong.  Hillary beat Trump 89-8 with the black vote. Biden is likely to do better than this.
She‚Äôs a fake progressive. Warren would have motivated right wing voters WAY more than Harris will. The left will fall in line behind Biden-Harris just fine.
The left will fall in line behind Biden-Harris. Don‚Äôt pretend otherwise.
Yep. Biden basically needs to prove he‚Äôs still relatively competent. If he does that, I think he pretty much cruises to victory. Biden refusing to debate would look terrible.
Hey y‚Äôall. There was no perfect VP choice. There never is. Just like there‚Äôs no perfect presidential nominee. While I would have personally preferred Amy K, Harris is absolutely a competent pick IMO.   Biden risked losing my vote if he‚Äôd chosen Warren, Abrams or Rice.
And the fact that she has the experience and is qualified to run the country if something should happen to Biden.
Good grief, I cannot comprehend thinking Trump is a better choice than anyone, let alone better than Biden/Harris.
With Biden in power I‚Äôm afraid Dems will feel like they don‚Äôt have to pander towards progressives and become more of a right wing political party than they already are
Idk I ultimately seem both as two sides of the same coin. Harris is her own issue with her constant harassment of Black communities and withholding evidence that can overturn convictions. I‚Äôd rather have Biden since he‚Äôs just racist and not dangerous and racist but...
NYTimes: Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
idea: we just put Trump and Biden into a boxing ring, no groin strikes, 12-6 elbows, eye gouging, throttle choking, or forfeit from exhaustion. last one standing wins president. Biden will forget why he‚Äôs there by the first round, and Trump will be out of breath by the same time
‚ÄúBaal, Bombs and Biden‚Äù doesn‚Äôt either.  Just to make sure we are leaving the other side of the Empire out.
The Progressives &amp; Warren supporters have as yet no way of knowing the details of  Biden/Harris/DNC platform. Therefore, it's illogical &amp; immature to assume that platform hasn't been influenced &amp; informed by other perspectives.
People don‚Äôt have a legit reason to joe Biden, they just voting out of hatred ! They can‚Äôt name one policy joe Biden is going for ü§£ü§£ü§£
Proof joe Biden a racist and kamala running with him üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Harris  said she believed the sexual accusers, Not Biden
Nope just facts of the matter. Just like how Trump's accusers never came out until 2016, after he ran for president, whilst Tara Reid's accusations date back to the 90's when she worked under Biden.
Reid, her ex-huband, her mother, and her friends attest she is talking about Biden, but "common sense" says they are talking about a different staffer. Delusion.
So Reid herself, her ex, and her friends attest that she's talking about Biden but you, random twitter user, know that she's ACTUALLY talking about a different staffer in his office. I see.
When Pete was in Delaware a couple of days ago, there were reports that Biden was likely to make him the White House Chief of Staff.
In March 25, 1996, Tara Reade‚Äôs then husband filed a court declaration which stated that Tara Reade had told him in 1993 that she was being sexually harassed while working in the office of Senator Joe Biden.  1996.
Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reid in 1993. Corroborated by Her Friends. Corroborated by Her Mother. Corroborated by Her Ex-Husband.
Eh, but Biden and Kamala are literally neoliberals. That‚Äôs their political description. They won‚Äôt go further left unless it threatens their ability to maintain power. In fact, expect the opposite over the next few months. We did this in 2016.
Fuck Biden, Kamala, Trump, and Pence. All them crackers sucks n ain't none of em gonna do shit to help me...  #JustAnotherDayInAmericaGettinFucked #TakeAnotherBiteOfTheShitSandwichCalledLife

Neither Harris nor Biden support true single payer universal healthcare. Which at this point is the bottom bar for true progressive politics. So yay for four years of ineffective fake progressive politics from the moderate democrats.

Less than 6 months ago you wanted Americans to believe Joe Biden was a racist . You emphasized it over and over ‚Äî what has changed ? Is he still a racist ?or does that drop since he chose you ? Do you have standards ?

The Biden ticket to #BLM supporters
I just wanna know if you're supporting the Biden/Harris ticket, or or are you going to sit this one out, since your girl ain't homecoming queen!
Biden should also announce his short lists for top cabinet posts, starting with Attorney General and Secretary of State, to demonstrate that he will nominate consummate professionals, unlike the current slate of sycophants and toadies.
People who openly defend Biden , are pieces of shit ! And like pedos
I'm not a huge Biden fan, but I've always felt that his empathy and emotion were genuine (unlike Bill Clinton's).
Unless Biden is dead, he will run for re-election in 2024.
I thought the news was just wrong - she had never followed Biden. Was the reporting actual right that she unfollowed him?
Half the Country: #ACAB   Joe Biden:
"what about the other two percent, doc" oh they are making fun of joe biden's vp pick
Are you attracted to women? Would you date an attractive woman if she's not your daughter? Is that weird to you? Must be lonely to be you. Literally the worst things you can come up with are some words. There's videos of Biden groping CHILDREN. Enough said.
Both Harris and Biden have acknowledged the mistaken ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù approach of the early 90s. As DA, Harris routinely reduced pot cases to misdemeanors, did not prosecute juvenile sex workers, and was considered the most progressive DA around by public defenders.
It's always a strawman. There's no videos of Trump fondling anyone. I really don't care what you say or how you feel. I've seen the pictures you're talking about and I've seen the videos of Biden. It's clear to me. Apparently not to you.
Full of hope for women in America. I am so happy that Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala has reignited that hope again.
Yeah we all know Democrats love to flip flop every 14 months thanks for sharing. The videos of Biden groping kids is enough for me thanks.
I thought we were doing a folksy Biden routine.
I hope we have all the film from the primary debates archived between Kamala and Biden.   ‚òïÔ∏è
So what?  Lots of former rivals make good teams. Indeed, Harris on crime probably ends up being an asset for Biden.

Very glad the Dems, during historic anti-police protests, have decided to run ‚Äútop cop‚Äù Kamala and author of the Crime Bill Biden on the same ticket.
I'm on the phone w/ the Biden campaign right now. This public declaration of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate has complicated my VP nomination.
Doesn't matter what the GOP says against her. This pick just further secured the majority of female, African-American, and minority votes for Biden. It was a smart pick and the right pick, IMO.
Never forget their were actual candidates with actual platforms but instead the DNC chose to rally behind Biden.
Between this and The Biden/Harris announcement I think I need to go back to bed.
Look I wanted Liz Warren to be the nominee but I understand why she isn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm fine with it  Every ounce of energy has to go in to making sure that Biden and Harris win this thing. Otherwise the country might not exist in 4 years
Me reacting to Biden picking Harris:
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Thank Christ Biden picked Harris. That means someday we can have a decent president again.

of course joe biden picked kamala, he had to cancel out his pick being a black woman with the fact that she‚Äôs a cop ! üòå
Biden picking Kamala Harris is a BIG F U to all progressives in the country. It just shows how tone deaf he is
LFG   Biden and Harris
Why have Democrats picked such bad and/or boring VPs?  Kaine Biden Edwards Lieberman Gore Bentsen Ferraro Mondale  Ferraro was the only bold choice. Biden might be the first one of the group to actually succeed after their VP nomination.
Joe Biden is out here like
Biden‚Äôs VP better be Bernie in a wig
Fewer players per team but way way more teams   A vaccine won‚Äôt help. It won‚Äôt be readily available and I‚Äôd bet 60-70% of the population won‚Äôt take it right at the start  We‚Äôre 2 solid yrs (that‚Äôs if Biden wins, 5+ yrs if Trump wins) before anything is back to semblance of normal
14 Kansas Biden and Bernie delegates have pledged to vote NO on the Democratic Party Platform. Watch them share why: #DrawtheLine #M4A #M4ANOW #M4AllNow
Really? I've never heard that theory. I've been really upset about Trump's mocking of Biden's speech impediment. If Trump has a reading disability, I would definitely lay off of criticizing things in that area.
Got some inside information about Biden's VP pick.  It's me.  After my tweets yesterday about tampons, Biden said that I had become the clear favorite.
Cardi B is essentially a campaign surrogate for Joe Biden.   I made the mistake of googling WAP.   Each day we stray further from God's light.
Biden's VP pick is the main character in what you're writing now: we good, or totally screwed?
It's been Biden's pandering and public comments that has made this such a public and rotten process. He should have said this one thing: "We will pick the best and most qualified person to be vice president."    created this problem.
Biden‚Äôs going with his heart, Susan Rice will be the vp pick #VPPick #2020Election #Veepstakes
I'm sure the republican spin machine will make it look like Biden isn't capable of being president and everyone will pretend like he's sundowning more than the current president.
OK Biden Who is your Black VP choice going to say took the Goods? Was it Reparations ?
I don't see Biden dying or resigning but I do see Trump stealing the election again.
Biden is also stupid.
Hillary was the MOST PREPARED NOMINEE in history and can‚Äôt even get a VP call from Biden!
How is he responsible job losses? Because it was recommended to shut the economy down by scientists? He is responsible for people getting sick? The GDP drop because of the shutdown?  President "China is Ok" Biden, no shutdown and we would have jobs? BTW, where were jobs when VP?
If Biden said this, it would get 20 minutes each hour on Fox.
It‚Äôs easy to forget the public polling has a watchdog purpose. If the polls have Biden by +6 in a state and they perform consistently across the country, and somehow Trump wins that state by +1: big red flag üö©
Seriously. I refuse to believe that  doesn‚Äôt know who Biden chooses in the finale.
Ok #BachelorNation I can‚Äôt wait any longer to see who Biden has picked as his running mate. I think it‚Äôs time for you to put your sleuthing skills to use.
I can picture it now. Biden introduces Pete, says he fills the campaign's need to improve his polling among young people who have "high hopes" for the future.  Haha gonna light myself on fire.
That would have been too bright. Give Sanders a do nothing job that placates most of his followers but also because of his age guarantees he can't succeed Biden or pick Biden's successor.
Counterpoint: It's Joe Biden.
We‚Äôre only three months away from Election Day and this mf‚Äôer still doesn‚Äôt have a declared VP. Hope the people in states who primary votes actually mattered are feeling like idiots. The only thing that gonna cost Biden the win is himself and a half-baked campaign team.
Lol sounds like Fox News talking about biden
I am voting for Biden. ‚ù§Ô∏è
We need to call debates right now.   Keep the momentum going, and keep Biden on his heels.   After huge EOs helping the middle class its time to get some Biden vs Trump prizefight airtime.   Invite Ye too.
Were is the Biden VP?
Sigh.  In 2016 Hillary beat Trump 89-8 among black voters.  What's your prediction for Trump's share of the black vote in 2020? Biden is more popular among blacks than Hillary was.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  That's not remotely believable. They're just trying to tamp down criticism of Biden's eventual VP pick.
I‚Äôm so tired of going on Facebook and seeing conservatives label Joe Biden as a socialist, it‚Äôs offensive to socialists and leftists every where
Why don‚Äôt you ask the black community what they think about Biden‚Äôs gaffes? (Spoiler alert: they don‚Äôt give a sh*t because trump is a clear and present danger to the country.)
I didn‚Äôt see this in the US papers - a pretty strong statement on nuclear disarmament.
Iran and China are using tactics to convince Americans to vote for Biden  Russia leaking Biden calls to prove he‚Äôs not who he say he is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
When Biden loses she will be ...Who?
Liberals and leftists called for a payroll tax cut just a decade or less ago. There's videos of everyone from Pelosi, Biden, Krugman, etc calling for payroll tax cuts. Another case of TDS, when cheeto does it the dissonance hits and we pretend we never supported the idea.

People voting for joe Biden just don‚Äôt like trump. Carol Haskins can run against trump and 40% of the US would vote for her lol

Would you be willing to commit, right now, to calling bullshit on the hordes of republicans that will immediately bask in the sacredness of the constitution if Biden is elected? They are going to offer you lots of power in exchange for keeping your mouth shut.
We will just have to disagree agree on this. Because yes people should give to the candidates not them BUT until Trump is out of office I will take their help. I‚Äôm under no allusion that they will continue to be on our side November 4 if Biden wins.
Except it was. It seems the headline is changed but the same thing is in the piece.
And Biden? HA.. HA HA HA Ha. What did I .....say..????
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Joe Biden seems determined to screw up his lead.  What is wrong with leadership.    Stop making jokes, Joe.  You're hurting your own campaign!
Traditionally this is true. This is the first time that for me, it will matter. I won‚Äôt vote Trump. And since I think it‚Äôs possible Biden won‚Äôt last the term, his VP choice matters to me.
Biden gets elected, turns the presidency over to a minority woman, she gets voted out next election, we are all racist and sexists again.
BREAKING: Biden has not chosen me as his running mate.
Biden is riding a bike. How about we skip the debates and have a Trump-Biden bike race?
I'm from WI &amp; I live in KS.  We want  to take votes from Biden &amp; Trump.  If your candidate is so solid, why not #LetHerSpeak?
Biden has known for a while who he‚Äôs going to pick. It‚Äôs just that his advisors don‚Äôt like her and keep pushing for alternatives.
You know what? Somebody on Biden's staff crafts these tweets, and that's GOOD, because Biden will surround himself with a staff that is GOOD.
And this is exactly why Biden should not debate a pathological liar, because Biden would end up having to defend himself against absolute nonsense.  To paraphrase the adage, never debate a lying fool, because, in the end, one won‚Äôt be able to tell who is who.
Here is what Biden should do: hold a press conference at the same hour every day to 1) identify and play a clip of the lies told by the president the previous day; 2) then the tell the real, evidence-based facts.
Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!  via
All due respect, AND let me be 100% CRYSTAL CLEAR you are DUE ZERO respect, you are A TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD human. YOU BREATHE IN LIES. YOU EXHALE LIES. Joe Biden could be in a coma w/HALF of his BRAIN missing, he'd STILL BE MORE QUALIFIED THAN YOU TO BE POTUS!!!
Biden already had my vote, but now he can destroy God? Sign me the fuck up.
The key difference is only one campaign demonstratively worked with a foreign government to gather illegally obtained information against an opponent. The other is Biden.
So you acknowledge this isn‚Äôt Team Biden?
And now he says that Portland is the "radical left's" "roadmap for America." He says the radical left will turn the country into Portland if Biden is elected.
Who is dumping?   If I were high level on Biden campaign I might be self dumping to get reactions and start inoculating the press a bit.
Biden has pandered endlessly (in particular about narrowing his search only to women of color). Then they basically trotted them at one at a time (testing the waters) to get them shredded and exposed. What a terrible way to pick your VP.

What trump appointee is in charge of the FDA? I don't trust the safety of a vaccine until Biden's people say it's safe.
idk man Biden has appeared confused and delivered constant gaffes and it hasn't seemed to matter so far...
The presidential debates are terrifying; the cards are stacked against Biden. He must NOT ONCE appear confused or have a verbal gaffe. Trump can continue to display his constant inability to comprehend words or speak coherently and that's just Trump?
Is Biden gaffe-prone and says foolish, entitled crap? Yup. I read his Latinos comment as Dems taking black voters for granted. Should he be much more careful? Yup. Does perniciously racist, &amp; hate-mongering, privileged current president have any grounds to criticize Biden?! NO!
Okay. Two tweets. I‚Äôm a bad patient. The poll also shows Trump up 50-43 over Biden. And Trump only +3 on job approval in KS (48-45). All in the ballpark of the limited polling we‚Äôve seen so far this year in KS. We‚Äôll be a Trump state, but maybe not as strongly as 2016, I‚Äôd bet.
My favorite news program. It's worth staying up late to hear wit like his.
Media: We know Biden sucks but TRUMP IS HITLER.
Not sure who's the brainiac behind Trump's strategy in this. I think West's presence pulls at least as much from Trump as Biden.
Biden will soon show how lost he really is.
The media will have a conniption when Trump is awful in the debates but starts closing the gap in the polls with Biden.
The media has run a few kind of generic stories like this one. But they refuse to say what should be obvious. We're taking a significant risk electing a 78 year to their first term.
The lead story on  was Biden's dumb comment about Black Americans. They spent four minutes on it, including a montage of 15 years of Biden gaffes. "Nobody is watching Biden screwing up" (because of the pandemic). Has Trump ever not said dumb things every day?
The media refuses to acknowledge that age is an issue with Biden. I‚Äôve been called an ageist for even bringing it up on twitter.
Um, the whole Russia thing...made up. Obama, Biden, Rice, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, Comey, Strozck, Paige, and more...about to be in the news. Not in a good way.
no u, but yeah fuck BidenWhen Biden‚Äôs AG indicts Trump &amp; any of his appointees, it won‚Äôt be a political stunt/move. They have been repeatedly breaking the law, in plain view of the world, documented in countless tweets, phone interviews, and ‚Äúpress conferences.‚Äù 2/2
Lol, so much Russian Collusion, let‚Äôs impeach him on a Ukraine phone call! And Not one person was charged with the Russian Collusion hoax. But again, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black!‚Äù
Trump is playing chess. It is not the position, but the threat. Threaten the postal service. Democrats must position them selves to counter act. Play the game. Reverse the roll. Take charge and attack Trump. He is beatable. Biden knows this.
I think Biden/Harris will win Georgia.
Believe in the Biden team. We came this far. Trump is pulling his bull shit. So what? His strategy does not bother me. It motivates me to beat him more. Vote early. Tell your friends. Problem solved.
And do does Biden.
What‚Äôs sweet sweet Jill Biden‚Äôs payoff
Probably.  But the irony of black women being Biden‚Äôs firewall when he has done more to decimate black families than any other living politician is galling.
The only question remaining in this election cycle is, what are the Republicans going to do when they are the minority in DC? It's over. Trump will not win. I am that confidant. Biden's team has got all Trump's plays covered. Trump knows he is done.
Biden's team is very aware of Trump's treasonous actions with the post office. Don't you think there will be lawsuits before the election? I am not worried. This will be an ass kicking on Trump.
It is not my problem that you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.  [It is within the realm of possibility for one person to loathe both Trump and Biden.]
Think about this. Biden is from Delaware. Democrat win. Harris from California. Democrat win. Pence from Indiana. Repub. Win. Trump from Florida. Democrat win. Trump is the odd man out. Biden-Harris 2020.
Relax Democrats. Biden will win. Breath. Trump late night election steal will not happen again. One reason, people are tired of the lies and treasonous acts against America. DC will be dominated by the Democrats.
Only number Joe Biden needs is 270. The electoral college has myriad options for Biden. Biden is neck and neck with Trump in red states. This speaks volumes. Trump's road is so narrow. Biden 2020.
Truth üé¨ domino Biden almost down!
If Trump is really for America, he wouldn't cut Postal funding. This is near treasonous behavior. Go for it Trump. Add to the unemployment line. In the end, you still lose to Biden.

dude, not voting is a vote for biden... not cool man.
From  I make no apologies for Biden's untenable position on abortion, but the reduction of the Catholic faith to this one issue has been a pastoral as well as a political dead-end, a distortion of Catholic moral teaching that must stop.
Ebola killed 2 people here.  Obama and Biden stopped it before it got here.  And you KNOW this.  You look very smart.
That does not address the question at hand? How is it that you can blame those problems on a Biden election if it‚Äôs currently happening under a Trump presidency?
This comes from knowing no one wants her. Biden &amp; Harris don't even want her she embarrasses Obama every chance she gets .

Lowest black unemployment, investment in impoverished communities, highest rate of black owned businesses, historic investment in traditional black colleges, justice reform, most new black business loans.    I antied up.   Now you do Biden/Harris.
Fairly encouraging numbers for Trump.  If Biden is so low now, after successfully hiding for months, what is he going to be in another two months?
OK....Can we get past the "woman" thing. We all know she is a woman. But she is a person and the most qualified person Pres. Biden could have picked. AND she can reach more people because they can relate to her.

You really believe that? Biden mentioned gender and skin color months ago as his criteria for the veep selection. That‚Äôs the main reason pundits had the insufferable nincompoop Abrams high on the list of choices.
The blacks will still vote for the racist Biden and brownie hound Harris, after all blacks kill more blacks than any other race yet they started BLM.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they vote for the two people that care the least about their race.  Harris = slimiest in office.
You must never tell blacks that Biden is not their friend.  I have been called a ‚Äúracist bitch,‚Äù and told to stay in my own lane.
We didn't vote for Trump because he's a really nice guy, we voted for him because he can get the job done.  Search 'Biden accomplishments' vs 'Trump accomplishments.'  Trump is the best by far.

We‚Äôll need four years of introspection and healing after this election, and Biden‚Äôs done nothing if not offer that service to Americans his entire adult life. He‚Äôll use his personal tragedies to empathize with all of us. We could all use a Grandpa Joe in our lives right now.

You‚Äôre digging a deeper hole. Don‚Äôt play word games. Just say yes, Biden and Harris need to answer questions.
It's 2020 and the Republican party is strongly warning me that Joe Biden is coming for my meat.
Trump and Biden are polar opposites when it comes to policy.

Alot of people call themselves anti imperialist but they are telling people to vote for Biden  Very confusing
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Why do they think will have leverage over Biden when Biden already said he will be a one term president?  Obama did all the shit he did while worrying about reelection  Biden is to his RIGHT and doesnt have to worry about it plus you pledged your vote. Makes no sense
But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.
Do you really not remember biden and Obama championing pipelines and incentivizing the massive expansion of fracking wells for natural gas?  Wells which are currently vomiting super-greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, totally uncontrolled, as they are abandoned?

You know Biden wins Florida. Trump has zero chance at reelection. Bet you a good cigar.
I want him to explain how we push Biden to the left after pledging out vote to him when he's going to be a one term president anyway and dont have to worry about reelection  Very interested in hearing it
I have issues with the woman that basically called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers jumping at the chance to run with him.
Dude. Trump can't win. End of story. Biden is so prepared. 600 lawyers ready at his response. Done deal.
punching left accomplishes what exactly?  He is a fucking grifter  He is pissing more people off than convincing to vote Biden
If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.
If Joe Biden were president, we‚Äôd already be past the worst of this. Instead we have record-setting unemployment and 200,000 deaths projected through next month. Please look at reality. Or just keep quiet.

To put it bluntly: biden and the democrats explicitly aren't even offering bread and circuses and have rejected doing so for costs. They're at best just promising that the prison guard kicking you in the stomach might not be a white man, perhaps, someday.

You keep shifting to your hatred of Trump.  I'm trying to focus on Biden and D's lying about what he said and thereby creating further racial division in their pursuit of power. I don't think people should be okay with it. I assume, you would not be, if you did not hate Trump.
You can hate Trump (as you obviously do) and still criticize Biden and D's for lying about what he said.
My main question is that if Biden wins and he raises taxes on the top 1% and Fortune 500 companies who will provide jobs for Americans when they take their factories to other countries? Please explain. I‚Äôve never ever got a definitive answer on this.
To state the obvious, Biden and D's are lying about what Trump said that day.  To create racial division to achieve political power. And you are okay with it.
I‚Äôm sorry, but no. Neither Biden nor Harris are socialists, &amp; they haven‚Äôt called for abolishing police.  However, Trump is actively hollowing out the government, profiting from it, is a white supremacist, and has let Covid completely overrun the country while calling it a hoax.
And this.
If you are honest and open minded, read this and let me know your thoughts.  Put Trump's flaws to one side for a moment.
Tom, any concern about Biden and D's doing this -- smart liberal honest former law school professor sees Biden creating racial division in the pursuit of power.

Again violating my vow to stay away on political stuff. Other day you  questioned if D's falsely created racial division to pursue power. See below by smart liberal honest former law school professor. You seem interested in truth.

The longer AOC talks, the greater the risk she‚Äôll point out that Biden is a racist with dementia and that KamAllah is descended from slave owners, and that AOC is the best candidate to lead a fascist global new world order.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE REPUBLICAN IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.     BIDEN DONATES MONEY TO RIOTERS TO GET THEM OUT OF JAIL, THEY HAVE A FUND.
I don't think Claire has many open minded followers, but for any who are here, look at how liberal former law professor Ann Althouse views Biden's and D's intentional creation of racial division to pursue political power.
I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
If you consider yourself on the left and you are busy pushing and holding water for Joe Biden instead of helping with a #GeneralStrike, you are a fraud  Sorry, not sorry
If you are annoyed that Biden isn‚Äôt exactly who you want to vote for, so are unexcited about participating in this election: I have good news!    If you vote some random third party or sit out the election, you won‚Äôt have to worry about voting ever again.
If Trump wins but Democrats retake the Senate and the House  What exactly could Trump get accomplished that Joe Biden wouldn't already do?
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD BRAIN SURGERIES, POLL EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  P0LL:  59% THINK BIDEN'S UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM  RAISE TAXES, DEFUND POLICE, SOCIALIZE MEDICINE, GET RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL
#throwbackthursday  Swears-In  as Senator.
Is the doturd for real?  The guy who said it would magically disappear is throwing shade on Biden? Get the hell outta here!
Did anyone hear #whimpyPence say we're not going to let Biden &amp; Harris take away your meat!  Ooooh Burn!
Make it fair and ask Joe Biden the same question! I heard plenty of whoppers coming from Joe.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS  A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC  BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP AGREE WITH AP-NORC POLL STATES TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC
I can‚Äôt imagine there are many Catholics who would change their vote from Trump to Biden because Biden was denied communion.
Amazing if you mispronounce her name you are now a Racist??? Biden cannot even say it right.
Yes its happening  Can't wait to crush this Biden bro

Why does the Missouri GOP ignore the voters on Clean Missouri? I guess some things are just an unconstitutional mystery.
I think it's just classic projection. They know Donald Trump did not follow the science and they're blaming Biden even though he wasn't the president and Biden did respect the science.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, RACIST &amp; SEXIST.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD POLL:  59% THINK BIDEN'S UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM  CAREER ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES

BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DON'T AGREE WITH BIDEN'S CHOICE FOR VP.  POLL: 59% THINK BIDEN IS UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM.  A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC.  TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE.  LEADER.
I thought the way biden put his hand at the small of her back while walking across stage was inappropriate. Something like that my husband would do to me, not a stranger.
LMAO at libs who think they will be able to go back to brunch under a Joe Biden administration   We should #GeneralStrike when he's in office to for Medicare for All   Completely evil not to support it in the middle of a pandemic
Ben Shapiro: Democrats slammed federal presence in US cities, but they want to 'send the feds to yell at you about masks?'
The number one priority for progressives should be organizing a #GeneralStrike, not holding water for fucking Joe Biden and the Democratic Party who are complicit with this shit
The reason why I know you are a deeply unserious grifter is because if you really believed Trump was this existential threat, instead of punching down at people with no money or no power, you would have hit the phones to actually help Biden win  Who's chasing clout now?
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DOESN'T THINK IT IS FAIR THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T COVER BIDEN'S HEALTH &amp; FITNESS.  VOTERS NEED TO KNOW IF A CANDIDATE CAN DO THE JOB.  TRUMP SUCCESSES ARE TAX CUTS, ECONOMY, UNLEASHING DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, &amp; THE COURTS.
Very concerning ticket... I just don't see how progressive Democrats will be able to vote for Biden/Harris... Though I also though Christian conservatives wouldn't vote Trump. So wtf do I know.
Joe Biden wants to shut down ice cream parlors, close amusement parks and put a complete ban on board games.
lol fuck kamala harris and joe biden.
*biden's script writers plagiarized announcement speech
Trump Derangement Syndrome made progressives completely forget about how shitty Joe Biden is.   the youtube grifting Democratic operative said protesters wouldnt get brutalize under Biden like Trump  Completely forgetting about Standing Rock and Ferguson  What a dipshit
I love it! Here is mine:  I am writing to you out of concern for our country. To save the soul of our nation and our lives, vote blue in November. Vote for Joe Biden!

Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'
Trump knows he's slated to lose He's throwing the kitchen sink at Biden/Harris but you're right it won't work Trump will not only lose in early November, he'll lose big Trump will lose big and knowing his next destination is prison, he'll start selling his kids out 4 leniency
As part of his bid to scare white suburban voters into supporting President Donald Trump in November, his campaign falsely accused Biden‚Äôs campaign of freeing from jail a ‚Äúmurderer,‚Äù a ‚Äúserial rapist,‚Äù a ‚Äúviolent fugitive,‚Äù and an ‚Äúattempted cop killer.‚Äù
Shitty progressives like  can easily pitch Joe Biden because he is fucking ignorant about how trash the Obama administration was  He was part of the class who wasnt devastated by their policies  But he thinks he can shame black leftists to vote for a racist? Fuck you
Oh ask Joe Biden what he thinks?? He gives credit to the Obama administration almost 4 years ago for Trump's hard work
Because of his opponent. Did you notice how Biden never accepts extemporaneous questions? Why do you think that is?
I have 2 daughters...I don't want them living in Biden's America! I'll die for them. Trust!
Biden / Harris 2020~ !!! Let's bring honesty, CLASS, respect, and intelligence back to the White House.  America misses those qualities in a President.
"I was one of the people who publicly expressed concern about Harris during her presidential campaign. A few key things have changed since then ... my politics have changed."  Translation: I went from critic to bootlicker within 2 changing seasons.
Libs: Trump wants to be a dictator! An autocrat!! Trump: The governors should make decisions. They know what works for them. Libs: He is not a good leader!  Biden: All governors should require people to wear a mask. Kamala: That's what leadership looks like. Libs: Yay!!
Don the con is going to raise taxes to the middle class to pay for his failed reaction to Covid. Biden will tax billionaires which means trump will pay more. Trump is going to spread any lies to get reelected to pay less in taxes and to stay out of jail for tax evasion.
Biden has his downside being an old white man and an establishment Dem. Kamala being selected shows the progress. This ticket is the best Dems have to beat the current GOP. But u don't beat GOP voter suppression without the black vote. After that women will lead the country.
So Biden‚Äôs not winning then?
I love the convo. But the Dem party has been making strides since 2018 w/ black women and other minority women (AOC, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley&amp;Rashida Talib) beating out old establishment Dems. While introducing new ideas and bills. Biden is to appease old Dems. Party unity.
Biden picks Harris for running¬†mate
Seems like all of the Biden press is positive and the Trump press is negative.  Who would have thought that?
I agree! She threatened Biden.
Biden mumbled and was zoned out today- ü•±üò¥ü§§.  Would you explain to Marie the importance that I know WHY JOE HAS NEVER had a covid test? Marie, hasn‚Äôt he gotten the COVID test ‚Äúout of the goodness of his heart?‚Äù
Best President ever. Biden/Harris cannot even come close
Wrecking the post office to interfere w/ mail-in voting &amp; set it up for privatization is 1000x more terrible than refusing to help Ukraine w/ its proxy war w/ Russia if they don't investigate Biden (or whatever the impeachment was supposed to be about)
No, we're not. It's coming back up because folks who haven't paid attention during the primary are now looking to get caught up for the general.  These folks that haven't any clue about Biden or Harris beyond the headlines of articles they've been scrolling past in the last year.
I would trust Biden to do a better job than Trump with the virus anytime
Bernie‚Äôs volunteers [as opposed to paid staff, a/k/a Jeff Weaver] and donors deserved better.  I know unpaid volunteers who gave up at least two years of their lives because they believed in the urgency of M4A.  And then immediately endorsing Biden?  WTFF?
I hope she and Biden don‚Äôt give it the time of day. Sadly, I think one of Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes was releasing his birth certificate rather than dismissing the accusations as nonsense
I will never vote for Biden, but I will admit you make a good point.
Exactly! As the saying goes, as Ohio goes, so does the country or something like that. Biden is actually faring well in OH. Let‚Äôs turn it blue!
Don‚Äôt get the rambling(see Joe Biden), thought he was well spoken and very thoughtful!
College students shocked to hear 'Biden' student loan plan is really Trump's: 'I hate him, but that's a start'
I live in Missouri. More than half of my extended family and friends voted for him. This is my plea to everyone to please, if you can‚Äôt stomach voting for Joe Biden, don‚Äôt vote.  Trump and DeJoy are already making sure people CANT vote.  This right is supposed to be guaranteed.
trump does megacrimes; I'm sorry there is nothing we can do about this   trump points out biden's crackhead son got a literal sack of diamonds as a bribe: HAVE YOU NO DECENCY SIR
Trump littrally AVOIDS and RUNS from questions when he is in the hot seat especially when he KNOWS he is useless and in the wrong Biden isn‚Äôt even president and he is criticizing him like he is ü§°
All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
Meredith Brooks blasts Kamala Harris for now siding with Joe Biden on Tara Reade allegations
So what you're saying is you race by, pay no attention to citizens, don't even bother to care about anything but yourself based on your speed while Biden goes by at a reasonable pace to speak with people and doesn't race past them? Cool
Know who I think should speak at the DNC convention? Fuckin, whoever the Biden campaign thinks should speak. They have made zero mistakes so far so let‚Äôs just trust the process, folks.
Have you turned over to the FBI the anti-Biden material you received from Ukrainian/Russian sources according to US Intel ? To not do so might be construed as criminal, even treasonous.
Can you please provide specifics on how the Green New Deal would "end Kansas agriculture"? Also, can you please provide documentation where Joe Biden endorsed the Green New Deal?
VP Biden has years of experience in government and can spell, unlike you. Your point?
I cannot believe the anti-mask idiocy. Biden takes a stand to call for a nationwide mask mandate, and the MAGAts come crawling out of the muck exclaiming, "But my freedom!" Please. It's not about freedom. It's about saving American lives! If you're a "patriot" then act like it.
KAMALA HARRIS BRINGS NOTHING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, SHE ISN'T BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.  MALES BLACK,  WHITES, &amp; LATINOS ARE UPSET WITH BIDEN FOR NOT BEING CONSIDERED.  IT IS ASTONISHING HOW BIDEN WAS ABLE TO PICK A RUNNING MATE HAS DONE MORE DAMAGE.
The onion is right! Biden really did need more centrist to even out all the centrism on the ticket
Neither one really like each other. Waiting for a Biden‚Äôs dementia breakdown, Referring Harris to the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word.  Dementia patients revert back to early years in life.
Biden has already said that he wants Bloomberg in his cabinet.  And Jamie Dimon.
It didn't spread cause Obama and Biden took care of it for the country.
Joe Biden is so toxic that his "you ain't black" comments have white liberals believing they can talk to black people this way  Fuck the Democratic Party
Remember how Joe Biden's team deleted all their Brett Kavanaugh #MeToo tweets in response to the Tara Reade bombshell?  Joe Biden is so toxic he turned liberal feminists into rape apologists
first of all no one said they LIKED biden/kamala but i 100 percent would rather vote them in and bully them to the left than have 4 more years of an entire administration of evil ass people
Biden has no idea what he is talking about. But one thing is for certain: he wants to control every aspect of your life.
Joe Biden said that he's a bridge to Pete Buttigieg yet charlatans still selling the idea that we can push him to the left üòí
than donald trump and his cabinet of racist/sexist/transphobic goons. the goal is to get biden in office and then push them further left. i don‚Äôt get why marginalized groups wouldn‚Äôt vote for him.
Biden/Harris2020 - We won't kill your kids*.  *certain restrictions may apply, see political platform and voting record for details
At least President Biden has faith. tRump's faith is the church of "People are Sheep" and I am ready to shear them all.
Joe Biden just provided us the leadership we need, by overtly politicizing masks ‚Äî something the Republicans have sneaked around while using it as a tool.
CNN carrying Biden live doesn't mean anyone is seeing it. Kind of a tree falling in an empty forest sort of thing.
Agreed - and nevertheless Biden/Harris have my vote....she is a great speaker.  I wonder who Axl was hoping for...ü§î
What do people think of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Here‚Äôs what initial polls say
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚ÄùYeah the Vermont result was the one that made it seem inevitable that Biden would win, especially Biden winning Virginia by more than Sanders did Vermont.
Keep up the good work President Trump. We will continue to welcome Republicans who are changing there vote to Biden! Love the #LincolnProjectEffect
But baby trump, Biden &amp; Harris are grownups &amp; moved on with their common goals for the good of our country.  you should try it. It‚Äôs what leaders do.
Oof can‚Äôt image that really swaying your choice that much. I‚Äôve been bullied by so many trump supporters, even some Biden supporters. A few people aren‚Äôt the big picture.
I think it‚Äôs that your area was small that you went through &amp; Biden supporters aren‚Äôt nearly as obnoxious as trump supporters. Just realize there isn‚Äôt a silent majority - you all have a shit ton of yard signs.
Please vote for the greater good. Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt sabotage the USPS for personal political gain especially considering it delays veterans from receiving their mailed medication prescriptions
You have to admit there's better things for him to be speaking about right now than an entire lineup of speeches about Joe Biden's failures, specifically. So many moves from this administration feel like they came directly from the mind of a 13 year old.
Everyone should view this video showing the past history of  Joe Biden continuously lying:
As Biden promises to rein in private prisons, they're throwing money at Republicans  via
Biden outworking dt again...
Trump or Biden. They‚Äôre both trash
What kind of fantasyland do you live in if you think Biden is radical... Biden! Lol
And Kamala called Joe Biden a racist in how she described hium at the debates.
They say trump, Pence, Biden, but not Harris. They also said Barack Hussein Obama.
Hahaha! Really Mike, you think we are that stupid? Come-on-man.   You know what you guys did do? Your sorry actions, caused 165,000 American deaths. A number VP Biden &amp; Pres Obama can‚Äôt match. You are disgusting &amp; sick for even bragging about this with your tremendous failure.
I've noticed, people mostly say trump, Pence, or Biden when referring to those men, so why are they not saying Harris?  Why is tucker say ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù, especially when he doesn‚Äôt know how to pronounce it?
Hahaha how tf did Biden get Kamala to talk about Amtrak in her own speech lol. "Riding the rails"
Hey  - any comment yet on president Trump‚Äôs outright verbal attack on Joe Biden‚Äôs faith - claiming he‚Äôs ‚Äòagainst God‚Äô? Or will you remain the silent coward and not speak out against the attack on faith?  Still waiting to hear from you
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Yeah, I laughed when trump said that today. They had that line written from the get-go, no matter Biden's choice. I think trump was drooling for Warren, but so was I - for very different reasons.
This is all on trump. PPE was essential for their lives &amp; he could have gotten it manufactured here, if he cared. He had the power &amp; chose to ignore their needs - our needs too. All those special healthcare providers died, because trump refused to do his job.  Elect Biden/Harris.
She might as well since Biden will be gone
I‚Äôm a little sad, because I wanted you Senator Warren. I will support Biden/Harris, because I know you will.
Dear Humans: Please let‚Äôs all overcome our hateful past and get behind the Biden-Harris ticket. They are who America needs right now!! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
She doesn‚Äôt fight for the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù when that little guy is in the womb. She loves the option of abortion up until birth, fights for Planned Parenthood to the point of breaking the law and covering it up. If any pro life voter votes for Biden, I‚Äôm shocked.
She would've done better if Biden hadn't been in the mix. He had the "juice" because of his association &amp; friendship with Pres. Obama.
Have heard a lot of folks say that as they traveled to stir his from around the country trump signs outnumbered Biden signs 10-1
If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Biden‚Äôs extensive plans, here‚Äôs a link!
A vote for a Biden-Harris ticket is a vote for:  -Making 4-year colleges tuition free for a large majority of students -The reversal of Trumps painful and deceitful immigration laws -A thorough climate plan, with trillions in government funding to get us carbon neutral ASAP
I don't have much to say on Kamala herself but their strategy for picking the VP is so dumb. Like Biden is already centrist as shit, what are they doing trying to appeal to Republicans even more? Can we please just once unite the rest of our party?
This is a great choice, solid ticket  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as vice president - The Washington Post
Kamala Harris being Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick is pretty awesome I would have been happy with her or Elizabeth Warren.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his running mate
Just as predicted the most corrupt president in American history is pulling out the most corrupt measures to try and get re-elected from sabotaging the USPS and mail-in ballots to more brazenly colluding with Russia to smear Biden &amp; again interfere in our election üò°
Joe Biden can when a debate with Trump even if Joe was anesthetized. Trump vocabulary consists of about 50 words.
Yeah, let Biden do it.
I read a real bad take on Biden and the VP choice (and apparently the slow nature of it). I could only think of you. So I guess you're doing well on the organic marketing of the new book.
Let‚Äôs see a Biden speech
Biden has been working in the system for 50 years and has done nothing to help.  Furthermore, based on his remarks in the past, he doesn‚Äôt want to.
I'd find it much easier to vote for Biden if he'd stop lying again and again and again.
But Joe Biden
Someone tell the Secret Service these guys are stalking Biden.
it isn‚Äôt even Trump vs Biden anymore for me,  it‚Äôs American freedom vs Communist tyranny
At this point I think the presidential debates should consit of all canadates trying to put shapes in the correct hole on those baby toys, because I‚Äôm 90% sure Biden and trump are to incompetent to do so  #LetHerSpeak #LetHerDebate
I‚Äôll feel disappointed but I feel like Biden is a puppet for people who will push him in a direction I agree with. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for. All I care about is having someone in office who will work harder for the environment.
False. Biden is picking up Bernies environment plan. Trump is for fracking and that cannot keep happening. It‚Äôs not really about politics or sides. It‚Äôs about who will help the earth and who won‚Äôt.
ending new fracking would mean it would stop. You can only do it in a location once so once active locations were done it would be over.
Anarchy- vote Biden bros.  I have a hard time feeling sorry. They voted for this government.  There‚Äôs no real change ever without chaos.  Live it. Then decide how to vote next time.
We don‚Äôt trust you Ron, because you carry water for trump &amp; Putin. You are dishonest with the American people about the Russians, Ukraine, &amp; Biden. LIES.

There are plenty of bad things you can say about Joe Biden that are true, but attacking his faith does not fit into that category
Not gonna lie, the way Joe Biden talks on camera Yeezy could beat him in a debate while rapping the points.
‚ÄúI know that four more years of Trump will further damage, possibly beyond repair, the institutions we hold so dear in this country.‚Äù&amp; ‚ÄúAfter nearly four years of Trump‚Äôs chaos..., S.E. you‚Äôre just ‚Äúconsidering‚Äù voting for Biden? And it depends on his running mate? Jesus Christ!
Joe Biden‚Äôs Statement on Faith. Like so many people, my faith has been‚Ä¶ | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
What I just gave you was literally Biden's stance from the primary. It's weird, because the "Biden wants to abolish charter schools" is a debunked claim made by Trump.
"After serving in an administration that promoted charter schools, former Vice President Joe Biden walks a fine line on the topic. He has said he‚Äôs opposed to for-profit charter schools, saying "it siphons off money for our public schools, which are already in enough trouble."
FAIR: As Biden Mulls VP Pick, Pundits Vie for Most Substance-Free Forecast -
There is a difference between charter schools and for profit charter schools. Biden is against for profit charter schools...which is about 10% of charter schools.
Wait, are we calling Yang and his UBI campaign "moderate?" Biden is about as center left as you get.
Romans 4:20...And the Lord hath a glass jaw. Let not the Biden striketh him.Probably a reason Biden waited as long as possible to announce her.
Would you serve in the Biden admin if you were asked to?  Are you feeling ok now?
You‚Äôre worried about winning against Joe Biden! So you begin to play dirty. The only way to win is if you CHEAT! The USPS is failing so you put someone in charge so you can make sure mail in votes don‚Äôt get counted
HANNITY ISNT TALKING ABOUT TRUMP YOU BUFFOONS!! HE IS TALKING ABOUT BIDEN
Hey Jim, why aren't you asking why Biden and Harris refused to answer questions at their press event today?  #Hypocrite #FakeNews
Joe Biden, you are dead broke.  The Dems are Dead Broke. You over spent for 40 years and produced nothing but debt.  You've literally stolen the future of millions of Americans. We don't trust you and your Nuclear Bomb, Trampala.
But, they're going to lie &amp; do their best to hide how really ugly Joe Biden is.
I know.  People need to think long and hard about that fact.  Do we want 4 years of Obama?  Nope.  We put in 8 years, we put up with him not yelling everyday to remove him.  I want to know how criminal Biden can run for President?  He‚Äôs wanted in Ukraine.  He‚Äôs a criminal.
At least Rudy's daughter is smart enough to endorse Biden.  #NastyWomenAgainstTrump
Here's a wild idea. Biden wears a mask because hes not actually talking it's someone else speaking using software to make themselves sound like biden through a PA speaker
if Maggie Rogers wants me to vote for joe Biden I will do it...I guess
i loathe biden as much as one person can loathe another but please vote for him
If you vote for anyone besides Biden, at this point, you do want Trump in office. So yes, you'll continue to be called out.
Joe Biden is a blatant LIAR!!!
Lindsey Graham needs a hearing aid.  Several.  And Mitch "Mumbles" McConnell is one step away from being Joe Biden.  Nancy Pelosi is a Meth Head.  I wouldn't give a nickel to any of them.  All they'd do is send you a bill to tax you on the nickel.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president:  #KAKEnews
So best case scenario if Biden wins that America somehow survives? That‚Äôs not the question. The question is: Are we better off than today? Will a pro-abortion, pro wealth re-distribution, anti-Capitalism, anti-Christian worldview from the top make us a better or worse country?
Well I hope those 150 black men see that and forget Biden.
Trampala Harris and Traitor Joe had a press conference today, and Joe Biden couldn't even speak.  It's obvious Biden is not running for President. Harris is the Radical Dem's pick, in charge of destroying the Constitution.
Hmmm... seems Trump, his Minions and Biden and his Minions have all started in with each of their respective narratives on why the election results will be null and void. Linking what Graham said with Our current state, could We imply Our current Regime is Corrupt as well? ü§îü§îü§î
Why is Joe Biden being allowed to run for President?  He‚Äôs been named as someone who was in a meeting framing Flynn?
Many of them do.  Joe Biden owns hunting shotguns and a Beretta handgun.
I've seen the theory that the best way to maximize your vote is to vote 3rd party, as:  1. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for Trump 2. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for Biden 3. A vote for a 3rd party is a vote for the 3rd party candidate.  Ergo, it's worth 3 votes!!!
Biden cant fix anything he barely knows what's going on in his own basement
Snowden came out with a book at the beginning of the primary pushing Russian disinfo on President Obama and VP Biden. That's what this is about. trump wants him to help attack our election and democracy.
No no no no. Shame on you ACLU. He's a traitor who most recently promoted Russian disinfo Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden. He put lives in danger.  He is neither a whistleblower nor a hero.
At beginning of the primary Snowden pushed his book (which US news media stupidly gave him a platform to do) during which he insinuated all sorts of things about Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden, in case anyone's wondering what this traitor's cooking up with the traitor in our WH.
Biden may have some social ineptitude as far as boundaries, but awkwardness and documented sexual assault with dozens of victims and keeping close company and association with Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell are 2 entirely separate things.
It's going to be hilarious when they're making these about Biden 10 seconds after he's sworn in.
Wow, knew Biden already sucked by himself,  now with this Broad he has running with him. How comical.  LOSERS
Vote for Biden.
And Pirro‚Äôs ominous words that something will happen to Biden. Does she know something?
I wish I knew you in person. That way I could remonstrate as Jesus exemplified and the Apostle Paul exhorted, in private. You‚Äôre not being clever or funny, or charitable. You do not know the state of Joe Biden‚Äôs soul.
voting will help, but it IS NOT the end all, say all answer, that‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt get. Sure, let‚Äôs get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris elected, but unless we can push them left and unless they stand up to Wall Street and corporate America, and put actual Americans first.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My family is voting for Biden Harris to restore sanity and the rule of law so trump is going down these are his last few months Mr Woods. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
...really? Vote for Biden. Why is this so difficult?
Is this playing role reversal?  They know Trump won‚Äôt be so they have to claim its Biden. This way when it happens, there will be disbelief?
Save our Democracy and vote for Biden. Trump will only get worse.

Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden is calling for a three-month mask wearing mandate -- news at 5:00.
Mispronouncing Kamala‚Äôs name is playing into what the Biden Harris camp want because everytime you show your misogyny you lose lots of votes but you can‚Äôt help yourself so goodluck in November. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Wrong!! You always talk so badly about yourself! Ha ha! trump our country is in dire straights from what you have done to Mother Nature! You‚Äôre ruining everything on the planet. Vote for Joe Biden!
I think he‚Äôs right. Many of his supporters follow him blindly! Because of this we need to get out the vote. This election will be the most important election of our lives!  Biden must win this election!
While we are fretting, I don't see anyone saying they're giving up or that he's winning in any way. Biden raised an astonishing amount of money in the last day, people are gearing up to fight.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Sigh. I guess. It just feels dangerous to give ammunition to the privatization crowd. I live across town from the Koch bros. and I know they have so much money and power. Hopefully Biden and his people can also quash that power a bit.

I really can't stand white people saying there's no difference between Trump and Biden.
I had Covid in Kansas and ended up in Covid ward at hospital. All nurses and doctors disgusted w PPE shortages and lack of support from Trump. Almost everyone here is a Republican. Either they won‚Äôt vote or they‚Äôll go to Biden we are more red than TX though so won‚Äôt matter.
If tRump wins we will need to learn Russian!  We know where tRump is headed so the only option is to elect Biden/Harris. We also must stop tRump from continuing to destroy the country before the election and inauguration.  #TrumpIsKillingUSPS  #TrumpIsKillingAmericans
Do you think that is an accurate representation of Biden and Trump's beliefs?  I am liberal as hell and live in Kansas, and I do not understand people always saying we want to  take away guns.  We'd like to get them out of the hands of criminals, but not legal gun owners.
Biden and Harris start joint coronavirus briefings #SmartNews
Does anyone else wonder if this some sort of societal test?  To see how far we can be pushed before we snap? Trump, pandemic, economic depression,  congressional incompetence, unchecked corporate greed, Biden and Harris.  What‚Äôs next?
I will take Biden's gaffes over Trump's documented 20,000 lies (and counting) and actual evil any day. Biden says stupid stuff. Trump is just stupid.
Sen Harris will be a great VP. She made mistakes in her campaign,  , that ultimately doomed it. She‚Äôll learn from this and it was wise of Joe Biden not to let her campaign people onboard
New Yorkers are too smart to vote for Trump.    If this is Trump‚Äôs plan‚Äî Biden is in good shape!
When will the media ask Kamala when she decided to forgive Biden for being a racist and rapist??? #SleepyJoe #CreepyJoeBiden #kamalaHarrisisafraud
Biden can suck all the balls
You are making a very compelling case here.  Yep you swayed me. Voting for Biden/Harris!
I belief Mr Biden isn‚Äôt capable of an original thought. He just repeats the words that the leaders of his party tell him. Without original ideas growth and innovation go stagnant. How is he going to move this Country in the right direction if new thoughts &amp;ideas are non-Existent?
I sure hope Biden doesn't do something truly senile like suggest there were airports during the 1770s or that WW2 happened in 1917-1918.
They were democrats, YOU.  That was your group biden.  The President thinks well of all people- unlike you and obama/dems
Would vote for moderate Biden, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what we will get. F‚Äôd up.

No, thanks, #CreepyBiden. Not interested in you telling anyone what to do, especially since #MasksDontWork.  Stop ignoring science! | Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Meanwhile -- Biden meets with the Covid scientist to come up with a stategy to defeat covid -19.   It is already abundantly clear -- To Biden and Harris -- #ScienceMatters.  Hallelujah.
You obviously aren‚Äôt following. Luck was all it was. There‚Äôs no evidence trump didn‚Äôt ‚Äúput his people first‚Äù and in fact all the evidence in the world he responded equal to or better than other countries and better than any alternative president like Biden for ex would have.
President Trump listens &amp; has changed to. But media don‚Äôt report that. Nothing is as important as admitting ur wrong. I have a question has Joe Biden ever apologized for looking up to a pure racist, Robert Byrd. Just wondering, I don‚Äôt know how anyone could support that man
Will you also chastise Biden for mispronouncing her name in his speech announcing her as his VP pick?
All this does is fire up democrats and suburban women plus independents to vote democrat if this is all they got it is going to be a Biden mega landslide.
Makes it even better that Biden mispronounced her name in his speech naming her as his VP pick!
Thank you for your courageous work in the face of sheep. I would not expect Biden to do the right thing here, but we do need an equivalent to the Nuremberg Trials next year.  We need to outlaw the goper party.
Omg can we stop complaining abt Joe Biden &amp; Kamal Harris that‚Äôs exactly how we got into this situation. ANYTHING (Besides Kanye) is better than Trump. So miss me with all that justice reform bullshit that Trump dont give a fuck abt either. Not voting is a vote for Trump ‚ÄºÔ∏è
You can vote for Biden because you hate Trump. Conversely, you can vote for Trump because you think Biden is incompetent. But can we please stop pretending that Biden/Kamala is some sort of savior ticket? It‚Äôs still the lesser of two evils mindset &amp; we deserve better.
I think it‚Äôs good that Hillary and Pelosi chose an Indian-American, no wait, a poor black girl, no wait, whatever she is this time, to be Biden‚Äôs VP. What could go wrong?
If anything happens to Biden Ms Pirro is the number one suspect.
Biden has a message for you....
Ridin with biden....
If you not voting cause you don‚Äôt believe in the system, by all means do you. But if you not voting just cause, I hope you fall down the stairs tbh. Biden at the bare minimum has political experience. How does it not make sense for him to be president over donald trump??

This is honestly the most logical argument I've seen for Biden. I hate Biden, but I can't justify a practical reason to vote 3rd party at this point. Even if the bus is only traveling 1 block down the street, it's still closer to the destination. #BidenHarris2020
She's the most qualified to be Biden's running mate. I don't have a double standard that a man can do it, but a woman can't. It's a cheap shot, especially considering Trump's history with women. If you don't like her, fine, but make it about her politics and quality of work.
Canada has done us a great service in the person of Daniel Dale.  I would suggest a Medal of Freedom from President Biden.
One thing Joe Biden has down is his ability to look and sound presidential.  Contrast that with what we've seen in the last 3 and a half years. Choosing the person and ticket that is right for this nation shouldn't be hard.
Here is a detailed record of Bidens shitty past

Here is a hella for thread that  found for me and holy shit her record has even more shit than what I thought she had. The horrifying things she and Biden have done. There is no excuse. If you vote for Biden and Kamala, you can go fuck yourself.
All the liberals excited about Biden &amp; Kamala make me fucking sick.
What a disaster!!
Biden is already on the DNC HIT LIST.  If he wins, he dies.  Now that‚Äôs one hell of a Demdemic.  Sorry Joe. You Lose.
Just blocked Joe Biden. Blocked Trump and Harris ages ago. Here's to a peaceful fall 2020!
And all Trump &amp; Biden do is pander black/brown (as they say these days). White, Christian people vote too, right
Biden made a huge mistake. Choosing a woman who has spent her career locking up black man for the rest of they lifes. I'm no trump fan. But this is an all time low.
I will be driving to my voting station and with my mask on, stand in line, no matter how long it may be, and proudly vote for Biden/Harris. I hope more Dems will do the same and show Trump we will not take four more years of his destruction.

I don‚Äôt care if I lose any followers because of my excitement for this election.   Was this how I saw things going? Hell no... but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are amazing people, and Kamala is more progressive than people give her credit for.   We have to rally around them.
Your previous and public assessment of Joe Biden is correct. Biden, like you, is a lifelong racist.   Can‚Äôt change your spots, public and political records now.  But you smell the power which makes your motives dangerous.
You will be a wonderful First Lady and we will do everything to make sure Biden/Harris win!!
After Biden pointing out Kamala's husband in their first campaign appearance together, I can't not think of this...
I don't know. If Trump wins, the desperation of the deep state operatives will hit full boil. If Biden wins, most will assume election fraud--rightfully so. Our ideological divide is fast becoming unbridgeable.

I think if the margin is below double digits between Trump and Biden, it will show how precarious the GOP‚Äôs position is if they continue to embrace the extremism.

Shut yo ima vote for Biden just cuz ion like trump head ass up !!
I dgaf who wins the second term to be 100 lmao but I‚Äôm curious so I‚Äôm not supposed to vote for trump like Biden is the better option ?

Kamala Harris is unfitvto be Vice President. Biden should know better. But he is a democrat so what do you expect   An idiot to say the least
Nobody needs to be voting democrat on presidential election. No Biden or Kamala Harris  both are liars and unamerican   Both want higher taxes and no constitution   They both will be deported out of this country for the good of our nation   Vote Trump. He will stand up for us
Maybe in 2 years he's seen Trump decline as we all have, and has decided that voting for, to him, the lesser of 2 evils is the adult decision to make? I am not particularly thrilled about Biden myself, but he's several orders of magnitude better than Trump.

I'm surprised that Kamala was the pick.  I can't believe  "If" Trump "didn't" get reelected, that Harris is who they want as president, bc we all KNOW they want to declare Biden Incompetent eventually.
It's really cool that the Biden argument is we should push him left but we also can't critique, complain, or challenge him at all.  Almost like liberals don't care.
Not sure how to fix the shit. Dude, but we have the  now. He does this totally whacked shit to try to fix situations. And now real joe Biden is on planets for which he belongs to too.

She let the people in California down.... can someone tell me why Joe Biden picked her... this is a retorical question!
Now  on  is promoting #BenghaziSusanRice as Biden's COS. Doesn't get any better than that!
Joe Biden as obvious signs that he has Cognitive problems. Does no one else see this?!
Sadly, Joe Biden has a mental deficiency and by November I believe it will be clear he is  incapable of being the President! Let the debates begin!
I'm sure the only reason Kamala Harris agreed to be Biden VEEP is because she knows she'll become president when Biden's Alzhimers gets worse in a year.
Biden‚Äôs VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
I wouldn't really call that pro weed. Nothing about taking it off Schedule 1 so it can actually be studied. People shouldn't be put in jail at all for something that is less dangerous than cigs and alcohol
I want to remind everyone that senator Warren was the only person who didn't pound on Kamala in the presidential debate when Harris rose in the polls after attcking Biden. She even defended her and said these attacks were unfair. We stan a queen who doesn't put other women down.

Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Joe Biden has not owned stock his entire political career. He made a promise when he was first elected, and kept it.   Y‚Äôall needs to get lives. Being contrary on Twitter is easy, actually making change is hard.
I wonder when Joe Biden comes up out of his basement,  they will let him know who he picked as his VP running mate.
Don't know why I am so emotional over this VP choice? I feel hope for the first time in months!!  Biden/Harris 2020!!!
Let‚Äôs see how they feel when the Biden administration gets busy putting demonstrators in jail in the name of ‚Äòlaw and order‚Äô.  I predict butthurtness will prevail
But Biden is worse than a rock soooooüòÇ there are more than two choices and if the American people want real change we need to vote like it.
Watch how fast the Biden administration will work to ‚Äòrestore law and order‚Äô.  I bet they‚Äôll make Trump look like a softie.  A lot of ppl are going to jail
I'm sorry but I can't get excited by this. The Harris pick was inevitable. I understand this is an existential election and I will vote Biden, but we can't go back to business as usual. We need to fundamentally change the way  government works. It hasn't worked for 40 years. üôÅ
Biden Harris, LFG!!!!
If you dumb ass Democrats want biden that nigga real stupid üòÇ
Look, I completely respect anyone who disagrees with me on this, but it would take a lot for me not to vote for Biden. I recognize that he's taking voters like me for granted, but I can't say I blame him.
I am so excited for Biden/Kamala! The perfect ticket to win.
Lets be real, the people upset by Bidens VP pick are the same people who lost Bernie the nomination. Our generation talks a big game but we dont show up to the polls as a whole. Super sad.  Biden made the right pick.
You guys you have no idea how great if a day this is for me. First two of my favorite political people talking to my favorite actors, then we get a Biden / Harris ticket. Maybe 2020 is turning around. ü§ûüèª
Donald trumper‚Äôs black voters just went to 0.00% even diamond and silk are going to vote for Biden Harris ticket. #onetermtrump
Out of an entire nation, Joe Biden picked frickin Kamala Harris for VP.
My point is that Biden/Harris is as vanilla as it gets üòÇ  Vanilla isn‚Äôt bad and I think it‚Äôs exactly what we need, for a while. We‚Äôve had a mouth full of anise for the last four years and are in desperate need of a pallet cleanser.
Well folks meet your new President if Biden gets elected. Dems will declare him mentally unstable and k harris will be President. Folks dont think for a moment that is not dems plan. She is socialist ally the way.
Very busy news day.  Democrat Joe Biden picks running mate.
No not at all or know she was put there because 100 black men threatened Biden if he didn‚Äôt choose a black woman.  Is that the way it works now?

But when Biden does it.....
My wildly hot take of the day: the biggest winner from Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate is one Ted Cruz.
Obviously, you are not who you say you are.  You can't write.  Can't think.  You're Joe Biden with someone else's photo.
What does the map of Montana look like? (The face of Joe Biden).  What is Montana sniffing? (Kamala Harris, I mean Idaho).
Clemens, you are a liar.  Trump has been on the road for weeks checking on companies in need &amp; the VA.  He's been checking on states who have outbreaks. Joe Biden has been living in his bunk bed for the last 8 month.  He and Kam will be the 1st Pres and VP to die in office.
Even though Kamala is backing Biden it‚Äôs still fuck Biden and fuck Trump . Biden was part of the 94crime bill which was a whole mess . üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP
So it's gonna be Biden/Harris, better than Trump/Pence, but far less than us progressives hoped when we started the primary process. So it's a choice between the lesser of two evils once again, center-right vs. extreme far-right.
The firmest slap in the face to BLM is Biden choosing a woman who made a career out of locking up black people over minor marijuana charges, and fighting to keep them in prison PAST their sentencing
Ballot:  ‚¨úÔ∏è (R) Donald Trump/Mike Pence  ‚¨úÔ∏è (Less R) Joe Biden/Kamala Harris

Kamala Harris for Biden VP!!!!!
Yes. I got a tweet from Biden!

Xochitl Torres-Small would be a good choice, IMO. Biden's support with Hisp. &amp; Lat. Amrcns is soft compared to other traditionally Dem demos. She's a Blue Dog Dem, which would help solidify moderates that worry Biden is moving to far left to satiate the Bernie stans.
Your a joke Biden you will never be potus
Really hope it‚Äôs Kamala Harris. Seems like a good balance, despite her putting Biden on blast in a debate.
The US judicial system will throw its full weight at you on January 20th.  Hilary Clinton, the new Attorney General will throw your ass in jail.  Sleepy Joe Biden will laugh when asked if he is going to pardon you...

You can't vote for a dead guy.  Joe Biden is a Dead Man Sometimes Walking.

Biden might not be the democratic candidate a lot of us wanted but his cabinet is going to be STACKED and he will actually listen to them and other experts. Just something to consider before November
Biden Bottoms That shit would be hilarious!
Joe Biden, stay in your basement and don‚Äôt come out.  The DNC needs you dead.
Political Assassinations are coming.  Talk on social media and during rallies say Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Biden, Trump, Pelosi, DeBlasio, Lightfoot and Cuomo are targets.
Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt blow his own nose, let alone cure Covid.  However, he can blow his election and kill the VP, if the DNC doesn‚Äôt kill him first. #TraitorJoe
Yes, except, in true fashion, you only see the 1% of America and not the rest of us who don‚Äôt want Biden elected over here in middle class America
Just tell them you don't have to be a Dem to vote for Biden, you just have to have morals.
Or you are just setting up the Dems defense if Biden doesn‚Äôt win the election.  Get a new stick this ones getting old &amp; frankly far fetched.  Except the results whatever they may be just like you want Trump to do.  Stop playing both sides of this argument.
Oh, hidin‚Äô Biden...you think we‚Äôre going to fall for your lies.
Biden has more paths then Trump. If Biden takes FL it is a done deal. And yes, but these regions are different geographically and politically. These changes tend to favor Dems.
Allot of these changes are Dems who have been voting red or voted for Trump in 2016. It's not new voters. The lead is much smaller then you think. And isn't an indicator alone on who will win the election. And all Biden needs is a slim win in PA and MI. Maybe AZ or WI. Or FL
Also, there was way more undecideds in 2016, not the case now. And that's with Biden leads. Most last minute deciders chose Trump after the Comey letter. Doesen't seem like that will be the case in 2020. Different year, different election.
Biden is the favorite in these states. Clinton hardly cared about these states in 2016 and still barely lost. Biden is laser focused now. This arrogance reminds me of exactly the Hillary campaigns confidence in 2016. Honestly, I don't mind it.
Theses people already voted for Trump in 2016 and have switched parties.  Dems also still lead in number of Registers. Biden is in a very good spot.
2010 -&gt; 2012 is different then 18 -&gt; 20. Dems have seen their leads continue and expand in some cases. Most R gains are being made by voters registering D -&gt; R or D -&gt; I. Indys gained allot, and Biden leads w/ them. So really Trump isn't getting as many new voters
Biden should challenge Trump to a debate that focuses entirely on the Bible. Let‚Äôs see how that goes for the orange one.
So will Biden announce his VP then...to take away from this news?

You do know that Clinton announced Kaine only 3 days before the Convention and Obama announced Biden only 2 days before, right? Are you going to base your vote on the VP pick? Do you want the news to focus on that instead of Trump‚Äôs unconstitutional power grab? For what?
No one on this country needs to vote for Biden or any other democrat for president if you love your country and what you have worked for all your life because democrats don‚Äôt care just so long as they are in office
I will vote for Joe Biden if he picks Mr. Potato Head as his VP running mate.
Idiots....vote for Biden he won‚Äôt know where he is at the whole 4 years he is in office and your investments will be gone
Not a "confirmed trumper" here either....Biden, Trump, neither are fit to be president.
WATCH: Joe Biden VP pick?
And Mr Biden can‚Äôt ride a motorcycle!  Which is better bike or motorcycle?
Also, unlike Trump, when Biden does something wrong, he acknowledges it, apologizes for it, and tries to do better, instead of either pretending he never said it, our doubling down on it.
Biden says stupid shit sometimes. That's not a big shocker to anybody who's been paying attention for more than the last 4 years. I can't speak for anyone else, but I'll take gaffes over 4 more years of the dismantling of our government in favor of billionaires. YMMV.
This is so dangerous. Clearly this is a prelude to claiming China hacked the vote to help VP Biden win. O'Brien also spread the lie that Putin preferred Sanders, when Sanders was being propped up by RU because of perceived weakness against their preferred candidate, trump. 1/2
Duh!  Just shoot them in the knee.  Joe Biden says that's best.
If the criteria is that she can't be smarter than Biden, the list just got really short.
Poll numbers play a major part in all of this,also timing/the election.The closer to election for stimulus checks to be handed out the better for Trump.Its probably the only thing to increase Trumps numbers &amp; done later gives Biden less time to rebound
Stop making fun of Joe Biden! It's Rude!
Show me one candidate or news outlet that has said if Biden wins, the pandemic will go away. We just want someone who will actually lead us and listen to science, rather than worrying about Wall Street and his own unstable fortune.
So then you're agreeing that Trump is at least as unacceptable because of his KKK endorsement as Biden is because his son once had a cushy job in Ukraine? Good to know. To quote a BRILLIANT mind: Checkmate.
So this further drives suspicion that something is wrong with Biden. At this point the debate needs to be held just to prove that he is mentally competent.
I remain hopeful that whomever the VP selection is can excite voters enough to overlook their reasons for not wanting to vote for Biden.. I really want it to be Yang. He attracts votes from both sides and would be such an asset! But it‚Äôll probably be someone I don‚Äôt know well.
Well, why not.  Biden gave away state secrets.  Let them have access to our DOD intelligence network, and put them in charge of half of the Middle East.  They love #TraitorJoe.  Let's kick him in the balls again, except he doesn't have any.
Perhaps it has something to do with the utter contempt so many Bernie supporters have been showing Biden since he beat Bernie?
Good thing Hunter Biden isn‚Äôt a Candidate then. Literal neonazis and the KKK support Trump. Bet you have no issue with that though.
Yup. BernieBro ideology:  Agree with Biden: 75% Agree with Trump: 0%  They‚Äôre both the same!!!
All he has to do is not shit himself in public and the press will fall all over themselves to praise him. I mean, non-Fox reporters were questioning whether VP Biden was *really* joking over a joke about choosing his VP but trump's daily propganda hour they praise.

I don't believe for 1 minute China prefers VP Biden. Xi said himself he prefers trump to Dems because Dems care about ethics. trump handed Xi wins on the Uighurs, Hong Kong, trade, and WHO. That report was written to give trump ammo as he already tries to tie Biden to China.
They are weirdos. Biden signs yet to come out w VP pick.
She's selfish like others who know exactly what trump is but can't bring themselves to vote for Biden or will do so only under certain conditions. She's not who'll be hurt if we lose, her wealth and privilege protect her. If  is willing to vote Dem what's her excuse?

Good Job Mr. President.  Particularly liked the way you kicked Pelosi/Schumer/Biden in the balls.  The Pres also provided new protections for our VETS so they will never be abused in VA Hospitals again.  Abuse was always one of Obama's favorite tactics.
You‚Äôre exactly right if trump screws with the mail service i will just hand deliver my families ballots and we are all voting for biden.
Joe Biden and 1 life jacket
Nobody believes Joe Biden actually has a plan.  Keep highlighting this nonsense, people see through the BS. Let‚Äôs see the actual plan then
He also gave financial assistance to Americans in need, deferred payments on college debt and froze the interest on that debt at 0%. AND created new protections to assure our Vets will no longer be abused in VA Hospitals. Lastly, he kicked Schumer/Pelosi/Biden in the balls. Nice.

Maybe I didn't say that loud enough.  The Democrats have no use for Joe Biden, except they already put his name on ballots.  The Dems have selected two very dangerous terrorists to run the country. Susan Rice and/or Kamala Harris is the Democrat choice for President. America Dies
The truth is, Obama and Biden gave away all drug manufacturing to China.  Biden was involved in sending secrets to China so they could attack us with bio-terror.  The greatest threat to America since Adolf Hitler is The Democrat Party.
Democrats announce that Joe Biden is not their President.  The Vice President being chosen by the far left of the DNC will be President.  Susan Rice or Kamala Harris, two of the most dangerous Anti-American radicals is the Dem choice for President.

No it wasn't.  FoxNews repeatedly stated that Biden had chosen a running mate, instead of reporting that a quick witted Biden trolled Steve Ducey while riding a bike and wearing a mask.
Never! But that didn‚Äôt stop me from telling the pollsters I would definitely vote Biden,  ‚Äúf***ing‚Äù with the pollster numbers like they did COVID.
I mean, unless something changes drastically in the next 3 months, it won‚Äôt matter who I vote for, Biden will win in a landslide

First of all nothing Biden says or does is clear. Mask during outdoor excercise and no helmet, makes sense.
The ‚Å¶ has accepted Russia‚Äôs help without shame or a glimmer of remorse   KNOW that they care NOTHING about their oaths to the Constitution   Their oaths and allegiances are to THEMSELVES   Just look at how they‚Äôre attacking Mueller &amp; Co.
#FoxNews is reporting that #Biden has picked his VP running mate. Announcement imminent. #Election2020
To be clear, I don't think what Biden said was racist at all. A majority of Blacks are Democrat. Latinos are a whole other story, especially in states like Florida and Texas. What Biden said was factual, but he could of worded it much better.
I do feel like Kanye won't have a big effect on this election. I'm more afraid of low voter turnout in communities w/ POC. I feel like the way the media covered Biden and what he said about blacks could hurt him, especially if he has more gaffes.
America CAN be great again after Biden wins in November!
This is so fucking stupid. Please don't vote for biden.
Go ahead keep replying... I can debate my position all day with Truth, Knowledge and Light.  Can you say the same of Biden or Trump?  They are hiding in their houses and behind security while I‚Äôm traveling the US free as a bird doing what I do to bring Light back to The People.
#TraitorJoe is not the Democrat Presidential Candidate. Nancy Pelosi said it doesn't matter who they choose for VP, the election is over and the President selected.  The reason Biden hasn't named the VP is, the Dems have chosen the VP to be the President.  Joe is a red herring.
Joe Biden and every one of his associates are the face of evil.  Their goal is to overthrow our government.  Their goal is to overthrow the Constitution.  Their goal is to make Black Americans slaves.  Their goal is to create anarchy, then attack the poor and kill them.

That seems to be exact reason it's presented as it is, especially considering trump &amp; his campaign have already been trying to tie Biden to China. Interestingly Xi himself said he prefers trump as Dems care about ethics (&amp; trump has handed China wins on Hong Kong, WHO, &amp; trade).
Don't believe the bit about China for one minute. Ratcliffe is simply trying to hand ammo to trump to use against Biden. Xi has already said he prefers trump because Dems care about things like ethics &amp; trump is transactional (he's already handed China wins w/Hong Kong &amp; WHO).

Yelling this statement does not make it true.  Neither does not addressing Mr Biden‚Äôs statements because other Americans want to know your rebuttal as well Mr Trump. This is how my children act, ignoring statements they don‚Äôt want to answer, grow up...
You can thank Bill Clinton and Obama for that.  They were the ones that signed the trade deals that gave foreign countries all our manufacturing.  They also increased taxes on American Companies.  Same tax rates that Joe Biden wants to use.  Biden means death.
Oh it looks like Ted has scared those guys.  Good God.  Let‚Äôs make this last through the election and people will be so pissed off Biden won‚Äôt stand a chance.
(meaning i am considering between voting third party and biden, thus be alright with biden losing, which i'm not sure i am)
but the reason i'm undecided is that i'm weighing the negative change with trump with the stagnation of biden; i'm not so sure i can take another four years of maga chuds. (2/2)
i'm a leftist who is undecided, but i'll tell you that i think most leftists (including myself) think that voting for biden will just elongate the politics that gave us trump, and that the moderate dnc platform won't really give us effective change. (1/2)
I‚Äôm with you - totally sucks.  The hardest thing to hear - and argue with - is ‚ÄòA vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äô.   Horrible but probably true -
They only pointed out that VP Biden is Catholic.  They made no implication that they are Catholic. As a Catholic who used to be Southern Baptist, I will occasionally say services instead of mass so chill.
Not only is Biden not playing with a full deck, I think he‚Äôs only playing with the Jokers. Redlandslide2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏.
Funny the o lot dirt you can dig up on Biden is a cspan video from 1993. All you gotta do to see this kinda nonsense from Trump is to look at his twitter posts from yesterday. Stop comparing two pieces of shit, thinking one piece of shit is better than the other. It‚Äôs foolish.
It‚Äôs hilarious how people are more focused on the President and his mispronunciations of a word yet are silent about the fact that every single lie they‚Äôve spoken about Donald Trump and his motives is what Biden ACTUALLY is. This impending judgment is turning into a good tv show!
If the ORANGE P.O.S. gave his cult a steamy pile of shit &amp; told you it was the cure for the virus you people would eat that shit up no pun intended! Now he's saying Biden wants to hurt GOD! YES GOD! you know who talks like this a CRAZY PERSON! Your wannabe pres. I A CRAZY PERSON
Why would Biden want to debate someone who can‚Äôt even read?
Biden really said the second one yesterday I CANNOT find it anywhere on twitter! If you think social media isnt covering stuff up you‚Äôre wrong and idk how you can still vote for Biden that shit is RACIST!
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."

Joe Biden has lost his goddamned mind. How the fuck can Dems have him as their candidate?
I applied for my advanced mail in ballot in May. I plan on doing everything I can to get people in my life to vote Biden. Maybe we can snag a Dem Senator in KS for the first time since 1932 lol.
Hahaha. Are you living in America? They don't let Biden got away with racist remarks you said? Please come back again!
I am not sure what you are talking about but we are talking about Joe Biden and his racist remarks.  He just made another one today! He doesn't think we the blacks can come together as one but he believes Hispanics communities are.
Joe Biden does not want any Debates.  People will see the cognitive capacity loss.  Near Alzheimer Conditions?
Black people are not a monolith, which is why I think the Biden video is so problematic.
"polling shows Biden's support with younger Black voters trailing significantly behind that of older Black voters... polls show the majority of young Black voters support Biden over President Donald Trump, many are unenthusiastic at best or hesitant"
Joe Biden is TRASH! Donald Trump is TRASH! We fucked up as a country.
Biden goes to church and is a devout Catholic! Has this godless man ever gone to church other than a photo op?

Jim, Biden is SO attackable!!!  LOL!!!
It's only a fundamental right for Americans who exercise all required responsibilities outlined in the law.  It's not a right for non Americans, terrorists or other felons.  Joe Biden is both a Terrorist and a felon.  Can't vote.  Can't run for any elected office.
Biden isn‚Äôt capable of a debate. He won‚Äôt make one of them in person. Let alone an additional one
If Joe Biden simply stands there and answers every question, "Well, I'd certainly do better than this muther f* here!" Would he be penalized for that? Cause, that's the honest truth right there.
But can Joe Biden tell us all what covfefe means????

If he went public, we would have a hard time distinguishing him from Trump. You know,  senile dementia,  verbal gaffes, opposes universal healthcare, opposes legal pot, allegations of sexual assault  lies about educational achievements. Maybe Biden should pick Trump for his VP.
If the Trump vs Biden debate were a Pay-Per-View I would buy it in a second.
That is pretty harsh Elizabeth I have seen about 3 different videos of Biden interviews and I felt the same way and I am black. Even just yesterday my and my friends were talking about it so I think you are being judgmental by not facing Bidens interviews remarks.
Truth? Did you watch the CBS interview yesterday? How about today? Biden said Black people have no diversity! So do you not read or do you not care about the Truth?

The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.

Everyone is afraid of trump but not realizing that the neoliberal Democratic policies pushed ppl to vote for Trump. Biden isn‚Äôt as disliked as Hillary but he also has 0 excitement behind him.
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
(Polling isn‚Äôt everything but)  I don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall realize how big of a deal it is that Trump is only 7 points behind Biden in Kansas. Hillary lost Kansas by TWENTY-ONE points in 2016. If we keep trending in this direction, Kansas could go blue (!) in 2024.
Historically exciting? I'm not African American so I won't answer how I feel about Biden choosing a woman of today. I just want to remind folks, however, Harriet Tubman isn't available.
Biden said ‚Äúif y‚Äôall don‚Äôt vote for me than you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù and y‚Äôall kneegroes really gon vote for em.
It's true, and I've already heard people on the right saying this "Hoax will all go away once the election is over" Like no, it'll go away after Biden gets in office because he will do the right thing and shut stuff down and listen to actual scientists.
Not to mention reflecting on good faith criticisms is how your party and ticket grow stronger. We've already seen it working with people pushing Biden to be more open to ideas on the left.
I‚Äôm convinced niggas is just scared and voting for Biden is the nice little white pat on the back they need to make sure everything is okay.....FOH they‚Äôre all white supremacist.
Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
If asked, I wonder if Trump would say ‚ÄúMary Magellan.‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúLove your God. Love your neighbor.‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúI loved my neighbor- she became my 2nd wife!‚Äù
Maybe it‚Äôs just me &amp; maybe I‚Äôm a little off, but even if that were true, it creeps me out &lt; Pence‚Äôs over the top evangelical bit.  (Shrug).  Either way, I still think both she &amp; Pence are far better human beings from what I‚Äôve seen than Trump or Biden.  But that‚Äôs a low bar.
Harris calls Biden a racist during primaries and still gets the nod. Politics makes strange bedfellows
I won‚Äôt be voting for you. I want safety &amp; I‚Äôm thrilled that my children can experience diversity, knowing they are no better than families in low income housing. Biden would reinstate it, giving better opportunities to Americans. I don‚Äôt know why Corey Booker is thrown in but ok
I don't understand even contemplating not voting Biden. I full stop do not like him, but the other option is a fraud committing white supremacist that is literally watching us die from a pandemic he could have prevented.
I kind of want to order a sheet, use one to vote for Biden-Harris, and then frame the rest.
I'm SO over "VP discourse." No matter who Biden picked my goal has always been the same: Get Trump out, and push a Biden administration as far left as possible. Harris is further left than Biden, and I'm hopeful that she'll be receptive to progressive voices in the party.
This is what I‚Äôm talking about. Get Joe Biden and Kamala in office and then we PUSH THEM. We demand change. I‚Äôm talking EXTREME PUBLIC OUTRAGE to force their hand on progressive issues.   Cenk Uygur: What We MUST Do If Joe Biden Wins in 2020  via

So far my Twitter timeline this morning is full of Progressives slamming more moderate liberals over Biden/Harris, who are busy quickly backtracking earlier slams of Harris, while right wing people are saying at least they have morals, while backing Donald Fucking Trump.

Great pick for VP! Unfortunately we are probably only minutes away from hateful and racist rhetoric from DJT,  Carlson and Hannity. DJT has already said Senator Harris is a nasty person. Really? Has he ever listened to the trash coming from his own mouth?
You can support Biden and still find this hilarious.
He is basically saying the VP Biden is not a Catholic! I am pretty sure you are told you are being excommunicated before everyone else is, but this disgraceful bishop is following trump‚Äôs lead and doing it by tweet!

WATCH: President Trump Claims Joe Biden Will "Hurt The Bible" (VIDEO) - The Scoop
"reports: GOP Senators accepted Anti-Biden material from Pro-Russia Ukrainian Lawmaker."    are getting "dirt" on Joe Biden from Andrii Derkach to aid in their "report" to be released this September.
To influence the 2020 Election, the Russian government is providing information to both  and  to re-elect Trump.   Seems a little treasonous to me.
I suspect Biden will chicken out because he doesn't want to advertise his senility. Then let's have Trump and Jorgensen on the debate stage. #LetHerSpeak
So to support your argument that Biden is about ‚Äúbig gov‚Äôt‚Äù you use a meme highlighting his vote against federal banking regulations in the 90‚Äôs? I mean... I very much support Glass Steagal but I‚Äôm a ‚Äúbig gov‚Äôt‚Äù liberal, as you might say. Ur mental gymnastics are making me dizzy.
As an attorney I can tell you the plain language of the EO says payments to be deferred, won‚Äôt that be fun for taxpayers and the US Treasury when they come due next April.  Honest question, what would your response be if Biden or Obama did this?
At least Biden can hold a Bible properly. He‚Äôll get bonus points if he can read it.
Haven't you noticed the lack of mental clarity in Joe Biden? Do you really want a senile old man in control of the nuclear football?  Try Jo Jorgensen if you don't want to perish in a nuclear holocaust.
Makes me wonder if that was part of the reason Biden didn‚Äôt make the announcement this past week, as seemed to be the original plan.

Reagan had Alzheimer‚Äôs for goodness sakes. I‚Äôve heard Biden and he‚Äôs fine most of the time. But I‚Äôd like to get a medical update to know. Christians don‚Äôt slander people.
The people close to Reagan including his own son acknowledge Reagan really struggled his last two years in office. Biden has always been scatter brained at times. We have no idea if its really more than that right now. But we should. Then again I don't think Trump is healthy.
Racism has nothing to do with it.  What EXACTLY did Obama (or Biden) do to improve black lives in America.  Please do tell. And Biden is self aware enough at this point to be a Socialist or any other ist. But Socialists are pulling all his strings. He is a disaster.
So I guess since the  is fine with accepting help from foreign entities, Biden should get in touch with China right away.
There's a difference between not having it and not being diagnosed yet (that came 5 years after leaving office). But some of the things you read are disturbing for such an important position.  And you do see some of that with Biden, but in fairness he's also always had this issue

You just described Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lol
And they want to say Biden has trouble speaking! Give me a break! This guy massacres the English language. üò©
Democratic Voters have said the exact same thing.
Hey Kellyanne Obama and Biden left donnie a plan for this but he threw it out because of jealousy. What is his plan? #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoPlan #WhereAreTheTests #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus
How long until Biden and Harris say, "We need to move on and not live in the past" when asked why charges not happening with Trump.
Still amazed that Biden was appointed by the DNC and we all pretend and go forward like it never happened.
I think  needs a new pharmacist to get his Adderall and his Diazepam in balance. After watching Biden/Harris, this thing is such a snoozer! Droning on and on repeating the same üí©üí©üí©
Her policies are far left leaning, and Joe Biden has embraced them.
Empathy. Compassion. Leadership.  Biden/Harris2020
Biden/Harris were a tough act for him to follow,  bad planning on his part for everyone to have such immediate comparisons!!
Have Biden take one. Trump already has.
Even Democratic voters said so too!
So every one of these voters need to have the FBI called on them to Karen?
Yep. As this happens more and more people will tune it out. Biden should fade to background and let her take this. America will have to get used to a mature response instead of our kindergarten teacher.
Face reality. Joe Biden is more than likely is going to be a one term president. And some of those think Joe won‚Äôt even make it through his first term. Face the facts.
I mean she‚Äôs right. His cognitive health isn‚Äôt the best. Almost 50 percent of voters believe Biden won‚Äôt make it through his first term. He is going to be more than likely a one term president.
Pretty clear a current terrorist organization in the United States supports Biden
Kamala‚Äôs policy views are far left and Joe Biden has embraced these policies!
Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden racist &amp; believed his accusers.? Now she‚Äôs his VP. Democrats and their monkey business
Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden racist &amp; believed his accusers.? Now she‚Äôs his VP.
I'm team Biden and Harris 2020 all the way!
He might be dead in Biden‚Äôs basement
i find that people who aggressively shove biden down your throat are really just angry that they, themselves, feel obligated to vote for biden. #NoComradesUnder1k #NoComradesLeftBehind
I give Joe Biden four
He pulls the strangest shit out of his ass. Where does he get this crap?
Whining is what Donald trump does best, better than any President in American history. --Joe Biden  [wonders if that was a compliment] --Donald trump
Kamala will do ALL THE TALKING!!! Wait and see‚Äî‚Äîshe‚Äôs the one Dems are really running for President and I‚Äôll bet Hidin‚Äô Biden steps down from the campaign at the last minute [ (mental) health reasons].
It's incredible that biden is actively snubbing hispanics and muslims. At this point I can only assume it is a personal grudge because those demographics supported bernie in the primary; no other explanation makes sense.
Hillary shot herself in the foot by not campaigning in Wisconsin Michigan and PA. And it could cost Biden too if Trump makes up ground, which appears he is starting to a bit.
Pretty clear with Biden being not able to speak without a teleprompter, and the debate being Trump, Biden, and the moderator, that these debates need to be on PPV!
Dang! That's important. Too bad Joe biden really obviously doesn't actually give a shit about any of that, and would rather lose than make a single concession to get people to vote for him
Fuck nudes send your vote for Harris/Biden
Watch to see what the tone of the reporters is for the Biden/Harris Press Conference.  I'll bet it is a liberal media "love in" totally unlike the treatment of President Trump.
Read This: "Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris"
But that‚Äôs the point...voting means you CAN complain. Bc you cast your vote and are not seeing change. Get involved with your local government! Keep talking about it. Bc in this country you have that right. Yeah Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt great...but rn we just need better. (1/2)
Biden looks like most Republicans in the house, old white dude???
I agree with you 100 percent. No politician is going to be perfect.  My hope is that Kamala and Biden will listen to the people. Biden choosing Kamala proves he‚Äôs willing to put differences aside for the good of America.  We the people need to give them a chance to bring change.
Biden has been in office forever and only done bad things
You can criticize Kamala Harris without being sexist or racist.  You can also criticize her while planning to vote for her.  You can also criticize her and not attack her with sexism or racism.  Joe Biden is a putz tho.
I enjoyed reading every word of this. h/t    Kamala Harris, Gen X‚Äôs Moment, and the Fall of House Boomer  via
Did Biden actually pick Kamala or did President Trump make the choice for him?
Wow. Marshall and Bollier have about the same name ID also. She‚Äôs running ahead of Biden. Really great poll for Barbara
If biden wants to actually offer the left concessions, I'll vote for him. If he doesn't, I won't. Simple
Anyone else get the feeling the GOP is adding him to the ballots to take away from Biden getting more votes, like how KS GOP added Bob Hamilton to the primary to steal votes from Kobach (helps Dem win)? I feel like they're leaning heavily into this now that Harris is the VP nom.
Biden was chosen by the party to be obama's vp specifically because he was the racist segregationist senator from MBNA, and the party wanted assurances that obama wouldn't rock the boat when it came to banks, finance, or racist white people
If Biden wins we lose.
Joe Biden‚Äôs racist past kinda‚Äô makes me wonder why he picked the ‚Äúwhitest‚Äù black woman on his VP list‚Ä¶.
Joe Biden‚Äôs racist past kinda‚Äô makes me wonder why he picked the ‚Äúwhitest‚Äù black woman on his VP list‚Ä¶.
In other conspiracies, it‚Äôs okay to shut down the post office because the postal union endorsed Biden, so clearly would influence the vote.   Unfair, conspiracy, etc.
Ah, right wing conspiracy theory I had missed.   Kamala is not the VP pick. It‚Äôs a ruse. Biden will be forced out within days of being sworn in, she‚Äôll be in charge.  Which is just ASSUMED to be awful I guess because WOC? They don‚Äôt even bother to say why that‚Äôs bad!
I‚Äôm convinced niggas is just scared and voting for Biden is the nice little white pat on the back they need to make sure everything is okay.....FOH they‚Äôre all white supremacist.
Just the way I like it out in the open. Biden/Harris operate the same in the system but speak in covert ways to gain favor with certain communities but have the same goal as Trump.
The problems that made covid such an uncontrolled terror in the US are fundamental and endemic to the US.  And, given the chance for a do-over, everyone is failing again. Even biden is calling for schools to open "for the economy" despite that being an obviously insane idea.
If you think this is as bad a strategy as it obviously is, bring it up with biden and ask him to change. Imploring people to slurp up the hot spit on our faces is a losing proposition. Consider instead telling biden to stop hocking loogies at a huge part of the democratic base.
If biden and the people around him remotely agreed with you, they would offer the left more than insults and spit. They have explicitly made the decision that they would rather lose to trump again than offer even a single thing to the left. They do not care like you do.
Take it to the extreme of every vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump...but at this point, it is what it is. Vote 3rd party for Congress. We putting Biden/Harris on a count down as soon as they are in office. Like...better act like yall know
I‚Äôve already donated! And of course will do so again! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide  Biden Has ‚ÄòBest Grassroots Fundraising‚Äô Day Ever After Harris Pick, Campaign Says | HuffPost
And all of this, although troubling, is still not as as bad as the slippery slope to fascism we‚Äôre riding. We have a clear choice before us-only one destroys the US. We have the luxury of looking at these things after Trump &amp; his cronies are out.  For now, I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris.
Biden's campaign explicitly made the decision to offer nothing but insults to the left because they thought they will get all the votes they need from suburban Republicans. If you no longer feel that is the case, consider offering the left something other than spit.
We literally were shouting from the rooftops during the primary. The media did not cover it, and when they did cover it it was through a lens of "bitter bernie bros".  Well, we told you for a year we wouldn't vote for joe biden, you nominated him anyway. Go call some Republicans.
Biden is literally opposed to all the policies that would stop my friends from dying, and a supporter of the policies that are killing them. He's as bad for me and mine as trump
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
Biden/Harris 2020   Because, seriously, look at who will be in the White House again if you don't.
Maybe that's why Biden waited so long
Introduction of a 3rd party isn't realistic at this juncture. Getting Cheeto Jesus and his corrupt asshats out of office is vital to America at this point. We can then put Biden/Harris on a timer. I will vote 3rd party, have before in local elections, just not right now.
Great vote for her in 4 years...right now isn't the time. Every single vote not for Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump. There was enough people that choose not to vote last election to put him into office...people already on the same, I don't like either candidates.
üé∂one of these pictures isn‚Äôt like the other ones üéµone of these pictures is just plain wrongüé∂ there are Gentlemen Presidents and then there‚Äôs Trump! #BIDEN/HARRIS2020
So excited for the Biden/Harris ticket, but even more excited for my country to have the opportunity to have such outstanding leadership in the WH again!
I'm still not over Biden being appointed by the DNC and everyone pretending like that didn't happen.
Where can I get a t-shirt that says "Another Nasty Woman for Biden/Harris"? #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #NastyWomenVote
Joe Biden just embraced the socialist ideology.
Sounds like Biden lol
Not a Biden fan, only Harris ü§òüèº
Nah I'm not gonna be voting for biden lol
Chris Wallace could not pick his nose correctly, must less an observation on Biden‚Äôs Vice Presidential pick...  Semper Fi USMC üí™
I kind of want to order a sheet, use one to vote for Biden-Harris, and then frame the rest.
Mark my words Biden/Harris will be coming for your guns!
Idk how realistic this is because Idk much about politics tbh but do you guys think Bernie sanders would have won Biden the election if he was the vp? I kinda do.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala as the VP pick.   I also hope Biden finds a way to include more women in his cabinet. Let‚Äôs get Warren in there. Susan Rice and Amy Klobuchar, too.   It‚Äôs time to let women run this country for a while.
#ohLiz  I'm old enough to remember when candidates ran on their records, not trying to blame opponents for stuff going on NOW, under their watch, especially Biden who's not currently in office or Harris for stuff not in her state! The Gop seems very scared!THIS BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT BIDEN vs. TRUMP, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HARRIS vs. TRUMP.  TRUMP WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DOG, AND HARRIS WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE ARCHENEMIES AND IN DIRECT CONFLICT TO ONE ANOTHER.
KAMALA HARRIS WAS BORN IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON, AND SO THAT MEANS NO ONE CAN COMPETE AGAINST HER TO THE TOP.  NOT EVEN, JOE BIDEN.  DRAGONS CAN OUTSHINE ANY MAN OR WOMAN, AND MAGICALLY BE IN CONTROL OF THEIR SITUATIONS AND REALITIES.
Biden/Harris ticket makes me proud!
I thought the same thing about Biden‚Äôs pick for VP
Unless they are black and smoke weed. Bad choice Biden. But then again... derp derp derp
Biden said he was going to pick a woman for VP. Congrats, Joe. It was a 50/50 proposition.
You may be right. All five of the suburban ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù will be voting for you. The rest of us suburbanites will be voting for Biden/Harris.
I don‚Äôt think people realize what a force Jill Biden is. She flies under the radar but she is to Joe what Nancy was to Ronald Reagan.
I hope once the Biden/Harris ticket wins, the CA governor appoints you to Harris senate seat.
is fond of Biden's VP Choice. #BidenHarris2020
I THINK, JOE BIDEN JUST WON THE PRESIDENCY, HE PICKED KAMALA HARRIS AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT.  SHE IS GOING TO SHAKE THINGS UP!!!  TIME FOR THE WORLD TO GO CRAZY, AGAIN.
I think they should switch it up. Let Biden debate Pence and Harris debate Donald.
Biden is taking his VP pick seriously. For someone who constantly cries sexism it seems sexist to me that you‚Äôre making a joke about it. You weren‚Äôt saying the same thing when Trump and Romney were making their picks.
This is an OPINION piece.  I haven't seen any tax plan from Biden. Nice try.  I'm still not voting for you,  or
Oh no, you mean Biden wants to help the poor and hurt the rich?  Tragedy?!?!
From that list, Warren. Although Nina Turner would be a great pick as well.
He gave one to Bill C. &amp; Biden too.
If ‚Äúgrab em by the pussy‚Äù didn‚Äôt kill your election?  What makes you think this will kill Biden‚Äôs?
If you were a never Trumper you would do everything you could to not get him re-elected. You have 2 choices; vote for Biden and beat Trump or don‚Äôt vote for Biden and help Trump win. But I‚Äôll say it again, there are no good republicans. Always party over country. So GFYS!
I don't have IG, but how many negative hashtags is Joe Biden's account actually posting?
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden , including if you don‚Äôt vote, you are voting for Trump. It‚Äôs that simple.Be a human being. Vote for Biden-Harris. Don‚Äôt be a dumb fuck.
Be a human being. Vote for Biden.
Joe "rain man" Biden is out, she can't afford Hunter
You‚Äôve LOST more jobs in 3 months than Obama/Biden did because of your ineptitude and ignorance
Is she gonna sing that bad guy song? It‚Äôs pretty creepy kinda like Biden. So fitting.
Just for 3 month until the election is over... If Biden wins Covid 19 will just mysteriously drop off the headlines... If Trump Wins we will be living with this thing for 4 years. Come on people your being your being abused by doomorats!
Of course the Trump supporters won't be mad if Biden pardon's him next year huh? We'll you should be mad, but only if you've been mad about him giving pardon's and commutations to his friends. If not, don't complain.
I only have a little over 600 followers TOTAL. Twitter said I was violent. Plezzzzz !!! Look at my posts I dont curse. I dont post anything violent. But Trump can try to start a civil war.
Thanks so much.! I barely know how to navigate Twitter.  I got suspended for 3 days.....FOR NOTHING.
Thanks a lot
Biden may not remember where he‚Äôs at, who he served as VP under, or what office he‚Äôs running for but he sure hasn‚Äôt forgotten how to take credit for other people‚Äôs accomplishments.  #LyinBiden #Plagiarist #Pathetic
Shd knows Biden is going to lose.
I‚Äôve been wanting to get rid of pigs and cows forever.  Thank goodness Biden will be the next President.  He‚Äôll also rid the country of a snake
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
How don‚Äôt you get the outrage?? We are mad at the media, if the roles were reversed this would be all over CNN and Biden would be having a field day with it. How don‚Äôt you get that? The killer being arrested immediately has nothing to do with it
I‚Äôm not blinded by party, I‚Äôm going to vote for the one who‚Äôs not actively destroying our country. Was Biden my first choice? No but he‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than the alternative
Much of Biden plan list things already done.
Biden is a career long foreign policy leader. Biden is not an asshole like Trump.
It wasn't by a Libtard either! Tho Obama and Biden will say "It was by our very hard work Trump managed this"!
Kamala: ‚ÄúI believe Joe Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers. I also believe he is a racist who didn‚Äôt want me to go to a good school. I‚Äôm proud to be his running mate.‚Äù   You‚Äôll likely notice that sentence doesn‚Äôt make much sense.   #PutThatInYourPipe
As a eucharistic minister for my parish, Biden or any other Demo (local, state, national) I recognize and on record as pro abortion, I would not serve them Communion. May get yelled at by priest or Archbishop, but oh well.
Biden-Harris win. Harris demotes herself to AG, overwhelmingly approved. She prosecutes Trump. wins. She is awarded Nobel Peace Prize, given by Biden in Rose Garden. promotes her back to VP.  a person can dream...
The best of Biden - I love his quote about being dumb - he stole that too. #JoeBiden
The best of Biden - I love his quote about being dumb - he stole that too.

$2,000 A Month Stimulus Check Now That Biden Picked Kamala?
Just one of the many things that I hate about Biden and the dem establishment is this call for a return to decency as some sort of alt to Trump. I must say, fuck decency. What part of I, and everyone else, want and need M4A do they not fucking understand?
You think Trump has dementia??  Biden doesn‚Äôt even know what planet he is on!
Fuck Trump Fuck Pence Fuck Biden Fuck Harris like bruh y‚Äôall gave us the options of all clowns
Yea he outta pocket for that, but joe Biden picking a black VP really is more an insult then anything cause HE ONLY DID THAT. For the votes &amp; that‚Äôs obvious.
Get used to it. This will be the Trump surrgate attack on the Biden ticket up until the election. Then they get to call her VP like the rest of us. Time for worthless JW to go dry up in a ditch.
Lol. Scott went Biden on air...

Biden/Harris ... well at least it‚Äôs not Trump!
Vote for Trump! Because we are tired of his lying ass! We are voting Biden/Harris and proud of it! Perhaps you need a sit down with Bernie!
I'm not leaving my party. I'm tired of Trump. I'm tired of sexist ppl who don't vote for qualified women.  That's ok.....WE GOT THIS !!! Biden/Harris2020
Biden/Harris....all the way!
Where does one find a "Biden Supporter"?
if Biden selected a potato for VP you would have written the same tweet
Joe Biden just picked the woman who called him a racist who hung out with segregationists, and who said she believed his sexual harassment accusers. I just don‚Äôt understand anymore.
My only comment on Biden‚Äôs pick is this:   My Twitter T/L speaks the truth.
Not only is  experienced and qualified, but  decision to choose a woman of color to be his vice president ‚Äì the first time that‚Äôs ever happened on a major party‚Äôs ticket - should make us all proud to be Americans today.
I simply love, and am brought to tears by the elation &amp; sheer joy on women‚Äôs faces as a woman has been selected by Joe Biden to be his running mate.  This joy will repeat 3 times in our history: at the convention, on election night, &amp; at her swearing in.
So exciting ....Congrats Kamala Harris  "Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
fun and games in the biden basement
Trumps not perfect and I don‚Äôt agree with some of the stuff he says. But if Biden becomes president this country is screwed. If you need proof of that look at all the cities that have riots/looting. They are all run by Democrats who want to defund the police. Look at the numbers
Poll: Alarming Portion of Dem Voters Don't Believe Biden Can Finish a Single Term in Office
The choice marks just the third time in history a woman has been chosen as a running mate on a major party presidential ticket, and the first time a Black woman has been selected.
Ok so Biden said if you vote for Trump you ain‚Äôt black. He said the Barack Obama was, and I quote, ‚Äúthe first maintstream African-American who is articulate bright and clean‚Äù. WOW. ‚Äúyou cant go to a 7-11 or a Dunkins unless you have a slight Indian a accent.
Racist things Biden said: ‚ÄúObama is the first mainstream African American who is articulate, bright and clean‚Äù   ‚ÄúIf you vote for Trump, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go into a 7-eleven or a Dunking Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent‚Äù
OK if I wasn‚Äôt voting for Joe Biden 20 minutes ago now that I know it‚Äôs Kamala Harris wow that‚Äôs just one more reason for me not to pick Joe Biden.
I would rather give Trump's party my ticket instead of vote for Biden/Harris... at least, I know where they are with the bullshit.
I can't wait to watch Biden and Harris get up and punch back.
I‚Äôd rather Kamala be AG but this is a safe choice. Biden/Harris 2020.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I‚Äôll save you the time. Biden has chosen a VP but hasn‚Äôt announced yet. So it‚Äôs all ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù of a pick no one knows. At least on the cable news networks.
Don't forget Biden. Now, just to solidify those thoughts he chooses Rice. Or whomever puppets Biden chose Rice. Those two have such great track records. That was sarcasm for those of you liberals that don't understand that. #BidenIsAPuppet #Trump2020
This is hilarious.  I will likely make the same facial expressions when Biden announces his vp pick.
get ready for the internet to break when Biden announces his VP.
BS. Did you see Joe riding his bike the other day. All Trump does is watch Fox news and tweet all day. Biden will keep a full schedule.

Always a diversion with Trump. After 4 + years most Americans are aware of his tactics. Besides being mentally unfit for the office he has proven a real danger to humanity and our planet. Life  long Kansan here. Voting Joe Biden President and Barbara Bollier for Senate.
The fake news media attack Trumps constantly, China Joe Biden is with out question the most pathetic candidate ever nominated in any election in the History of our country His mentality and cognitive acuity is completely unacceptable for a Presidential candidate!
One of the late night 3 Stooges,Fallon, Colbert, and Kimmel, these liberal turds are Hollywood Democratic Party Puppets, not one Liberal wants China Joe Biden to debate Trump, The tariffs and fracking that China Joe will decease will crush jobs and the economy!
Biden probably should have a MAGA hat and Trump tie ready because Trump's only retort will be "WRONG" and Biden can then stick him in a corner to defend it.
I think it will be Harris but it could be Rice as Biden may not want to lose a Senate seat.
yeah, because going out of your way to kill American kids is really the only level you haven't publicly stooped to yet.  But thank you for doing so much work to campaign and rise funds for our soon-to-be elected forty-fifth President, Joe Biden!
Sorry, nothing you say or do can ever substantiate or elevate China Joe Biden, he‚Äôs a pathetic miserable excuse for a human being and beyond clinical definition of sound mental acuity! The Democratic Party is officially the lowest levels of mentality in American History!
