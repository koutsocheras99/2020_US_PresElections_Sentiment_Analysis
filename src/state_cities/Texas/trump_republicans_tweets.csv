All the polls are horse crap. Trump will be in office again.
It's not from 'our tax money' -
The 'budget' doesn't need saving.  The FED govt is the currency issuer- not like you and me.
Maybe learn about the 'debt'? It's not what you think...
President Trump is urging Americans who have survived coronavirus to help others suffering with the disease by donating plasma.
Trump is ‚Äòcompletely unraveling‚Äô: Former top White House aide says ‚Äòyou can see it on his eyes‚Äô
He was in Oklahoma not wearing a mask  a while back at trump rally .
Every time Trump speaks.
The cost doesn‚Äôt matter. Trump campaign doesn‚Äôt pay its bills. Doesn‚Äôt he still owe El Paso?
The human race. Lots of choices not Trump.
Trump‚Äôs ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded ‚Äî and given to The New York Times
Dufus trump doesn‚Äôt understand that there is a direct correlation between controlling the pandemic and economic recovery!! Complete idiot!!
Obama gave political speech at a funeral. What a shame. What he has done for blacks when he was president. What he is doing now in his private life for blacks. Trump has done more for blacks than Obama‚Äôs entire life. Obama, Biden, Hillary and Pelosi all worshiped KKK Robert Byrd
And its going to be a landslide .. count on it Trump...
Proud of fellow Canyon-ite &amp; Red Raider  for hosting our President  in Midland this week. Thank you for shining a light on our region, what we bring to the table, and the hard working people of #WestTexas! #FoodFiberFuel
‚ÄúWe want a temporary extension of enhanced unemployment benefits,‚Äù Trump said at the White House. ‚ÄúThis will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.‚Äù
Cmon, the election is 98 days away. This will be gone by Thanksgiving. But Trump will be impeached again for something right after that.
trump is a monster    We will vote him and you OUT!!üòÄüòÄ
vote trump out !!
I agree. There are definitely some downsides to Trump, but I‚Äòve actually grown to like him more and more because he‚Äôs kept so many promises that he ran on to begin with. It feels like ‚Äò16 all over again; it‚Äôs just glaringly obvious who the right choice is.
People need to know what is taking place... Hydroxy works, but because Trump is promoting it, the news says it will literally kill you if you take it. Because of this fake news, thousands have likely died.
High, is what she is...
Trump is a monster üò°üò°
Trump is a liar üò°üò°
WATCH NOW President Trump daily coronavirus update.
Ventura never had the political skills... he even grew to hate the job... I think if Trump believed the public tired of the fights and disfunction he would have reduced it a long time a go... but it's always been his way to control the narrative.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The family of a slain soldier found dead near the Texas Army base where she was stationed has taken their story directly to President Trump.
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
President Trump said Thursday that the November election should be delayed. Do you agree or disagree with the President? Let us know!
No they aren't.  If McConnell thinks he's going to lose *his own* election, he will be parroting Trump.  Watch...
Good idea? Or bad?
If McConnell thinks he's going to lose *his* election,  suddenly, suddenly, his words will mirror Trump's.   Vote them both out.
I don't know if it was a joke, but it was meant to get a reaction out of the press and the left and to push the discussion on mail-in voting. It also came on a day of economic bad news. And judging by my Twitter feed, Trump got what he wanted.
His response will 100% depend on whether he thinks he's going to lose *his* election.  He'll be all for Trump's plan if he's behind.
I‚Äôm tired of seeing these headlines. Trump isn‚Äôt going to quit. He will collude, cheat, there will be voter suppression. You name it he will attempt it. So instead of banking on him quitting just go vote for f*&amp;k sakes!
It may be a stretch to you. But Trump has always worked to distract, deflect and be the center of attention. Not one iota of a stretch to me.
I blame Trump!
The viruses were introduced , there are predictable time tables .. Given Joe Biden‚Äôs association closely with China .. it is not far fetched to put together a perfect storm to crush trump..
The news conference Trump called at the last minute was an attempt to dampen interest in Lewis' funeral. And to distract from Trump's abysmal Covid response.
Trump is a monster üò°üò°
"More than 6,400 residents have died in the state‚Äôs nursing homes..."   Where's the 33,000 people number come from?  And you say CNN has no credibility? LOL.  But nice avoiding the question. One more time: what SIGNIFICANT change has Trump made?
The reports on that mistake are mixed AT BEST -  - and Cuomo has reversed said policy  What significant policy has Trump reversed, as more information on a novel coronavirus has emerged?  But nice clinging at straws.
Trump is in no way a perfect president, but this graphic is blatant ignorance. Ya, Trump has a big mouth and he has screwed up as president, but he without a doubt has taken a stronger stance on foreign policy and creating policy that benefits America than Obama ever did
Sure, use the contrast between Trump statements and reality to condemn Trump's policies. Still seems inappropriate to pretend we are now way worse off than anyone foresaw a few months ago.
He‚Äôs trying - and will fail - to step on John Lewis funeral service. Trump is a whiny toddler. Has no compassion or empathy. Willful negligence in Covid response.
With his toadies installed on the Supreme Court, yeah, I'm not all that confident that there would be *any* check on Trump doing literally *anything*  The record so far of any of our institutions managing to check a lawless president is pretty dismal
Trump's toadies in the Senate are trying to dismiss this as "a joke."   Trump is never, ever, EVER joking. He did not joke about the Muslim ban, the wall, caging babies, injecting bleach, sending troops to bust heads, etc. etc.
Dunno. Maybe he'll close the stock market as well and nationalize all companies as subsidiaries of Trump, Inc.?
Hm. And the videos showing roaming packs of thugs many blocks away from the Fed building? The ones beating veterans and moms?  Oh yeah, and then there's the thugs gassing peaceful people so Trump can hold up a bible?
I know someone who died in a car crash and their cause of death was due to injuries sustained in the crash, not COVID. Does my anecdote trump yours? Is that how this works?
Trump 2020!
Biggest drop in GDP in history. 1 person dying every minute in the US from Covid 19. 19 straight weeks of over 1 million unemployment claims. Any guess why trump wants to delay the elections?
Americans prefer not to watch our political sausage be made. We prefer a Clinton-Bush-Obama style of secretly handling pesky problems, or dispatchin official talking points. Mr. Trump enjoys publicly making sausage. And November will likely prove a national fatigue in watching it
Trump wants to open the schools up because it's safe... but delay the election because it's unsafe.   I hate it here.
ah yes, elections that Trump loses in a landslide must be INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT
You want a thousand more?  Pretty sure you wouldn't read any of them,  listen to any Republicans that agree,  listen to anyone outside of your media bubble.  If you want to step out of the cult of Trump there's redemption, but you have to take the first step...
Russian collusion hoax investigation by muller, fabricated intel to warrant illegal spying on Trump, and General Flynn all provable facts, Corrupt FBI caught in the act, I would say the same thing . The lefts corruption cannot be trusted..
And yet, if a Supreme Court packed with Trump toadies upholds it, what then?
I‚Äôd like to see one of trump tell where to find the video of Trump saying the virus is a hoax.. I‚Äôll be waiting
... Right up to the point where it isn‚Äôt  When you let him get away with using foreign aid to Ukraine as a blackmail tool to try to rig the election, where did you think Trump would stop?  When you dismissed open corruption and incompetence, did you think he‚Äôd learned his lesson?
Imagine being  smiling when Trump acknowledged him as if he‚Äôs part of the cool kids table in middle school. Honey,  doesn‚Äôt care about you. He never will. It‚Äôs time to find new friends and actually speak for Texan interests.
You must have been living under a rock- please inform yourself-
I‚Äôm so over 2020. Herman Cain dies from COVID 19 and Trump wants to push the election out further because of mail in votes. Smh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
When your entire political philosophy boils down to ‚ÄúWhatefer Trump says, I agree with!‚Äù I don‚Äôt think actual labels apply any longer.
What? Trump didn't offer the hydraquisine? Didn't send them  bleach?
Next up: ‚ÄúTrump has never once ordered his mercenaries to open fire on crowds of starving women and children.‚Äù
Pandemic Preparedness in the Next Administration: Keynote Address by Ant...  via  Within the first 5 minutes, Dr Fauci states that Trump will face a sudden Pandemic!
Dear  - What rationalizations will you now make to retcon this? What Fox talking point will you parrot now?  Or will you continue to ignore the clear evidence?  Will you cheer when Trump‚Äôs savage mercenaries shoot Americans in the face when they try to vote?
Enter this into an addendum category to the near-constant Trump ‚Äúthere is always a Tweet‚Äù stream of deadly irony
Trump has been a grifter his entire life.  Biden sucks on money stuff, no doubt.  He's not pro-abortion up to 9 months.  No one is 'pro-abortion'. There are certain rare cases where the mother's life may be in danger where exceptions are made.  ...
Trump doesn't feel guilt. That is an emotion that's foreign to him.
The word ‚Äúlegally‚Äù is doing a lot of work there, especially when you consider Trump‚Äôs violent mercenaries beating and gassing Americans in the streets for trying to exercise their rights
This didn‚Äôt age well.
There‚Äôs stupidity. Then there‚Äôs Donald trump.
Do you think Trump is pulling the ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù card to A) use the pushback as ammo for opening schools on time B) hide the 32.9% Q2 GDP contraction (which has NEVER been over 10%)
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Well.... I feel for his family, but dammit, he let trump kill him.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress.
Trump‚Äôs musing about delaying the election because... -GDP dropped 33%. -Unemployment numbers rising again. -They have no relief package. -Maxwell indictment dropping. -Grand jury‚Äôs getting his taxes. -He‚Äôs a traitor. Let‚Äôs stay focused.
LOVE Trump ‚ù§Ô∏è
stopped flights to USA from China in January. Hillary, Nancy &amp; Chuck made fun of Trump for stopping them. But, Hillary would have 'done something'? She DID do something - made fun of what later proved to be the right decision.
The GDP dropped 33%. Let‚Äôs focus on that. Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to delay an election. This news source knows that. This is nothing but a distraction. Do better, media.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Political loyalty is going to cost people their lives. If you are of African descent, a professor or admin, Republican, and voted for Trump please love your students enough to protect them if you teach F2F in the fall. WEAR A MASK!  #AcademicTwitter #BlackInTheIvory
Trump will still tout Q3 as the greatest recovery in history and the gullible will eat it up.
You know it's going to be better in the third quarter right before the election and Trump will convince the gullible that it's the greatest recovery in history...
When all is said and done... a few years down the road... the biggest stories from this time will be the audacity and breadth of treason committed by trump and the GOP, the massive amounts of money they stole from us, and the 100‚Äôs off thousands of unnecessary deaths they caused.
That‚Äôs exactly right. In fact this has been the message of the Republican Party for decades. Trump‚Äôs just the first in a very long time to say it plainly... and they‚Äôre going to find that the part of the base that wants to be openly racist isn‚Äôt as big as they thought.
More Americans have died from Covid19 than Persian Gulf War (91), Iraq War, 9-11, and Vietnam War combined!! Fuck trump!!
Want to flip Texas blue and make Trump a one-term president?   Join fellow Democrats and make calls into Lubbock!
She doesn‚Äôt want to see Trump announce her successor...she will die in office ..
Dr. Fauci knows what he‚Äôs doing!! trump shut the fuck up!!
Just like that trump is right back in this race. Buckle up we got a looooooooooong 96 days ahead of us.
President Trump signed 4 pipeline permits that will, in part, allow Texas to export crude oil to Mexico.

Republican Voters Against Trump Face Masks! This is awesome! #NobodyLikesTrump
Trump is a racist....plain and simple.
Trump has more rape cases against him and the stuff on Biden turned out to be false. And whose name did epstein have in the book? Hmmmm not Biden but Trump...trumps even admitted liking young girls. Back your stuff up with some facts...
Trump isnt an American patriot. He is a Russian Patriot! 150,000 AMERICANS dead cause he is an idiot. He is pushing a pill that doesnt help covid19 patients but it sure is filling the Trump bank accounts. How can 1 even think trump is patriotic with what he done to Ameicans?
trump is a monster üò°üò°
Why would Trump winning be more likely to produce a Tom Cotton?  Remember, John Kasich wasn't the runner up to Trump.  That would be Ted Cruz.  The more competent fascist will be waiting in the wings regardless of who wins this year IMO.

Trump delivers remarks, signs executive orders on lowering drug prices  via
Trump was publicly critical of his GOP allies over the $1.7 billion for FBI headquarters that‚Äôs included in the bill, but which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later said he opposes as not related to virus relief.
Trump refuses to autograph Dan Patrick‚Äôs mask
It's all projection. Trump thinks that everyone he needs to like him is, well, like him  That is: irredeemably racist and a garbage person  Thus, he crafts his policies to appeal to such people  Our national shame is that such policies are often popular
Oh, this is going to drive Trump batshit crazy with envy  He may knife Mitch McConnell just so he can try to one-up Obama
Trump is an extreme case, but the degree to which Americans defer to the wealthy creates monsters who are convinced of their own genius &amp; superiority because everyone bows &amp; scrapes to them  Many running around the movie industry, for example
really curious what you have to say about Trump ending the AFFH.
really curious what you have to say about Trump ending the AFFH.
I‚Äôm sorry, but the price oil has bottomed out since Trump took office. How is that good for the oil industry? The jobs disappeared, too. How has he helped Texas? What‚Äôs that you say? It hasn‚Äôt.
I think it more likely that the longer things stay shut down,  less possible it is for Trump to be able to pretend that Everything Is Awesome (now vote for me!)  They may have a malignant plan, but truly, after 4 yrs of utter incompetence, I doubt their ability to wipe themselves
And before January 21, 2021, Trump will go lower, lower, lower still...we underestimate his ability to do evil brand of damage to people and our country's institutions.
Love that Trump and Arrington nor the military guys have on masks!!

Donald J Trump has appointed a new campaign manager, he believes she's a genius and continued to show his support for her. Congrats Donnie Dotard!
Really? And trump and pence are promoting a doctor who believes demons and witches impregnate people while they are dreaming. Land of the free? Sending federal agents to hurt non violent protesters doesnt seem like the land of the free to me
How cool is this?!  The United States Secret Service and  asked our very own Lubbock Motorcycle Squad to assist with the Presidential motorcade!  Early this morning, our officers headed out to Midland to help escort President Trump from the airport to Odessa!
He's actually worried that people will learn about modern monetary theory. (MMT)
Representative Louie Ghomert was banned earlier today from boarding Air Force One and flying to Midland, Texas, with President Trump.  Ghomert apparently tested positive to COVID-19 before boarding Air Force One.

Mona is ALMOST there. So close.   Drill down past Trump, and what you find is the entire right-wing lie machine that deludes conservatives, feeds them fantasies, and ignores or exonerates criminals and corruption  That is the true face of the enemy.

trump really is a childish insecure immature narcissistic attention grabbing pussy Bitch!!
We have seen countless federal agencies bend to Trump‚Äôs will‚Äîdespite the fact they have to dishonor themselves and betray their duty to the Constitution in order to do so‚Äîand there‚Äôs literally no reason to think these agencies are going to suddenly find a spine in January.
If 77% of voters trust CDC &amp; 23% trust the Trump administration, then 100% of voters trust.... The Trump Administration
And if there are Trump loyalists within the leadership of the Secret Service and military, what makes anyone think they will put their duty to the Constitution above that loyalty?
Trump is combining some fundraising Wednesday with his first trip to an oil and gas rig and to his first visit as president to the Permian Basin.
If Trump begins making hay about how the election was stolen‚Äîa possibility that grows ever-more-likely when you consider it will probably be several weeks between Election Day and when the results are finalized, given the pandemic‚Äîthe Republican establishment will fall in line.
The thrust of these ‚ÄúRelax, everyone‚Äù articles is that the Republican political and media establishment will see the writing on the wall if Trump loses, and so will pressure him to give up the White House. Umm... what fucking planet have these journalists been living on?
The Trump administration is dismantling DACA. We've had ENOUGH.   Send your senator a letter demanding they defund ICE &amp; pass permanent solutions without hurting people by supporting HR6, the Dream and Promise Act. Join the fight with
The Constitutional lawyer in me needs everyone to understand that our system literally buckles in the face of someone like Trump‚Äîsomeone who disregards norms and traditions, and who possesses almost no regard for his fellow Americans or the American ideal.
I have been reading a lot of articles that basically say ‚ÄúRelax, everyone: Trump can‚Äôt refuse to leave office if he loses.‚Äù These takes are universally naive, and show a real lack of understanding of just how much Trump has been able to get away with by simply ignoring norms.
Trump can never admit he was wrong, even about rambling off the cuff. These fucks can also never admit Trump was wrong or that they were wrong about Trump.
Twenty-two Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee fired back with a letter to Trump saying a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe‚Äôs defense would encourage Russian aggression and opportunism.

Sounds to me like he‚Äôs saying russia(trump) is planning to print millions of fraudulent ballots. But I‚Äôm just an alarmist.
I figured that a lot of them were people who had no stakes in the election.  It doesn't make sense why somebody who has to live in this country would allow the possibility of Trump over something as trivial as the difference between M4A and Biden's health care plan.
Yep, Trump screwed up the COVID response and Pelosi sat and watched him burn and ultimately over 200k will die to help ensure they win the Whitehouse in 2020.

A thing I've noticed on this site is that everybody spends more time talking themselves into why Trump might come back for no particular reason and very little time talking about the possibility that Biden's lead may get larger.
Democrats say this visit won't help Trump's chances in the state come November, but Republicans say Texas is still a deeply red state. What do you think?

While I do wish Trump had more of a sense of decorum, I'm glad he doesn't give our money away to people that are full of shit. The notion that people believe diplomats are pillars of morality is bonkers to me. Same people that probably give a trophy to every team, first to last.

‚ÄúFaithless electors are going to save the Republic‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrump refusing to accept the election results carries any legal weight‚Äù are somehow believed by some of the same people.
Watch now
We‚Äôre gonna have to do it over.
A thought I just had: I am more concerned about the possibility of Trump dropping out in October than I am about the possibility of Trump refusing to accept the results.
President Trump recently announced the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida was cancelled, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just not the right time for that‚Äù due to coronavirus concerns.
The reason why peaceful transfer of power breaks down is because a significant portion of people in power don‚Äôt accept the legitimacy of the election results.  Like it‚Äôs a problem if the military has Trump‚Äôs back on this, but not just if Trump is screaming into the void.
It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Trump accepts the results; what matters is whether the American people (and here I‚Äôm specifically excluding Trump dead-enders) accept the results.

I am an older woman &amp; I have seen many a fair politican a few even great, some pretty bad ones, a few really bad ones but only one I could dub evil! I hate that I am living in the Time of Trump which I perceive too to be unredeemable. My days simply run together as I wait for Nov
This is exactly why I think publicly pushing the ‚ÄúTrump will steal the election‚Äù stuff is dumb.  It gives people an excuse to not vote if they think the game is rigged.  (Same with Bernie, actually.)
CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî Twitter has temporarily halted President Donald Trump‚Äôs son from tweeting on its site after he shared a video riddled with unsupported claims about the coronavirus Monday.

So much irony coming from someone who wants so badly to be Trump‚Äôs lapdog. Not even good enough for that. What a worthless rep. Can‚Äôt wait to vote against you in 98 days.
This weekend I visited a blue state next to Texas for a weekend vacation. I won't say which state but it rhymes with blue texico. Never saw a Democrat sign anywhere. Saw Trump signs. Saw plenty of California license plates headed east loaded with furniture.

Cohn was portrayed in the HBO show 'Angels in America.' In the movie he said he wasn't gay, only that he had sex with men. Also in the movie: when dying of AIDS, made his doctor write in his medical file that it was liver cancer. When Trump learned Cohn had AIDS, deserted Cohn.
I mean how is Trump going to attack Kamala for putting people in jail?

They're afraid of the delicate sensibilities of reactionaries.   And too tired to be ready to continually fight the lies. It's sad that Trump might lose *only* because 1000's of people are dead and millions have lost their jobs.
It's hard to watch bernie videos now. Knowing he won't be president. I mean trump or biden is the best we got? Jesus that's depressing.
Peter Strzok believes that President Trump is Russian asset. Here are the details on the upcoming release of his new book.
If you want the reason to reelect Donald Trump and a landslide of Republicans in the 2020 General Election, listen to the opening speeches of both Jim Jordan and Attorney General Barr.  Our Liberty will be restored.
And this is who Trump trusts more than Fauci?   No doubt she's already been offered her own show on Fox to spread lunacy &amp; lies about a malevolent alien takeover ...   Hmm. On second thought, THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING!!

In their thirst to stick it to Trump, Pelosi was taking tours through SF China town in late February... actually had a house committee pass a bill in mid February to prevent him from restricting travel from China or anywhere over Covid. Trump under-reacted, but Pelosi was AWOL.
With Covid.. listen to Fauci.. end of February was saying this was not a big deal... Trump did listen to them... they were wrong... arguably due to misinformation from the Chinese... but now they have big credibility issues with him... big suprise.
The constitution creates elections to remove deeply hated presidents... impeachment is for removing those who commit High Crimes and Misdemeanors... and I will happily compare the crimes of Obama over Trump...
She is prioritizing taking the Whitehouse in November over saving peoples lives... deliberately staying at arms length... letting Trump go down in his own self inflicted flames... it's the most callous thing I have seen in politics.

I generally think not giving Trump free campaign attacks is a good strategy.
It‚Äôs nauseating. They knew in a couple months there was no collusion. Now, it became clear Trymps campaign was run by idiots as well. But, a coordinated conspiracy? Come on. Trump‚Äôs Campaign could barely tie their shoes.
He was trump squared. How do people not see that... take every bad thing about trump.  Square it.  Philandering, sexually assaults, tax fraud, bribery. Except the was charming and a Democrat where it‚Äôs ok to be misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and a crook.

Gaslighting is pretending both the Democrats and Republicans didn't screw this up royally. At a time we needed them to work together, they used this as a way to attack each other... and 200K people will pay the price. Trump is not by any means blameless.
Drink the Kool-aid some more... maybe you can believe Biden really wasn't a racist homophobe in the 80s... seriously.
She is not a coward.. I actually used to respect her... but she saw Covid as a chance to let Trump flounder and swing the election... and who cared about the 200K that will die.
Trump senate trial February 6th. CDC issues first Covid alert January 6th.. First Senate hearing January 23... no press attend due to Impeachment deadlines that day.

Do you people seriously not see the propaganda campaign let by the media. You guys are brainwashed into believing the billions of anti trump BS they say every other word. Even with a negative view of the man it's obvious he cant be controlled. Biden in the epitome of a puppet.

I mean, I guess this depends on what you think of Trump, someone who has probably paid for an abortion at some point.
If Biden wins, we won‚Äôt have this issue much longer after election. If Trump wins... well, we will hear of this for even longer.
Fred Trump didn't teach his boy very well, did he?
Its too important for Pelosi to wash her hands of this. Trump may run the administration, but she has a major role... And for the record... Bengazi and the email server were baseless political theater. So was Ukraine. Bounties a joke.Trump? I'd vote for a good Dem alt - not Biden
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Melania Trump has announced plans to redo the White House Rose Garden to make it more in line with the original design implemented during the 1960s Kennedy administration.
Wonder if he's gonna vote for tRump again
No I don't deny that... Trump has spent more than Obama and is set to outpace him with spending by far. Congress does write laws and obama legislated from office but so has Trump. Youre making my points love.
Melania Trump on Monday announced details of a plan already under way to spruce up the White House Rose Garden, the iconic outdoor space famous for its proximity to the Oval Office.
Trump seeks political shot in the arm in vaccine push
I read Reuters and for opinion go to Reason. Do you somehow deny the fact he has created more debt than any president ever? You can literally see the numbers... Europe, our closest allies openly mock Trump. Do you deny he has done nothing to support Hong Kong... cause show me Lol
I'm no Trump fanatic... and yes, seriously believe this. Besides, do you think Trump would first admit this was out of control in order to blame Pelosi for part of it? Come on.

So trump refuses to pay respect to Civil Rights Icon and Congressman John Lewis!! Because it would insult his KKK base!! Fuck trump you racist fuck!!
The easiest way for Trump to get re-elected is tto cut the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $2.13, plus tips. White, male, non college educated voters would flock to Trump for saving them so much income tax!  And Trump and his fellow Republican fat cats would change to victory!

Was there more than this tweet? If not, he merely stated a fact. Trump is, in fact, the president. The sky is blue and grass is green. This is completely asinine.
Then again, there are days when I wonder if we‚Äôre even going to have an election this year.   Trump may just unleash his stormtroopers to gas and shoot anyone who tries to vote against him  Are we just rearranging deck chairs at this point?
Thanks. I‚Äôll take a look at it. My opinions were mostly formed by watching her grill mendacious Trump toadies in hearings   Earned her the label of ‚Äúnasty‚Äù from Cheetolini
Gee, give me a break. Half of the country thinks Clinton did it and the other half think Trump did it. I'm asking you what gave you the impression, not me. I've looked into some of these (some I've never heard of) and the more I dig, I find that the media skewed their coverage
Counterpoint: do Benghazi news cycles make Trump look good?
Trump basically said fuck your civil rights movement. I would say I‚Äôm surprised .. but naw 2020 is a nightmare
yeah, and like, I‚Äôm not sure why giving Trump an out to make the election a choice between Trump‚Äôs idiocy and outright socialism is a great idea
Figures that Trump built a wall around the public White House. #NeverTrump   This madness gets worse each day.
And like if you have a debate on foreign policy, what exactly would make anyone think that this helps Trump?
Yes... and Trump propagated and encouraged that same division. Just because a former president was bad doesn't mean the current one isn't.
President Donald Trump on Monday welcomed a Marine veteran to the White House as he completed his 300-mile walk to the nation's capital to raise awareness about the problem of veteran suicide.

Yes we are, and we will make sure every last person is registered and ready to vote out trump, cornyn, and Texas Republicans. We‚Äôre flipping Texas y‚Äôall. #PoweredXPeople
Yeah, umm this should probably be deleted along with the firing of the campaign fundraiser and the social media director. Not a good look to attack a TRUMP SUPPORTER.
The senate brought attention to the issue... Trump even said it was what drove him to restrict travel from China.. saved thousands of lives... The House punted for a full month to even hold a hearing... Democrats in the Senate certainly did not try to keep this secret.
The party that nominated Trump just isn‚Äôt nominating Charlie Baker.  This is complete nonsense.  I‚Äôm not even sure they would nominate Nikki Haley.
Both came be true... Trump admin under-responded and Pelosi did nothing to help until it was far too late, and even impeded the process by distracting the press and congress at a critical time. Lots of blame to go around.
The comparison is EXTREMELY telling. Does Jodey Arrington subscribe to Texas values OR Washington values? Look at his words and actions. No meetings with constituents, only support of Trump. He's got to go!
Everyone thinks voting trump out will end end thisFascism, bit in reality Joe Biden had a heavy hand in creating the current police state, and I refuse to let covert Fascism back into our lives #Bernieorbust
I am not a fan of Joe Biden, and normally would vote Green or Socialist. But this is so important that I will vote Biden this November: How the global #climate fight could be lost if Trump is re-elected #ClimateChange
Even if it was all true and much was it was SOP for every administration. Show me a president that didn't use foreign policy to get elected. My god, Obama actually sicked the FBI on the opposition presidential campaign based on a known false premise. What Trump did was trivial.
Because he actually committed crimes and lost the support of the Republicans. There were no crimes committed with Trump... even the Democratic House Managers admitted that... said it could be just about a nebulous abuse of office. Both sides knew it was a baseless political hit.
Covid became the primary political football to defeat Trump in February... Anything Trump was for, she was against. Country first! The Strategy - create divisions, attack the administration, blame them for the chaos... and wash your hands of responsibility.
melania trump is as useless as donald, donald jr., eric and lvanka put together.

And certainly not unprecedented as the papers say, Johnson did the same thing to Nixon ... pulled Laos into digging up dirt to undermine his candidacy against Hum pries. Johnson did so much worse compared to trump.

Deep-pocketed and often anonymous donors are pouring over $100 million into an intensifying dispute about whether it should be easier to vote by mail, a fight that could determine President Donald Trump‚Äôs fate in the November election.
Of course Baron Trump will not have to worry about his private school not opening for school. And djt can afford private tutors and whatever his little heart desires.

The Trump of the Democratic party... loud, mean and clueless. God help us... she will be president one day.
Had she been the nominee, and picked a young (non AOC) progressive... she would have won hands down... with Biden on the top of the ticket... Trump better win this or god help us.
Get them out of there. Quit being Trump‚Äôs GMan, America is smarter than this.
When will the LameStream Media,   etc, actually investigate the fact that Obama, Biden and their staff speed on Trump during his Campaign and after he was Elected President? Are LameStream Media scared of the TRUTH? Who‚Äôs paying LameStream Media not to investigate
Trump tweeted Sunday that he won‚Äôt be able to make the trip because of his ‚Äústrong focus‚Äù on the coronavirus, vaccines and the economy.
If you were a trump supporter you‚Äôd have no brain for complex thinking like that.
You know, if they wanted independents... Kamala Harris.. she was the most interesting of them all. Strong on crime, tough demeanor but likable... she may be VP I hear... but its just not the same. I would have hands down voted for her over Trump.
But its why I don't trust anyone anymore when it comes to Trump.
Add to that a nearly bankrupt news industry needing to generate clicks to survive... they all conspired to push this lie. It certainly wasn't hard... its easy to hate Trump.
Got into a guy one time who insisted Hunter S. would have absolutely loved Trump.
Oh, Trump lies... a lot... all politicians do. But its like The NY Times said.. its unique times and the previous standards don't apply to Trump. Hence, before I believe it (and I have no delusions he is a saint), I need to know peoples motivations.
Puto‚Äôs can‚Äôt throw pitches. They just abused other puto‚Äôs.   Trump‚Äôs technically a Puto Sien Verga.   Don‚Äôt know what that is? You don‚Äôt live in Texas.
This mentality is why Trump‚Äôs admin and his ‚Äúplatform‚Äù exist and can do whatever they want. These people are stupid enough to put us in the position of losing all our freedom and they won‚Äôt notice until they‚Äôre dying and won‚Äôt have to deal with it :)
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump will shift his focus to American energy dominance during a stop in Texas later this week that will include his first visit to an oil rig.
I just wish that if there was anything the last 3.5 years taught us was that with so many people willing to lie to take him down... FBI officials, newspapers, House chairs... you have to vet the motivations of the source. Trump is nasty... and hatred makes people Machiavellian.
Yes that‚Äôs trump‚Äôs wall. Blown over by a simple tropical storm.
This is the perfect metaphor. Everything trump did will crumble in the wind. We are the wind.
You forgot to mention that Omar Navarro has stalked an ex GF and violated his restraining order. But ‚Äúagree with him on everything‚Äù is a little strange.  Btw, so glad I get to watch rugby with fans, wish Trump would‚Äôve had a more stern effort to stop the Trump Virus.
AP: President Donald Trump won‚Äôt be throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after all.
So ... how soon until we find out that Trump pocketed BILLIONS in kickbacks and bribes, built a shitty wall that a stiff breeze can knock over, and is now demanding more $$ to do it all over again?
Because you can bet your asses all of the Trump-y boomers and gen x‚Äôers are going to make sure to go out in full force for Trump. And I can NOT endure another 4 years
Imagine going into a coma January, 2020 and waking up today. Kobe Bryant dead, the NBA playing in a bubble, people wearing masks, Trump talking daily about the radical left Democrats, Kanye west running for president, oh and Regis Kelly dead.. A nightmare we can't wake up from...

Under Obama, Texas Republican lawmakers punched up at the feds. Under Trump, they punched down at locals. And now, in their most vulnerable cycle in 20 years, they‚Äôre punching at each other.
I think I would rather have Biden as President with a Republican Senate than Trump with a full Democratic congress.

President Trump has almost doubled his support among Black voters.  He was elected in 2016 with 08% of the Black vote.  Trump is now receiving support from 14% of Black voters, with 09% still undecided.  Receiving 16% of the Black vote would insure his victory over Joe Biden.
Students for Trump! You guys have to be strong from coast to coast! Too many universities are teaching liberal views and those students are brain washed and even throw frozen water bottles at police! Students for Trump grow your base, knock on doors. Please.

Trump‚Äôs a dirtbag...but he acts just like this to those who follow him as well.  ...and Biden is on multiple videos literally telling people to vote for someone else because he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to them. Not sure how that shows he cares for all constituents.

Trump has dragged this economy straight into the gutter. We will be like that movie The Book of Eli if we are forced to remain under this idiot.  He is awful.
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.
The human side of the party will be appalled, the Trump's side not so much.
Greg Gutfield is a hypocrite-so high &amp; mighty complaining abt Twitter!  2-3 weeks ago he posted on Twitter saying "Everybody should hate all Republicans! They shld  hate all Republicans &amp; President Trump!" Don't believe me? Ask him!
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.
Trump is like any loser who isn't "winning". Whenever they start losing they try anything to cheat. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.

Oh really? John Cornyn is a trump lap dog.
This is why he called the press in. Another photo op and distraction on this day of final goodbyes to John Lewis. Trump is a pig from hell. How dare he use people in this fashion? Uncouth ass.
I hope now all the black conservatives out there Will stop listening to your God King Trump and wear a fucking mask  there is no reason this man, who I do not agree with on anything, should be dead right now #RIPhermanCain

From what I was saying the Democrats they were just bitching and yelling at him never let him answer any of the questions. The Democrats are the ones that are lying dividing and trying to cheat this whole time Trump has been in the presidency
Just in time for the 2020 Presidential Campaign, Trump has a new hat.
Yeah your right....... Keep letting that TDS affect your vision.
Nice meme. Could put Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton (both), Pelosi, Schumer and many more before putting Trump on it.  How‚Äôs that TDS doing? Must take your medicine before it drives you crazy üòú
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He‚Äôll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
And every warning has fallen on deaf ears. And when state leaders actually try to do something useful to help, the Trump bunch cry out unconstitutional. It is so sadly stupid that anyone cares about those idiots.
I live in a suburb of Dallas. A blue collar suburb. We have quite a few low income housing complexes here. I live in an eclectic neighborhood of many races. My home values are fine and seeing an increase as opposed to going down. Trump is wrong.

Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, dies from coronvavirus  via
The nomination of a retired general for a senior civilian position in the Trump administration was cast into doubt when his confirmation hearing was canceled just before it was scheduled to begin amid signs that he did not have enough GOP votes.
Cain reportedly learned that he tested positive for COVID-19 on June 29. He was hospitalized two days later after developing ‚Äúserious‚Äù symptoms.  His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa.
Very sad bc this dude should still be alive. This is what happens when the disinformation of the trump administration and his supporters resonates in their minds.
Two trump ass kissers.
Trump wants to open schools now but then delay the election??? The hypocrisy and corruption of the trump administration and his supporters knows no end.
Trump continues to try to tap into the ‚Äúfears and anger and resentment of people...and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.‚Äù
Mr. Obama spoke about how Mr. Trump has a core base that ‚Äúfilters out any contradictory information.‚Äù
Mr. Obama was asked what keeps him up at night these days. He cited fears of voter suppression and an effort by Mr. Trump to question the election‚Äôs legitimacy.
New York and other states sued the Trump administration over new limits on the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù rule, which critics said would discourage immigrants from seeking medical treatment during the pandemic.
‚ÄúIn the campaign of 1968, my father, Governor George Wallace, understood the potential political power of downtrodden and disillusioned working class white voters who felt alienated from government. And Donald Trump is mining the same mother lode.‚Äù
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
And Mr. Trump‚Äôs claim that mail voting leads to inaccurate counts or fraud is false.
Mr. Trump has no authority to unilaterally change the date of the election, which is set by federal law. His suggestion comes as polls show him trailing far behind Mr. Biden in surveys of nearly all of the key battleground states.
Even for Mr. Trump, suggesting a delay in the election is an extraordinary breach of presidential decorum that will increase the chances that Mr. Trump and his core supporters don‚Äôt accept the legitimacy of the election should he lose.
On Thursday, for the first time, Mr. Trump in a tweet suggested the vote be delayed ‚Äúuntil people can properly, securely and safely vote,‚Äù something he cannot legally do.
The president is very clear about how he wants things done,‚Äù said David Lapan, who was DHS spokesman during the first year of the Trump administration, ‚Äúand the ability of people to push back when they‚Äôre in an acting capacity is much more limited.‚Äù

BLM GROUPS HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EXCEPT FURTHER DISTANCING ALL THE YEARS OF PROGRESS MADE BY ALL PEOPLE BLACK AND WHITE WHO STRIVED FOR A BETTER AMERICA. BUT AMERICAS LEADERS WHO HATE TRUMP FORMED" SYSTEMIC RACISM" IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN AMERICA AT ALL COST. WAR!
Opponents spinning wheels   They say he serves Putin, risks Germany.  Then mock Trump 'he only moved them to Poland' like its a fake draw down well if the troops R still nearby how can one argue that it puts Europe at risk?  when you get to be prez YOU can decide where to deploy
Donald Trump pulls 12,000 troops out of Germany slashing presence there by a third because Angela Merkel is ‚Äòdelinquent‚Äô on NATO spending
I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.
why do trump supporters even exist???
Do you not realize who Ronald Reagan was? He was just as racist as Donald Trump if not worse

If President Obama had reason to say 'Protect the people's park' I would have agreed with him.  If Obama had said, 'I'm president, &amp; have the right to walk across the street' -- agree again.  So I can hardly reverse that to say Trump was wrong.
There is no misunderstanding on Barr's part.  It is intentional.  He doesn't care as evidenced by today's testifying.  Barr was a pick by racist Trump.

President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
The  found in an analysis of more than 200 Portland arrests that even those accused of breaking the law during the¬†liberal city‚Äôs¬†nightly rallies don‚Äôt neatly fit into President Donald Trump‚Äôs depiction of protesters as¬†‚Äúanarchists and agitators.‚Äù
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there‚Äôs that.
Donald trump could never do you hear me. NEVER. #JohnLewisMemorial

I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. ü§£
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his ‚Äújoke‚Äù about injecting people with bleach. He wasn‚Äôt joking.
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.

Yes, we must! We simply have to get rid of tRump and every treasonous republiCON up for re-election! We have to take the country back from the racists, the haters, the white supremacists, the fascists and idiots who, collectively, are driving us to ruin and even to death!
I wonder what Superspreader Trump will say about this?  Trump, now has one less vote.
I did not vote for him and have no opinion on Mr. Cain as a person.  I did not like his politics.  No one should be attending Trump rallies, with or without a mask.

The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Bonus points if the scientists who performed this work were atheistic socialists, so we could rest assured knowing they are not sell outs to Trump making ship up like the CDC is (when it disagrees with us).
Yeah, if Trump delivered Heman Cain‚Äôs eulogy (fat chance) and touted the virtues of 9-9-9, I doubt it would even make the front page.
Well troll patrol, besides stalking Trump supporters, spreading demo propaganda what have you LITERALLY done for black lives? Did you get the lowest unemployment #'s EVER for black, Asian, Latino, women's lives the list goes on?  What did you do to help?
Okay.  Can they name something Trump has accomplished ‚Äî besides inheriting millions ‚Äî in the past 50 years?
You are a dope
Time for Trump to set another record.   Nixon should have been jailed; that was gross negligence.  We can't make that mistake again or the GOP will never learn.
I can‚Äôt stand Latinos that support trump. Like bitch he‚Äôll send your ass back too. Even if you‚Äôre from here
Here‚Äôs a deal. As per trump phd, md, dds, os, ocd, da, pa, rn there‚Äôs no danger in reopening schools. Leadership by example. Send his kid to a public school for a month to show just how safe it is. If not safe for his own son, it‚Äôs not safe for anyone‚Äôs child.
No class!  No character No integrity  Loser, and waste Bottom feeder And big mike is ugly 8 long years of hell Pulling America through hate  Causing riots. Killings of black on black and saying its racism He was a puppet  And it is over! I woke up and Trump is My  President!
With Trump it is always about him.
John Lewis didn't go to George Bush inauguration but he was there.  Descent people find a way to have humility,  Trump has a mental issue.  He doesn't even relate to his wife and child.
Trump‚Äôs inability to grasp or refusal to accept proven scienfitic concepts is killing Americans.  No more conspiracy theories.  No more dead Americans. We need science not propaganda.  #TrumpHatesScience
They got their judges, they just want to wash their hands of him. No back-peddling, trump's their monster now.
Im sure Trump is loving that. I sick to death of this man. We need to all stand up and vote him out. He is killing us.
This is HUGE they are effectively washing their hands of Trump and the GOP

I firmly believe trump is ugly on twitter to strategically divert focus toward his words and away from his policies. One side only cares about his policies, and the other hardly calls his policies out and focuses on him being mean. Democratic politicians fall for it all the time.
Voters unwillingness to reveal support for Trump is affecting poll numbers After 2016 many voters made a decision not to reveal any true feelings to pollsters
So wrong in SO many ways!!! President Trump next!
Dude went to that last trump rally and 10 days later got the virus smh
Tea, have you seen  's #TrumpsEvilPlan ? Trump will do anything to get reelected.
Most Americans voted for Trump
This man has ALOT OF FUCKING NERVE!  The GOP are cutting unemployment benefits from 600 to 200. But yet Mitch thinks it‚Äôs okay to give an unrelated to the pandemic, 1.75 Billion to build a new FBI building down the street from Trump Tower! During a pandemic. üò° he is such a POS!

Then just why is trump voting by mail? No time? Sure. It would interfere with his golf game when he‚Äôs down in FL. 72% of this country wants mail in voting. Rs and Ds. He just wants to grab more attention for himself. Still no action on the bounties. Sure respects our military.
Guess you think more of Trump and less of Biden  than I do to let His VP pick determine who‚Äôs you‚Äôll vote for POTUS.  If his pick is an empty. An of beer I am voting for Joe

How many innocent lives are worth having fair elections?  We have given up too much to stop following the Science and Data now.  If Trump really cares about saving American lives he will issue an executive order and hold off having the elections until it is safe.
Send a message to voters instead please!  Trump won't listen nor his cultists.  We need to all vote as if we are losing this race and even then if we win it through a massive #BlueWave expect Trump and his cult to fight and possibly use violence in protest against it.
Hypocrite.   You looked at a shift in 2012. Talked about it on TV. But Trump asks the question and you panic.   Pathetic.
Works for me let's claim Trump as 2020 Election winner an call it a year.
You cannot make this claim and then turn around and vote for Trump or any who make allowances for his behavior.

Fine by me if it also means we drag Trump out of office.
What is it going to take to get Trump to shut his racist mouth and stop saying ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù?  It‚Äôs so offensive and does not make anyone believe he‚Äôs somehow not responsible.
Trump will remain a factor, but minority parties have a way of many voices being relevant.  And Trump isn‚Äôt on the 2022 ballot either.
I‚Äôm not surprised that MSM are having a moment Today! It‚Äôs what they do! Trump can play them like a Fiddle! We won‚Äôt be having  Mail-In Votes Dimwads!
Trump and his complicit republicans are doing a good job of making our democracy ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.  I hate all of them for violating their oaths of office.  There is nothing worse than a liar with no honor and no ethics.

That is exactly correct.  Trump continues to make horrendous mistakes and refuses to listen to the experts because he thinks he is an expert at everything.
Take a good look at Twitter "trending" tonight.   MichelleObama Podcast  Evict Trump CNNTownhall TrumpHatesScience  Notice a pattern?
So you think ONE person can run a nation wide response solely on their own without anyone else involved? You do realized the blue cities and states "resisted" when Trump ordered their compliance, as did all the sheeple.   There is the problem right there - own it.
You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
Sad, but true. The Left has gone full fascist! Censoring medicine and medical advice to make Trump look bad. Sad.
I think this is what they call getting rid of the riff raff. It's why people like Trump like borders and country club memberships. Jack up the prices until "undesirables" can't afford to hang, then all you have left are the willfully ignorant deplorables.

Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äù refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN‚ÄôT wearing masks because Europe‚ù§Ô∏èTrump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb

The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

Ahh yes, another Republican that Never Trump GOPers will fellate dry for taking an action that is too little too late.   Want to do something? Introduce articles of impeachment for Trump and Barr.
Has our system of government exceeded its life expectancy too? Because your man Trump is working on trashing it, too, Fifth Generation American.
#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump often displays ignorance, but this tweet is actually a symptom of his brain decline, cognitive impairment, &amp; frank mental illness. He is out of touch with reality &amp; is incompetent.
Trump has dragged this economy straight into the gutter. We will be like that movie The Book of Eli if we are forced to remain under this idiot.  He is awful.
May I also remind you what the democratic party was busy worrying about instead of COVID? Trying to find some reason to impeach Trump. None of them were concerned at all. Forgot about that part right?

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people‚Äôs lives?
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.

You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.

Nancy Dumbass Pelosi said in February we have nothing to fear come out and enjoy your self while she was walking around China Town is SF. And when Trump stoped all flights from China the democrats said he was being xenophobic.
None of them are going to work. Remember the parable of the scorpion and the frog. Trump is the scorpion. It‚Äôs all over.

If Trump is going to lose anyway, isn‚Äôt this a great year to put forth a third party conservative candidate to lay the groundwork for a victory in 2024? Who can we recruit?   Anybody is preferable to 95% of what the Republican Party is offering.
Important. Congress and SCOTUS must stand up to this kind of behavior.
Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.

I don't think it's breaking news that Donald Trump will have to use absentee balloting in November. He lives at the White House but his residence is in Florida. duh The media acts like absentee balloting and mail-in voting are the same thing. They're NOT.

Wonder if Trump knows what a hanging chad is.
(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.
(2) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump at fake briefing now drones his monotone script with (a) reduced freestyle BS; (b) fewer questions from press; &amp; (c) always calling on Sinclair/OAN minions.
(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He‚Äôs no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump‚Äôs
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!‚≠êÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚≠êÔ∏è

one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y‚Äôall goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?

Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
lol.  no one believes your bullshit Rafael.  Energy costs to $65,000 lolol.  Your Donald Trump economy is in the toilet.  All the problems are happening on your watch.  Blaming future democrats for your problems is laughable.
Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
Watching  make Zuck feel uncomfortable never gets old. I wanna see her debate trump.
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes

Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.

My issue with Will is that he is ex-IC. He co-signed on way too many tRump attacks on our IC people and sources around the world. He knows better than most of how dangerous tRump has been to our national security and he will forever wear the Scarlett T as far as I‚Äôm concerned.

Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn‚Äôt exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don‚Äôt buy that he‚Äôd have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump‚Äôs rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I‚Äôm not convinced Trump‚Äôs team can thwart it.

No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him

I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump‚Äôs birth certificate to verify his birth info).

President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.

Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump‚Äôs term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You‚Äôre all talk with no action.  Why hasn‚Äôt anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn‚Äôt like trump when McCain was alive but since then you‚Äôre playing good guy to trump. It‚Äôs obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.

Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don‚Äôt matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
Trump is often persuading.  His goal here may be to draw attention to problems in mail-in voting.  Or it may be to get Democrats to commit to accepting the results of the election.  Or it could be a random thought, but don't ignore persuasion or you will misunderstand Trump.
The ignorant love Trump.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that‚Äôs cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples‚Äô lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn‚Äôt accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.
NO MASK. Trump does not care because anyone near him gets tested. Trump is safe while he let's 150,000 die. DUMP MALIGNANT TRUMP
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  üò¥

To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.

John Lewis never accepted ANY election results when Democrats had to hand over power to Republicans. He never attended inaugural for George W Bush nor Trump. Not accepting election results is what happens in banana republics. The only people who refuse to accept results are Dems.

Of course, Trump was too busy to pay his respects at the Capitol ... only dropping the ball when it's inopportune ... or continually ... whichever is more frequent.
where did  get those rediculas polls about Trump dividing and hurting the country? VI don't remember anyone asking me or polling my neighborhood.

#trumppresser Q : How come Trump never catches #Covid19?  A: Covid19 is very rare in the non-human species.
Defeating trump in November will only cause the white nationalists in the Republican Party to redouble their efforts to erase the last 70 years of social and economic progress. Fortunately, though they will be more motivated than ever, they will be left far less capable
Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.üôÑ

He's a coward who've seen the internal polling and Trump is in for a shellacking.   He had a chance to vote for impeachment and show some grit, but voted against - because then Trump was still polling good.
And these theories being floated by Trump and his cult. Going on every air wave to speak nonsense
I‚Äôm short‚Äî fuck Trump. ü•∞ü•∞
Trump and names!
Trump is essentially saying that HIS government than HE‚ÄôS had control over for 3.5 years is too inept and too ineffective to pull off national mail-in voting.
Trump kills democrats to improve chances of re-election. Its far worst than false claims of voter fraud. He is literally killing out the competition.     2nd impeachment needs to be considered on principle. Ppl r dying 1 per minute
Yeah no. If you Americans like Death and destruction you can vote for Trump he can give that to you.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.
Yeah no chance in Hell trump wins in November

Trump is the most clear and present danger to us right now. Above Covid. He has endangered Americans with his conjectures and confusing data, pushing lies &amp; outright incorrect medical info, and letting Jared muck up the national testing program. We need to move this election UP!
Yeah that‚Äôs a whole lot of bullshit trump. The vast majority of Americans hate you. Can‚Äôt wait for NOVEMBER 3
Why can't ONE JOURNALIST tell trump that Absentee Ballots and Mail-In Ballots are THE SAME DAMN THING?

I can assure everyone Trump will tweet something false and stupid tomorrow.
Let the record show that  DID NOT PUSH BACK. He said Trump ‚Äúwas joking‚Äù so that when he really does try to move the election, John can then say that Trump told us what he was going to do months ago. We‚Äôve been here before. #JohnTheComic

This is an issue because Trump's polling numbers are terrible. He's  trying to use the expected rise in absentee ballots due to Covid-19 (no one knows what the # will be) to shovel conspiracy theories. This time he has Barr helping to peddle the theories.

There appear to be more than a few people upset by people who point out that Herman Cain went to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally, and mocked the call to wear masks. But, he did, and he did. Shouldn‚Äôt people point out that reckless behavior may have ghastly consequences? A serious question.

What the hell are the "therapeutics" that trump keeps tossing out as doing very well?
I wouldn't bet a dime on this election.. absolutely impossible to predict. I will say that before February, it was Trump's election all the way. But with the economy going south, regardless of the fact he literally couldn't have saved it (no one could have), it doesn't look good

I agree with you. The 2 party system isn‚Äôt working anymore. Both are corrupt and ineffective. But, this is not the election to make that point. Right now, it is either or... you are wasting your vote if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. America can‚Äôt endure 4 more years of Trump!
That's how they might get the word out to the mail carriers (which didn't happen). And I would like a link or reference to where Trump says he won't "go peacefully" if he loses. Can't seem to find that anywhere.
Thank you trump! My city recently tore down our only low income housing project. It was filled with crime / drugs / trash

Another Trump success story.

1. I didn't hear him say that. 2. Oh he said it but he didn't mean it. 3. He meant it but he can't really do it. 4. He can do it by executive order because he is President.  Then... (5.) The election was rigged so Trump can stay until it's rescheduled. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry

we need federal mandate for masks.Right now corona virus is bigger enemy than violence in cities where Trump is sending federal agents without consent from local Mayor of Gov.
Trump should be held responsible for 35000 deaths which could have been prevented if he had not made fun of wearing Mask,not to mention loss of GDP and increase in Debt for our grand children to pay for.

Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.

I mean trump struggles with pronouncing certain words in his speeches, so they both old. What do u expect. We gotta choose better candidates be a both of them ain‚Äôt good.
Have you not heard Trump‚Äôs speeches yet?
Also, Trump was the one who sent the feds, who perpetrated the violence in Portland. The protesters were peaceful until the feds wanted them to leave because there were so many people. The people did not want to leave, so the feds use violent force and tear gas to get rid of them
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the Democratic Party. I KNOW it‚Äôs the Democratic Party. Is Trump perfect? No. But he‚Äôs doing a hell of a lot more than Obama ever did in office.
Trump is like being on a cruise ship and hitting that last buffet before you have to get off the ship.  Playing all that free tax payer golf.
New report claims Guilfoyle and Don Jr. stranded staffers in South Dakota after her positive diagnosis. The president's eldest son and his Trump campaign finance chairwoman girlfriend are pilloried for their selfish behavior.
Reagan Foundation tells Trump to stop using the 40th president's name to raise money. As harmful to the country as Reagan was, those who guard his legacy want to be sure to keep the current White House occupant at a distance.  #TrumpMustGo
He won‚Äôt respond to you. This is one of the Bros that kicked of twitter saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúa wife‚Äù but it‚Äôs just him sparing hugs same old hate speech. Trump isn‚Äôt a racist.Funny how Democrats cherry pick the constitution. Last I heard Democrats thought it was an outdated document that needed to be brought into the real world. Anyway...PRESIDENT Trump sure knows how to ruffle the Democrats feathers, and you fall for it every time! üòÇüòÇ#Trump2020 üá∫üá∏
It‚Äôs better than Trump‚Äôs lies
Trump is the problem.  And the GOP earned this awful burden.
if Trump says we‚Äôre getting stimulus checks bigger than 1200 then we‚Äôre getting checks bigger than 1200! Last time I checked Trump is in charge! Not the Democrats or the GOP! #Trump2020

Trump Voters Now Wearing Hydroxychloroquine Necklaces To Ward Off Dangerous Liberals
Herman Cain died for being a Trump follower.
Love this screen name. The liberals hate it when Trump talks to Putin. But they are working hard to make us more like the failed Soviet Union. Truly irrational.
You two have it WRONG. President  Trump  was asking  a question  so he could point out that mail in voting is not needed!!
If I have to vote for Trump in a hazmat suit come November I will do it.
You are a fraud... criticize trump while all ur Bros hate on the LGBTQ community
Why no warp speed approach to study hydroxychloroquine? Unless Trump is just selling us snake oil.
Paula, if possible, please ask Trump if Herman Cain signed the waiver before the Tulsa rally.  Curious.
Dear   and other WH Press, If possible, please ask Trump if Herman Cain signed the waiver before attending the Tulsa rally. Thanking you in advance.
Trump first announced his candidacy for President in the late summer of 2015. And you can bet he was planning it several months if not years ahead, starting with his "birtherist" claims against Obama.
Trump's fumbling is easily explained by his inability to trust intelligence agencies who are clearly opposed to him, and obfuscation by your friends in Beijing.
It‚Äôs so funnny to watch the left praise people they labeled terrible people just a few years ago just because they dont support Trump.   They praise Bush, but claim he hated black people  They praise Romney, but claim would put blacks back in chains.   Make up your minds.
Let‚Äôs be honest.  Trump wasn‚Äôt invited.

Upon losing the election, Trump's fade into irrelevance will be one of the most amazing transitions ever. Most of us will simply be done with him. He'll claim to be a martyr and that the system is rigged, but his tweets won't matter anymore.
Read This: "It‚Äôs Hard to Find a Trump Who Hasn‚Äôt Voted by Mail" Here trump is such a hypocrite. His whole family votes by mail, many in his administration voted by mail, but now voting by mail is fraudulent! trump is the real fraud! ‚úäüèªüá∫üá∏
Why leave out that he traveled a lot before and after the rally and could have gotten it from traveling? Must suck to think Trump Trump Trump 24/7.
There's no doubt Trump will claim illegitimacy in the election if he loses. But that election will be on 11/3. He can't change that date or dismiss the results.
No talk about Ameican bounties, even on the day we found out that the State Department -- Trump's State Department -- warned Putin off (after, of course, the NYT expos√©).
Trump haters checking their social media each morning for Trump‚Äôs latest offering:
If you lose TMZ...
Donald Trump should resign.... Pass it on!!!!
Most of us have learned to disregard the nonsense that Trump tweets from the WH bathroom. "Despotic declarations" makes you sound like the reactionary mooks you're referring to.

The Crazy D‚Äôs are grasping at straws, trying to blame President Trump for COVID-19. Sad, huh that they deny that China is not our friend. Truth is: COVID stands for China‚Äôs Own Viral Infectious Disease! Trump‚Äôs been saying that from the beginning. He was right!

President Donald Trump has done more for our country in 3.5 years than Busch and Obama combined.   Change my mind. I‚Äôll wait
Trump is Trash. #EveryonesLaughingAtYouDonald He has completely lost any sense of reality trying desperately to appear healthy, wealthy and wise. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure   Too bad his üí© Daddy isn't around to see the debauchery he created!

- Clueless and a liar.  Add in a Trump a$$ licker.  Great combination.
It's an act.....a shoo-in for his VP.   (But Trump will prevail.)

Probably.  It's an act so they can shoo in his VP ASAP.   (But Trump will prevail!)
It‚Äôs really simple - they are dumb.  How else do you explain voting for Trump.
Everyone should tweet at donald some variation of this story just to get under his skin. Thanks Mary Trump. üòÜ
Trump had the economy booming &amp; more people working than ever, then you democratic clowns destroyed that with your tyrannical #Scamdemic. Now that you've ruined the places you were elected, you're trying to beg and borrow millions to trillions to unfuk it. Then tax everyone later
So Trump is in Texas... when he returns to DC will he have to self quarantine for 14 days too?!

Don‚Äôt you ever talk about law and order again you Trump fascist ball lickers
What Politico, MSM and democrats are seeing in the lop sided polls is faulty numbers where the 'Cancel Culture' has kept the 'Right' quiet, scared, but come Election time, the Trump voters will come out...
You should look up the definition of dictator. President Trump is not a dictator.üôÑ If Biden wins... you will learn very quickly what oppression is. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
It‚Äôs the truth, sorry you can‚Äôt handle it.  Moving a division of troops several hundred miles closer to Russia is not making Russia feel any better.  But go ahead and pretend it does, since you hate Trump so very very much.

YES, we are all wondering when it's gonna happen, and if it will happen in time. If #Biden wins, we are all majorly screwed. Trump and some fresh faces like YOU are the only hope #Patriots have to save our country, the current #GOP are not doing anything, except a small handful.
It‚Äôs easy and quite the American thing to do!  Vote Trump 2020!

Where are the Trump supporters at? Didn‚Äôt Trump promise to bring coal production back, bigger and better than ever. What about the wall that Mexico was going to pay for? Oh, it fucking blew over during a tropical storm. What about this great Republican health care plan?? Crickets
do people still think that this COVID virus isn‚Äôt political? think about it. the people who are against Trump are also the ones against HCQ. that‚Äôs no coincidence. so we have needless amounts of deaths because of hate for one man.
Pretty much everything has sucked since 2017.  You just now realizing it. That truly is TRUMP DERANGED SYNDROME
forget about Trump, what are your thoughts about rest of the world, countries like India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, took preventive action, went under complete lockdown, still people are dying.friend‚Äôs dad died right infront of his eyes in India. China used a bio weapon
Saying you‚Äôre a Trump supporter who is voting for Biden is like saying you don‚Äôt know what the hell is going on at all.
I can‚Äôt believe Trump really made all my conservative friends on Facebook believe Hydroxychloroquine is the vaccine the government doesn‚Äôt want us to know about I‚Äôm laughing please get this man out of officeüòÇ
I do. I used to put up an American flag on the front of my house starting Memorial Day, taking it down after Labor Day ... because of Trump and his corruption of our flag, this is the front of my house now

I don't see the importance of Kasich. He is no different than Romney, Bush or the late Sen Mccain. None of them liked the President. The fact, that he going to speak at the DNC won't influence my voting for President Trump.
But, Trump and his Deplorables are "divisive."
The going after Bill Barr now.becsauce the got nothing  on Trump.
Trump put immigrant children in cages, dude. Get with the times, republicans suck
Oh yeah I completely agree. Money has no place in politics and rich people suck. Do you also hate the trump family who do business in China? Or all the rich people in Trump's cabinet? Sounds like you're in favor of a marginal tax rate that would tax the rich...
Great news for the PRC and the Socialists Dems. Bad day for freedom  and personal liberty if Biden wins. Oh I forgot you don‚Äôt care do you, just want to win at all cost.Thats all you care about ; put down Trump.

Support her opponent, her opposition to Biden means she is a Trump supporter.
Read Mary Trump's book about Fred and  . It will help you understand the lies. It's because he can. Nobody makes a big enough deal out of it. He just does it and gets away with it it. Hopefully a jury sometime next year will not be so tolerant of his lying for fun

I've said this before:  Notice how Trump's attitude about the virus suddenly changed after they took the data away from the CDC.  What do you think they saw?
So the White House is encouraging Trump to resign?
Tell trump to have them stop. This smells of being orchestrated by him to scare the white folk.

#JoeBiden is corrupt as hell, everyone knows it. But the #dems hate Trump so they will even vote for the most corrupt, #deepstate puppet with Alzheimers before they choose Trump.

I really believe the hate of Trump is a mental illness.
Wrong.  CNN reported on several occasions that there was no wiretap on Trump‚Äôs campaign.  That was patently false.  Not only was there a wiretap, but it was illegally unmasked and the transcripts walked into the WH.
I‚Äôm sure that our intelligence agencies have more than enough information and proof to remove Trump from office. Treason, pedaphile, money laundering, Russian asset, mob connections, tax evasion, bounties on our soldiers. And they do nothing...
Looking good don‚Äôt you think  - only a Trump ass kisser would try and play this as making progress.

Ken is currently under indictment on 3 criminal charges.  Very on brand for the Trump criminal enterprise.

Fake, I live in the same area, Trump 2020 signs everywhere. I drive to med center everyday and I have not seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker!
biden would only be responsible if he didn‚Äôt have NG ready in case state governors called for help. imo, trump has taken too long on some things so maybe he is at fault. i just know y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt like me as president. i‚Äôd put all these assholes in prison.
but isn‚Äôt it true? what are they rioting for? who is allowing this to happen? idk if you have hate for trump, but if you do, your hate is blinding you. i dont see how DJT stopping this is bad.
whats bad about trump sending ‚Äòsecret‚Äô police? what don‚Äôt ppl understand about that? the cities are being destroyed, so they need to be stopped. it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make him a bad guy or a ‚Äòdictator‚Äô.

Chicago and other #democrat mayors are total hypocrites. Their citizens are getting slaughtered by the hundreds, all in the name of TYRANNY, and yet blame Donald #Trump for  cleaning up violence in their cities, which is supposed to be THEIR job to protect and serve citizens!
Yeah, could really tell by all of the Biden bumper stickers. Sounds like 2016,again. Will you let Biden participate in a live debate with President Trump?
But it's Trump's America
Just a reminder,   China levied sanctions on Ted Cruz and Rubio. Now the Chinese consolate that handles world for Texas and Florida has been closed by Trump.
Did I get this straight?  Trump left the COVID-19 battle to local officials,  but insists that he must help them fight ordinary street crime. (Although, sending a hundred undisciplined agents is not really any help.) #TrumpsGestapo
The real issue is that Trump thinks that he passed some kind of IQ test. He just doesn't get it.
if all Q being banned on twitter, the covid ‚Äòreporting errors‚Äô, the unconstitutional shut downs, the democrat mayors trashing trump as their cities burn and their ppl die don‚Äôt convince you of the agenda at play.. then you are a very gullible human.
I'm all for you, Joe! But maybe you can apologize for that "first racist president" comment...Trump is just the latest in a long line of racist presidents - he's most likely the 44th racist president, honestly. Why don't you just vow to not be racist, and leave it there?
So... showing a picture of violence in Trump's America is supposed to scare people about Biden being president? Did I get that right? The saddest thing is that his people won't get the disconnect
Once the election is over if Trump wins he will order military force and clean it all up...Let‚Äôs face it, the governors and local city officials have shown they won‚Äôt do Sh*t...it‚Äôs beyond ridiculous...It‚Äôs played outSo make sure you never call the cops when you get in a accident or get robbed or if anything that one would need the police for. You call Trump an idiot but  I bet you sure like those tax cuts. And of you have stocks you like those stocks.
A deal to stop nuclear proliferation. Compare to Trump's deal with Saudi where he gave them nuclear tech, weapons, intelligence on Khashoggi. They financed 911 btw.
Ok, here is Trump saying he ignored the experts. Full interview hasn't dropped yet.
LOL considering I don't have cable or antenna to my TVs? I love when you folks make this claim. Now you'll say it's the info I get from my phone. Which is funny as well since I read from a variety of opposing sources I don't trust gov, but you trust Trump, who is the government.
You realize Trump has largely ignored most of the advice from his experts, right?
Ok, he takes it in the squatter from his wife/husband, he was raised by a porn model, he gave 15-billion of Taxpayer money to a known enemy, he spied on Trump, during an election!! Does anyone expect him to display some type of moral fortitude?
To be fair, due to trump and the trumpvirus, the job market looks pretty bad.
Yes, we really need to call out the bias of someone willing to denounce...*checks notes*...Trump's federal warfare?

Paul Weyrich already did that. So did the kochs. Trump merely expanded on Reagan. Soon, forty years of Reaganomics and talibangelical theology will be be repudiated.
And why shouldn't he support the police and Trump? Stop just hating and educate yourself on the facts of what great things Trump has done for this country. I'm not a fan of a lot of cops but I know not all are bad. With out cops as u can see in Portland evil will accure.
I think we both know why ppl leave certain areas no matter the race. What were you implying about Trump admin stopping the the movement of ‚Äúcertain‚Äù ppl? My comments were about first hand knowledge of a white housing project.

Is that why you call TRUMP RACIST? Because I personally know a lot of Black people who don‚Äôt want low income Blacks moving into their neighborhoods. BLACKS call LOW-CLASS BLACKS,HOOD-RATS or ghetto. So,are they called RACISTS, BIGOTS , BOUGIE or your every run-of-the-mill SNOBS.

Dictatorship versus democracy; communism versus free enterprise.  You‚Äôre NOT King Trump.
When Trump is gone in 4 more years, you'd do well to remember the cowardice and corruption of the Democrats that tried to stop him
Look man you are going to vote the way you vote and I will vote the way I vote. We won't convince each other to do otherwise. Though I don't listen to what Trump says, but I do see what he does.
Last thing I heard about that was that Trump never knew about that. Never made it to his desk. So it was not verified enough to make it to Trump. Might be Russian disinformation that the media loves to spread.
I bet all Democrat leaders have been on Hydroxychloriquine for many months!! Keeping it from the people shows they knowingly have murdered people to keep Trump frm having rallies, and to promote mail in balloting, bc cheating is their only hope of winning.  And they know it.
Donald Trump "requested" a mail-in ballot. Any citizen can request a mail-in ballot. When one request a mail-in ballot, they are validating that they are a) Alive, b.) Residing at a specific address, c.) Certifying that they are eligible to vote.
How does Trump do this ?  Uou make accusations but no proof by making accusations doesnt make it true
Trump Administration Refuses To Accept New DACA Applicants Despite Court Rulings
I agree, and have thought this for quite some time.  It's a shame. Trump tried by telling us at the beginning,  but ALL the so called expert went in a different direction. All for money and power.  Democrat leaders and China coordinated together on it!! I bet ya!!
Thank you sir!  Thank you for doing the work of the American people.  You and President Trump are my favorite great Americans.

Americans trust Trump. Americans find your name-calling hateful! Our honorable AG Barr is not a blob. Please grow up!!
...and Trump/Putin have it figured out.

Also please explain how trump is a danger to this country. Is it because he will not lay down and take it like all the rest of the president have? Are you going to blame him for Covid19? If so stop there. It has been proven that Obama funded it.

Trump stated in a presser he took hcq as a preventative.  So yeah. Thanks for bringing this up.
I live in Texas- just north of Houston.  Drove to New Orleans last week with an overnight in Baton Rouge. Drove through both BR and New Orleans. Hundreds of Trump signs. 1 Biden. About 800 miles driven.
Right trump broke the American economy like he's done with all of his businesses.
Kinda like trump supporters at a 2016 trump rally.  You know punching and shoving non trump supporters.
Did Putin send some help? I always thought we'd see Russian troops here before Trump was done.
I'm sure Trump would love it if we used a THUNDERDOME to compete for those jobs. He's sit on a throne and preside over it, and in his mind this would seem perfectly right and good.
Shame on him. He knows full well how terrible Trump has been.

Trump's hatred for those critical of him &amp; his ineptness has led to the death of 145,000+ Americans. Trump is sending federal agents into states that have not requested them. He's violating his oath to the Constitution. But you don't care about that so long as you own the libs.
While tragic, the 1yr old didn't get shot at a BBQ. He was at a playground. No suspects have been apprehended, so motive is unclear. If you think this is anarchy, I've got a house in a swamp I'd like to sell you. how did Democrats hatred of trump supersede keeping Americans safe?

Become subject to the court, with skin in the game, then you can talk international law. I look forward to trump, Wolf, and others from this regime standing before the Hague.
I respectfully disagree. Limit to daytime protests? Sure. Have trump claim "it worked in Portland and we are now headed to a town near you"? Not a good tactic.
Problem is, the violence of these peaceful protests' are these biggest source of injustice at the moment. Trump isn't hiding anything. He's saying this lawlessness is going to end, one way or the other. Can't get more transparent than that.
So you‚Äôll finally support your President Trump!  Welcome to the Republican Party!
The acts of a very small minority among the protesters does not remove the right of protest. I love the basis of this country, but under trump, the Constitution is being ignored. I will not leave the country I fought for, and due to inept leadership most countries ban US citizens
They were trying to make Trump look bad.
Oh sweetheart, this is a blind, ignorant foolish attempt at deflection. Who has divided our country? Trump. Who has put or retracted policies to make our country unsafe? Trump Who has violated the Constitution with sending Federal Agents into states without being asked? Trump

Actually you are.. u can blame protesters if u want as some didn't wear masks.. but the majority of this spread has come from beach goers.. partiers, people getting together for family events.. and the majority who are not wearing masks are MAGAs.. Trump's Rally's have caused...
Trump supporters ARE the working Americans and Middle Class
Biden really riding the whole "hey at least i'm not trump" campaign - which worked great for Hilary lmao
Trump 2020!
You do know this raid took place under trump right? ü§£
Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but look at his enemies: THAT should tell you what you voting for or against. Trump hasn‚Äôt been perfect. But in light of the rules he has to play by and the sheer enmity and resistance he‚Äôs faced, it‚Äôs a wonderful he‚Äôs done as much as he has!!
I‚Äôm 73 and holding on till Trump is gone
Bill Barr just tried to get his own person installed at SDNY after firing Berman whose office is prosecuting Maxwell.  Epstein died in Barr‚Äôs BOP.   Bill Barr‚Äôs dad had an extensive history with Epstein.   Trump also just wished Maxwell good luck.
And what's up with Trump's skin? Is the snake molting? Maybe this is what crazy Dr. Stella Immanuel meant when she said our govt is run by Reptilian Half-Human/Half ETs.
Will you move out of the country once Trump wins ?
What's going on with the skin on Trump's face? It looks like he is trying to molt or something. Snakes do that, right? Maybe that's what the crazy Dr. Immanuel was talking about when she said our govt is run by Reptilian Half-Humans.
&amp; the right is oblivious to the fact that trump drug his feet on Covid and thousands of people died on his watch. Hr should be held accountable suffer the consequences. Better yet, if he contracts covid, I'd like to see him take hydroxychloroquine on live tv since he swears by it
This is why voting matters.    most recent opponent was Trump sycophant  San Antonio will survive this crisis and the number of people we‚Äôve lost will be smaller due to Ron‚Äôs leadership.
If Clinton slept with underaged girls he should go to prison for the rest of his life. If Donald Trump slept with underaged girls he should go to prison for the rest of his life. See, that‚Äôs not difficult at all.
Instead here is trump fucking our great America into shamble. #thanksfornothing
Huh. All the Trump voters I know use iPhones

All these April attacks on Biden were actually panicked shrieks to keep Trump from getting any ideas.

I don't know what news you listen to. But you need to wake up and listen to the other point of view because you're getting lied to. I don't know who's lying to you. But somebody's lying to you. Donald Trump has done an awesome job in his first 3.5 years
Yep. They were bringing girls to the house from the nearby HIGH SCHOOL!!! He got rich by playing the system, lying about is resume, etc. Sickening. The pics of him w Trump are creepy.
You can still be anti-trump if you critique Joe Biden. Is this a boomer account?
There is nothing inspirational about Trump, lacks the ability to motivate, inspire hope, provide encouragement to the American people during these difficult times. All he knows is complain, stir up trouble and create division among people. He's an example of a bad leadership

For a bunch of assholes that hate Trump, they sure has hell cannot leave with out him, and to use the death of Lewis as the venue, is just insulting to Lewis and his family.
The only thing crooked in the upcoming election is that Donald Trump will be in it.  With all the shit he's pulled, he should have been out of office by now
Your just a pawn... Your being controlled... Yet they are doing exactly what Trump and perhaps Russia wants.. spreading fake propaganda and information around.

Please note when you read this article that the Trump Administration was not intentionally letting Democrats die for political gain.  They were letting ANYONE in a blue state die for political gain, Democrat, Republican, whoever.
And sadly he became a Trump cult member.
Ha, talk like a DEPLORABLE tRump cult member too!
Whenever someone tells me they support Trump administration policies, I ask them to name which ones specifically. So far, no one has been able to articulate even one. I hear Ummm well...   Maybe it's hard to hear oneself defend the indefensible out loud.
A lot of this could've possibly been avoided if:  1: Trump took this virus serious from day one instead of politicizing it  2: MAGAs would all agree to wear a Mask and Social distance.  I know some might but the majority do not.   3. Listen to Fauci instead of bashing him.

Trump 2020!
Also Trump put several people at risk so maybe go after him.
This needs to brought up by Congress because questions need to answered for this. It appears that Trump is going for Impeachment part 2.
Trump 2020!
Wait, tRump said the heat from summer would make it go away, and LIED.  Is this another LIE?  Because nothing tRump has done is helping solve this problem!  Unless you count his plan to Lower COVID numbers by Stopping testing!
you‚Äôre only doing this for the Hispanic vote. We don‚Äôt fuck with you. You want to separate our families, call us savages. Get rid of daca and deport kids by themselves fuck you #TrumpIsARacist
Just bc you like a picture of Trump on insta, it doesn‚Äôt make you a Trump supporter.
Herman was " his own man."  He made the choice not to wear a mask.  How dare you accuse Trump of killing Mr. Cain.  He made his own decisions and accepted the consequences.  A free thinker unlike you----Fredo.
What ignorance!  Has been around that long but NOT for COVID-19!  Don't be stupid, vote tRump out!
Donald Trump in 2020.
We need money for regular people. Not corporations. You Republicans and Trump stole the previous package.

Im pretty sure Cain was tested prior to entering the rally if he was there with Trump. Just like every other VIP that was around Trump.
John Lewis was political. He spent his entire life fighting for equality for everyone. What did tRump put in on this? NOTHING know why? He wasn‚Äôt invited üòÇ Oh wait. He spent his day trying to move the election date üòÇüòÇ Nice try though.
150,000 American dead are indisputably China's fault, not President Trump's fault.  He listened to the experts, and against their advice, decided to ban travel.  He listened to the experts and killed his roaring economy to save lives.  He listened to the experts but took HCQ.
Did it take three days for you to compose a tweet justifying Trump‚Äôs quack ‚Äúcure?‚Äù  Misinformation is a public health threat, ‚ÄúElena.‚Äù
your comments about Chip are a little off base.  is the political opportunist Chip is just Trump lite.
He knows he can‚Äôt move the elections. This is another one of Trump manipulation of the media. Look at the coverage he got today and how he played it toward voter fraud. That is his message.
Think about what tRump said . .   May not be safe to vote so we need to delay the election!  But it's still ok to force kids to go to school?
It should have been Trump.
You are such a dedicated hard-working reporter. I can‚Äôt imagine having to report on President Trump every day and night. It must be a mind numbing.
President Trump has no blood on his hands, Mr. Cain was a successful businessman and, as an adult, made his own decisions.  He was a political leader we will miss.  #RIPHermanCain

looking forward to 2030 when idiots reminisce about Trump during the reign of God-Emperor Carlson
President Trump is listening to the science, following the advice of experts, taking HCQ for prevention.  Mr. Cain, already battling stage 4 cancer, made his own decisions traveling to the rally (which may or may not have been where he acquired Wuhan Flu}, wearing a mask or not.

#ObamaWasTheRacistInChief  President Trump is not racist.  President Trump praises black men and women all the time.  You don't listen.
Mr. Cain was a fully developed adult, accustomed to making his own decisions.  He was a successful businessman with stage 4 cancer.  It is entirely a hateful myth that President Trump or Trump supporters are anti-science, provably not the case.
President Trump has listened to the pediatricians advice for his call to open schools, are you questioning kids doctors for the best advice?  Keeping kids from school is very harmful to kids, in their social and mental acuity.  President Trump does not endanger life, Dems do.
A bunch of moms, vets, and other BLM sympathizers faced down the most powerful nation on earth. Portland was the Trump admin‚Äôs  Hanoi. Declare victory and use that momentum to persuade the moderate middle of your cause.
Weird how history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. John Lewis' America vs trump's Amerikkka.
Don't you love when democrats show their hatred of President Trump? They are literally living rent free in their heads!
The Wuhan Flu and death is entirely on China.  President Trump banned travel early, convened a task force, and updated America daily on Covid.  5 Democratic governors sentenced 30,000 elders to death in nursing facilities against CDC guidelines.
Why Facebook and Twitter won‚Äôt fact-check Trump‚Äôs latest false claims about voting
He certainly massacred more people. Must be why you love him. War criminals are adorable aren‚Äôt they? I‚Äôm so sorry Trump refused to bomb the shit out of Syria. I know that must have hurt you.

It‚Äôs sad these people listen to the news and don‚Äôt actually look anything up. Trump is amazing!
President Trump had nothing to do with Mr. Cain's death.  He was also battling stage 4 cancer.  He was an adult who made a decision.  Honor the dead.
I don‚Äôt know what planet you are on. The local governments are allowing the rioting. They are not allowing protections. Trump is way better at your list then the Dems! He actually has results
Ok trump
The dominoes are now falling for Trump. How fast will his current supporters defect to save their own butts?  Who will be the first to go after The Federalist Society prez called for his impeachment and removal?  McConnell? McCarthy? Barr? (fill in the blank)
You already made it political bringing up Cain going to Trump rally!
He cancelled the plan because politically it was hitting Blue states where they reasoned citizens would blame their governors. They would let us die. And now want the kids to go to school. Fuck Trump. Fuck Jared. Fuck
Tbh idk who imma vote for . Biden seems like he‚Äôs no better than Trump , hell I might as well write my own name on the damn ballot üòêüíÄ
It is safe to say that you know squat about what decisions Herman Cain would have made if President Trump was not POTUS.  Mr. Cain was also battling stage 4 cancer.

Funny how I never mentioned Trump or COVID, yet the MAGAts went right there. They know the truth about their master.
The UN can kiss my American ass. We fund them. We have protected the nations supporting them for decades while they spit on us and called us evil until Trump came along and told them to pound sand or support us.

Trump plays the 'fear' card to inspire his base. He's always done this. The strategy here is to get out the vote to overcome the dem resistance.   In doing so, Trump builds in an excuse in case the vote is close allowing him to contest.

I believe...trump will coordinate with key Republican controlled states to contest the election results. There will be no clear majority vote when the Electoral College meets, so the vote goes to the House. One state, one vote, trump wins with 53. So I disagree.
Trump: ‚ÄúCain? Love Cain. I snort it all of the time.‚Äù Mr. President we‚Äôre talking about Herman Cain.  Trump:‚Äù I never snorted a line with him, who told you that?‚Äù
Just stop covering Trump PERIOD! All journalists need to boycott the lying orange one.
As the left couldn‚Äôt accept the results of the election... you‚Äôve been had by mainstream media. All own by  DC. Right and Left crooked. Michael Moore called it, we through a bullet at corruption in Washington. Trump.
Blame your mayor and governor.  They did not quell the mobs.  Trump is not racist.  Doctors with actual patients, unlike Fauci, say Hydroxychloroquine benefits patients, as does Henry Ford study, Yale epidemiologist and other countries (India, for one). Reaearch!

Do you remember that time tRump showed some warmth and humility?  No?  Whew! I was afraid I was having problems with my memory!
Trump is dilusional
Sickening what these long time democratic politicians are doing destroying our country!! They could not beat a real citizen in 2016 and now a lying like babies since day1!! I feel like telling trump to go back to his regular life and make more millions!!
I can‚Äôt listen to Trump today. I tried, but his snorting and lying got on my last nerve. I heard 3 former presidents who spoke eloquently today from their hearts. F*ck Trump and his entire administration.
With the Trump kids it‚Äôs obvious that someone peed in their gene pool.

Maybe presidential daily briefings are not placed on trump's desk? Thus, trump saying "it never reached my desk". Or maybe he's a lair. He passes the duck test for being a russian agent.
The Trump wall is crumbling.  But do not let up!  #Vote because if you don't he can still win.  #Vote
Trump just said our Texas numbers are getting lower while I just read we had a record high. He‚Äôs such a moron and embarrassment!
Trump has Treasury propping it up buying junk bonds. It won‚Äôt last.
What President hasn‚Äôt lied? Obama/Biden weren‚Äôt America‚Äôs saviors! They and their families have profited off the position. Tell me   Why do you hate trump so much? He may have not been the best business man and has had numerous shady deals.
For the two and a half years I‚Äôve been on Twitter I have always said I was incapable of hate and not even Trump could push those buttons to make me hate him. I apologize. I‚Äôm done with the MF. Totally hate his ü§¨orange guts.

Well he got this hoax disease after going to a trump rally. Hmmmm it is political dumbass
We would not need to give up our blood if Trump had enough sense to stop golfing and take this pandemic seriously.  What you should have done was mandate masks from the time we knew they were effective in other countries.  You failed.  Now, 150,000+ Americans are DEAD!  #Vote
I tried listening to Trump but I am afraid to roll my eyes so far back they will stay there
Trump is now trying to delay voting so there is no mail in voting cause it‚Äôs unsafe &amp; will cause fraud but wants to open schools open economy not give new stimulus package not only does he take the dictators road of suppression but will go the way of a monarchy looking out for us

Day 27 since we've learned of the passing of Spc. Vincent Sebastian Ibarria in Afghanistan.  Trump offered his condolences to the family of singer Charlie Daniels, but, refuses to offer his public condolences to the Ibarria family.   Why?
Day 35 since we learned about Russia offering bounties to the Taliban for killing American troops.   Trump was briefed on the bank transfers, large sum of cash discovered, the Taliban admission, and told of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan.   So, why hasn't Trump taken action?
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs  A very interesting read. #CheckItOut #ThursdayThoughts

Sir, to politicize the eulogy of a great American and warp the message by attacking a sitting president exposes your fear of Republicans. You undermined the 2016 Trump candidacy with deceit. How should anyone believe anything you say? You are a feckless disgrace.
If you actually look at the things President Trump did he did a lot for the USA before this virus and he didn‚Äôt take anny shit from China and Iran and I‚Äôm sure he probably even told Putin to behave that we don‚Äôt know about so let the guy do his job

I don't really understand how Trump's ... proposition isn't electrifying and terrifying every single person in America right now. The writing is on the wall. It's not a joke, it's not a one time thing. Consider what is at stake if we over react vs. under react.

If the president was a democrat then I would of said the same thing the president is the boss and democrats should have the say so so right now Republicans and President D.Trump have the say so
Didn‚Äôt trump know about bounties Russia had on us troops ü§î
If Trump loses this election, there is going to be the biggest told you so moment in the history of the world.  There will be no 2nd chance,  we must all get out and vote Trump into office for another 4 years.  We were warned  in the mid terms and blew that! Wake up people !
Trump, McConnell and Graham.  I‚Äôd need 4, must add Pence
Lol trump is so fucked
Yeah that‚Äôs crazy first the democrats pass a bill then when republicans try to put it thru democrats try to slow it down why people need all the help they can get with this stupid COVID annyways Trump is the boss it‚Äôs up to him and republicans how  help the people
Biden said , some blacks are just as smart as rich White kids. Hum. Biden said Obama is the first Black, that can talk like a white man around White people, then talk like a Blackman , around Black people. Hum. Biden said, your not Black, if you vote for Trump. Hum.  Very bad
So let me get this straight. Hermain Cain died from covid after mocking masks and attending public rallies without one, Trump called for delaying the election, AND some of the worst economic numbers in modern history dropped all in the same day. Fuck yeah America
Trump's gonna drop marijuana legalization before the election.
No, the vote then goes to the a House. One state, one vote...trump wins with 53 votes. This is the exact scenario that will play out.

It took that tweet to realize that Trump is a fascist? Better late than never I guess
Her name and gruesome murder created a national movement that has now taken her family to the White House. Today the relatives of Vanessa Guillen met with President Trump shortly after introducing the #IamVanessaGuillen bill.  #kens5eyewitness
supports Russia paying the Taliban a bounty for killing US soldiers. Trump was informed of this in February. Trump and Putin spoke at least 7 times since April. Sen. Tillis won‚Äôt condemn Russia or Trump for his treasonous agreement to allow this to continue.
Call it the "Trump Dump". He owns this shit.
WELL NOW TRUMP AND BARR ARE GOING TO CLAIM A NATIONAL EMERGENCY SO THEY CAN CHANGE THE VOTING DATES. I WOULD THINK BARR IS IN TOO MUCH TROUBLE AS IT IS TO DO THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK NANCY.
There's a common theme with Obama where he'll continue disgusting programs started by Bush and then criticize Trump for using these programs  (Border camps, drone strikes, deployment of federal troops to kidnap protesters)
a lot of things Donald trump is good in that‚Äôs why I like him atleast Donald Trump don‚Äôt take no shit especially from the chinese he‚Äôs also willing to help Americans a lot that‚Äôs great to but It seems Democrats are trying to screw things up now after they said they would help
In THIS election? It IS a matter of life and death, saving our democracy, and keeping our Constitution intact! So far, 150k Americans have died due to Trump‚Äôs complete failure managing the COVID response. So? I‚Äôd say my Christian priorities are just fine!

I‚Äôll call a trump supporter a fascist to their face and won‚Äôt think twice about it.
He plans to gut every bill that helps the working class, financially and medically. while supporting market transitions for his rich supporters. This is why you can‚Äôt have a businessman run a country. A vote for trump is a vote for fascism.

Trump 2020!
"Swept under the rug" like Trump does with anything scandalous.
I‚Äôm sorry to all my Democratic followers but sucks to suck, trump 2020
It's why Trump mandated attendees sign liability waivers.  Trump knew his rally could/would lead to death.   Those who said they'd die for Trump: Wish granted.
Trump is saying by voting by mail is fraudulent and people shouldn't have the opportunity to do so. which in our current state of pandemic that it would be safer to be allow to vote by mail. I do understand that some states do let their resident to vote by mail. CA I did.
Trump trying to undermine our elections all day every day.
This is insane. If Trump loved America, he would want to lose.
didn't want to do anything for #JohnLewis but I'm sure when he heard the news of  and his tragic passing Trump was relieved he could say he felt remorseful of a black dying that he could show remorse towards to look good. May they both rest in peace
President Donald J. Trump and Brad Parscale are above reproach. They are honorable men with totally natural skin tones.
The enthusiasm is for getting rid of President Trump in November. There, fixed it for you
The president's statement drew a rare chorus of condemnation from both sides of the aisle. But not from Cornyn.
He died because he listened to Trump
I think all you idiots that don‚Äôt like trump are voting more than once
Thank you Donald J. Trump Tulsa Rally..  #FoxNewsLiedPeopleDie  #TrumpKilledCain
Trump did not divide the country the liberals that do not like him because he is a smart man divided this country
My condolences to the Cain family -- and -- you should have reconsidered attending the Tulsa tRump rally.  He didn't care about your well-being, so, you should have cared for yourself. :( #GenuinelySorry
TRUMP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
I‚Äôve been watching a lot of Seinfeld lately and sometimes Trump reminds me of George Costanza...
Also Trump voted by mail in a state he doesn't live in. If its good enough for him to vote by mail. Why isn't it good for us?
Trump only knows destruction, consumption and self-obsession and it's not even clear if EVEN HE is enjoying himself.
Ain‚Äôt nothing truthful about Trump. If it was we‚Äôd have sanctions on Putin and the Pandemic would be under control.
Good job Republicans. üôåüôåüôå 25 millions of Americans out of work. üìà 5 million jobs available. The pres is getting ready to go golfing again. 1/3 of Americans ain't sure how they'll pay rent in Aug No plan to help Americans 155,000 dead Americans from Trump's virus. GDP üìâ33%
His puppeteer is pulling his strings tightly. Leading him by the nose to think he will be dictator in charge if he, Trump plays by Putin‚Äôs law!
Then I'd like to know how you characterize Trump's so-called COVID pressers, sir
Vicious and true: "Mr. Trump didn‚Äôt hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of¬†what the party became¬†over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."
They even believe that Trump fixed Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù economy.

Mr. Caine RIP. But watching my fellow citizens the last 5 months and the disconnect from reality and willing to believe lies. To see the worst in other people. I now see how the Nazi party took over Germany. That‚Äôs harsh but what does Trump say that isn‚Äôt believed?
This is why most real Americans despise tRump!  His supporters are to blind to see the truth and to IGNORANT to know tRump never speaks the truth
At the beginning of July, after Layfaette Square, the military signaled their fealty to the country over Trump. Today, after a Trump floated  the idea of postponing the Nov 3election date, Republican politians signaled the same fealty. Hey, we all want this chaos to end.
So do you march with your FASCIST friends that support tRump?
That Smell from Trump  via
Lol watch Trump win and then the libs actually have ground to stand on instead of unstable Russian collusion foundation.
So glad Trump floated that tweet about postponing the Nov 3 election. McConnell is having none of it, as are many Republicans. They must be so tired of DJT and will be happy to see him leave Washington.
Kanye literally put on a Trump hat to get a meeting with the president to push artists getting more royalties on streaming services. Plus Taylor's buddy with Kanye now, she's a liar.
Reminder that Trump just yesterday attended a fundraiser and gave a speech with crowds who didn't either social distance or wear masks.  Here's Pence today with a crowd who is neither social distancing or wearing masks.
Now lets talk trump
Fight for me Nancy please dont let Trump bonce my next stemulis chack too  IRS
What is this? Are you trying to delay the election because it is UNSAFE to vote but DEMAND kids go back to school because it is SAFE.  What is TRUE and what is the LIE?  So used to lies from tRump we dont know what to expect!  Lock tRump UP

Trump already has the money to keep them going separate than the money the banks have. So thats two ways they can survive. But this is still a man made crash, not economic. Just need to get the democrats out of the way and watch the nation flourish.
Maybe Congress can move it up! How‚Äôs that Trump?
Dont let Trump bonce my second Stemulis chack to IRS for back childsuport fight for us nancy please fight for Me
The most moving, American thing that has happened in the past 4 years, just happened today at the funeral of Congressman John Lewis.  Trump wasn‚Äôt included as he isn‚Äôt worthy to be in the presence of such a dignified, intelligent, well spoken, articulate, compassionate group.
Trump bonce my Stemulis chack.into IRS hands for back.Childsuport What kind help that . Why you punishing us
he put the info out on the media and they are talking about it...  honest media out there are reporting the CBS and New York Mail In ballot tests which pretty much proved Trump's point... it won't work. Fraud will be rampant and easy.
When liberals come out and say "Trump makes me miss George Bush," you can immediately disregard anything they say because they're just admitting they don't believe people in the middle east are human. They are no different than the MAGA people cheering on the concentration camps.
Don‚Äôt you know...sports media are rooting against having jobs because they hate trump!!!!11111
Rep. John Lewis's funeral ended an hour ago. Focusing on his life, and especially Pres. Obama's inspiring, stirring eulogy for him is making us feel some optimism, even a bit of comfort from it. Meanwhile Trump tweets ? of election delay. Prominent Repub died of Covid-19.

Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
The Trump movement cares more about making sure America is white, heterosexual right wing Christian male more than it cares about making sure America is successful.   That's why they're prepared to destroy the very idea of what America is.
Never said OD‚Äôing. I said side effects and if anyone actually believes Trump took HCQ needs to go back and watch the last task force brief.  He said ‚ÄúI would take it‚Äù and quickly said I did take it.

White supremacy makes life worse for everyone except the elite.   But we as a country have decided that's okay so long as non-white people had it worse.   Obama's election created anger that deal appeared to be broken. That's what created the Trump movement.
Rubin: Minutes after horrible economic numbers ‚Äî a 32.9% annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims ‚Äî were released, President Trump tweeted a statement saying we should delay the election. Here's why he did that.
Vance previous decision on the Trump‚Äôs is of concern. Is he ethical is questionable?
Re-Elect Trump in November.
What‚Äôs your point Obama/Biden depleted medical supply stocks. Trump imposed a travel ban while Democrats were against it.
Brave John Lewis had more dignity and nobility of character than Trump will ever experience in his entire life.
And the President wants to push the election. We are under a dictatorship in waiting. If you vote for Donald Trump in November you will be on the wrong side of history. We are headed towards full Balkanization of our nation. Do the right thing.

You poor baby. Did you get ripped off at Trump U or was it when you got stiffed working at one of his bankrupt casinos?
So this may be a shock to some people but I voted for trump. Now does that mean I agree with everything that this man has said or done heck no and if you think that my Allegiance is to a man or a political party and you no longer want to be my friend after this then god bless
My president is going off! Fk trump!
We all wish that were the case. But most of the party decided to die on the Trump hill.
Watch how fast the entire  flip on Trump once his ass is out of office. We know they‚Äôre two faced but the internet will prevail again.    and all the others slurping trumps semen off old socks.
She‚Äôs as full of it as any Trump.  And, btw, I thought she was sick.
We need heed the warning folks Tucker: President Trump's hope for re-election  via
The stress of campaigning is too much for the two men, both die several months prior to the election. Trump‚Äôs base still elects him on the hope that he will rise from the grave like he promised. He doesn‚Äôt. Nobody sits in office. We don‚Äôt talk about it.
Trump‚Äôs continued mental decline has  left him only able to speak in two-word phrases consisting of an adjective and a common noun. Biden is never seen without a deck of flash cards to remind him what his opinions are.
A glimpse into 2024: A vaccine for COVID-19 has finally been created, but 50% of GenZ and 80% of Millenials still refuse to leave their houses. A spry 78 y/o Donald Trump comes out of the shadows to challenge 81 y/o Joe Biden for another turn in office.
Democrats have a better deal that actually helps us. Yours is absolute shit and gives money back to the military that you took for Trump's stupid wall that Hurricane Hannah took out.  Fail.

Trump asked a wuestion he didnt make that statement
Hey  even your own party is saying no.  Sounds like a good time for you to SHUT UP!!! #TrumpThreatensAmerica
There's some whopper far right beliefs I had never heard of before (not being far right or Repugnantcan) that I can't believe any rational human being could fall for! But then these are probably the same people who buy The Enquirer at the grocery store!
President Trump is out of favor with the majority of American voters per the national polls. I hope he understands that this will be his legacy if he won't listen. The movie that will be made will show him as a narcissistic ignorant fearmongering racist .
The hypocrisy of this dimwitted president is unbelievable.  We MUST open schools.  We MUST open businesses.  We can eat in restaurants but we can‚Äôt hold the election?  Sounds like Trump is rationalizing a coup.  Be ready America.  Revolution #2?
This is a distraction. Trump will coordinate with key Republican controllled states to contest the election results. No clear majority will be established when the Electoral College meets, so the vote will go to the House. One state, one vote, trump wins with 53.
Thread by  OMG...IT'S GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE TOP OF IT NOW... You think TRUMP SUPPORTERS will be PASSITURN OUT this November? When they keep being ENRAGED by DC elite crap like this? We **can't wait** for November 3‚Ä¶
That's not why. It's funny because he very famously refused to wear a mask at a Trump rally and helped spread misinformation about the virus. He then got sick, most likely as a result of attending that rally. He also probably got countless other people sick too. Rest in piss
Doctor responds to scene at Trump's event: Depressing, distressing and dumb  ‚Å¶ responsible for Texans not following recommended CDC guidance.  Fellow Texans are foolishly believing the hoax chat &amp; risking peoples‚Äô lives &amp; spread virus.

Are the ads about how Trump rented out an entire floor of his Trump Tower to Bank of China?  Are the ads about hundreds of millions in bank loans to China?  Are the ads about the 38 trademarks awarded to the family biz?  Or, are the ads about asking for help to win the election?
This is a distraction. Trump will coordinate with key Reoublican controllled states to contest the election results. No clear majority will be established when the Electoral College meets, so the vote will go to the House. One state, one vote, trump wins with 53.
Sad but probably true. You do know that any action taken against those who actually DID collude, against President Trump and his staff, will be described as simply politics by the Dems and MSM. They have no conscience or morals.
It has only been politicized by Trump in an effort to avoid responsibility for not doing enough to stop it.   The rest of us just want people to be careful and wear masks from a place of love and concern.  An elderly man should never have been at that rally with no mask.
You look like you want to blame his death on Twitter replies instead of facing the truth that he died because of not wearing a mask at a Trump rally. Im also sure you called out the people on the right cheering when George Floyd was murdered. Right?
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 cancer, but died of COVID19 a month after attending Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Youre really blaming Trump for the situation in Portland hm? Lol
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
As a former Trump supporter, can you please move it up? Let‚Äôs vote Trump out tomorrow!
is about to speak....trump wants people to watch him instead.
Trump inherited a strong, growing economy from Obama. He absolutely wrecked it with his incompetence. He is, objectively and demonstrably, the worst POTUS for the economy since at least Hoover, probably ever.
No doubt. Multiplied by all the other Trump followers who did the same and you have this mess the rest of us are dealing with.  Makes me think of the Walking Dead episode where Carol kills some people for being irresponsible or something about being infected and gets shit for it.
Man we all knew Trump was gonna do this.
Facts that no one is even arguing?!   What the fuck is wrong with you people. I already said I agree with what you've said.  We asked the lady a question about TRUMP'S presidential behavior.   But for some reason yall keep diverting the topic to Obama and Clinton? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

BTW Congress, not the president, has the power to move Election Day. And even if Congress did postpone the vote, the Constitution would terminate Trump‚Äôs term on Jan. 20, 2021.
Trump is now openly and unabashedly an authoritarian dictator. No elections until he knows he'll be able to fix the election for himself. Voting won't fix this. Time for an even greater popular insurrection.

When you have people like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Moscow Mitch, Gym Jordan, and Matt Gaetz who have no integrity doing everything they can to help Trump who knows how things will go.

President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years ‚Äì- via starkly different paths.
That‚Äôs a shame. On top of it, his family has no recourse to sue the Trump campaign because of the waiver he had to sign to attend that death rally.
I hope, if trump wants to leave, he'd be left alone to go. Then it could be determined if his US passport should be rescinded, so he could never some back. But, I agree - no retribution. It's time to move forward and leave all this stress and the trumpism horror show behind.
Nancy Pelosi you can call covid 19 the trump virus or whatever you want. This November we are going to relieve you as speaker of the house. You are a disgrace and embarrassment to this country.  You haven‚Äôt done anything for this country but makes excuses November YOUR OUT!
Hahahhahahha!  Tyrant Twitter seeks "#OpenInternot" allies and collaboration.  After President Trump signed the Executive Order to further clarify Section 230, so that we can stop the censorship.  Censorship kills people.
I agree. ALL of them should step forward at this time against the corrupt, criminal #Trump and demand his removal.
Former Presidents are speaking at the funeral of #RepJohnLewis and are doing so with kindness, caring, eloquence, and statesmanship.    Meanwhile, Donald Trump is tweeting about pizza -- Yes, pizza.
Well his boy Hermain Cain just died of that hoax  I wonder if tRump will have condolences for him?
If Trump had done his job in Feb or March we'd be back to work now. Out of control pandemics crush economies, always. It could have been controlled. He did nothing. It is absolutely Trump's failure.
I do believe that Trump poses a threat to our democracy and our national security. I am alarmed at the things he says and does and I hope both left and right recognize it.  We are all Americans regardless of our political views. Stay safe my friend!!
Herman Cain, who was diagnosed with #COVID19 less than two weeks after attendind Trump Tulsa rally has died. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask or practice social distancing. Trump is killing us all, but his followers, the no mask types, especially.
Is Trump saying it is too dangerous to vote inperson but safe to send children to school?
Trump still cannot change the date of the election. Only Congress can. That applies to every scenario you invent.
So glad President Trump signed that Executive Order to clarify and define Section 230, and close any wiggle room.  More people are tyrants than not, it seems to me.  Time to take that opportunity away from them.
He died from going to a Trump rally

By clear wording in the Constitution, Trump cannot change the date of the election
It‚Äôs not clear when or where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June.
It is a political statement and he died on the sword of tRump's antimask message.
Only Congress can set a date for the election, which is very clear in the Constitution. Since Dems hold the house, there is no way Trump can change the date.
"Legal" means less than dog shit to Trump.

Joe Biden should win and Trump should be gone from Office for good in November
Trump will spin it and say he advised Herman Cain to wear a mask.
TRUMP HAS TO GO BEFORE HE DESTROYS AMERICA
President Trump probably crossed the line into fascistic action (or at least suggested action) by suggesting the election be delayed.  Fascism isn't just in Germany or Italy or Spain.  It looks different wherever it is.  And it is here.  Now.  In this this President.
As disturbing as this is, I'm also hit by the argument being made by his  cronies that it's just his response to the chaos Dems supposedly created by demanding mail-in voting. Uhhh NO...

Hey Trump.. how's your economy doing now? Is it fake news that the GDP dropped nearly 33%?

Oh no. If Trump would have done the right thing and at least mandated face masks and social distancing he would be alive. Trump‚Äôs ego for adoration killed Herman Cain.

Its not even 10am yet and Trump is calling for the elections to be delayed and then Herman Cain passed away from COVID.
As if Trump can actually think for himself. Good oneüòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs the Trump plague now.
"Clear" is a subjective term. Trump and Barr will not accept the results, no matter what they are. Even if he manages to win by voter suppression, he'll still say it's voter fraud because it wasn't a landslide.
After Trump loses most of his staff to Covid: "Doctors came to me, they said, 'Everyone around u got the china virus but you. WOW! You're the strongest person we ever met! When need to do tests, blood work, not the cognative test.' That I aced by the way. Man. Woman. Camera. TV."
Or, you attend a Trump pep rally without wearing a mask, contract the CovfefeVirus, and then you die.
Only Trump would think of something so asinine.

Dude... C'mon. I want a media that is not biased and just reports the news. I want honest journalism. The MSM are in essence a bully against President Trump. They ,along with the left, have been trying to impeach him since before he took office. It's pathetic.
Just a reminder if you support trump go ahead and unfollow me
I don't watch CNN or MSNBC or any tv. I just look at numbers and the things Trump is or isn't doing. It's so easy to see that he literally isn't doing anything to control the spread of covid. He literally refused to wear a mask for months even though it's proven to help.
Polls are more accurate than spotting people in maga hats in one portion of Florida. You do know Trump voters are the only ones that show off who they plan on voting on that hard. Normal voters don't do that

Fauci: Some messages from Trump's task force don‚Äôt match reports from 'trenches' - ABC News  (via
Brother, the fact that voters aren't enthusiastic for Biden proves my point. Voters are doing what they did in 2016, they are voting AGAINST a candidate they do not want in charge. Old people are a large block of the Republican vote and they don't trust Trump during the pandemic
It actually has nothing to do with the media painting Trump as a Nazi. It's more about him not handling covid well, that's the reason old folks in Florida are flipping over to Biden. They are terrified for their lives and Trump doesn't even hold press conferences on covid anymore

trump is behind Biden in Texas , Texans are loseing interest in trump are dropping him like a hot potato.Wonder how much cash he raised last night in Odessia not as much as expected I bet.
trump is truly floundering , I think he knows no one believes or trusts him he is just setting up a contested election .
"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again."

I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump‚Äôs got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That‚Äôs...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump‚Äôs saying there‚Äôd be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don‚Äôt even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...
This would be my thoughts on how Republicans would try to keep Trump in office without an election.

Okay I‚Äôll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, ‚Äúwhether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.‚Äù Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one‚Äôs own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

The Trump administration has granted  an already rogue and immoral agency, the power to detain and expel people from the U.S. without any record or paper trial. That‚Äôs the horror behind the secret detentions in hotels.

We are not laughing  , just like we didn‚Äôt laugh at your Corona joke. 150,000 dead is not a joke. How will you respond when Trump says his tweet is absolutely serious - which he undoubtedly will do?
Watching this helps steel my resolve to do everything possible to rid our democracy of Trump and ALL of his  enablers in November. The parties will continue to have their policy differences, yet they can treat each other with respect and love America equally. #WeWillVote
Attention all #Trump supporters! The election is delayed by one month in spite of what the #FakeNews reports‚ùï   #MAGA #Election2020 #ElectionDay #DonaldTrump #Biden2020 #COVIDIOTS #MaskUp
Pending Postal Service Changes Could Delay Mail And Deliveries, Advocates Warn    So the Trump Administration messes with the Postal Service and NOW they are worried about mail in ballots?
This is a lie. LMAO. Trump has denounced white supremacists multiple times. And you all call Trump supporters dumb. There are dummies on both sides, but there are far more dumb Democrats than Trump supporters, for sure.
dude. stop. being antie trump doesnt mean you have to make biden out to be something hes not. dont be stupid.
As Joe Biden so eloquently stated if you vote for Trump you ain‚Äôt black
Obama delivers call to action in eulogy for Lewis, likens tactics by Trump and administration to those by racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights By Paul Kane and John Wagner
You need to be more concerned with Trump working with Russia to ‚Äúrig‚Äú the election. As you know the fraud is Trump not mail in ballots
As for the dems are mean too.  Yeah again back to that we tell kids to get over it... Hell you are telling me get over it, but heaven forbid we tell trump to get over it!
Ultimately any dumbass who went to a political rally inside an arena with zero social distancing and zero mask mandate during the Covid 19 pandemic is responsible for their own death. But Trump is complicit and negligent
When I hear that Right Wing Nut Jobs and #MAGAts say that Liberals created COVID to make Trump look bad I have to stop and think for a moment, Trump doesn't need anyone to make him look bad! MFG he does that all by himself!
he signed a pledge to support whoever the nominee is. and he has always said he will do what it takes to stop trump. running independenf would hurt that cause.
No Free world under Trump and current GOP leadership. Try something else.
Good, I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump discipline. Notice the question marks at the end obviously meant as a thought that he completely cleared up in his 5:30 press conference, but I love how people go crazy by a thought by the President on a social media platform that allows kiddie porn
President Trump suggested delaying the election because of the coronavirus, something he cannot legally do. Top Republicans quickly rejected the idea.
Ted Cruz Hits GOP Panic Button: ‚ÄòTexas Is In Play‚Äô For Democrats In November   The Republican have done absolutely nothing for Texas just for Trump and themselves. Send kids to school what about the Teachers and Bus drivers. No make Trump happy
Black people in Minneapolis is crying out for greater police protection!Dr. Fauci works for Democratic politicians since he predicted in 2016 (of which we have documents to show this)that pandemic during Trump‚Äôs term in office ! How did he know this!
If Trump had not insisted on holding his little house party/campaign micro-event Mr. Cain would be alive.   Fact.   Trump killed the pizza man.
story but that is not why Trump hates China.  Did I forget to mention he still build hotels there?  God I hate this program when it comes to responding or having a convo but i digress
Somewhere they are hearing that what‚Äôs being suggested is not the same as absentee...what Trump is implying. I tried to educate her but her opinion is cast in stone.
voted to not hold Trump accountable for soliciting foreign intervention in our election emboldening him to interfere in the voting rights of US citizens who are registered to vote.
How many times do we have to do this?
Is that why you are running scared and doing what you do best, lying to the American people  about everything !!!  The ‚ÄúTrump Virus,  Voter fraud and the economy!!!
WhY is it we punish families and small businesses for bKP but he is smart? WHy is his business allow to drain our precious economy but no one else?  Why is he not held to the same starndards Everything Trump supports list and rage at others for he has done MANY times and recorded
Regardless, as I have repeated, what u as a trump support, is the preceived injustice &amp; power others in DC have, but he is no different.  He is not an outside, he is part of their club &amp; always has been, but back to bKP...
No your boss is wrong for moms. Trump‚Äôs track record proves he‚Äôs incompetent to lead.
I‚Äôd say Herman is responsible for his own death by not using common sense. But Trump DEFINITELY set the stage.
got ppl retweeting shit supporting Trump. nice lil block button being handed out.
Interesting that when President #Trump talks about #Biden in the Rose Garden the press and #Democrats accuse the President of politicking yet today #Obama gave a political speech against the Trump under the guise of giving a eulogy at a funeral. #JohnLewis #Trump2020

Trump 2020 no matter what
Because in his role as NSA he would have access to all the illegal activities of the Obama administration. Trump wasn‚Äôt suppose to get elected. They weren‚Äôt suppose to be found out

There is absolutely no strategic gain for the US and only a strategic gain for Russia in our pulling out of Germany.
Heres a story: 2015 Obama approved millions in funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology the soon to be location of COVID-19 outbreak that was planned to be released during this election year after the impeachment of Trump failed.  Democrats and MSM cordinated this shutdown.
That was 14 years ago.  He caught COVID-19 around the time of Trump's superspreader rally in Tulsa, tested positive a little over a week later, and succumbed to the disease after a month in the hospital for it.
No it doesn't. At least not until they put him in the ground. What does matter he made the personal decision to not listen to medical professionals, chose the political road, and now his family has to lay him to rest - all for Donald J. Trump.
Oh my God. Did he tell everyone that he got it at a Trump rally where everyone was discouraged from wearing masks? A rally that never should have happened in the first place? That every doctor said was a bad idea? Thought not.
PLANO NOW  ...Republicans Continue To Leave Trump  ...Texas Congressman Will Hurd  ...Joins the Exodus  Thanks  &amp;
Trump is already that.  Get on board and support #TRUMP2020
No we blame Trump, period
Hydroxychloroquine didn't save him? I thought Trump on his supporters have the silver bullet. I just created a call to people that will die because of people like Herman Cain and Donald Trump, will one day see them both in hell.
Trump is scared. He knows what will happen on November 3rd
Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.

Bless you President Trump. So sorry. He was a kind and wonderful man and he will be missed. He was a hero for our Country. Prayers.
Remember the movie "A Million Ways to Die in the West?" The sequel should be: "A Million Ways to Impeach Trump in the US" Get started on that Seth MacFarlane.
The GOP and Trump are the threat. Trump is so tight with Putin and of course Chinas President that for all we know Trump gave China the opportunity to hack Coronavirus details.
King Trump?
All Trump talks about is mail in vote fraud! Ridiculous  Any excuse to refuse to accept the out come Nov 3 if he loses!
Trump just stated his game plan if he loses. ‚ÄúLitigation could take YEARS before we find out who really won the presidency‚Äù. #briefing
Oh, Annie, Mr. Trump was impeached. That's not "nothing". In addition, Mr Trump is an Unindicted Co-Conspirator in at least one case. Lastly, the "activated" AG doing your claimed investigations is himself being investigated.
The contrast between Obama‚Äôs oratory and Trump‚Äôs semi coherence and mispronounciations is staggering.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There‚Äôs way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There‚Äôs little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.
You pushback on us harder than Trump? And therein lies the problem. #DoYourJob
Let‚Äôs not forget that Trump is rAcIsT though, right? Right?

In a very recent interview, Trump said he doesn't joke.
Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?

You said this is Trump‚Äôs America, didn‚Äôt you?

Weird these are indicative of what recent event...and where was this started. Damn Trump for being a business man not a politician.
This is America's first Caligula, paired with a giant FOX cult, so this is our first real stress-test on our system by totalitarians.  If we get a 2nd chance at democarcy next year, we now know exactly all the weak spots to repair, because Trump tested every law in the book.
Fucking trump
is the joke! trump is the punchline! Cornyn is one of trump‚Äôs biggest enablers and sycophants. As a constituent of Cornyn‚Äôs ü§Æ I‚Äôm 100% supporting  to defeat and remove this joke from office!
Well to be fair, Trump's bumbling incompetence has stymied his autocratic tendencies at almost every turn. Not sure the same could be said about Cruz.
Former special counsel Robert Mueller's decision not to charge President Trump with obstruction of justice was an ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù lapse that ‚Äúlet Trump get away with lying,‚Äù said Norm Eisen, former special counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
If damning information could disqualify someone, then Trump should have never ran and he should have been removed. People are going to bash KDH, but we got her if Biden does the right thing. #BidenHarris2020
I feel like Liz Ortecho needs to do a PSA correcting Trump that sex with aliens doesn't cause the coronavirus. #RoswellNM
Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.
Sen Cornyn, Donald Trump has never made a joke and neither was this! And if it was a joke, it wasn‚Äôt funny!
Trump is screwing up his plan to sell out
im in texas and im not gonna vite for biden. if that leads to texas going to trump then so be it.
It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
Curious how you know he didn't get it at the Trump rally. How do you know where he got it? Are you like one of those Dogs the Germans have trained to sniff out and identify people with COVID-19?
Did the right thing in 2016 and will do the right thing in 2020. TRUMP 2020
Regardless of the perpetrators, Trump is trying to stop the violence while local governments are enabling it.
Watching the  documentary on  and it just makes me so sad that she's not our President. She's not perfect, but i have no doubt we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now due to Trump being completely incompetent.
They know - what they are hoping is that the AMERICAN people don‚Äôt know...
These other countries aren‚Äôt dealing with the Left‚Äôs real national emergency- getting rid of Trump
Can you feel that America? That‚Äôs the shifting and the waking up of some Trump supporters. Welcome! Let‚Äôs come together and beat this virus. #TakeBackAmerica #EnoughIsEnough #UnityWins
üòÇ Not sure Trump should be trying to go back to back with Barack Obama. The comparison will be devastating for Donald. Not that he'll notice. He &amp; his minions are the least self-aware bunch we've ever had in the Whitehouse.
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Do they not understand that the more they attack Trump, the more we love him?
NWO and Trump is trying to stop it. Affects entire planet.
On the back of black people...he has done less for them than Trump...sad
There is a lot at stake in this election. It isn‚Äôt about Trump vs Biden. The Libs are undermining our current ststem government. You need to wake up.

I've been dying for him to use my phrase I gifted him a couple years ago. Describing talking to Trump voters as "being bukkaked with stupid". I guess I can understand not using it on MSNBC or CNN but maybe the Podcast is a fit.
is guilty of Trump crimes. #ComplicityIsGuilt
trump should have been removed! You failed to do your constitutional duty by refusing due diligence in his Impeachment. #EpicFailureOfLeadership
is a liar! What happened to the values of the Corp? Everything Trump turns bad and dies.
He's been at the game a lot longer.  It also says you should look at your content and delivery.  If all you do is rail on Trump you might be losing out.  Too many outlets for that and it gets tedious.
I wonder if we need to shut down social media until this Donald Trump presidency has passed

Plus will give more time to biden to fix his dementia. Funny how I typed Biden and then trump and it auto corrected Biden spelling but not trump
#WeWillVote. Even if that means a full HAZMAT suit. #WeWillVote Trump OUT. His utterance of delaying an election is something EVERY American who is worth their salt should vote him out of office for. To not is traitorous and certainly unpatriotic.
Excuse me, but are you the same Ari Fleischer who excoriated Joe Biden for suggesting three months ago that Trump would try exactly this?
You say this but rules and law mean nothing to trump and his thugs. How can we sit here and belief anyone who says this can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt happen?  They simply doing care about the law....and no one is holding them accountable.  Our votes might not even matter now....unreal.
This!! I watched an interesting documentary last night re the takedown of the mafia. 1 segment talked at length how they had to ‚Äúprove to the court‚Äù reasonable cause for a warrant &amp; what they went thru to get that proof. Which was a lot less than what‚Äôs known about Trump!
If he hadn‚Äôt followed Trump and gone to the Tulsa rally, he would still be alive!  People that follow Trump, either die or cause someone else to die! #Trumpisthevirus
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
Delaying the election is the least of my worries lol. Trump could theoretically make state legislatures bind electoral votes to him and SCOTUS could green-light it.
The blame lies squarely with tRump, and his death cult.

Trump, no doubt
While I pray for him and his family, you forgot to mention he got it from Trump Tulsa rally
Good point! But this is what the administration wants. Whether it‚Äôs the virus or the secret police sent into our cities, this will be the way it goes until Trump is out.

I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Completely predictable.
Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.
I bet Trump got Afghanistan‚Äôs #GDP up a bit by looking the other way as Russia paid all those bounties for dead Americans.
Last public appearance prior to contracting covid was the trump Tulsa rally.   Every cult eventually becomes a death cult.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.

Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn‚Äôt wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.
Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the marquee event for the president's self-proclaimed reelection campaign kickoff.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Sad. Oh well. He gambled with his life and lost big. My condolences to his family. trump is culpable.
Everything Trump touches, dies.  Ask Herman Cain.  Oh wait. You can't. He's dead.  Mask denier, dead today from Covid.
Is the economy worse than four years ago? Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited! Let‚Äôs see those tax returns.

No wonder Trump wants to delay the election (in addition to bad polls) as this news just came out, Trump‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel is the economy:
Fun fact: misleading information about an election (like saying absentee = good, mail in = bad) with the goal of suppressing votes is a good reason to report a tweet. It'd be SUCH  a shame if everybody did this and Trump faced a consequence for once
How about Congress re-schedule the election to next week? I mean, since you brought up the topic of re-scheduling elections. I don‚Äôt need any more time. I know all I need to know. Just to remove any suspense, there‚Äôs NO CHANCE IN HELL that trump gets a vote from me! üñï

... cowards or taking an anti-Trump position? ... almost certainly both ...
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I‚Äôd agree with you. Trump doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about Federal law, so don‚Äôt act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It‚Äôs his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
This is one of the scariest things I have seen Trump tweet...and that is saying a lot.
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England‚Äôs survival depends on it.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election ‚Äî But Congress Sets the Date

Marco Rubio is a spineless coward and a yesman of a politician, unworthy of public office.   Not only has he debased himself for Trump, he KNOWINGLY allowed Covid to ravage Floridians in exchange for temporary political expedience.   Vote lil Marco out.
** Breaking** He can‚Äôt do it, but he‚Äôs floating the idea.
No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.

That is information we must have. We have no use for Trump‚Äôs lies, which you and republicans constantly mimic.
We certainly can not trust republicans, they have become lying minions to con man Trump.
Same, it was something along the lines of "Trump was going to get them to pay for the border wall through indirect payments, nobody said they would just cut us a check for it"
Just out of curiosity...what would it say if President Trump lost the election...but Republicans kept the Senate and gained the House back?

The U.S. Postal Service reached a deal with the Trump administration over the terms of a $10 billion loan.  via  We have best postal service in the World and must support it. And, our thanks to Amazon for doing just that! Say thanks, everyone.
Good thing anyone can kick down Trump's border wall and walk into Mexico. I know Mexico isn't technically allowing us in, but if you walk in and feed the first family you see, you have a friend and ally forever. As a Texan, I have often looked to Mexican people for humanity.
I understand that some people have beautiful, kind hearts. I admire them.  Myself, maybe I am broken. Some guy supports Trump's murderous reign, I'll drop a deuce on his grave.  He helped kill many decent people. No sympathy for that devil. F him.

My thoughts are, why didn't the Trump administration develop some kind of council between federal, local government, and community leaders to discuss solutions for ending police brutality? I mean, he is "the great negotiator". At least that's what he claims.

The FDA revokes the EUA. The FDA approves recommendations for treatments. Once the Trump admin aporoves this drug, assuming it has some efficacy, it should be used.   It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs own admin that are in the way.
So would a door knob.
First reported by Politico, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert received a positive COVID-19 test during a pre-screening procedure Wednesday morning. He was present at William Barr's hearing yesterday, not wearing a mask and claiming he'd tested negative.
Nope. He just has to let MAGA be MAGA.   Biden has the Dems. Polls show he has the women vote. Biden has the black vote and looks like Hispanics are joining as well. All he needs is a few % of MAGA to abandon trump and he crushes trump.
If they were truly our allies Trump wouldn't have to insist NATO countries pay their 2% insist all trade be fair and reciprocal. they shouldve already been doing that. Instead they let American taxpayers and consumers subsidize them. With allies like that who needs allies.
They would take a bigger hit with Trump in office because he's demanding fair and reciprocal trade which doesn't give the economic advantages they were enjoying since WW2.
Tell me all the world leaders who want Trump reelected, none of them do. Since they're globalists, throwing their citizens under a bus is nothing to them to get rid of Trump, not so coincidentally the dems themselves have no problem destroying the economy to keep him from winning
Trump has appointed gold standard people to the fed and Trump has pulled the fed into the treasury. So never say never. Trump has a real grasp of all the problems career politicians have created and despite all the crap the swamp throws at him hes still managing to get stuff done

If you like corpses. Talk to Houston and San Antonio folks about it. Austin is a ghost town. Texas is getting flattened.  But we won‚Äôt call trump out on his complicity. And Abbott is starting to feel some personal responsibility for the crisis.   We are on fire.
Trump has done everything I could've asked for and more. As a person that voted for Trump in 2016, i say to all, I will vote for Trump in Nov. Even if it takes my dying breath to get to the voting booth
Considering the Trump admin scientists support this conclusion, I will trust them.   No demon seed will impact my decision
I can‚Äôt help but think Trump being president has something to do with it. The illusion of democracy is over.  That dipshit blew it to pieces. So welcome to the new normal. And unfortunately I am guessing it‚Äôs going to get worse before it gets better.
Alien DNA and demon sperm, man... ya can't make this shit up.  If she'd said Trump was created with alien DNA and demon sperm I might've believed it!
Until trump made fun of his wife and accused Ted‚Äôs dad of killing JFK. But at some point, Ted said, ‚ÄúYep, going full MAGA‚Äù.
So the president isn't allowed to exercise and stretch his legs? He did prepare he got enough doses of hydroxychloroquine to protect the people. Unfortunately the media and dems can't have people surviving and keeping the country open that doesn't hurt Trump or his voters.
Or, and hear me out, look at Ted trying to stay relevant and jockey for a position in the potential next trump cabinet.
I bet he thanks ‚ÄúPresident Donald Trump‚Äù
Testing isn't a federsl issue its a state issue but since states were shirking there responsibilities Trump had to do the states job for them. Nice try though.

When Trump and Republicans say LAW they are referring to White Supremacy. When they say ORDER  these Trump Republicans mean they have the right to ignore any concerns pertaining to Black Americans. The Trump Administration is racist from the Head down.

Nice try. Trump has failed us all. Everyone is in danger with him in a position of any authority. The Mayor of Chicago has to rebuild the South Side, even if she has to do it without the Republicans.

The strange thing is that mainstream media only covered the democrats primaries. Trump also beat other republicans. Now, they polls mostly sample democrat voters so you don't get a real quality poll, it is BIASED. Like most of you. I guess u need the lies.
I followed the primaries closely. Had democrats and independents united they would have had about as many as Trump, but they didn't and Trump had double the delegates of the 'best' democrat.

Legislators are just that, legislators. I know, many were lawyers in their previous life. But if the Democrats are serious about preserving our democracy, they need to recognize that this is a fight that Trump, Barr, et al. fully intend to win: by whatever crime necessary.  11/12
And find a way around the 5 minute rule! Yes, Dem Reps scored some "hits", got Barr to squirm a bit, but SO WHAT? To me, this political theatre, this trolling contest, suggests that the Democrats don't really have a plan on how to take on Barr, Trump, et al. Dems: just vote! 9/12
There's no question that Barr is Trump's Roy Cohn, and that Barr has turned the DoJ into a law office with one client: Donald Trump. The question is, WTF to do about it? There is no doubt as to Barr's criminality, and the risk to an election less than 3 months away is high. 4/12

Gutfield. I dare you to tweet anything you feel trump made a mistake on.
no. trump should have taken it seriously like a grown up, like a president &amp; set a National strategy &amp; take advice &amp; review data &amp; change strategy if the data indicates it.  Gov. Abbot in Texas has now  realized this &amp; is now leading Texas in the right direction.

trump is behind Biden in Texas , Texans are loseing interest in trump are dropping him like a hot potato.Wonder how much cash he raised last night in Odessia not as much as expected I bet.
trump is truly floundering , I think he knows no one believes or trusts him he is just setting up a contested election .

I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump‚Äôs got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That‚Äôs...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump‚Äôs saying there‚Äôd be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don‚Äôt even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...
This would be my thoughts on how Republicans would try to keep Trump in office without an election.

Your job is not to create violent theater to distract from  COVID failure, but that seems to be all that  can think of.  Your job includes dealing with Hurricanes and pandemics, but that fails to interest Trump or Chad.

Bias is telling the story and then sharing their own opinion on it, but they make sure that they portray trump and trump supporters as evil. You see reporters time and time again taking the time to insult him and manipulate his words instead of reporting on him.
Okay I‚Äôll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, ‚Äúwhether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.‚Äù Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one‚Äôs own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
Sadly all the GOP is in lock goose step with dear leader trump.  No one from that party will call him out.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

(2/2) I am not sure what I am more frightened about, Trump getting reelected or a President Biden.  Petulance vs incompetence 2020
I will as long as Trump is president. Thank you.
No, Trump's idiocy is helping the Democrats cause. If he had a small modicum of empathy for the average hard working American he would have had no problems being re-elected. Face it, George W Bush had way more class and empathy than this selfish clown Americans elected as #POTUS
If America becomes Venezuela, it will all because of Trump. Mark my words.
Trump raised $7 million yesterday in the Permian... imagine if we were in a boom?!
I sick that Trump did not cancel his rally during a state wide emergency.

Have you met the democratic party? I'll take none of the above for 200 Alex. That party you speak of is long gone and will never return without accountability and cleansing. Trump is doing that now. Hope you see your party again soon.
I am white and was raised in inner city of Chicago! U tweet is racist! And Trump has done more for the black race in3 years then any other president save Abraham Lincoln!
U need to resign !Mr. Barr is not going anywhere and nor is Trump

Just a few sights from President Trump‚Äôs visit to the basin today. We‚Äôll have the EXCLUSIVE 1 on 1 interview with POTUS on  at 10.
It's not everyday you get to cover the President. I talked to local Trump supporters who waited for hours outside just to get a glimpse of him.
no offense but the ppl who are pressed about trump being here are the same ones who just drink every weekend and go off of everything based on what their friends say/think.
Loved the speech! He speaks the truth! Thank you President Trump for visiting Midland Odessa today! We stand beside you all the way!!!!
It was great to have you in Midland today!!  Trump 2020!!!  WWG1WGA

Yep. Cause they‚Äôd definitely be fired for attending a pro-life or Trump rally
Please don‚Äôt vote for trump :(
My family got a selfie with the president of the United States! Nice to See you in Texas Trump!
And the projections for Trump tax cuts were off bc they didn‚Äôt account for increased investment or taxable revenue.  They only took current numbers and allied the lower %‚Äôs. I can do the best projection in the world and forget one variable and be massively wrong.
And tax cuts for Amazon to hire more people and invest in Business infrastructure is different than personal tax cuts for Bezos.  The same guy who vastly supports a $15 min wage btw. Tax revenue, again, increased after Trump tax cuts. Wages rose for lower class.
Sparse crowd lines up to greet Trump at airport in Midland. A confederate flag can be seen waving in the background two days after School Board renamed Robert E Lee High School!
Imagine Trump pulling up to Shack lmao
Trump is in Odessa rn and this fool has the audacity to close the highway bitch people are trying to get home üò§
Great day !  President Trump here in my home town-
Great day in Midland Texas! President Trump here, letting us know how much he supports our oil industry.  Lots of support here.  He will win Texas.  His phrase for today was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess with Texas‚Äù.  Well known to all Texans.
If you think trump is going to the glue factory,  it seems you need the caring for. The elite hate him because he is exposing everything. He has a trump card and I'm sure will use it at some point soon. Already exposing the pedo sickos.
Trump playing Village people "YMCA" athis speech to an all male white audience in cowboy hats in Midland Texas. Reminiscent of "Brokeback Mountain" at Double Eagle Energy.
You come to Midland? We were there to welcome you and your dad. Thank you the Trump  family for saving our country.
trump sweating his ass off in this west texas heatüòπ
Newsflash to Trump! Midland is becoming progressive. Just this week the local  School Board voted to rename Robert E Lee High School.
Not admissible evidence, I might add.
Blame it on Trump. He knew about the virus since November and didn't do a damn thing until he people started dying in the thousands.
Trump complaining of problem in Portland ironically as he never addressed the mass shooting in Midland Odessa. Shooter was mentally ill and obtained assault weapon legally. Local victims asked to talk to him and cruz! Crickets!
So why blame her for a status quo that was put into place long before she was elected? You might as well blame abortions on Trump when he was living there.
What are Trump supporters, Alex?

My area of Texas where I live is going buck wild crazy cause trump just landed to give a speech.
and I made our way to the Double Eagle Energy oil rig where President Trump will be speaking this afternoon
Here is Trump landing in Midland. No mask even though we are a covid hot spot. Everyone on ground has masks and he greets them breaking the social distancing guidelines. Unbelievable.
Reporter‚Äôs Notebook: Trump's visit to Midland
Me looking at the videos of people hanging around the airport to welcome Trump to midland and none of them are wearing masks. Nasty
Look at the Trump delegation landing in the Covid ridden Midland Odessa area. All Texas officials on ground have masks on. Most of the Trump delegation do not. And Trump is not social distancing coming in 6 feet of Governor Abbott.
why don't yall start doing real news coverage like the child pedophilia, human trafficking news going on. Amazing y'all can find out what underwear Trump is wearing, but can't report real news.
I hope traffic isnt all wack since trump is here. Luckily i drive back to el paso today üëÄ
Hahaha I wish!!  Any chance Trump signed a  helmet  #PonyUp
People are really paying thousands of of dollars just to meet Trump?? üòÇüòÇ
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt support big business republicans. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt donate to Trump. He has enough money, he doesn‚Äôt need mine.  But until you stop believing the MMT bs you will keep allowing our leaders to spend our money and line their pockets.  And we will be Venezuela.
Then they‚Äôll keep being a shit company making shit cars.  Oh, but they said they would make eco friendly cars... so they‚Äôre the good guys, we can give them money. And their CEO doesn‚Äôt like Trump and donates to DNC. So open up the gov wallet.

For the rest of my days I will never understand this cult for trump.
You can't legally arrest people without a warrant. Sorry, but this is Pinochet type autocracy we're seeing in Portland. President Trump is in the wrong, and his behaviors will come back to haunt him.
Covering President Trump‚Äôs visit to the Basin with  Right now we‚Äôre at the Marriott Hotel in Odessa, where the President is set to hold his fundraiser luncheon. Many attendes are lining up to get inside.

Excellent perspective from Speaker Craddick: Trump is committed to West Texas‚Äô recovery  via  #txlege
Just got my temperature checked and was screened. President Trump should be arriving in Midland soon.
I doubt it will be by Late October/Early November but there is enough concern right now to push people to be in the middle.   If we see unemployment fall again this month I suspect Trump will see a 2-3% jump in most polls overnight.
I hope someone plays FDT when Trump arrives at the airport
Here at Midland International Airport, Trump supporters are here for his arrival in the basin. Air Force One is scheduled to land at 11:30 and we‚Äôll have coverage on air and on

If I don‚Äôt get to watch a Trump/Biden debate, then what‚Äôs this all been about? What have I been working towards?
So far they have censored conservatives with their rhetoric tactics.  Will be so glad when Trump gets to rally back.  By the way Peside Trump- welcome to Midland Texas.  My home town.  Excited to have you here.
He touts "law and order" but the sister of Odessa mass shooting victim says are streets are far from safe. Carla Byrne requested to speak wit Trump and Cruz but they refused. #MidlandOdessa
We were briefed by CIA, and FBI, since President Trump will be in Midland today for a fundraiser. I just hope to catch a glimpse of Air Force One. I‚Äôm sure that plane is bigger than the whole Midland airport.
Remember when Collins was caught on a hot mic calling Trump "crazy" yet she never calls him out in public. She wouldn't voteto impeach. She knows the truth. She's a stooge!

One and done president.  I even hate to use that term when it comes to trump because he is NOT a president.  He is a whiny narcicist who only cares about destroying anything that Obama accomplished and playing golf.  He DOESN'T READ SECURITY BRIEFINGS, HE DOESN'T TRY TO LEARN

You're thinking of President Trump.
People need to stop overestimating the power of the President. Does anyone remember civics class? Or government? The three branches have equal power. People thinking Trump can just do whatever he wants are overreacting or trying to make him more than he is.  Both sides do it.
Don't think he's a Trump supporter, sir.
you suck at your job too. How the hell are you the rep for Florida and blaming Trump for the COVID cases? Why don't all of y'all tell how y'all are lying about the cases and they changed once the cases were stopped being reported to the CDC?
Just saw some people selling trump flags on wall st. Bout to drive by blasting fuck Donald Trump.
Trump is coming to Midland Texas tomorrow where our Mayor followed Trump's no masks needed advice. We have a surging case count and people are dieing everyday! Trump killed Texans and its economy! #TrumpKillsTexas
I can agree to that. I agree that Trump can single handedly unite this country as well. Unfortunately, his opposition and the MSM negate his efforts at every turn. It's frustrating to me. Imagine him with his plateful. I'd be frustrated too and I usually keep a good composure.
That was a premeditated attack on the US. One could argue that the virus was too, but even if it was proven, when Trump mentioned it was a blatant attack on us, the left wing media used words such as racism, dictator, cruel, unworldly, disruptive, etc....
Correct, they aren't important. Solutions are important. You and I know that the left literally blames every possible negative situation on Trump.
4+ million confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 150,000 deaths, and...this.
Trump anonzwa shona hereüòÇüòÇ
Don't forget they are pushing shut downs and protests ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But is Trump's fault ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Unreal isn't it? But by all means, vote blue.

OMG....ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Everything is spun into "Trump's fault". Unreal with you folks that believe everything the left spews.
If CNN, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, etc said that you will die from ten minutes of sun exposure this month, the sheep would believe it. Then they would blame Trump ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And couple that with the 1.0% raises he gave the military the rest of his tenure idt that 3.4% was really his idea.  I know all of my buddies who still serve are happier now then they were for 08-16. Vets overwhelmingly support Trump. And for good reason.
It's sad that the left followers truly believe in every single "spin" of every situation as truth. Ridiculously sad. Common sense, from any neutral person, shows the agenda set by the left. We all have choices, but somehow our choices r Trump's fault, unless it's a good choice ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This has absolutely nothing to do with trump. He was manipulated into believing he was actually fighting for a legit cause. He played a stupid game and unfortunately won the stupid prize.
no, that happens all the time.. trump and pence have both been quoted, they are handed stuff all the time.. it wasnt a freemason handshake, its a roman style, grab the palm.. my preacher does it, its more endearing than a reg shake
Again Dan I‚Äôm a conservative who thinks we should cut military budget by 10-15%. Buts it‚Äôs for equipment we don‚Äôt need anymore of. The f-35 was a masterclass in gov waste and Pelosi spearheaded it.  Obama refused to give soldiers raises, Trump did give them raises.
I was in the Military under Obama.  He defunded it pretty hard. Which killed morale. Also, as we have already gone over my inability to have the VA do anything.  And buying F-35‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt fund the military. Trump got pay raises for soldiers, Pelosi is getting for herself.
Trump is going to incite a war with China. A military war not a trade war. It's the Republican plan on how to keep power. #MorningJoe

The president of Midland Texas School Board is a Republican and penned this op-ed on Sunday calling for Lee High School to change its name! This is a must read! And a sign that Trump is over!
They also don‚Äôt take into account anything pre-trump. The vast majority of these ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù are a result of continued trends from the previous administration. Obama brings the unemployment rate down from 12% to 5% and no one cares. Trump goes from 5% to 4% and woohoo
The Right is done with Trump's racist agenda as Midland County Texas School Board voted in a 5-1 decision to change name of Robert E Lee High School tonight! This is a statement! This is the end of Trump!
To do otherwise would be to "help Trump" which is absolutely against their agenda.  The media would rather commit treason than inadvertently help Trump.

And you're saying trump is coherent?  Or even smart?  You need to read his answer to Hannity when he asked trump what his vision for the next 4 years is.  Because if you consider that intelligent  or even coherent ... then you're an idiot as well.

Trump was never Vice President. I was speaking on Biden, sir. Keep up with the conversation. Is English even your primary language?

Dear Donald Trump, You are planning on coming to Midland Texas and give a speech. PLEASE STAY AT HOME. Since you took office our economy collapsed; we endured a mass shooting that was preventable with gun laws, and a raging pandemic. #JoeBidenJob
President Trump is visiting one our rigs and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen grown men so excited!
One more day America survived Trump.
Midland had one per cent unemployment when Obama handed the reigns to Trump. Today it looks like a ghost town. Biden can restore the Texas economy.  #JoeBidenJob

So does President Trump.
Stop deflecting and giving mulligans to Trump. Trump is a dishonest president and businessman. If Obama broke the law he should be convicted. Same with Trump. This shouldn't be that difficult for you to comprehend.
We weren't talking about abortion, but I'm game. If Trump is so pro life why does he keep reimbursing Planned Parenthood?

He is laughing at this. It‚Äôs the only explanation I can come up with. Trump is using this 14th century medical ‚Äúexpert‚Äù to make fun of Fauci in some odd way. No one believes this. Well besides cultists.

Someone explain why the city officials are allowing this to continue? Do they really believe it's hurting Trump? Are they willing to sacrifice their cities to hurt Trump?
So if trump is telling us flat out that he‚Äôs rigging it, how do we get around it?  Make no mistake, he‚Äôs tattling on himself here. He usually does.
This country was fucked way before trump.
No one cared that Trump sold HCQ to Brazil with some of the highest mortality rate when it was debunked but here we are again.
Twitter is such a little b*tch...  Yet they continue #Orwellian censorship with absolutely ZERO consequence. Nobody's coming to help. They own Congress &amp; Trump has done nothing.  It's US vs Them.
Of course they knew! If President Trump had not been for it could have saved many, many lives. Instead the "experts", MSM, Democrats, Trump haters and big pharma simply had to be against it's effectiveness.
Every hospital in every democrat state is lying about covid numbers to steal the extensive federal emergency funds-more than even to discredit trump
That is how Trump wins....
Rowlett/Garland Texas had a trump parade of boats at lake ray Hubbard.  More than 600 boats, all the restaurants sold out in outside seating. New photographers showed up. TOOK NO PICTURES. NOBODY GOT HURT, BEATEN OR SHOT. NO VIOLENCE-FAKE NEWS DOESN‚ÄôT CARE
Does this have anything to do with a headline I saw that said Trump Admin loosening US policy on exporting drones?  I just saw the headline pop up and thought it might be important to remember...
Dude, where have you been?  Trump is trying to open schools and Biden and Dems want them closed.  What do you not get?
Well, the GOP certainly knows how to win the hearts of hard working Americans. NOT.   Time to oust Trump's #1 rump kisser and vote for MJ Hegar who will support the working class people in the state. #TexasDeservesBetter than this.  Vote for
I believe should use common sense and remember what that orangy, racial, ignorant jackass has done to this country. But I'm afraid that common sense is really hard for Trump people. Let's hope and vote!
Can you give any hints? I may have to call my credits and my mortgage company to let them know that I won't be able to pay on time. Why are you screwing us over? You have a job, you get paid, you have your home. We lost jobs because Trump wasn't prepare for this. Not our fault!!
No but HELL NO! Can't deal with Trump and his cronies who have NO common sense!
How you want to be in the same room with Trump it beyond my understanding. Everything is  COMMON SENSE and not your kind of common sense!   It's not our fault!!  ** HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?** If you still have a heart, please, don't screw us.
Why would you want to hurt the unemployed through no fault of our own?  I had finally found a job I really liked but was laid off because of you, the other Republicans and your leader Trump, who obviously couldn't care less about the rest of us.
Then i guess that couple that decided to point their gun at protesters should have been shot at? Pro-gun users do that all the time, especially trump supporters.
Think our TX Senator may be getting worried. It's about time Trump's #1 rump kisser woke up to the the changing climate and the blue tidal wave coming to Texas. #TexasDeservesBetter than John Cornyn Vote for MJ Hegar 2020

I understand the thinking, but Biden and Dems need to do what‚Äôs best for the people and not let Trump and  drive this narrative.     I wish we can have 4 VPs!  So many great choices!
Always the same kind of animals !
LMAO its ok, he has a couple more months talking about trump and it will be no more once he‚Äôs out of office üòÇ
Nah, I just choose not to converse with someone that‚Äôs immature enough to go find one extreme pic and try to throw it out as some all encompassing trump card.
But of course the unions dont, against Trump by All means. Socialists.
Why Dems know they are doing all this. Are Already laying the groundwork against Trump by saying he wont leave office as demagogue.  When it's really due 2 their trying 2 steal election as history &amp; recent events prove. Dems are up 2 old stealing moves
The federal government declared a national emergency. Which in doing so puts the coordination on them at that point. Trump even before that was trying to downplay it. So then his constituents (Republicans who control congress) follow along. It starts with him....
I dont care about biden. Whatever his problems are hes not as bad as trump. Trump also the guy who said if you don't test you won't have  coronavirus case. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ
Trump could have done this: Keep in mind he declared national emergency so that then is to coordinate response to the states. 1. Actually used DPA to mfr ppe and ventilators until there is surplus across the nation.  2. Nationwide shutdown  3. Money to citizens and small business
So the rest of us had the info but trump didnt? ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
You're the one who said somehow Democrats are responsible for covid failure when trump is president and has a Republican Senate. So why dont you start...
I'm not a Democrat or Republican but please explain how they are more responsible for the COVID19 failure. I mean this is 2020. We see every tweet, press conference and rally from trump. We dont need the news or politicians to tell us. Its right in front of us.
When Joe Biden says that Donald Trump is the first racist president (it follows his supporters as well) he‚Äôs not saying that Trump hates black and brown people? And if Joe is making that claim, are his statements getting the attention they deserve?
Yep I am voting trump
Ew wtf, Black people do not like trump for 1. And 2, Texas is now a battleground state, and is actually a blue state but leans slightly red to ridiculous gerrymandering.
Trump will say anything
wtf is trump supposed to do he‚Äôs told people what to do to slow the spread of the virus he cannot make people do anything. its up to the people to do something.
funny how you are tied in Texas according to polls, but in NTX only Trump signs and flags fly. Nothing, absolutley nothing for crazy Joe Biden.
I‚Äôm with you sister!  One blue dot in a sea of red here in Texas surrounded by family &amp; friends who are all on the Trump Train but I will not be silent!
It doesn't matter if Trump wants to leave. On January 21, he will no longer be president. If he is still in the White House, he will be trespassing. It doesn't matter what he thinks.
Im not a trump supporter btw. üñïüèæ trump

Universal Healthcare? Who is going to pay for it? With fair tax burdens you can‚Äôt have universal healthcare. We have global alliances. The US has been getting screwed for years and years on import and export taxes. All Trump did was raise them so that it‚Äôs fair to the US.
Thousands showed up for the Trump Parade on Lake Ray Hubbard. Chairman Anderson was there with SREC Member Stephen Stanley and Keenan Williams from Trump Victory. Texans are ready for a big GOP win in November! #LeadRight #Trump2020
As one üîµ in ruby red Texas, I can say that those that are still on the Trump Train are big conspiracy theorists.  These aren‚Äôt your parents‚Äô Republicans any more down here.  It‚Äôs eye opening and very disheartening...
Sad? Cynical?  You want cynical, look back on your dear leader's treatment of Merrick Garland's nomination.  You think if RBG needed to step down, he wouldn't fast track whichever kiss-ass nominee Trump put out there?
How did I stumble upon the Trump 2020 boat parade. I stg this is going to be the most uncomfortable dinner ever
Better than Trump is an ignorant reason. That would be the same logic that African Americans voted for Obama because he was black. There are no Democrats that can come up with anything that‚Äôs great about their party.
Trump Parade outside Dallas. At the Hilton in Rockwall, TX (small town America) A policeman I spoke to tells me, I bet there is 1,500 boats out there. People lined the shore. MSM polls may be off.

Other than the vicious attacks levied at Obama by Trump etc?  Let's not wash that aside.
The Trump presidency is a test of commerce/infrastructure verses infrastructure/governance.  The need to "get paid" outweighs the "need to do good".
and trump and multiple republicans are trying to make a change biden wants to keep all those criminals in jails he did it back in the 90s he‚Äôll do it again he doesn‚Äôt care about this shit. and neither do democrats.
$45m? How much has Trump's golf affliction cost the USA?
I don't disrespect your opinion, btw, I'm just reflecting what I see.  My political position is to see what I see - from all angles.  As a corporate employee such "easy wins" would never be tied up in red tape.  Trump promoted his as such as leader yet failed on the easy wins ...
But I don't think most people are fooled that suddenly policies that help lower income ppl are now enacted when the polls are showing such a poor situation for Trump.
Prices didn't escalate like they have, unconstrained, under Trump.  I've only been a US citizen for two years so this is my time to object.
They are vets. Real vets know our job has always been to protect the people and defend the constitution. Both of which are under attack by the Trump administration.
Trump has proven that the constitution, and the law, are just suggestions.   By doing nothing to rein him in, our law enforcement agencies at every level, have confirmed this.

Since they ant this so much that they won‚Äôt let trump stop it- how is it trump‚Äôs America, miss cha cha?

As well as Trump then right?
Are you paying attention you suburban wives planning to vote for biden?
Now do the same for Biden. My prediction is the DNC keeps crazy Joe in his basement and will never let him debate Trump or engage in any lengthy meaningful conversations. They know he will end up telling the truth and saying some stupid shit.
""Q"" is just conspiracy nut jobs that believe anything they are told that makes em feel good about themselves. Mostly wacky folks but the majority are harmless. Don't see the point of banning them, If you don't ban their leader. Donald Trump. He's the dangerous one

Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.üôÑ
trump is just playing along with the crazies who want to shut it all down, hide in our closets, and hope the world works out.  He floated the idea that takes their lockdown logic to the extreme of actually canceling the elections.  Its a great move, politically.
I admit that since Trump is so public, it wouldn't be easy, but it has been done before:
Thinks? Pretty much certain the way he is acting.  All five year olds, ever: If I can‚Äôt play with it, I‚Äôm going to break it so nobody can play with it.  Trump is a bully with no compassion, he will tear everything down in the tim between the election and the inauguration.
2/ This means that landlords have to pay their loans, which means they have to collect their rent.  I'm not saying any of this is right, but it is, sadly, the position Trump has put us all in.
Hehehe. We all know what bless your heart really means.  Good for him.  Trump wants fox to be state media.
Obama criticism is one thing, but to act like Trump is better for the black community when he‚Äôs letting a pandemic kill us is really worms for brains
Obama should stay out of things he shouldn't be there he's not in the government anymore he's a dangerous man and he's a traitor and I was Trump I wouldn't go there either he needs to not be in the anywhere around stuff like that uses obiden for his puppet
Please tell me he coughed on trump at least
You are ignoring that trump thinks he is above the law and his supporters are letting him be so he could do this.
Trump hasn't even tweeted his condolences.  He may not even remember who Cain is, with his dementia and everything.

That is assuming trump will leave the office.  Economy can be repaired.  Letting a dictator take over the country only has one solution.

Oh, no, they HATE me.  They won't listen to me either.  At this point, if they are still planning on voting for Trump, they are either brainwashed or they are profiting from his administration.  Either way, they aren't changing their minds.
I think a lot of people support Trump cause they are tired of lifelong Politicians. No reason for people to be in Washington 20 years and average person having to work two jobs just to live. Democratic Party needs to find someone not a ‚ÄúPolitician‚Äù

Sad that this is not even newsworthy. Most folks don‚Äôt even know what is happening/ MSM will just report that Trump caused it all. They are hoping for mass carnage.  Some suggest protestors/rioters are being compensated like an army for hire.
Your leaders won‚Äôt listen-they can‚Äôt blame Trump for violence if there is no violence. Get out while you can
I mean fuck Brett farve wtf this mf trump doing bro mfs dien out here
Please pray for our sons and daughters in HLS.  Our modern politics uses them as pawns, and demonizes these public servants while honoring  anarchists. The left agenda cares nothing about innocent life as long as they can beat Trump.
Not a fan of police, but I wouldn't trust Trump with the life of a watermelon seed.
Look, I'm going to be brutally honest here.  I don't care if you are a staunch Republican at this point.  I don't even care if you initially voted for Trump (I don't like it very much, but...).  If you are voting against Trump and the current ass-kissers in the White House, okay.
Okay, I've made a decision.  I'm going to stop blaming everything on #Trump.  Yes, he is the #asshat that leads them, everyone currently working in #TheWhiteHouse is complicit, therefore they are ALL to blame.  So, from now on, I will be saying "The White House" did this or that.
Brother, if you think you are immune to a beating from the cops becaue you licking the boots of Donald J. Trump you are highly mistaken.  You want to say the Democrats blocked some kinda bill to help the American people . BRO, I DONT NEED NO HELP I WORK FOR MINE.

This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.

I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
It says a lot that trump makes grand statements on behalf of republicans who publicly have not agreed with his sentiment. He expects them to fall in line and doesn't wait for confirmation that they will.
Name one fault Trump has taken responsibility for. Politicians, Dem or Rep, don‚Äôt do that. That‚Äôs why we call them politicians.

Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there‚Äôs that.
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. ü§£
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his ‚Äújoke‚Äù about injecting people with bleach. He wasn‚Äôt joking.
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.

The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Do you Church of Elon members realize that Elon aligns himself with the Trump-loving witch doctor who is insanely promoting hydroxychloroquinine as a Covid cure? Yes Elon is  world class cutting-edge engineer, but he is also a dangerous idiot.
The Right is losing the middle: Trump pushes Elon's idiot idea that hydroxychloroquinine cures Covid. Trump listens to Elon and removes data access from CDC because of Elon's idiot idea that evil doctors are inflating Covid deaths. Elon is causing harm to the world.

My Constitutional law is rusty but if I recall correctly, if the election is delayed it would not extend Trump's term and I believe in lieu of an election by January 20 the House would pick the President. I don't remember if the VP is picked by them or appointed by another.

I‚Äôll just remember until TOMORROW when Trump says he doesn‚Äôt kid. Then I‚Äôll vote against Cornyn in November, by any means necessary.
One of the worst things about all this is that I doubt most Trump voters have the capacity to feel guilt, shame, or remorse in any way. If challenged I'm sure most of them will defend their 2016 vote as "still better than Hillary."

Not to mention that states have methods to guard against fraudulent mail-in votes such as signature matching.  So basically, all the claims about mail voter fraud are absolutely ridiculous and are just ways to disenfranchise voters who would negatively impact Trump‚Äôs re-election.

whats funny is that even if the election gets delayed, trump and pence get auto kicked out of office come January, so pres would be Pelosi but she's up for reelection too and if dems win the senate then the next president would be Pat Leahy of VT

If by ‚ÄúTrump was a great candidate.‚Äù you mean he is great at the shameless art of self promotion, then yes he was a great candidate. However, he is a failure as a leader. He has yet to establish an effective plan to run this country. Propaganda is his only policy.
yes, they are not being fair. Covid 19 should not dictate mail or in person voting. it should just be moved up in all fairness to everyone. Biden is not fighting the Covid 19 either. Trump is, and thats global and More important. But it is the Democrats taking advantage, FEAR
But just to be clear about me I‚Äôm not a Republican I am a constitutionalist and lean toward libertarian on government staying out of my business but I do like Donald Trump because of the things he‚Äôs done supporting the constitution and the conservative movement
There are also perfectly decent people and Republicans who do like trump for the things he‚Äôs done for the conservative movement
Remarkable how many GOP senators and governors already on the record this morning against this: Rubio, McConnell, Sununu, others. It‚Äôs easy to forget not every R is projected to lose their election, but they might lose if Trump squashes turnout by signaling the base its hopeless.
I know. Had to explain it to several friends. No wonder trump,Hitler and other dictators love the poorly educated. What‚Äôs truly frightening. These friends have been home schooling bc schools are inferior to their knowledge. üëÄ they will receive a World History book for Christmas
I forgot about that bit, but in any case, Trump delaying the election hands the whole government over to his opponents, so he's just incredibly stupid in his desperate attempts at dictatorship.
PRESIDENT TRUMP is 100% right (COVID19) and is backed on this from all his supporters and voters.  Pelosi doesnt want that cuz it will mess up their framing President Trump . The WORLD KNOWS THIS , every country.  too sad that the Democrats dont have supporters that can  think !
Trump is the man who destroyed America and gave us to Russia! Economy is tanked, he didn‚Äôt even try to stop a pandemic, he has managed to bankrupt our farmers, and small businesses. Trump is a liar, a racist and traitor to our country! Trump has divided America to make us weaker.
Betcha a dollar Trump attends HIS memorial.
Ask them all, on the record....see where they stand. Only congress holds the power to delay the election.  Also remember that Trump is trying to distract from the most devastating economic contraction in history....under his leadership. He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about that.
He could probably muster some CPD agents and those sad prison guards he dragged to DC a few months ago. I suspect the sight of even one Apache helicopter would melt their devotion to Donald Trump pretty quickly.
It did...but Herman Cain was a willing victim. We watched him stand maskless next to so many others. He ignored the science of his chosen profession in pursuit of power under Trump...he paid the ultimate price.  Will you chose wisely in November? A vote for Trump may kill you.
Trump believes this only if he loses!  Trump is in trouble for lying, being a white supremacy follower, and his corruption!
Herman Cain should be any right wing COVID doubters wake up call. He knocked mask mandates, did not wear one at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally and likely contracted it there. Now he‚Äôs dead. If this doesn‚Äôt clear some things up you are beyond help.
That isn‚Äôt the case in the US (yet! four more years and who knows). Gen. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs *apologized in public* for his appearance in Trump‚Äôs Lafayette Square debacle. Weeks later he told Naval Academy grads: ‚ÄúWe must guard against those who would divide us.‚Äù
Herman Cain had choices to make for himself. He chose to follow Trump, he chose to go to Tulsa, he chose not to wear a mask. We are all personally responsible for our own choices. Leaders lead with the well-being of their constituents. Trump and his administration, do not.
Ours....POTUS DICTATOR TRUMP. If he wants a revolt, he‚Äôll get it by doing that.
For those unaware. This is the Economy. Not the trump Fed assisted, pumped up Stock Market. Everything w trump is smoke and mirrors except this, a result of his ineptitude

Democrats are the only ones who can fix back what you‚Äôve destroyed. Republicans always do a terrible job when in control of office. Trump destroyed this country trying to undo everything Obama built. Crime boss bunker boy Trump is no good for Americans.  #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots
I believe it was Obama who ridiculed Mitt, during a debate, about ‚Äò80s foreign policy. Yeah, Putin just wants the best for his European neighbors. You sound like‚Äù ‚Äúflexible after the election... lead from behind Obama.‚Äù Fact is, Trump also wants to lead from behind.
Has been n always will b FUCK DONALD TRUMP
Lol Trump came to Midland.... he has fueled the racists in West Texas.
just a thought, i don‚Äôt know how it works, but when polling people call and ask if i‚Äôm voting for trump or biden in november... and i say trump... and if we all say trump... will he not advertise as much? then we can vote biden and chuckle to ourselves?
not wearing a trump 2020 mask to the mall, not thatüò∑üò∑
Did this trick just state, "the opportunists who use my family name to advance themselves?" as the hardest thing about being First Lady? The woman who sold her body to Trump for money and a green card? Look closely, you can see dollar signs in her eyes on her wedding day. Please.
How does this group and other WS groups have a leader but Antifa which trump is trying to claim it‚Äôs a terrorist group, doesn‚Äôt have a leader or monthly meetings. I haven‚Äôt seen any notifications.
It‚Äôs not just vote with the Democrats, it heretical to voice any viewpoint that Trump supported yesterday, but opposes today. He brought them all inline on tariffs. No dissent is allowed!
Hey, I‚Äôd love some internet friends to talk to! If you have any of these interests/traits please feel free to dm ‚ò∫Ô∏è -like art -are lgbtq+ -support BLM -hate trump - old white men make you uncomfortable üò£   I‚Äôm open to anyone regardless of these, and please no hate ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Trump doesn't need to be at the funeral services of John Lewis. He was a man that stood for the civil liberties of maligned citizens. That is obviously what Trump is not. I'm quite glad he's done away with pretentions of decency.
If Trump could realize this and even pretend to show an ounce of humanity he'd probably be a shoo in (unfortunately). Always happens after big disasters. But he just can't do it.
Because of a doctor Trump talked about that made a comment about alien DNA being used in research.
Do you support the Trump-Putin plan to withdraw US forces from Europe, or do you stand with our NATO allies?
I suppose he'll tell suburbanites they'll be wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. Just like he told those attending Trump University they'd be receiving a world class education. Those that believe his lies are children themselves.

how does trump consider antifa a terrorist group, when it‚Äôs literally just anti-fascism, but doesnt consider the KKK a terrorist group...
Your Mini-Me is already mistreating women, Trump. You taught him well. He‚Äôll eventually move past playing with Barbies and move to sex dolls when he grows up.
Trump is all corrupted!
The country is tired of trump and his racist and white supremacy executive orders!
3 million more people voted for Clinton than Trump, it shouldn't matter where they live in the country.   Stop pretending like you respect Democracy when you clearly don't understand its most basic principle.
We got your  back President Trump
What works is what trump is not vested in. Remdesivir a very good antiviral plus steroids. It is keeping ppl off the vent if they catch it in time. I‚Äôll repeat. Hydroxychloroquine at the dosage they have to give in hospital settings is NOT SAFE. We want to Cure not Kill.
Alien DNA and sex with demon spirits are 2020. Look at the bigger picture, Trump is touting the virtues of a foreign, black woman.
MJ is running to take over the Texas sentate seat current occupied by the trump brown nosing  she is a veteran, she is progressive, and she will fight for Texans. We deserve better than John Cornyn who is actively trying to dismantle the affordable care act.
I believe every word I hear from Trump!!! Plus back him forever!!
Oh no a scary anarchist! It's 2020, you should have a better understanding of what words actually mean. It's sad you are the option against Trump.
Sure he does. Just go visit  It's all laid out there along with his other plans. Make a nice contribution while you're there. Trump on the other hand has nothing except more tax-cuts for the rich.
I prefer clean air and water. I have nothing against business and jobs as long as they don't operate at the expense of the environment,  which is Trump's short-sighted goal.
ü§îwtf does clean out Portland. Marshal law. On what grounds. You were not invited in Trump
SOOO glad I‚Äôm not in midland fuck Donald trump &amp; his klan
I do but you do not. Conversely, name one good policy from Trump.
Paid for by Trump!
In Trump's mind, it is still 1952 and the suburbs is only for white people.
Trump gon put up 2014 Lebron numbers on they ass
Ditto. Gohmert is and has always been a disaster. He‚Äôs a idiot that keeps putting his head in his own as as well as Trump‚Äôs....which is where he speaks from. These people are KILLING us! #TrumpIsAKiller
If they make it controversial they keep our economy closed in if they don‚Äôt Trump wins
You have to be incredibly stupid to still believe Trump and anything he says.
Yep and they want to say Trump is the problem‚Ä¶..
So what I want to know, because this seems to fit the time profile, did DoD withdrawl them now because Trump got bored of it as he has with Corona?  We need DoD officials that will defend the constitution in the FACE of tyranny, not after the tyrant moves on.
Great question. One will be approved...it‚Äôll happen before the election. Trump will be first to tout it...I‚Äôve performed a miracle...regardless of efficacy. It would depend on who supported it, Fauci, NIH, NEJM. It‚Äôll be moot for months while essential personnel are vaccinated.
Ditto.  We're all making post-pandemic, post-Trump plans.  I want to see the new Dinosaur Hall at the Smithsonian.
Trump voted absentee he had to request the ballot Dems want to send every American a ballot with no request, big difference Joey boy
Hmmm, very interesting read and review regarding Barr, and why they thought he shouldn‚Äôt be AG from his previous years as one. Why would trump pick himü§î after reading this?
Trump retreats from The People.
If you think these idiots have the solutions our country needs I feel sorry for you. Not only do they hate Trump and anyone associated with his administration, make no mistake about it, THEY HATE THE UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA! #BarrHearing #Trump2020Landslide #Democrats
Trump has 3 family trust and each has a family investment in a Dodge &amp; Cox mutual fund, whose largest holding fund was Sanofi = the French drug maker who makes Plaquenil. ü§î but, trump IS REALLY in this for us y‚Äôall!! Woohoo!! YEAH!! üôÑplease hurry, Mr. Biden
Trump IS the GOP, and they must be defeated!
Obama was SO much better than Trump could ever dream of being. üòû
Vote Trump 2020. Get these socialist idiots out of office
Are yall really fucking comfortable with biden using the same dogwhistle as trump?
‚ÄúCalling Dr. Bombay, emergency, come right away!‚Äù (You might need to be of a certain generation to get it. )
The context is he called for the arrest of protesters and used the exact same dogwhistle trump has been using the whole time
Idk maybe everyone is too young to rem another scandal that 2 names we hear right now were also involved in, in the 1980‚Äôs and they walked away untouched. Barr and Trump, The Iran-Contra affair. Barr was AG then under Bush and Trump gave $4m to the üëÄaffair
But like fr why are both presidential candidates calling for political dissidents to be prosecuted, like wtf why would Biden propagate the same awful rhetoric trump is
Omg, yes, I despise those 3... if I was in a room with trump, Gaetz, AnD Jordan .. I‚Äôd prob have stroke arguing with them
Yeah... about that, I‚Äôll bet trump likes a ‚Äúbutt salve‚Äù heard about him and little girl‚Äôs with Epstein
Then why wasn‚Äôt trump prepared? If he was ‚Äúwarned‚Äù if the shelves were empty why didn‚Äôt he go on day one and how do we look here? Are we prepared for an epidemic?? Check, looks good. FCK. We also ‚Äúmight‚Äù have many issues he should be prepared..
Barr will choose the Electors?? How can we ensure they will cast the vote faithfully? That feels rigged already!!! If he chooses them, they all get extra money to vote against the popular and for trump, and we will have what did last time! Where CL really won but EL cast against
trump or third party
Serious question: It‚Äôs my understanding Trump owns at least two handguns. I keep thinking, given his mental illnesses, if he loses the election outright, he might kill himself.  If he did... what would be the upshot politically? Culturally?  Would his base consider him a martyr?
The ‚Äústudy‚Äù by ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù that was so widely used to smear Trump turned out to be false and rigged to make Trump look bad yet not one MSM agency retracted the info reported when ‚Äúexpert‚Äù got busted flat out lying! Wake up people!! Stop believing everything msm feeds you.
Like yeah it‚Äôs true but I also *hate* the fact that Dems are basically running Biden on ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not Trump.‚Äù They refuse to give us ANY actionable change and we‚Äôre just expected to go along bc Trump is an idiot
Would Mike Pence make a terrible President? Hell fucking yes.  Would Mike Pence be a better President than Donald Trump? Yes, but so would any inanimate object at this point
#WhyIDontLikeTrump  He's a coward who pretends to be brave who dares insult John McCain, a MAN who spent several YEARS in captivity in a foreign country. Trump hid in a bunker in the WH when he heard a crackle outside. #BunkerBoy
Bill, we all saw the video where it is already happening in NYC. We just aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs goons or yours.
Trump 2020
Awesome! Trump 2020!
#Emmys2020 #MAGA2020 Your such a LIAR!  For 30 years you appeased China and sold America out outsourcing everything. Today you are copying Trump about building America again!  Thanks but no way. YOU‚ÄôVE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE ALREADY!
I got hired to play bass at a super conservative church in denton around the 2016 election. The pastor openly said vote for trump and justified it as voting for the party not the candidate because of the GOP platform. I had to quit but I would be interested what their view is now
Only choice is President Trump üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
That‚Äôs a great picture Trump Pence 2020
Teacher: I was a reluctant Trump voter. Coronavirus is the end of my Republican identity.  via
Stop believing these dumbasses....
The numbers of COVID cases are going to come down because trump is forcing states to stop reporting cases.  Another real danger because people will believe it is safe and in reality they are going to their death. Texas reported today they were reporting differently now!
We got trump didn‚Äôt we?
So it wasn‚Äôt a police officer. That‚Äôs good, it was just a WS biker trump supporter? He loves the bikers. Recall. How many other offenses in the name of trump aka Antifa has there been at protests?
Is this how Evangelicals excuse Trump‚Äôs myriad infidelities and misogynist behaviors? Because clearly both rules &amp; police existed, and that should have deterred him.
Did they work at Trump Pizzaria?
Nope because trump asked putins help
"Hell No" I know beauty is in the eyes of the Beholder. But best beauty to be found is in the soul. With out honor and Empathy. How beautiful could your soul be. Looks fade with times. And if outer look is bad you need to have a good soul to out last it. Trump is not physically
#WhyIDontLikeTrump Because honesty is best way to be. Lies only hurt us all in the End. Trump doesn't live in reality, he is like a child always afraid of world around him. He feels by altering reality he wont feel so alone. I don't like how he holds and talks about his daughter.
Preach it Tommy Chong ü§ó if Trump wanted to be liked then he should have done right by all the people. If others never had a voice until trump then thats their own fault. Even a single marcher gets noticed.
Oh dear lord. This is what the 700 club is publishing on it‚Äôs online news as ‚ÄúAnother Expert Confirms Trump Was Right: Hydroxychloroquine Saves Lives, 'Propaganda War' Is Killing People‚Äù
Yes, I believe it, b/c there still remain some Trump supporters who also believe. Repeating the obvious is not harassment, but justified.
Cc:  Jane is a journalist looking into folks getting aggressive trump fundraising messages without signing up
IKR. A friend sent it to me this morning. She had gotten it off the Christian Broadcast News as fact. That trump was correct. I was horrified. First never heard about hiccups being a symptom,and that Hydroxychloroquine cures hiccups. If it could only cure low IQ as well.
The BLM movement started during obamas term, donyou unironically think im arguing that biden would actively support leftist direct action, because thats not my point. Trump is noticeably more antagonistic to the cause, and his rhetoric is actively McCarthyist and fascistic
Trump put us there.
What exactly is your solution if not voting in biden to remove trump, even if the only positive thing that happens is white nationalisms growth is slowed down? Im absolutely serious, what do you recommend leftists do if you font think voting trump out matters
Oh shit! Has Burgess lightened his hair to look more like Trump?  üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
You mean so they can pay what trump charges them to protect him on friggen golf trips?
Its obvious that they didn‚Äôt want him talking they just wanted to berate him and Trump I don‚Äôt  see anyone on the fence deciding to vote Democrat after watching this, just the opposite people will see it for what it is Democrats supporting socialist agenda
It was ALL planned! THIS was anything BUT a hearing my friend! Meanwhile, Biden: lying, accusing Trump constantly, fake details to reporters! All this is meant to undermine our current administration! Bunch of bull____!
Barr's testimony   Like your show   I am anti Trump for sure  However the Democrats kept cutting off Barr's answers, which makes it look like they were being unfair to him  However for Barr to say that the Coronavirus was Obama's fault, is rather dumb!  Jack F
Why do we have to hear out constant accusations towards the Trump administration, and mere hatred? They won't even let Mr. Barr have a break!? Sick!
well, nurture definitely did something to jacy since her mom and sister like that too, but for example someone in my family who is a poc used to be affiliated with a bunch of guys who were trump supporters yet their political views didn‚Äôt impact their relationship
We will get through this we will defeat trump. He will leave the White House..like it or not Nov.3rd Vote Him Out!!!!
Trump says we can‚Äôt trust CDC, remember bot?
Rant about Trump all you want, but the one and a half party dictatorship of our state would gladly let us die whether the president was liberal or conservative.
Trump is partially responsible for the situation in our state, but the main culprits are from our state govt: Abbott, Patrick, the soulless Republicans, the Democrats who never really cared; they were here before 2016 and they will be here after 2020.  #TrumpKillsTexas
says, everything Trump touches dies. That encompasses a hell of a lot, democracy, the Constitution, American citizens, including the ones in the Lone Star State. #TrumpKillsTexas
Hey! What's Trump's boot taste like? Asking for a friend
Literally when every trump supporter from cleburne posts their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù
Trump stole MAGA from Reagan anyway
Personally, I don't think Trump made America great, so the word "Keep" really bothers me and invalidates the slogan. However, "Build Back Better" sounds like a fifth-grader wrote it, which makes sense given Biden's mental capacity.  I'd give the nod to "Keep America Great."
7am received text from a friend, of same medical doc in parking lot stating she had tx 300 pts w Hydroxy. Then same friend sent me the CBN news that Trump was correct.I politely explained research&amp; please do not believe docs in a parking lot by B news. It cures hiccups is proof?
Because he is a Trump ass kisser who only wants to destroy Texas. I love my state. VOTE HIM OUT!
I agree they need to set new rules. Stay away from federal buildings. See if feds retreat to federal building! If they follow people will see the lies from Trump!
"The Fake News Media is trying to portray the Portland and Seattle ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù as wonderful, sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll."  LOL, no they are not. Another Trump delusion.
Trump thinks protesting is illegal. He thinks Twitter trends are illegal. He thinks not clapping for him is illegal.  So, just keep that in mind.
Another lie from Trump
Your beliefs are shaded by the people you associate with. The middle has always been for Trump and always will be. The only ones who are not for Trump are willfully ignorant liberals.
Most definitely photo shopped. Smoothing and softening. Truly trump is aging like preserved pickle soaked in vinegar
At that moment,in Texas, the guy in the mask was fully justified in shooting the guy in the Trump hat.   Republicans insist that‚Äôs true.
Is he mad about this?

The reason the guys trump sent in aren‚Äôt arresting people, is because they have no legal authority to do so, they could capture people and scare the he** outa of em, why they aren‚Äôt reading Miranda rights before shoving guns in people‚Äôs faces
They‚Äôve shown the before ~ actual people standing peacefully, trumps wana be‚Äôs inciting force and chaos.. Fox News then claims that‚Äôs the protestors.. wish people would stop saying the ‚Äúforces‚Äù there t federal or military, they r hired extras by trump and Eric P. $$ to dress up
My question would be.. why would trump get credit for a vaccine? He shouldn‚Äôt!! It‚Äôd be the hard work of the doctors. Trump thought this was a hoax and it would go away, if not, maybe he would‚Äôve been a smart man and started protocol for a mass infection control in Jan
Everyone is a star line up for one flew over the cuckoos nest.. trump can‚Äôt find anyone with higher standing?
Would you like to see the files case against trump, for the 13 year? I‚Äôve known about her and the 15 yr since 2015, why I never liked him. Just being friends with ALOT of weirdos pointed that out. But oddily, no one EVER called Biden out the 8 yrs he was VP ü§î
I can literally see him being like ‚Äúnope, we didn‚Äôt lose. In fact we won, yes we won this wonderful election  Biden fought long and hard but it just wasn‚Äôt enough‚Äù if he loses   What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?
This is what all companies should do with their office workers. Stop extending the timeline to return to offices by dribs and drabs. Accept that "getting back to normal" is a stupid goal until this thing is under control, which will not happen under Trump.
Lewis called Trump an illegitimate President due to the Russia hoax.  Why would an illegitimate Presidente go to his funeral?
Her own police chief is telling businesses ‚Äúyou‚Äôre on your own‚Äù They‚Äôre hand are tied. That mayor would let her city burn to spite Trump. If Trumps doing anything wrong, it‚Äôs not going hard wnough on these domestic terrorist.
The physical manifestation of Trump‚Äôs paranoia and fear.
Cornyn is up Trump's butt so far, he can't see what is best for his state.  He is an absolute disaster.
Have you seen what it looks like during a trump rally? üòÇ
I can't believe Trump thinks negative Tweets becoming popular is illegal.  I knew he was a special snowflake, but this is just...so bad.  #TrumpleThinSkin
It's reversed, I think. Outlets like Sinclair/Breitbart want to use the bad doctors to discredit all doctors.  It's a reverse cargo cult.
I‚Äôm calling on President Trump to declare Marshall law and take full advantage of our military to put down the insurrection know as antifa and BLM and any other militant group attacking our American law and order system the sooner we take this measures the less casualties act now
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised Trump hasn‚Äôt said he has COVID just to tout that medicine lol
Only big Pharma can succeed at making Trump look like the good guy:
Wonder if Mr Hinderocker is familiar with Avik Roy‚Äôs views on the GOP, racism and Donald Trump? He‚Äôs been very outspoken in the past. Roy is a very smart fellow.
I swear some of yall are as dilusional as you claim Trump is lol
Trump doesn‚Äôt care if kids are in school, he would‚Äôve made sure that little 13 yr old girl was there instead in his bedroom, .. he just wants elected. Why didn‚Äôt he say anything last April? Or may??
Interesting. Is that what they think tanks are supposed to do? Is it legitimate? Did they declare the value of their time as a political donation to Hillary? Are they prepared to pay Donald Trump‚Äôs legal expenses from day one? Are they prepared to pay for the Mueller fiasco?

We agree there has been no justice! Trump should be in jail or at least removed from office for not honoring his presidential oath of office. Trump is corrupted, a liar, immoral, and a racist!
No,  Trump will STILL receive plenty of Black votes. Remember, some slaves loved their masters more than life itself.
Absolutely. Trump is seriously trying to turn America into a police state. But the fluke that happened in 2016 isn't going to be effective in 2020 because he's managed to piss off a lot of the people that voted for him the first time. Veterans. Suburban moms.
But the guy above you said everyone was at work??? That‚Äôs odd? Are they at a trump rally or work??
I fully approve of President Trump.  I Ask for every American's Freedom: To choose to NOT be vaccinated or to be.
I‚Äôm glad John‚Äôs memorial won‚Äôt be sullied be Trump‚Äôs presence.
Funny how people keep blaming Trump for the division in the country but it‚Äôs people like this that create it. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt agree with me you can‚Äôt listen to my music‚Äù seems pretty divisive
Y‚Äôall keep praying for trump, and more people keep getting caught for crimes, maybe god is listening
I wouldn‚Äôt mind being surprised by a respectful visit by Trump to show actual contrition for his thoughts and actions.  But... I don‚Äôt see that ever happening. So best he stays the hell away.
You know who needs help with childcare... the lower income ... that‚Äôs why I hate every goddamn trump supporter. They know what they are doing
I assume this means John Lewis and Elijah Cummings will boycott Trump‚Äôs inauguration again
President Trump has said No, he will not pay respects to Rep. John Lewis while in state in the Capitol Rotunda. He said all that we need to know about his character or lack thereof.
The truth is that the legacy of liberty and freedom for all rest in the hands of Donald J Trump. His heart is now the reservoir of generations of American hero‚Äôs of all races. Democrats are a nasty cesspool of evil.
Trump Vs. Biden will be like watching a first round matchup of Wizards Vs. Hornets.
In a way it's almost nice of Trump to remind everyone that along with major regular police reform the feds need to go too
Christopher Ray is a chickenshit liberal. I can‚Äôt stand him! He‚Äôs a smug little Imitation of James Comey. He refuses to pass on information thereby slowing justice down to a crawl. He needs to be fired and I hope Trump will do that after the election. Throw him out!
No such thing as honor with a JD. The Nobel Prize Committee has long since been tainted, 80% have been won by Hasidic Jews, and Obama was a pedophile in the White House. Not exactly the standard of excellence but agree Trump is a traitor.
The Trump supporter view of Trump is so astoundingly unbelievable. I check in on an childhood friend occasionally and he's always posting things about what a great Christian Trump is. It's baffling.
People are centered on COVID19 and their family‚Äôs survival right now. Senate Republicans think that sending out $200/wk vs $600/wk for unemployment will suffice. $200/wk will barely cover groceries for a family of 4. Don‚Äôt worry Trump, the Senate will lose the Election for you.
My thought process is like, if you still support trump at this point you‚Äôre a lost cause and nothing will change your mind lmao
Yes sir, Trump‚Äôs gutless governing allows others to assume power that should NEVER be in their hands...Bill Barr, Stephen Miller, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, Steve Mnuchin, and more hold power above &amp; beyond their station. These are criminals who will do ANYTHING to stay in power
Trump is a hypocrit
The talk radio catechism and the Trump catechism are one in the same these days, and the foundation of the talk radio catechism is anger with the modern world. It's not a matter of what you get that they don't, it's a matter of you getting anything without their permission.
Here's a photographic example of  's thesis from his op-ed in USAToday: these trumpistanis are feeling empowered by rejecting know-it-all scientists. Also, that looks like assault.
And trump being a racist is definitely an opinion and a popular one. Its based off his actions and his words over the past 4 years he has been president. If Trump is not a racist... the majority of his followers surely are...
And trump was supposed to be our ‚ÄúFixer‚Äù. He seems to have too many Fixers. Only those in a crime family or are extremely corrupt have a ‚ÄúFixer‚Äù

Melania Trump to Announce Plan to Revamp White House Rose Garden   Heard she is going to put in poison ivy or oleander.
Exactly. Journalists need more assertiveness with both Trump and his lie-bots, Kellyanne and McEnany.
Trump is incapable of shame. If that were in his repertoire of feelings, all of his moral turpitude would have melted him into a greasy little puddle by now
Exactly! It's insane that they have the audacity to be ignorant to trump's faults in his presidency. They all treat him as if he was god sent. I remain an independent and not belonging to any party. I hope after this people will focus on presidential ideals than party ideals.

President Trump, have you been compromised? Does someone have dirt on you and is willing to release it to the public if you don't push this Covid-19 bullcrap? I am a republican and voted for you in 2016 but I am having a real hard time supporting your of late.

Who cares about trump? You use him as a cop out when you know you have no science or fact on your side.  Why do you not care about science or truth??? What has gone so wrong that you have lost your mind &amp; left reality behind? Why do you let yourself be so gullible?
, Trump is not making a joke. He serious and you‚Äôll go along with him. A leader should NEVER JOKE about elections. You‚Äôre excuse is pathetic just like you. Vote

Wrong. That was in 2006 and he was cancer free in 2007. That‚Äôs 13 years ago. Ignorance, stupidity, idiocy and Trump killed Cain. And by not wearing a mask Cain is responsible for causing others to not wear masks and dying. Republicans are gullible, stupid, selfish people.
Of course you don't see any outrageous claims.üôÑ  That's what makes it impossible to have any kind of serious discussion with you. Better to stop here than waste anymore time.  BTW, if you're talking about trump, he's done outrageous on a daily basis, so don't even start.ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The GDP is down 33%. The worst since 1947. What policies has Trump and the Republicans enacted again that actually work?
Now if only he was a little smarter to wear a mask and not support trump, he‚Äôd still be here:)
I will be voting in person for  I don‚Äôt care how long the line is I will vote. I don‚Äôt first USPS any longer. I don‚Äôt trust Trump or anyone appointed my Trump.
Trump failed him. His republican party faild him. Conspiracy theorists failed him. The KKKult45 failed him. The country did not fail him. Get that straight
If you tweet about Trump's tweets but remain silent on despicable people like this, you are a hack and just as miserable and insufferable as this trash human is.
Cain's tweet right before Tulsa rally: ‚ÄúMasks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!‚Äù
Herman Cain has died from Covid-19 which he got at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Rally. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask.
I am waiting for the next modification to social distancing and wearing a mask. Possible modifications: 1. You can remove your mask while trash talking about Trump. 2. You can shorten your distance if you are trash talking about Trump, (keeping mask on is optional, see 1)
Eh.  That‚Äôs just him blindsided mid-testimony by an irrational Trump Tweet.
Will Trump attend his funeral or will the Cain family forbid it?
Rename Rikers.  Trump Family Prison.
Because Trump told the Antifa and BLM idiots to riot and spread the virus. Also, blame the idiots partying on July 4th. Considering the total US population, this number isn't bad at all. Roughly 1% if the total population. Do your math, before you open your piehole.
I hate Trump more everyday. I don‚Äôt usually hate a person. It takes a lot to make me hate you.
Anyone who touts their IQ is a tool.  You're simply trying to buy credibility just like trump with his cognitive test.
Trump suggesting we delay the election this fall is something Frank Underwood would have done. You can‚Äôt make this shit up.
Too bad she spent so many months pandering to Trump....maybe people would listen to her
I called this yesterday. Trump will also declare martial law and himself President for life. It's coming....
Trump's Brown Shirts in their own words.
Awesomeness!! 12s up
Just do it Trump congress won‚Äôt
It looks like it was passed and signed into law.
Putin in Trump's ear is bad for USA.
Great move Trump
She's right. Pulling the troops out of Germany at the cost of billions is a gift to Putin. If a WW breaks out befor 11/3, Trump will declare marshall law, cancel the election and deploy federal troops all over the country. Declare himself dictator and democracy dies.
Yes we are all screwed! Trump is our only hope, Trump 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Trump and U.S. COVID-19 Cases: A Timeline | NowThis  via
I will use a bit of common sense.  Epstein has the dirt on many.  Almost all are Democrats. They killed him,  because he would have the dirt on them all.  Here's the piece,  so if this dirt existed on Trump,  they would have included it,  and successfully impeached the man.
You can have your own opinions but you can't have your own facts.
President Trump‚Äôs policies and leadership has done so much for AMERICAN families and USA as a country, we will #VoteForTrump again! #Trump2020 is a must ! Democrats are rioters &amp; looters, politicians justify destroying our neighborhoods! What common sense person will want that?
Dude it‚Äôs the Examiner. It‚Äôs a Murdoch owned rag. Of course it favors Trump and Republicans. Try a reputable news site next time.
This makes no sense at all. Taking troops out of Germany and putting them in countries who pay even less to NATO. Putin tells Trump to do it and he does it.
‚ÄòTrump‚Äô is a losing monopoly
Sure thing Louie...now tell me why the taxpayers should pay your medical expenses...If Trump wants to shield businesses then shouldn‚Äôt taxpayers be shielded from what your hatred of science has caused.
37% is NOT MOST OF AMERICA. I guess you took math at Trump University.
He wouldn‚Äôt have gotten tested this early if hadn‚Äôt been scheduled to fly with Trump.
The racist Trump is saying no POC can live in white neighborhoods as long as he is POTUS.
Who owns stock? Trump? Ivanka and Jared? What Republicans? Loeffler? Perdue?
But Trumpers are sending our tax dollars more and more to church schools...is that OK? Are church schools allowed to close and still get money? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they didn‚Äôt manage to get even more money like Trump and DeVoss want if public school money is pulled.
Just more evidence of how right wingers hate science. They refuse to believe anythung they can‚Äôt control or blame. Trump claims he knows more about epidemiology than anyone else and Paxton is just dismissive of any scientific knowledge.
If I were the Kistner campaign I would simply *not* put out an internal poll showing me down 9 points in a Trump district üìâ
So the media and the FDA both just decided it was more important for trump to be wrong than to save lives? It‚Äôs not possibly because the drug doesn‚Äôt work at an effective enough level (or at all) to be worth the risks?  What is your tinfoil budget? $400? $500 a month?
Dems hate this drug they know it will save life‚Äôs and it will make Trump re-elected
How much stock does Trump own in Kodak? How many Republicans own stock in Kodak? Final question, who stock did Loeffler dump to buy stock in Kodak?
Dems=hate=bullies=suppression=loss of Freedom vote TRUMP 2020
There is no"safely return to work" while the plague rages on.The GOP/Trump's failed policies, ignoring of science and experts has landed us here Ted. You doubling down on that tells us all we need to know.The masses are expendable.The donor class are all that matters. You bastard
I will be so glad when Trump loses. When he‚Äôs out, people like you go out with him.
No, dear. You are woefully uninformed. Obviously no source will convince you. Trump has lied to us, verified, over 20K times in 4 years, yet you defend him. Your allegiance is misplaced. But it is yours to give. So wear a mask and socially distance.
Right, because Antifa and BLM riots, that created the recent spike, is still  somehow Trump's fault...
To Destroy our great President Trump from being re-elected #WhiteCoatSummit
The Constitution clearly states the current potus SHALL relinqish power on January 20. Period.  So, when biden wins, no matter if trump refuses to leave the WH, trump is no longer president. We couldwrite P-R-I-S-O-N on the wall outside the WH and leave him in it.
Fk barr! He‚Äôs just a mini-trump
Twitter, Facebook Delete Viral Video Promoted By Trump On COVID-19 And Hydroxychloroquine
and while you're there look at all the videos of Biden and Hunter and how they made millions and millions off of the American people - TRUMP 2020
And lies just as much as Trump and you.
You don‚Äôt really mean what you just tweeted. You‚Äôre just trying to be politically correct. Try to score points for Trump and the Republicans. It won‚Äôt work.
The ‚Äúmedia‚Äù will lose the election?.....  Every one wants Americans back to work and schools open, but if it can‚Äôt be done safely then it can‚Äôt be done.  Pretty simple when you take your desire to support/defend trump out of it.
Nor Florida. DeSantis isn't allowing a true accounting and Trump is preventing the CDC from receiving the statistics from hospitals. Why is that do you suppose?
People LOST their jobs by NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. They lost these jobs because of the INCOMPETENCE OF TRUMP and the Republicans REFUSAL TO REMOVE AN INCOMPETENT LEADER. No waiter or waitress wants to work for 2.13 an hour plus tips. There are no tips right now. Business is down.
Did he deny responsibility like Trump does?
Stella Immanuel, Trump‚Äôs New COVID-19 Doctor, Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine ‚Å¶ re-tweeted this nut job, his Dr.
If you support Trump supporters üñïüèæU and Block me now.
He‚Äôs smug, prone to panic (like when Trump took out Solameni) and has weird crushes on liberals. I prefer Laura Ingraham.
Funny quote: ‚ÄúSuggesting the president go on TV is like pushing against an open door,‚Äù #election2020
And let me guess, somehow it's Trump's fault.
And what's wrong with supporting  and being a Stargate fan? If this guy is a Trump supporter then be it, he's got the same right as everybody else. So it looks like you're the hypocrite
Republicans are punishing the people. We didn‚Äôt quit OUR JOBS. We weren‚Äôt fired for doing a BAD JOB. We LOST OUR JOBS because of Trump and his incompetence. We LOST OUR JOBS because Trump handled Covid-19 badly and the Republicans remain silent.
Trump's üá∫üá∏ really sucks.
It is a shame you here taking away a drug you know can save lives just because you want the left to win an election by blaming Trump the deaths, when it‚Äôs people like you. I hope you can sleep at night.
We the people don‚Äôt trust democrats who hide #Hydroxychloroquine !!! When President Trump said from day one! Shame on you all!
I wish trump would bring these doctors into the Corona Virus Task Force #coronavirus #corinavirustaskforce #StellaImmanuel
THEY REMOVE THE VIDEO BECAUSE THIS PROVES PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CORRECT AND HE WAS TRULY HELPING AMERICANS TO SAVE LIVES WHILE MEDIA, PHARMA AND FAUCI AND THE DEMOCRATS POLITICIANS HIDE FOR POLITICAL GAINS AND LET PEOPLE DIE! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
THEY REMOVE THE VIDEO BECAUSE THIS PROVES PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CORRECT AND HE WAS TRULY HELPING AMERICANS TO SAVE LIVES WHILE MEDIA, PHARMA AND FAUCI AND THE DEMOCRATS POLITICIANS HIDE FOR POLITICAL GAINS AND LET PEOPLE DIE! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
President Trump was correct from day 1. And media and Fauci made fun of him! Shame on them! #Trump2020
Yeah..and trump is an ice cream sundae????  Get a grip nina.
My friend and me say the same thing!!!!  It's like living in a blender if trump bullshit.
Trump.
What a bunch of BS and propaganda from The Fake News Network.  Living in Trump‚Äôs America, how that working for you?
If that's what you think, then you're totally clueless. This has been going on for long before Trump took over.  I guess you were just too blind and ignorant to see that.
4 more years of Trump. Say no to Creepy Joe Biden.
Trump has lied 20K+ in just over 4 years. What ever he has on you, it must be career ending.
Ummmm ... yeah, they‚Äôre on YOUR side. And if people are stupid enough to vote for Joe Biden this will CONTINUe. Trump is taking out the Antifa trash.
It is the truth and you trying to say the opposite is evil! So many people have died because of ppl like you lying about #Hydroxychloroquine ! Shame on you and all left! Just to hurt #Trump you killed people!
#POTUS #TRUMP SAID FROM DAY 1 #Hydroxychloroquine SAVE LIVES and DEMOCRATS and MSM promoted the opposite just to hurt our economy! SHAME ON YOU ALL!
No I won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt trust Trump at all.üò≥
This is the task heath force for cover Trump needs not Fauci!
Trump is coming to visit an oil rig but not the Covid-19 ravaged RGV which was recently hit by Hurricane Hannah.
So, in other words, Trump can't handle a crisis. We all knew that would be the case.
Of course Trump won‚Äôt go and we all know why.
Good. He has no business there. Trump is the antithesis of everything good and right about the honorable John Lewis.
He'll probably call himself "forced out" and birth a group of "trumpians" who are "real Americans" who's goal is to live to his ideals and put him back in power, meanwhile trump will likely be on his beach in Florida tweeting about injustice and how America will crumble alone.
It will be tacky. Everything the Trump‚Äôs do is tacky.
Imagine being a coward like Marco. Afraid of an old man like Trump. Shame on Marco.
Every time Trump says something nasty, which is multiple times a day, you‚Äôll condemn him? Speak out against him? üôÑ
You‚Äôre so delusional, first you blame Trump a man that has nothing to do with Pharmaceutical s contrary to the democrats who receive billions from pharmaceuticals as campaigns contributions! Second the policies of the democrats literally destroys USA economy not Trump!
Liar. You want folks to sacrifice their lives for the stock market. Your god is pissed at you Ted. Oh and by the way, when can we expect Trump to address the bounties on US service members heads? Ever?
A&amp;M didn‚Äôt leave bc we needed tu‚Äôs $.  The last straw I believe the LH network was the final straw in what most considered narcissist &amp; greedy.  The SEC shares it‚Äôs network &amp; revenue between all schools.  It just feels good, think about it! Everything Trump does is for others.
Hey Ted.....it's been 30 days and still not a word from Trump about Putin's paying for the assassination of our US service members. What gives? You don't care or what?
Bounties.  Covid. Unemployment. Treason. Trump.
Let's see Trump go on  Rachel Maddow's show.
Let's start by asking candidates about their own personal actions, teddy.  Like tRump's response to Putin's bounties on American soldiers' lives.  Traitorous and deprived.
Shocked it‚Äôs taken this long to be discussed.  UBI was a given the moment Trump went stimulus instead of ceases all tax payments for a year.
Yes, definitely. History is on Trump‚Äôs side. Americans tend to like incumbent Presidents to remain in office. Biden is in the mold of Dole, Kerry or Romney who tried and failed to unseat a popular President. Trump‚Äôs on par with Obama eight years ago. I think he‚Äôll win easily.
Oh pleaaaassssse... Trump is inciting? LOL
I don‚Äôt support either. But here we are with still no answer from a trump supporter on why you support him, the same goes for Trump, just openly a pedophile and people are considering voting for himü§°
Without Trump we would not be America anymore
I just don‚Äôt want to see y‚Äôall giving them ammunition against you like that. I personally believe the spike is from all the idiot Trump supporters who don‚Äôt wear a damn mask but they ARE  blaming the protesters on their threads. I don‚Äôt want protesters blamed!
Trump all the way
Riots? GTFO. The TRUMP GESTAPO is hurting protesters and NAZIS LIKE YOU APPROVE OF IT! Shame on you.
You can‚Äôt bitch about silencing whistleblowers when Trump does it all the time and you remain silent.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Exactly. We have to vote out Trump and those who enable him. I will never understand why 90% support him and why they‚Äôre so full of hate.
GET RUSSIA and CHINA OUT OF OUR ELECTIONS !! trump wants to win by getting help from russia and China because he can win NO OTHER WAY
If I see on Snapchat that y‚Äôall are hanging out with multiple friends that don‚Äôt live in your household in the middle of a worsening global pandemic, I‚Äôm just gonna assume you‚Äôre a Trump supporter because you‚Äôre either ignorant by choice or you don‚Äôt care about human life.
Trump supporters. Are they all just stupid?
Maybe they should GTFO of Portland, stop gassing people and shooting rubber bullets at them. Stop kidnapping them off the streets. The Trump gestapo is the problem.
Take it,  Please take it! And share it with the Trump fan club! Please!
By giving the Medal of Freedom to the racist Limbaugh. The Liar in Cheif has rendered it a CrackerJack prize now. My gawd Trump is a vulgar clown.
Love her. We need more leaders like her and less like Trump.
This is a joke, right? Trump is a criminal. A mob boss. The only hope lies in us voting him out of office 100 days from now.
Republicans act like the extra 600 a week is too much. Many lost health insurance. Paying into COBRA is expensive. Trump won‚Äôt open the ACA exchange. I guess they what people to die. Go hungry.
Trump needs to send in more feds to deal with those scumbags protesters.
Another example of the Trump Party motto....‚ÄùAll for Me..None for Thee‚Äù. You must have lots of mirrors in your life so you can always be with the only one you care about.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Let's be clear, the deployment of Trump's Gestapo is a political gamble the Naked Emperor is losing.
Go f yourself. You're golfing with Trump while Americans DIE? You're a POS too!
I have a Trump joke.  That's 5 words.
Bunker Boy? You mean Biden right? Trump has been traveling around the country. He was in Rapid City, SD recently at Mt. Rushmore for Independence Day. Maybe you saw that. He also spoke in Oklahoma. Where has Biden traveled to?

Here's something pretty cool: In one week, Mary Trump's book "Too Much and Never Enough" sold more hardcover copies than "The Art of the Deal" has in the 33 years since it was published. 11:11 AM ¬∑ Jul 23, 2020
I‚Äôm sure Trump‚Äôs deal was better. He simply removed barriers from purchasing US prescription drugs from Canada and other places. He didn‚Äôt CONTROL the prices. He reduced red tape and allowed market forces to truly work. America has been subsidizing the world for a LONG TIME.
So Joe Biden (richer than average American) is going to hell too? Pretty sure God judges us by our actions. Trump paid off the mortgage of a family who helped him when his car broke down. Trump regularly handed out $100 bills to his hotel staff. Didn‚Äôt have to run for president.
Obviously prayer is foreign to you. You pray TO Jesus. No one is praying to Trump. LOL
When the WH is opened to tours and Trump resumes his rallies, we`ll talk about it.
Bullshit. Trump did notning more than sign pieces of useless paper.
It's time to find out who these individuals actually are and out them publicly. Show their faces and name their names. The country has the right to know who Trump's Brown shirts are.
Never Trump zealots think that if Biden wins the GOP will suddenly re-embrace them and liberalize.   It‚Äôs not going to happen. We‚Äôre not going back to the pre-Trump consensus and we‚Äôre certainly not handing the keys of the party back to the people who betrayed it.
You are just plain sick!  Trump ‚Äúselfless ‚Äú?!!! You believe THAT and you are plain looney!!  It‚Äôs just indecent to say that!
You think trump isn‚Äôt serious?

Jeff get off the drugs. What your obsession of bashing Trump on the head. We already know you were under the desk shining Obama balls in the Oval Office and you can‚Äôt wait to do the same thing for Biden if he wins.
Yes: I think his campaign manager has a lot of work to do to corral Trumps mouth &amp; thumbs &amp; do serious damage control.  Trump had us on our way, then C19 followed by BLM Riots.  Biden represents the riots, that would be our entire country if he got elected.  Scary thought!
This is why they served(unlike Trump and almost all in his administration) to protect free spoech and the right to protest.

Make no mistake friends.Trump's messaging waiver on Coronavirus has nothing to do with the mounting deaths. It's his sinking poll numbers.He still could care less if you live or die as long as he retains power.Deeds not wordsThe tRump Virus is responsible for Killing Americans!
So fall in line and hope they don't fuck us over next time cuz Trump bad. If we don't push back and hold them accountable they're always going to use this same situation to blackmail us into voting for their shitty corporatist candidates.
where's the photo of BillClinton? He's mentioned directly in the docs, Trump is not.  Nice distraction. But it's not going to work.   Mueller was the head of the FBI that knew, and ignored these child victims. Comey as well.   All during the Bush &amp; Obama administrations.  ü§î

Very interesting how this move comes days after trump said he had a call with Putin.   Either way, US troops in allied nations are for strategic purposes and quick responses, not for protection.   This move will once again hinder the US if a matter were to arise in the East.
If the Republicans keep lame ducking it, I'm not going to cast a vote. Today's hearing, along with a few more political disappointments from them has me questioning my choices. 30y Republican voter. I proudly voted for Trump, was considering it in 2020, but now. Fence sitting.

With Bush v. Gore, there was not time to prep a legal team when the Republicans worked to steal that election. We know what's going to happen when Trump loses. Joe needs to be rallying teams of lawyers from every state that are ready to fight.
Trump won‚Äôt try to delay the Election. He talking when he mentions delaying it. You won‚Äôt have to worry about Trump after 2024#ABC
Obama was responsible for the death of Osama bin Laden, so I disagree that he let ISIS thrive. The world we are living in now is pure chaos. I am by no means an Obama fan, but things under Trump have never been worse.

Trump wants to delay the Nov. 3 election. Looks to me somebody just realized he don't have a prayer. Trying to extend his rule of "King Trump" .  Better keep an eye on him now. He's getting desperate now. Lie, cheat, steal, bribe, kidnap important families. What ever it takes

Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.üôÑ
trump is just playing along with the crazies who want to shut it all down, hide in our closets, and hope the world works out.  He floated the idea that takes their lockdown logic to the extreme of actually canceling the elections.  Its a great move, politically.
I admit that since Trump is so public, it wouldn't be easy, but it has been done before:

Look, I'm going to be brutally honest here.  I don't care if you are a staunch Republican at this point.  I don't even care if you initially voted for Trump (I don't like it very much, but...).  If you are voting against Trump and the current ass-kissers in the White House, okay.
Okay, I've made a decision.  I'm going to stop blaming everything on #Trump.  Yes, he is the #asshat that leads them, everyone currently working in #TheWhiteHouse is complicit, therefore they are ALL to blame.  So, from now on, I will be saying "The White House" did this or that.

Swalwell to Trump, Republicans: Stop Being ‚ÄòSelfish‚Äô ‚Äî Just ‚ÄòWear a Damn Mask.‚Äô Believe me, if I saw you coming, I‚Äôd not only wear a mask, I‚Äôd have a clothespin on my nose. Stinky!   #MAGA2020
I guess that when the Federal govt. files suit against Donald Trump and his father,  in Federal Court in New York for discriminating against the black renters of their property in Brooklyn,  and they had to settle out of court, the Government just got lucky.
Because Biden just sees women as objects! He has no remorse for sexually assaulting  or touching little girls inappropriately. If you vote for Trump or Biden, you endorse that behavior.

Imagine Trump stepping out of Air Force One at Goodfellow AFB with his mask off like Future. He's literally the epitome of Future's song. Think about it, he's been chasing checks his whole life. Trump has that plug walk like Rich The Kid.

It‚Äôs kindof a shitty narrative that Trump enacted the Right to Try for medicines. Yet there‚Äôs liberal run states trying to ban Hydroxychloroquine. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt work.

After YOU responded to OUR conversation which hadn't included you, interjecting "white fragility "  I responded nicely, recommended some even better books for you.  Don't appreciate "you people", WHOEVER you think you are referring to.  Calm down and relax. Have a great day.

Trump sexually assaulted women, you did too
But you'll notice that unlike Fauci or Cuomo, Trump NEVER admits he made a mistake and works to correct it.  So he's either flawlessly perfect in all things,  Or a delusional malignant narcissist. Or just very lucky so far...
Love the statement followed by hannity and Ingraham tags.  Who is making this political? Got that Trump meet up yet?  And why not release some of your patient records.  Redact names. You are advertising to people "with flu like symptoms" and calling it covid. COVID TESTS????
You support Trump and call yourself a Christian?  My mind can't twist that far
Thank you for today's dose of common sense.

Last thought. Fauci acknowledges errors (not lies) and corrects Cuomo notes mistakes, examines, adjusts  When did you last hear Trump admit he made a mistake? ABOUT ANYTHING? Always fake news, deep state, enemies. Nothing about that worries you? He NEVER admits an error?  NEVER??

If you vote for Biden: you promote sexually assaulting women and inappropriately touching kids. Biden is the Dems version of Trump. If you vote for Trump you promote sexually assaulting women and rape.

Last I looked most of our mass shootings in America were by white men quoting President Trump and White Supremacists. Get the facts and prove me wrong. So are all Christians bad? Of course not! But by your logic "you just can't tell"...
Under Trump we already are, with high death rates, overwhelmed hospitals, federal soldiers in the streets fighting citizens, threats to not respect an election, and the rest of the world building "walls" to keep Americans from entering their countries. Feeling GREAT yet??
Now to see the Trump supporters try to portray these peaceful, diverse, committed moms, dads, vets, young, and old as "rioting thugs". Amazing, truly inspiring

Why do I need to hide? I don‚Äôt fear any of these Twitter phonies. I don‚Äôt endorse trump or Biden. We need a younger government who knows what‚Äôs going on.
I‚Äôd vote for Koko over Trump and Biden
Right. I‚Äôm clueless. All these years in politics and she hasn‚Äôt done shit. She‚Äôs no better than Trump.
I never said Trump was innocent, he needs to go too. But Biden is exactly like he is. If you endorse Biden or Trump, you endorse sexual assault on women and children.

Well again, I‚Äôm not arguing the fact that Trump won. As far as a re-election goes, 3/4 presidents that lost the popular vote were not re-elected for a second term. History doesn‚Äôt look bright for Trump.
I‚Äôm not doubting the fact that Trump won the election you dunce. I‚Äôm stating that the information in the meme is horrendously wrong. Spreading fake information and trying to pass it as facts is what causes such a divide in society. Fact check your stuff before you post it. üôÑ
Wait wait wait, we already discussed that the left isn‚Äôt the minority. Again, 72 million Americans didn‚Äôt vote for Trump, almost 9 million more than those that did. Trump supporters are the minority.
This IS Trump's America
A President swears to ‚ÄúProtect this country and its citizens from all enemies, foreign and domestic.‚Äù Mr. Cal Thomas (2003) once seemed to conjoin the power to spy, wage war, and torture with the President‚Äôs Oath to protect us.   Now, Trump is protecting us from us. Anything goes
If you look in previous tweets, I‚Äôm well aware of what the electoral college is. Again, I‚Äôm only providing evidence that majority of voters didn‚Äôt vote for Trump.
Over 72 million Americans didn‚Äôt vote for Trump while less than 63 million did. By definition, this makes Trump supporters the minority.
I mean you could literally google 2016 Presidential Election and it‚Äôll show you the results. But here‚Äôs the chart if you really need to see it. She won the total vote by 2.1%. I‚Äôm simply stating facts that the people that voted for Trump are the minority of America.
There‚Äôs nothing to argue. I didn‚Äôt bring up Trump once. I‚Äôm not arguing Trump.
I‚Äôm aware of how the electoral college works. I‚Äôm simply stating that the majority of American voters didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. That is a fact. Another fact is that the president that loses the popular vote has only won the presidency 5 times. 1/2
Can you prove that they cheated? I‚Äôm just simply looking at facts. Facts show that Hillary won the majority vote from American voters by 2.1%. By definition, Trump supporters have always been the minority.
For real, we have to remember that the majority of voters in 2016 didn‚Äôt even vote for Trump. His supporters act like 90% of America backs him.
Yo, Trump supporters, don't worry about wearing masks!  They are just damn, dirty libtards supporting the masks!  Who cares if you drop dead???

I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump‚Äôs got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That‚Äôs...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump‚Äôs saying there‚Äôd be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don‚Äôt even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...

Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally
The fact that Trump is again moving to end DACA in the middle of a pandemic is no coincidence. He's used the cover of the pandemic to go around Congress &amp; the courts to enact a white supremacist wishlist of anti-immigrant polices that separate families, gut asylum protections.
Media will take the bait, and Trump knows this. It distracts from the GDP numbers and COVID deaths  Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not calculating a way to weaponize the FEC

Okay I‚Äôll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, ‚Äúwhether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.‚Äù Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one‚Äôs own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.

Oh my God. Did he tell everyone that he got it at a Trump rally where everyone was discouraged from wearing masks? A rally that never should have happened in the first place? That every doctor said was a bad idea? Thought not.

Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?
Trump
Absolutely, and one of the many reasons Trump perpetually tries to disparage Obama - a bitter, jealous, resentful and pathetic man who cannot hope to ever come close to demonstrating the class and character of the President who preceded him.
Trump's promise of lofty GDP growth post tax cuts passed Dec 2017 were BS.  Only 1Q 2018 did GDP growth exceed 3%, has averaged 2.2% 2Q18 thru 4Q19 pre pandemic, and now -5% 1Q2020 and a record -32.9% 2Q2020 (a record low)!  Vote him out!!!
Pompous Pompeo as usual, blowing smoke up everyone's **s!  Attributing an authority to a corrupt and unscrupulous AG which he clearly does not possess.  Trump and his debased administration are desperate and think nothing of violating and skirting the Rule of Law.

How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
If damning information could disqualify someone, then Trump should have never ran and he should have been removed. People are going to bash KDH, but we got her if Biden does the right thing. #BidenHarris2020
Regardless of the perpetrators, Trump is trying to stop the violence while local governments are enabling it.
Trump‚Äôs attempts at sincerity remind me of Pitt football injuries. (If you get this, we can be friends.)
Watching the  documentary on  and it just makes me so sad that she's not our President. She's not perfect, but i have no doubt we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now due to Trump being completely incompetent.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won‚Äôt oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.
Donald Trump is directly responsible for the death of Herman Cain.
Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs playbook:  Economy report is a disaster, let‚Äôs tweet out some crazy shit.

If President Trump hadn‚Äôt held his rally in Tulsa or if he had demanded and modeled the wearing of a mask, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn‚Äôt wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
Sad. Oh well. He gambled with his life and lost big. My condolences to his family. trump is culpable.

Exactly zero surprise that Trump is trying to delay the election.  Exactly ZERO.  He's not gonna go without getting physically frogmarched out of office.
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I‚Äôd agree with you. Trump doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about Federal law, so don‚Äôt act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It‚Äôs his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England‚Äôs survival depends on it.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election ‚Äî But Congress Sets the Date

Make no mistake. This is Trump's version of "There goes the neighborhood".
No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.
So it begins.
In the past 20 years, over 250 million votes have been cast by mail. Meanwhile, there have only been 143 criminal convictions for mail-in voter fraud. Trump is absolutely trying to undermine the election with fearmongering and misinformation.

Trump has decimated international education. For the thousands of people who have made a career out of this until now, we liked America better before he tried to make it ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù

you LIBERAL , so glad u are not my Gov. Letting people destroy stuff. TRUMP #1
No, you grow up, &amp; I‚Äôm just being ‚Äúdirect‚Äù, here   seems to ask all black Republican guests he interviews, if they were PAID to vote for Trump. He asked  a life-long Democrat, civil rights atty, the same condescending, BS question. It is beyond racist‚úîÔ∏è

Regardless of who is behind the violence Trump is trying to stomp out violence in these cities while local governments are throwing fits. It‚Äôs a losing battle for leftists regardless.
Fauci hasn‚Äôt been consistent nor has he been credible. Trump wanted to close the borders in February to prevent spread and was called a xenophobe but democrats.
I‚Äôm not sure the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre actually secret white supremacist instigators‚Äù argument for the violence in Portland is the right way to go for Democrats.  Even if true, that means Trump is doing everything he can to stomp out white nationalists while local government does nothing.
Why does the right constantly give the left a voice?  PLEASE explain??  Can we not just do our own thing and dictate what we want and control the narrative? You are giving these people cred.  Shut them up like Trump does.  Follow his lead.  #Trump2020
Germany is literally buying Putin's oil. How is Trump doing his bidding?
Sleepy Joe is in the basement and getting votes by staying there. Trump is everywhere and losing. The mishandling of the pandemic and out of touch with reality, the opposite of campaign 4 years earlier. Hillary did the same in 2016.
Sleepy Joe got everything his way. Trump mishandling of the pandemic will lose the 2020 election. JR got masked and duck taped on Twitter. Going in the wrong direction.
I think this is an occasion perfect for Trump‚Äôs Right To Try order.
Trump inherited Great Obama economy but botched the response to the pandemic and #150000dead so far and #32MillionUnemployment #COVIDSurging #TrumpDepression #PutinPuppet #BenedictDonald #RussianAsset

Trump administration to send federal agents to Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee
A two party system is stupid asf. Both sides are pedophiles and neither side really give a fuck. Atleast the unemployment rates for minority communities has fallen drastically under trump. That‚Äôs really the only thing that gives him a leg up on Biden
Unfortunately it appears that Trump is concerned only with re-election.
One has to ask, does Putin even give Trump a reach around or is Trump just so happy to be his bitch he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt raise the subject‚Äù with him?

Who's side are you on
Trump dumped the plans for a new building in the suburbs.
Nadler needs to go. He helped Barr and Trump yesterday.
Trump is a badass and could have taken on the liberal pussies in the street, but he didn't want to put any of the Secret Service agents in harm's way. He's kinda awesome that way.
Trump is a sleazy person. It's laughable to say he's not the swamp hell he built it. And feed it with the Republican tax cut that only rich folk benefited from. No one from the middle class benefited from it. Trump is the monster from red lagoon.
Notice how LIBERAL YAHOO has taken away the comment section on yahoo...they don't want to hear the truth from the people. TRUMP # 1
Not much of an "investigation" when Barr couldn't say a word. You CANNOT get anything to use against him when he is not allowed to talk. Our Party needs to fire these buffoons we've elected and start from the ground-up, starting with Nadler. This has helped Barr and Trump.
To some the issue of #bounties is #fakenews, to others of us, it's real and is despicable.
What did I miss? Oh , Trump trumping again.
Democrat friends are outraged at this as much as I am. Some have already said they are voting for Trump while others are considering it. This may be just what the Far Left wants but rank-and-file Democrats are appalled.
Just so everyone is clear! Kill all Jews is fine with Twitter, but Trump says something they don‚Äôt agree with, censor! Why do they have certain protections at Twitter, Facebook?
You gotta hand it to the Dems on the committee. They had a plan and they stuck to it. They wanted to give their media friends plenty of sound bites of them verbally attacking Barr and showing their disdain for Trump while preventing Barr any room to testify
I spent a full minute trying to figure out how this was a political protest message against Donald Trump. It hadn't occurred to me it was purely a supportive gesture for the sitting president.  Not awesome.
He's good at this because he has the right experience and expertise to lead this nation out of the giant hole Donald Trump and his ilk have dug for us. We are sinking fast and need Joe Biden now more than ever.

stand by while  an obvious Russian asset does nothing to defend our troops as Putin is putting boutiesvon our troops heads! This veteran says it‚Äôs time to hold Trump accountable!
Trump is a WEAK man. He lacks courage and integrity to protect this country. #VoteHimOut
refuses to acknowledge that Trump failure at pandemic response! He voted 12 times to not even hear evidence and hold a Trump accountable and now stands by as Texans die due to incompetence. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Republicans already put into place Opportunity Zones that led to record unemployment for Black and Brown communities. Biden not offering anything new, he‚Äôs just pandering for votes using Trump‚Äôs ideas
#WhyIDontLikeTrump  #tRump wants the riots, he wants the Federal Police and he wants fear - so that he can present himself as the "President of Law and Order". In order to win the elections, every means is right for him. He and his  enablers are a threat to our democracy.
That‚Äôs interesting, Trump already did this with Oppotunity Zones. So you continue to offer Zero new ideas, just piggybacking on other successful programs to pander for votes
Now show a white trump supporter in a black neighborhood.  The reactions Would not stop at harsh words.
Lock Trump up!
Just one problem.  Greeks sexual preference of children back in ancient history has followed them to our century.  Trump hinted at the "oldest" human trafficking organization.  Tom Hanks verified it. Ain't no mountain high enough.....  We'll get them ALL. BHO
I‚Äôm visiting my elderly mother in Wisconsin.  She and all of her neighbors believe all of this bullshit.  It should be a crime.  They think everything is fine and they are all in their 80s and believe the masks are there to harm them.  Trump signs everywhere.
Obama is as good as we got. Bush Sr, Jr outside the wars decent men. Can't say that about Trump.
I'm sorry. Donald Trump cares nothing about the people or parts of this country that don't serve his political agenda. Something I would never say about Bush Sr or Jr, Reagan or even Nixon. Trump is a unique beast, and he has destroyed so much of this nation's fabric
Trump and his family have made $32m on Tax payers. Obama has created more jobs that Trump. Did you know since 2017 none of Trump economic years has topped Obama? I can provide sources if need be.
I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
Again, I don't practice in conspiracy. What I do know is Comey, Hillary, Obama are all free. Trump, Barr have the power. Barr has activity been a bad AG - but they have nothing. Trump is scared as crap about Manhattan tax case because if he loses jail is possible.
Well my view is that Trump has not been good for America. He uses the divisions as a political maneuver. I hope the country makes a change and we at least can put President Trump into the history books. We need both parties to function correctly. But at the moment the GOP is mia
I think that is justified only because how Trump vilified Media and good journalists. You reap what you sow and he has sowed discourse since he came down that esculator.
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
Like Fox News? Again I traffic in facts not conspiracy. The media reports what President Trump says. I have seen CNN report what Trump says and have seen the same video on Fox News. CNN didn't doctor the video they just report on his actions. And I make the final judgment.
I agree with them. President Trump at his core is not a good person. He does have these views and values and you can simply roll back the tape since he's been President. His ban had nothing to do with a systematic approach to controlling the outbreak, it's him and his team biases
Well I don't peddle in conspiracy theory. I traffic in facts. President Trump dismissed this virus back in December and continued to do so all the way until April. So I place blame and responsibility where it's due - however you have the right the believe what you chose.
#1 -This has to be on top of the list of people to indict. #2- Reverse Pardon on Roger Stone and get him in prison #3 - Michael Flynn, for the ‚ù§Ô∏èof god get this guy in jail  Top dog - Arrest Trump and charge him with all the items in Mueller report plus all the extras
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Donald Trump withstands news conferences, without a pre-approved list of sympathetic reporters, teleprompters, &amp; without an advance list of questions‚úîÔ∏è  He was interviewed by Chris Wallace, &amp; answer tough questions‚úîÔ∏è  You should be able to, as well‚úîÔ∏è Time to DEBATE TRUMP‚úîÔ∏è
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Considering all the laws the AG has broken its fair to assets some type of punishment. The Trump Administration and the AG had thumbed thier noise to the Dems in Congress, so I can't join you in sympathy.
We should all be watching this hydroxychloroquine narrative closely. I feel like Trump is trying to use the "I've been telling you" narrative... Dangerous human being, that man.
Something I honestly never thought I‚Äôd see on a news chiron: ‚ÄúDoc shared by Trump reportedly believes in alien DNA, demon sperm and hydroxychloroquine‚Äù. We‚Äôre doomed.
Thats funny, I recall defending trump on multiple occasions
Ima fw you later bro, you seem to only want to defend Trump at all costs and are not open to persuasion
Your argument at this point is "Trump didnt hear it" which goes against the millions of people that SOMEHOW did
Trump is back at it pressuring governors to open their states in spite of surging cases and deaths across the country. When the situation gets even more dire, will  blame the governors once again for ‚Äúopening too soon‚Äù?
You just had to bring out the ad hominen huh? Either way its impossible to debate with you because your reasoning is invalid and flawed. I respect for not just saying Trump 2020 like a dumbass though good day to you my kind sir
It‚Äôs an embarrassment. It‚Äôs a wonder that there has not been a revolt of POC who are done with our shit. Trump opened my eyes &amp; now I can‚Äôt unsee it.  I promised my 3 daughters that trump would not win.  That that wasn‚Äôt who we were. I was wrong.And if -- big if -- we manage to get Trump out of office AND avoid fracturing the country in two, it will always remain possible that it could happen here. Again.
I wonder how the Republicans are feeling. Saying that they didn‚Äôt need masks and Corona is made up and now Trump is trying to stop the election because of corona? Genuinely curious about how they feel rn.
is hiding in the bunker with Trump. And  is an idiot who cares nothing about our children, teachers, school staff or the families. If Abbott would come out of hiding and Paxton weren‚Äôt such an idiot, they would allow for distance learning.
You'd look like Trump
and what about trump not engaging Putin about Putin bounty on our Soldiers. Very disgusting and unpatriotic of an American president not looking out for the safety of the Soldiers serving in harms way

Did you turn off the tv when AXIOS reporter told trump did he bring up the Russian bounty on killing our troops and trump said he didn't  mention that Putin, question, did that make u sick to your stomach. tic toc tic toc.
Anyone else think President Trump‚Äôs tweet was designed to make the leftists shit their pants?
CNN would not promote HCQ if it were a 100% cure for Alzheimer‚Äôs if President Trump touted its effectiveness.  They cannot allow him any praise.... Orange Man Bad....always...
In the being of the pandemic I said Trump was actually doing his job when he sent out those first stimulus checks. But I take it back completely. He thought by shoving a grand in our face that we would forget about him calling the virus a democratic hoax and he delayed reaction
Project Lincoln should book this guy to take part in a video. Calabresi is now a Republican voter against Trump.
Miracles never cease. Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus  encountered Jesus. It took Calabresi just one tweet-threat from Trump to demand re-impeachment. You can only support the racism so long before you realize he's a wannabe dictator.

With the Clinton it was widely tested in blue states with illegal votes and would of won. But they did not count on the rest of the country to come out and vote for Trump like we did and did not see we where sick and tired of the Obama bull sht.

Update, 1 p.m.: President Donald Trump is meeting with the family of Spc. Vanessa Guillen now at the White House.
I read and tweeted this article on my timeline. Here's why it makes sense:  As a narcissist, he'll save face with his base by pulling an LBJ rather than face a devastating electoral loss. (To be sure, Trump isn't completely going away even if he resigns.)

That, too, isn't working. Trump isn't a student of history; he only understands media's effects to a certain extent. The visuals on his Gestapo is devastating to his polling and the GOP.

Are you aware CNN causes stupidity, change the channel Dummy. Trump did not kill 100,000 people. #MAGA2020
You mean like #Hillary hasn't accepted the last election results! #Trump has more class then that.
Guess your to stupid to understand he won electoral college with 5 states with 80k votes, barely. If you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs different this time I think you have already had to much disinfectant. Trump will lose popular vote by wider margin, forget about a squeaky college win!!! Bye

Fauci? Really? Nice try. He doesn‚Äôt live a 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. unless you can tie him to all these companies looking at having a workable vaccine, your theory is BS.Trump is the one that‚Äôs accountable for his lack of leadership regarding this virus. Like retweeting quack Dr‚Äôs.
Well if you believe that then I'm wasting my time speaking to you.  If that was the case why did there need to be a hearing for the judge to throw it out and release Cohen?   Trump intentionally, specifically, tried to deprive a citizen of their first amendment rights.

Trump says a lot of crazy/stupid stuff every day, one just needs to consider the source, take the money information with a grain of salt. Just like yesterday when he retweeted the doctors who claimed there was a cure for the COVID and wearing masks doesn‚Äôt help with the spread.

Trump is the head of the government
When Trump took virus case count reporting away from the CDC, it was obviously so he can release fake (low) case numbers.  He began doing it the very day he took control from the CDC.¬† Our USA cases curve immediately flattened. #wtpBlue #ONEV1
As a voter that‚Äôs my mission, to take trump down. I don‚Äôt need any help from any media outlet. I have watched, listened, read tweets and texts to figure out for myself his inability to do his job. They call bad doctors ‚Äúquacks‚Äù, so i guess #45 is the ‚Äúquack‚Äù version of President.
The stupid won't magically disappear when Trump is gone.
Facebook is blocking it also..they dont want that info getting out..the dems are pushing the virus..keep everyone home..allow mail in votes so they can get Trump out of office..because the know Biden can't win fairly. We the people know whats up-and-coming
Facebook has to make money from the ads that come before and after the video. They are there to make money. They are not here to save America. Like Trump here is here to win, not there for the love of America.

How much taxpayer money has Team Trump wasted fighting BS losing legal battles?
...(8)...that a few mins at a time. Trump was having unscripted interviews lasting 2-3 hours every day. Pres Trump is not a saint. But he‚Äôs done more for this country, for every race in this melting pot we call USA, in his first 3 years than Obama/Biden did in 8.
...(7)...lies how can we trust him? He will lie when the truth will work better. He is afraid of debating Trump for any time at all yet thinks we should put him in the position of dealing with other world leaders? He has to have scripted interviews and can‚Äôt speak for more...
...(3)...manipulated. Yet they claimed President Trump should be impeached because he was being manipulated by Putin. When are people going to wake up and see the overwhelming hypocrisy from the Left? The lawlessness in big cities cannot continue. We have to take a stand...
While President Trump is pushing for a payroll tax cut, most GOP senators prefer the direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans.

Some Democratic-leaning states with large undocumented populations would lose congressional seats and electoral votes, and Republican-leaning states would gain them.
They are getting paid to give a perception this is the world of Donald Trump. They want people who do not follow politics to think good god we need a new leader
This is happening while trump is president though dipshit
The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyperpoliticized moment when Trump is trying to show that he stands with law enforcement and depict Democrats as weak on crime.
Yoho puts his faith in trump, who says he does not ask for forgiveness, he says, "No, I don't think I do...I don't bring God into that picture." Yoho embraces a guy who rejects the sacrifice of Christ. Yoho is that kind of Christian.

Apparently Nancy Pelosi is okay with calling COVID-19 ‚Äúthe Trump Virus‚Äù but not ‚Äúthe China Virus‚Äù  It didn‚Äôt come from Trump‚Äîit came from China.  Pelosi is a disgrace to America.

When Trump answers the question of whether he is a racist by pointing to criminal justice reform simply proves that he is a racist. Criminal justice reform is not a racial issue.

I agree 100%!  I always thought that. Trump has not changed at all from his playboy days!  He is a disgusting person!        From the President that gives a shout out to a woman charged with soliciting minor girls!
This is Trump‚Äôs gestapo!  Vote this crazy man out in massive numbers!         And you Republicans wonder why he is double digits down. The majotiy of Americans will not tolerate this!POTUS designation members of the press "the enemy of the American people." Therefore, I was amused to receive an invitation on Facebook to join American Patriots for Trump. One member is a Latina who was born south of the border.
You silly act has long since jumped the shark. Can‚Äôt believe trump still paying you.
If trump could just show some contrition I might be able to feel bad for him.
I for one do not believe trump is that smart. He says something stupid regularly every single day. Some days it looks like it was a distraction. It‚Äôs not. Just a day when bad news conflicted with his stupidity.
I really do not care if he doesn‚Äôt accept the results. At noon Jan 20 Biden is the president and trump can whine for the rest of his life. Nothing out of the ordinary is going to happen. He did same in 2016. He didn‚Äôt think he would win then.
Let‚Äôs see now, Obama have the main eulogy at the funeral today but Trump couldn‚Äôt stand it so he gave a speech too. But no one gave a crap because they knew it was just trump being a racist. It was very disrespectful. Screw trump in my book.
Woo Hoo finally a Fellow Texan. Trump 2020. God bless Texas, God bless USA and God bless Trump.     Y‚Äôall have a nice day. üòä
The only thing we can know for sure is that Trump really needs to STFU and let someone talk for him. But you absolutely can't trust any poll.
Trump is the reaping of what the other men sowed
I am no fan of Herman Cain but he should not have died of coronavirus after going to Trump's ego-fueled Tulsa rally.  Now his family can't even do anything because of the waiver the campaign required from attendees.  Why are these people so loyal to Trump.
So trump says it is so bad we need to cancel the election because of the COVID 19 but not to bad to send our kids to schools. That makes little sense folks. But he is not sending his Son to School
Gotcha must be that ‚ÄúTrump education‚Äù my bad.

The questioning by the Democrats today was just as I thought. It was all about stopping the investigations. Impeaching Barr and beating Trump at the polls will do it, they think. But it won't. Today was showtime, flex your muscle day for the Democrats. They failed miserably.

Newsflash--Obama/Biden is not a choice in this thread. He was not talking about them.  Also news--I am not a Trump supporter, but I'm scared to death that Biden might win and he's even worse.  More corruption to continue the existing corruption.
Antifa could literally break the doors down, march in there and start beating on them. And they would still deny their existence. Or say they were hired goons from a secret police force sent by Trump. üòëüòë
Mark my words: if trump ever toes the rubber at a Yankees game, this throw will have better mechanics
I watched the whole thing. It is very informative and encouraging.  But it makes me have greater doubts than ever about politics and fake news. That they would rather people die than agree with Trump is scary.
That was Trump‚Äôs point. Take away the salaries from the teachers that refuse to work and pay the American people that have to do it in their place. But I get your point. My wife and I both work.
Whatever. Trump wants to pay the American people to homeschool if so required. I can get on board with that now that I see who‚Äôs really been teaching our children.

As far as the Heart disease goes, why aren‚Äôt we outlawing fast food and sodas? Bc of how much money there is in big pharmaceuticals. It was president Trump that just signed a executive order that lowered the cost of of insulin and Epipens.
Your exactly right the democrats did absolutely nothing when Trump wanted to shut people coming in from other countries. He also said that hydroxy was a possible cure and everyone laughed. He did his part it was the dems that did nothing at all.
Trump is right if you hate the US...leave!!!
After the elections, I fully expect Trump and the Republican controlled Congress to pass legislation to rebuild those businesses that were destroyed by the anarchists. The owners deserve to be made whole again.
It is amazing to me that liberal democrats are willing to kill the American public, so that they don‚Äôt have to admit Trump was right!!
If the polls showing Biden with a lead over Trump in several states, there is no need for mail in ballots. You Democrats have already stolen the election from Trump.

For awhile now, I've seen headlines/heard politicians question: "What if President Trump doesn't accept the election results?" - This question comes across as fear mongering / reminds me of tactics some Republicans used when President Obama was in office. Let it stop.
Are you under the impression that I'm a complete Trump supporter?  Here's the problem: "R or D is your only choice, and whichever you are, you have to be all in"  I'm neither R nor D and I've never been all in with any one politician or political party.

I think the Democrats will tire of the riots and protest going on, will throw Biden under the bus at the convention, elect Hillary to run against Trump again. She will move back toward the center. Any way you slice it, Hillary will be the Democrat nominee for President.
So you are pro life but you don‚Äôt give a damn about the kids in cages. Your pro life but the 146,000 who have died with the COVID isn‚Äôt bothering you. Well I call bullshit. When you love trump even thou he has been terrible President.
If trump says we should not do mail in ballots then that is exactly what we need to do. Always do the opposite of what the brain says. Just makes since folks.
I hope that the first thing our President does on January 21st is pick up a sledge hammer, walk outside and knock a big hole in that offensive wall that Trump put around the Whitehouse.
Wowwww.... so very liberal of you. How kind... let me explain TRUMP will be your POTUS for the next 4.5 years.

Oh hell! I guess that, just like Trump, I need to start having compassion for the more than 145,000 souls lost due to our greed. I‚Äôve got 100 days to make people think I care.
I still this Biden running for President is a sham and and a setup for Hillary Clinton. She looks and talks too comfortable. I think she swings her party back toward the center, but still far left. She wont debate Trump. She will make wild promises she can't keep.

Ever heard of slander and not all comments are protected under freedom of speech. Like I said I am sure they have committed crimes. I would have to look into it. Purporting a false plot that government is being sinister while Trump is being heroic could be inciting riot.
Trump is obese because he is a corrupted glutton. And while most people stuff themselves, digest and dump it out to a deuce or a triple Trump is on blood thinners.
I don't want to knock Trump too much as I am unilaterally opposed to the sapping and murder of Americans outsourcing to Communist China and all that that globalist Bohemic iceberg portends. And I realize that there's a limit to the faults and vices of others even on Social Media.
Same here. I find it's still very difficult to watch 9/11 memorials yearly and documentaries on it.  I'm looking forward to Trump and his Sycophants spending their twilight years in courts, Tribunals, and Congressional testimonials answering to Investigations done in truth/facts

With Trump, Cruelty IS The Point
I actually pinned the Fox news clip where Trump had called in on the phone and said this!  One of the Lincoln Project vids also has a short clip of that very call in. Trump said the economy, the country, needed to CRASH, before it could be maga.  He's a dangerously stupid man

My mother, an apolitical devout Catholic, viewed Trump through the ‚ÄúOrange man bad‚Äù lens   That was until she noticed images like these. She played close attention to things he would say specifically about God and prayer, as well as the unborn.   These images have impact.
Oh they covered the deaths. They attributed them all to the trump rally in Tulsa. I remember when news was fact. So long ago.
Mariners might sign him, though.
Did you see the pitch?  Wow. I mean,
Why do I feel like the Republicans enjoy being in the minority. When Trump was elected you had the majority, but what was accomplished?
There is nothing, NOTHING more important to the Democrats than to control the narrative of Fox News, and they are doing it. Almost 24/7 coverage of the Democrats effort to make Trump unelectable, while limiting Trumps achievements to a few minutes on talk shows. Please R/T this.
Trump's competition... Lmao
Theres a gathering of people on Highland waiving trump flags.   Sure would be awful if someone reported that theres not a mask on any of them.
I have a Donald Trump joke, but it's stupid.
If and when President Trump nominates and gets placed another Conservative on the Supreme Court, that will effectively close the door on liberals  running to this Court and their allies for a positive verdict whether lawful or not. Interpretation of the law will once again reign.
Another conservative appointee by President Trump will mute his vote. We just have to bide our time.

We are not dealing with the real Democrat party here. This is what real organized crime looks like.  It won't stop after Trump gets reelected or if the Republicans win both Houses of Congress. The key to eliminating them is Durham/ Barr.

Anything's possible.  The story is that Putin (Russia) has actually paid some of those bounties ($100k per Soldier) they've placed on their heads for the Taliban.  But you're probably aware of that.  This appeared in Trump's Presidential Daily Briefing   Trump, MSM - nothing
This story is Nicole Wallace blasting Trump for his tweet using the word "housewives" instead of "women"   It's not bad Actually, but still ü¶óon huge stories about, for example, Russia paying bounties to Taliban in Afghanistan for killing our troops!
I see. Yes, it is MSNBC. I understand. I too am very skeptical of big media - they aren't asking the toughest Questions and seem to have "breaking news" that's a non important (Distraction?) many times.   asked "Big Question" - twice - of Trump and  ü¶ócrickets

Try reading before you respond. I said he panders to the population that pushes that agenda. Also, I didn‚Äôt ask why they won‚Äôt vote for trump. I asked why no one supports an independent or 3rd party. You people are illiterate and respond to shit you can‚Äôt comprehend.

You‚Äôre Christian yet you will vote for someone who panders to population that wants religion gone. You sound misinformed. If you people don‚Äôt like trump, throw your vote behind a libertarian or independent. You must value politics more than your god or freedom.
All this talk about cheating on mail in ballots? Well that‚Äôs just hoping you use a machine because it is easier for Putin to change the vote. It is that simple. Last thing we need folks. A vote needs to be accurate and honest. This is America folks. Screw trump.

That's the reason I don't often make that comparison.  The use of the term "Fascist" I do think it's fitting and I also use it often to describe what we're seeing with Trump and his administration. We began saying our ww vets were "anti-Facists" when Trump &amp; supporters derided us

There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.
Trump was austracised for taking swift action, being called a xenophobe and other names. MAGA wore Nash‚Äôs and social distanced the first 15 days as instructed, but 4 month later here we are. And Fauci has changed his narrative so many times.  #ThinkForYourself

Absolutely, and one of the many reasons Trump perpetually tries to disparage Obama - a bitter, jealous, resentful and pathetic man who cannot hope to ever come close to demonstrating the class and character of the President who preceded him.
Trump's promise of lofty GDP growth post tax cuts passed Dec 2017 were BS.  Only 1Q 2018 did GDP growth exceed 3%, has averaged 2.2% 2Q18 thru 4Q19 pre pandemic, and now -5% 1Q2020 and a record -32.9% 2Q2020 (a record low)!  Vote him out!!!

How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.

Trump Rally - they bragged about no masks required - June 20.  tests positive July 2. Today he is gone. #rip #coronavirus
RIP Herman. How did that trump rally without a mask work out for you?
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won‚Äôt oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.
Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs playbook:  Economy report is a disaster, let‚Äôs tweet out some crazy shit.
Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn‚Äôt wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?

Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.

We voted during the civil war, two world wars, and he has no power to stop the election. Voting during crisis is something America has always done. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
So it begins.

Trump 2020
Trump has the blood of 150,000 people on his hands.
And here we go. Trump suggests delaying the election.
Trump could if we don‚Äôt mail in ballots early, filling them out correctly, and if we are not willing to wait in lines many hours. This vote is a patriotic one requiring sacrifice. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Trump has decimated international education. For the thousands of people who have made a career out of this until now, we liked America better before he tried to make it ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù
I have a master‚Äôs degree, too, and I just lost my job. If I decide to apply for the new contract- adjunct, and they decide to hire me-it will be a 30 percent pay cut plus no security-after 22 years of service. Trump did this with his Xenophobic rhetoric and policies.
At some point in the future after Trump has coronavirus and it has swept through the ranks of Republicans who refuse science we will be told ‚Äúthere will be time to discuss the issue of masks in the future, this is a time to deal with the issue of governance!‚Äù

I think Biden doesn‚Äôt have to worry about anything.  The people will rise up.  Only 33% of Americans voted for Donald Trump last election and I predict that goes down to 29%.  That means 2/3rd‚Äôs of this country will rise up.  You can count on that!
Again I disagree with some of your opinions but you are always consistent. Starting to think I need to listen more to your opinions. Thanks for being a voice of reason for the Democratic Party. It‚Äôs hard to find these days! Trump should hire you because you offer balanced opinion
Sounds like Kushner and the Trump crime family to me.
Trump releases all his convicted friends so they don‚Äôt snitch on him. This administration is loaded with crooks and it‚Äôs only obvious to people w good common sense. It‚Äôs a shame what Donald has done to his bleach drunk supporters.
Democrats are the only ones who can fix back what you‚Äôve destroyed. Republicans always do a terrible job when in control of office. Trump destroyed this country trying to undo everything Obama built. Crime boss bunker boy Trump is no good for Americans.  #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots

In 2016, Trump movement was about results &amp; action. In 2020, Trump has doubled down issues that are out of touch. Pandemic, economic recovery &amp; protest, Trump Administration has not responded. Building wall, repeal ACA &amp; blame everyone else, Biden is doing what Trump did in 2016.
China virus originated in China. Trump listened to Fauci and Birx (the experts??) but whatever keep defending China.

My name is completely satire and the original post was about traveling to space. You made it about politics and trump in one statement. Let that sink in.
Anything to keep Trump from getting recognized for being right. Even at the expense of lives. They just don't care. Just like the Grim Reaper Cuomo. There is no God so how can anyone be made in the image of God? Satan has little time left. Lift your heads to the sky.
Can't let Trump be right on this. Even at the expense of lives. They will be judged.
I‚Äôd ride with Trump driving before I‚Äôd get in the car with Biden behind the wheel.

Regardless of who is behind the violence Trump is trying to stomp out violence in these cities while local governments are throwing fits. It‚Äôs a losing battle for leftists regardless.
Fauci hasn‚Äôt been consistent nor has he been credible. Trump wanted to close the borders in February to prevent spread and was called a xenophobe but democrats.
I‚Äôm not sure the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre actually secret white supremacist instigators‚Äù argument for the violence in Portland is the right way to go for Democrats.  Even if true, that means Trump is doing everything he can to stomp out white nationalists while local government does nothing.
Why does the right constantly give the left a voice?  PLEASE explain??  Can we not just do our own thing and dictate what we want and control the narrative? You are giving these people cred.  Shut them up like Trump does.  Follow his lead.  #Trump2020

Nadler needs to go. He helped Barr and Trump yesterday.
Trump is a badass and could have taken on the liberal pussies in the street, but he didn't want to put any of the Secret Service agents in harm's way. He's kinda awesome that way.
Trump is a sleazy person. It's laughable to say he's not the swamp hell he built it. And feed it with the Republican tax cut that only rich folk benefited from. No one from the middle class benefited from it. Trump is the monster from red lagoon.
Notice how LIBERAL YAHOO has taken away the comment section on yahoo...they don't want to hear the truth from the people. TRUMP # 1
Not much of an "investigation" when Barr couldn't say a word. You CANNOT get anything to use against him when he is not allowed to talk. Our Party needs to fire these buffoons we've elected and start from the ground-up, starting with Nadler. This has helped Barr and Trump.
What did I miss? Oh , Trump trumping again.
Democrat friends are outraged at this as much as I am. Some have already said they are voting for Trump while others are considering it. This may be just what the Far Left wants but rank-and-file Democrats are appalled.
Just so everyone is clear! Kill all Jews is fine with Twitter, but Trump says something they don‚Äôt agree with, censor! Why do they have certain protections at Twitter, Facebook?

Obama is as good as we got. Bush Sr, Jr outside the wars decent men. Can't say that about Trump.
I'm sorry. Donald Trump cares nothing about the people or parts of this country that don't serve his political agenda. Something I would never say about Bush Sr or Jr, Reagan or even Nixon. Trump is a unique beast, and he has destroyed so much of this nation's fabric
Trump and his family have made $32m on Tax payers. Obama has created more jobs that Trump. Did you know since 2017 none of Trump economic years has topped Obama? I can provide sources if need be.
I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
Again, I don't practice in conspiracy. What I do know is Comey, Hillary, Obama are all free. Trump, Barr have the power. Barr has activity been a bad AG - but they have nothing. Trump is scared as crap about Manhattan tax case because if he loses jail is possible.
Well my view is that Trump has not been good for America. He uses the divisions as a political maneuver. I hope the country makes a change and we at least can put President Trump into the history books. We need both parties to function correctly. But at the moment the GOP is mia
I think that is justified only because how Trump vilified Media and good journalists. You reap what you sow and he has sowed discourse since he came down that esculator.
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
The ‚Äústudy‚Äù by ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù that was so widely used to smear Trump turned out to be false and rigged to make Trump look bad yet not one MSM agency retracted the info reported when ‚Äúexpert‚Äù got busted flat out lying! Wake up people!! Stop believing everything msm feeds you.
Like Fox News? Again I traffic in facts not conspiracy. The media reports what President Trump says. I have seen CNN report what Trump says and have seen the same video on Fox News. CNN didn't doctor the video they just report on his actions. And I make the final judgment.
I agree with them. President Trump at his core is not a good person. He does have these views and values and you can simply roll back the tape since he's been President. His ban had nothing to do with a systematic approach to controlling the outbreak, it's him and his team biases
Well I don't peddle in conspiracy theory. I traffic in facts. President Trump dismissed this virus back in December and continued to do so all the way until April. So I place blame and responsibility where it's due - however you have the right the believe what you chose.
#1 -This has to be on top of the list of people to indict. #2- Reverse Pardon on Roger Stone and get him in prison #3 - Michael Flynn, for the ‚ù§Ô∏èof god get this guy in jail  Top dog - Arrest Trump and charge him with all the items in Mueller report plus all the extras
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Donald Trump withstands news conferences, without a pre-approved list of sympathetic reporters, teleprompters, &amp; without an advance list of questions‚úîÔ∏è  He was interviewed by Chris Wallace, &amp; answer tough questions‚úîÔ∏è  You should be able to, as well‚úîÔ∏è Time to DEBATE TRUMP‚úîÔ∏è
There was not 50 days of violence and destruction.  The protests were actully winding down when Trump sent the Thugs in
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Considering all the laws the AG has broken its fair to assets some type of punishment. The Trump Administration and the AG had thumbed thier noise to the Dems in Congress, so I can't join you in sympathy.
He established a council to restore black neighborhoods, he once dated a black woman, he granted clemency to Alice Johnson, he upgraded MLKs birthplace to a national park, he promotes HBCUs...Trump isn‚Äôt racist.
No kidding I felt the same way. Who knew that he would be such a GREAT President. If he could run I would vote for President Trump a fourth term. üôèüèªüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

How popular is   provides an updating calculation of the president's approval rating, accounting for each poll's quality, recency, sample size, and partisan lean.
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.
Trump is like any loser who isn't "winning". Whenever they start losing they try anything to cheat. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
That was 14 years ago.  He caught COVID-19 around the time of Trump's superspreader rally in Tulsa, tested positive a little over a week later, and succumbed to the disease after a month in the hospital for it.
To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.
I understand your stylistic objections to Obama.  I have a similar hostile response to oleaginous politicians like Cruz who insult your intelligence; and that‚Äôs even before Trump turned Republicans into the nihiliststic Trolling for Liberal Tears Party.

Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.

SOMEBODY please call trump out on his ridiculous BS diatribe about the ‚Äútremendously corrupt‚Äù mail-in vote. It‚Äôs like watching a Jim Jones sermon!!
All Trump talks about is mail in vote fraud! Ridiculous  Any excuse to refuse to accept the out come Nov 3 if he loses!
Trump just said if we have mail in voting we will be the laughingstock of the world.  We are already the laughingstock of the world because of him!  He said you have to be really stupid not to understand that. Oh my God he is really an idiot!.  üò≤
That's kinda like true, only a few stay near the border, and the ones that stay near the border often aren't the criminals Trump is so scared of.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Finally because Herman Cain was killed by Trump Virus, he mentions the more than 150,000.
You know what's going to be sad? The fact that three former Presidents prior to  will probably show respect and condolences to his family and be willing to pay their respects to him on behalf of the nation and Trump couldn't do the same for John Lewis. That's sad.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There‚Äôs way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There‚Äôs little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.

Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.

It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
trump knows he can‚Äôt change the election,he‚Äôs trying to cause confusion so people give up because they‚Äôll believe his lies! Americans have to be smarter than that! Look at the facts! I have applied for my mail in ballot! This is NOT a new system! trump and his family used it!!!
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
Imagine not buying into the GOP strategy of everyone open schools so economy will be better in Oct so Trump can claim He Alone Can Fix It.
Curious how you know he didn't get it at the Trump rally. How do you know where he got it? Are you like one of those Dogs the Germans have trained to sniff out and identify people with COVID-19?
Did the right thing in 2016 and will do the right thing in 2020. TRUMP 2020
Typical trump.
Calling it the "Trump Virus" implies that he started it, and is responsible for the damage is causes. It should be referred to as "Wuhan", "Chinese", or "Democrat" virus.
He literally died because he went to a Trump rally and didn‚Äôt wear a mask he would still be alive had he not done that and Trump actually took Covid seriously but ok
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Makes me cry every time I hear him now. What a contrast between his moral leadership and Trump‚Äôs complete lack of it.

From what I was saying the Democrats they were just bitching and yelling at him never let him answer any of the questions. The Democrats are the ones that are lying dividing and trying to cheat this whole time Trump has been in the presidency
I've been dying for him to use my phrase I gifted him a couple years ago. Describing talking to Trump voters as "being bukkaked with stupid". I guess I can understand not using it on MSNBC or CNN but maybe the Podcast is a fit.

This!! I watched an interesting documentary last night re the takedown of the mafia. 1 segment talked at length how they had to ‚Äúprove to the court‚Äù reasonable cause for a warrant &amp; what they went thru to get that proof. Which was a lot less than what‚Äôs known about Trump!
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He‚Äôll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
Delaying the election is the least of my worries lol. Trump could theoretically make state legislatures bind electoral votes to him and SCOTUS could green-light it.

The blame lies squarely with tRump, and his death cult.
In what will be the first of many, a high profile #COVID19 denier and GOPer  Herman Caine has died of COVID after attending the OK rally held by Trump.
And every warning has fallen on deaf ears. And when state leaders actually try to do something useful to help, the Trump bunch cry out unconstitutional. It is so sadly stupid that anyone cares about those idiots.
Trump, no doubt
Trump 2020.  He does what is has promised.  Salute to the pres.  now if only the Republicans in Congress would step up their act.
I live in a suburb of Dallas. A blue collar suburb. We have quite a few low income housing complexes here. I live in an eclectic neighborhood of many races. My home values are fine and seeing an increase as opposed to going down. Trump is wrong.
In the last 24 hours Trump promoted segregation, the GDP is down 33%, he is pulling Troops out of Germany (you're welcome Putin) AND he wants to delay the election.    "Make other countries feel sorry for us" should be his new campaign slogan.
Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?
Trump murdered Herman Cain. #TrumpVirus #TrumpKilledCain
Trump Sez:  "It is time to show the whole world that America is back - bigger and better and stronger than ever before."
Trump: 63M (48%) Clinton: 66M (52%)
I say that based on the anger/size/consistency of BLM protests nationwide. And that‚Äôs just people upset about racial issues. Imagine if trump loses and refuses to give up office or even if he wins, imagine the uproar. I think a 2%&gt; of Americans will be in the streets protesting.
What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
Are you sure?  It's possible Putin's English is better than Trump's. ;-)
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.
Completely predictable.

Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.

The test he took was a dementia test, and said the questions about months was the hardest... Trump has an equal amount of scandals. Just know, I hate Biden just as much as you do if not more, both are horrible for the country and all around horrible people.
Bluer areas are near the border more than ever now cause Trump's put them through so much shit.
Our country is divided but not defeated. We really need to pull together and tell Putin that we don‚Äôt want a country like his and  run Trump out of our white house
Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.

Cain was part of the the corrupt Federal Reserve System, and his 9-9-9 was a gimmicky selling point that would have likely increased the national debt.  The extent to which I see some NeverTrumpers acclaim him suggests to me they would support Trump if only he was a nicer grifter

and yes protests and rioting are different so please explain to me how and why the police (who are under trump) are getting away with these crimes of killing and injuring civilians.
this is occurring under trump though. trump also has evidence of being involved in a sex trafficking ring (predominantly minors), while also being openly racist calling covid 19 the ‚Äúchinese virus‚Äùand banning hospitals from releasing covid numbers. i‚Äôm not for biden but come on.

The strange thing is that mainstream media only covered the democrats primaries. Trump also beat other republicans. Now, they polls mostly sample democrat voters so you don't get a real quality poll, it is BIASED. Like most of you. I guess u need the lies.
I followed the primaries closely. Had democrats and independents united they would have had about as many as Trump, but they didn't and Trump had double the delegates of the 'best' democrat.

There's no question that Barr is Trump's Roy Cohn, and that Barr has turned the DoJ into a law office with one client: Donald Trump. The question is, WTF to do about it? There is no doubt as to Barr's criminality, and the risk to an election less than 3 months away is high. 4/12

Does Trump get secret service protection in prison?
I certainly hope so Kathy. Probably no one else has done as much damage to overall tenor of debate in world's "greatest deliberative body", maximizing polarization, political cynicism, disaffection: all of the ills that ultimately set the stage for Trump. Simply because he could.

Yes he does, and sadly many women don‚Äôt like Trump only because they don‚Äôt see him as ‚Äúkind, nice, compassionate‚Äù... They refuse to look at his policies, and how much Americans, including them, have benefited from his policies.
Thus is the way a effing self-centered, petulant child talks: ‚Äúwhy don't I have a high approval rating ...‚Äù. Trump's rant displays the emotional development of a five-year-old.

Under Trump's  presidency, Covid 19 cases today stands at 4.4M and 151,000 deaths. The will the Republicans realize that people are dying and nothing has been done. They wanted the Health Dept under Obama to resign after 2 deaths and 11cases during  Ebola. Jim Jordan what say you

In this case it is. The reason this was possible is because Trump threw out the oversight committee. Imagine leaving an armored car on the street with no guards.

She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.

Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.

But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that‚Äôs cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ‚Öì on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
I know, but that message doesn't get the same sort of backlash. Lord knows it *should*, but saying that sort of thing won Trump an election.   Also, Barr know that if there's no election by January 20, it'l be President Patrick Leahy.

Having read her platform I‚Äôd have loved to have her as President so that‚Äôs not a valid excuse for supporting Trump. Even if she wasn‚Äôt a top choice there was Gary Johnson and Evan McMullin on the ballot and anyone could write in John Kasich or any other name that‚Äôs qualified
Meanwhile I found this pic of you at a Trump rally maskless with your culty friends!
We love and support you Trump!! Some of us know the truth!!
This is an issue because Trump's polling numbers are terrible. He's  trying to use the expected rise in absentee ballots due to Covid-19 (no one knows what the # will be) to shovel conspiracy theories. This time he has Barr helping to peddle the theories.
We will never see trump in pictures like these

I would have said Trump before this month but the economy and Corona are tanking his numbers with the "people who don't study or know shit about politics but still vote" demographic.
Each quarter, President Trump donates 100% of his $100,000 salary to various charities.  Note: His salary is $400,000 per year.
if you dare, make list of things you hate about Trump then check it for truth. How much do you love the politicians that lied to us all for decades?
Wasn't paying attention during first three years?
The only issue for Trump is poor polling numbers. So, he's trying to take advantage of the rise in Covid-19 related absentee ballots to push conspiracy theories. This time he'll have Barr helping to shovel instead of Roger Stone.
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
C'mon, Bill.  Surely, by now, you know President Trump is trolling the Democrats and the MSM just to get them riled up. And, they are taking the bait.  Besides, there's gonna be a red tsunami on November 3rd.  üá∫üá∏
A Pence rally.....lol man let me know if I'm wrong, but did Presidents and VPs have rallies like this when they were supposed to be working before Trump? Before him, I'd never heard of Presidents having rallies.
It‚Äôs interesting, some of the similarities between Obama and Trump.  Obama was re-elected, Trump was impeached.  Obama kept many of his Cabinet members, Trump is running out of people to replace his Cabinet members.  Trump is orange, Obama is black.  ‚ÄúSimilarities‚Äù may not apply.
You and trump are the frauds.
Also, even if he didnt (which, again, the evidence and timeline points to) many did:

Another lie.  Health  policy experts say Trump‚Äôs deal will likely offer patients only minimal relief and may take months to implement, if they're implemented at all.
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there‚Äôs that.
Trump says Trump is trying to delay the election. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Tomi please Trump said the virus is a hoax  . Trump waited to long to to something about it . And the real ass kicker is he tries to make Fauci the scapegoat for his ignorance ,I‚Äôm sorry but get your complaints ready for Biden .thats my final thought
Even this despicable excuse for a human agrees that Trump is full of shit when it comes to his election bitching.
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. ü§£
I‚Äôm more furious than sad. This black man towing the Anti Mask line for Trump and Trump ain‚Äôt going to even give a f‚Äî- about him. Less than two weeks after being at the Trump Tulsa rally he contracts Coronavirus.   You really hate to see it. I‚Äôm so angry. Sorry for the rant.
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his ‚Äújoke‚Äù about injecting people with bleach. He wasn‚Äôt joking.
It's not. Trump reads polls. Re-election is all that matters to him.
Wow. Trump was leading
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
You don't want to give relief to the American people. You want to protect Trump's interests and the interests of your donors. Spare us.
They got caught. Thus disproving it‚Äôs widespread and undetectable as Trump says.

Yes it is so vote for Trump!
The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Imagine what would happen if we had a Senator from TX who didn‚Äôt spew lies to dupe Trump‚Äôs cult.   Why did Trump repeatedly call you Lying Ted Cruz?
Turn off Fake News....Trump is getting ready to drain the swamp like you cannot imagine....Coming FISA indictments=START to #ObamaGate  failed coup conspirators are going down...Goodbye Hussein, goodbye Hillary and ALL of the rest of the TRAITORS. Enjoy the show!

That‚Äôs complete nonsensical lies, but Trump is so delusional he may even believe his own lies.
Well that‚Äôs true, but only because Trump thought he has been campaigning this whole time instead of actually being the president...
Sorry if this offends you, but Obama is trash. Total scumbag.
But then you conveniently ignore the lawless Barr that is making a mockery of justice. Looking forward to see you gone, almost as much as seeing the fat ass of Trump booted out.
And here I thought Trump's Tweets were going to be the dumbest crap I'd read on Twitter today. Scooter here is making a late push...
Trump went to NJ and didn‚Äôt quarantine. He golfed with Favre and sent out pictures. Trump set the example.
I care ABOUT our POLICE! If you think this Republican is voting for trump,... Guess Again; Look out the window into Trump's America! For God's sake it a NIGHTMARE!
It‚Äôs the lawful thing to do, when the government is a lawless corrupt DOJ with Barr, giving special treatment to those that coverup to protect Trump.
".. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again by the House &amp; his removal from office by the Senate" Written in NYT by Mr. Calabresi who is a co-founder of the Federalist Society - #Election2020
I don't think 11 Trump hotels would be a "large hotel chain".
Owner of a large hotel (Donald Trump) Jeffrey Epstein  Alan Dershowitz  Maxwell Ghislaine Prince Andrew Bill Clinton  Bill Barr Both redacted and interacted co and conspirators should be prosecuted.
Remember how they tried to make us feel bad for Dick Cheney's equally evil but more cowardly daughter cause her lord Trump turned on her? Respectability for them, corporate war and exploitation for everyone else
if you watch filthy rich, you'd see that trump cut ties with epstein over a decade ago. he used to be in the club, for intel. you can't get information on people if they don't trust you to share it.
After watching the speakers today sending off our patriot   I know our nation is better and stronger than Trump and his administration. Our VOTE MATTERS - every citizen 18 and older has the obligation to cast a vote on November 3rd.
That is the question but I do think trump has put the gop on the midwest track.  Probably won't help in 2020.  But if the electoral college projections are to be believed Romney 2012 plus Florida 31 plus ohio 17 and iowa 5 is  mid 260s
‚ÄúAll these damn Trump bots!! ü§¨ü§¨‚Äù  Y‚Äôall wanna tell em or should I?
Please do illustrate what this has to do with Trump, dummy. Yeesh you people are fucking ridiculous.
Its amazing how much they will defend Trump and make an ass of themselves in the process.
It time to throw in the towel Trump, Resign before the American People throw you out of office
She might not since her term ends January 3rd. I like &amp; respect Speaker Pelosi, but if trump's enablers continue to do their best to destroy the country...
I‚Äôm pissed off I‚Äôm not a Democrat I know other conservatives that don‚Äôt like this tweet I know other Trump supporters that don‚Äôt like it
Trump does not care and he never will.
Openly rooting for a pandemic that destroyed our economy is a real good look for this pud  and the rest of  folks. Well done. Must be nice not worrying about a job or paying bills. You really owned Trump.
Trump the clown!
Hahahaha it‚Äôs true a lot of accounts going after trump because this guy was his lawyer on the impeachment trial , but not even one word about Clinton , or not even mention that Dershowitz has always been a democrat
Yea it was fun for a while but that kid madly in love with trump cant reason with stupid cant argue with ignorant.
We now face a huge increase in unemployment and the lowest GDP in history. This is as bad or worst than the GREAT DEPRESSION! All caused by Trump!
Reminder , he has always been a democrat , just changed to trump impeachment team because he said it was a total hoax (it was ) always was non sense that impeachment , but he is against trump he even campaigned against trump , you can‚Äôt make it up #ClintonCrimeFamily
I think Pelosi should impeach Trump on his failures with Coronavirus.   But we know she won't do that.
Trump doesn't understand science or economics. #TrumpHatesScience
Anyone else catch the part where Trump isn't a wannabe dictator because he hasn't tried to curtail free press or try to arrest political opponents...  Sometimes I feel like Trump thumpers simply refuse to pay attention, bc it's the only way to say this shit with a straight face.
Eeee he is a Democrat and the one mentioned on the documents is Clinton , no trump . Sorry you can‚Äôt make it up
True but the safer choice is biden imo hes the more likely to get trump out of office and for that reason alone he has my vote tbh
Save lives from the Trump Virus! The Trump virus and Trump‚Äôs  late response and saying the virus was gone and telling people to go back to normal has caused record number of cases and a rising death toll!!
Dearest Joe, PLEASE HAMMER HOME that IF trump's SO determined to send children to school with NO SAFETY measures in place, then why is he so determined to undermine &amp; delay the election? Open Schools. VOTE! He's scared shitless! My name's Beverly; I approve this tweet!
i'm not gonna spoon feed information when everyone has the same access to the internet as i, but here's something to start  #KeepTexasRed
Buying stamps is not going to help save the USPS. The postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, is a Republican newly appointed by Trump and he is following Trump's orders to slow the mail.   DeJoy is more loyal to Trump than he is to America.
150,000+ dead americans, 30 million unemployed. You have to be unpatriotic and hate america to vote for trump. Clearly isn‚Äôt fit for office.
It's very sad that trump promised the Guillen family financial help to bury their daughter.  We ALL know that was a damn lie.
And you know Trump personally to make such an accusation?
- Trump writes an epitaph for Herman Cain. Makes it about himself. On brand.
TRUMP's determined to SEND KIDS TO SCHOOL, so WHY DELAY THE ELECTION? He's terrified his corruption is UP! My name is Beverly &amp; I approve this tweet.
lol, yall can impeach Trump 100x wont change a thing, or stop him
trump has done more for the black community than any other president other than abe. libs are making them feel oppressed for why? they're not. he's created millions of jobs, stocks and 401k have sky rocketed, he's providing other opportunities like low income areas, nasa, korea
The reality, however, is that no single physical barrier can completely stop smugglers; even CBP officials acknowledge that! The smugglers have also started tunnels under the wall! So much for Trump‚Äôs wall that he bragged was impenetrableüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ!!
Apparently Trump partied with Nicole a lot like this pic
He used to be better, but he's become an abject weasel when "interviewing" Trump surrogates. He just lets them yammer on, spouting the conspiracy theory or lie du jour, without challenging obvious falsehoods. That is not journalism...
Nah joe biden weird af too but theres no way trump is the better candidate so out of the two evils hes the better choice.
So far Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, Clinton are listed.... waiting for Trump to show up
The hype is real! Can‚Äôt wait to see which puppets are getting roasted all night and tomorrow morning! Expect to see Bill C., Hillary, Trump, Melania, Prince Andrew, Weinstein, Musk, Bill Gates, Bezos, Piers, Murdoch, Rothschilds, etc. on there. About time they all got arrested.
i don't trust liberals nor lefists. the riots are out of hand, they're destroying america. biden doesn't know what he's talking about ever, i mean i just watched a clip where he said "we should re-elect trump" ... nuff said.

Only a Trump or  would praise  like this upon his death. Respect should be earned, not expected like Trump expects it.  While praise should be freely given, it must be sincere, not just lip service for an egomaniac.
I attend Trump rally and I have never seen KKK or Nazi flags.
Sandi, I find it very odd you promote yourself. If all roads lead to Trump, the evidence, PROVE IT. The Clintons have blood on their hands and incriminating evidence in stacks. Being in court as a crappy journalist means exactly that. Congrats on getting a glimpse of a pedophile.
If you‚Äôre going to be all over my media atleast drop a follow you fan. ü•± type in ‚Äútimes trump has lied‚Äù and come back in a few hours once you read all 20,000+ lies they have recorded from him. #bot
Mr.President TrumpÔºåYou are great ÔºÅ
President Donald Trump promised that a wall on the border would radically change undocumented immigration and customs enforcement. The president's wall isn‚Äôt as sturdy as he promised: Smugglers have been using a commercial saw to cut through it!
Without Republican checks and balances Trump has a lot of power to use towards those cheating ends. And an equally corrupt lunatic in Barr.
I don‚Äôt worry about President Trump‚Äôs tweets!  That‚Äôs how America knows the truth of what is going on.  He keeps in touch with Americans, which is much more than I can say about the democrats.
This is Trump's equivalence of burning the place down because he knows he's going to lose, so he might as well take down-ballot Republicans with him. This is what a malignant narcissist does.
Trump has not removed Fauci because of the appearance, Trump knows Fauci is not being forthright on Hydroxy..it works, pandemic would be slowed to a crawl..but can‚Äôt let that happen until November..
Trump clearly would have done same in 2016 if he lost, he would have dragged it out for as long as he could get away with.
Ah, taking those same creative liberties with reality that your orange dream supreme is so fond of taking. That's okay, puddin' pop. Next time, I'll use much smaller words and speak slower for you. Anyone who can honestly continue to support Trump at this point ain't too bright.

Trump: It‚Äôs a liberal HOAX
Trump is not the one oppressing voters, that would be your party. Mail In elections would take our vote away.
I never really understood what Republicans were about until ‚Äúthe Trump ‚Äú took office. Now it all makes sense. If you want to be controlled in any way,your on the right, if you want to converse and gather opinions and debate the best outcomes your on the left.
Remember when Obama ran for president he said he would always be transparent? He lied. Trump is brazenly transparent and dems are too blind to appreciate it.
32.9, 60, 0 - 32.9% drop in the GDP; 60 seconds - yesterday, an American died every 60 seconds from the coronavirus; 0 - the number of times  stood up for our troops in his latest conversation with Putin. This is Trump‚Äôs  cc
The Democratic plan is no platform and I honestly don't blame them. Trump is burying himself daily without a target.

Biden and Hillary have both absolutely nailed on the head the many problems Trump brings to democracy, but are discredited because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust playing politics‚Äù
When are you going to stop writing pulp fiction opinion articles that you spin as being fact?  When are you going to realize that republican voters for trump are majorly underrepresented in sample polls compared to democrats?  When are you going to realize it's the media and folk
Real Republicans are not anti science. Uneducated idiots are anti science. Some of them seem to vote Republican because they think that Trump represents them. But no, Trump despises them, as he despises all other people. Give us back the real GOP. Intelligent and thoughtful.
A president is not supposed to try to push millions of people‚Äòs buttons that‚Äôs not a presidential Trump said he could be presidential if he got elected. It‚Äôs not going to be funny if he loses to Biden

It wouldn‚Äôt matter. US congress sets the E day at a national level; meaning it has to be on the same day for everyone. States have no control. Undermining would be a crime. There would surely be court battles but I‚Äôm pretty sure; in the end, Trump would be removed by Inaug Day.
He pushed the idea that not wearing masks in public spaces was okay. Then he caught COVID at a Trump rally and died from it. He deserves zero sympathy
Both will have an asterisk by their awards. Just like their hero the impeached President Trump.*

And replace him with who? The base will go nuts, scream about backstabbing RINOs, and they‚Äôll lose even more spectacularly. Trump is the Albatross the GOP has superglued to its own neck.
I felt sorry for Trump at first. I really had never heard of him and didn't know anything about him. I had some hope even though I knew he would be a bad president, but I had no idea he was such a bad person. Now I feel nothing but disgust and loathing.
‚ÄúCovid is fake‚Äù. It‚Äôs people like this that are going to say the election results are fake if Trump loses lol    hillary was right about ONE thing, the basket is real, deplorable do exist.  But just as many on the left.
Sadly that wouldn‚Äôt be a first for Trump.
It‚Äôs pretty silly. People listen to Trump and think voter fraud is a big deal. But it like never happens and even when it does it‚Äôs never a difference maker because it‚Äôs so minuscule
What specific crime? Still waiting on a trump fan to name a crime. Nobody can yet haha

I don‚Äôt vehemently back Trump. I think his tweets are stupid he worries too much with pop culture bs and comment today about delaying election was even more stupid. But I did vote for Trump because of the following 1/2
Lies  Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies  Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies All YOU DO IS LIE DONALD  LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES  DONALD PUNK TRUMP    RAPIST SIDE WILL COME OUT
Democrat Party, all they can do is bash Trump. I test any democrat what good would it do besides getting Trump out to have Biden as President. He cannot put three sentences together. I KNOW you wish you had another alternative. I get it. Educate yourself don't be lazy.
You destroyed your reputation to bend over for Trump. Now you are nothing but a foolish hack.
Got that right.   Democracy under Biden or white supremacist fascism under Trump

Well see who is laughing in November...God bless Donald J. Trump!!
Funny, stuff #Jake. Trump is getting every lefty on the record to hold the elections as scheduled. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
is an idiot which is demonstrated by the fact that he hasn‚Äôt learned anything in 4 years.  As a result, he has fully embraced the Fascism of Trump.
Trump's campaign has virtually disappeared from the airwaves as it undertakes "a review and fine-tuning of the campaign's strategy."  Not surprising as they have nothing to offer, nothing to say and no path to the future. #TrumpIsAFailure  #TrumpIsLosing
3) Trump doubles down - comparing Russia‚Äôs actions to American involvement in Afghanistan in the 1980‚Äôs...

The narrative is going to change drastically between now and then and I believe Trump &amp; military will be in full command
Please watch your President who is so excited he passed a ‚Äúhard‚Äù dementia test. Omg. Joe Biden has had a stutter for ages. Read up on it.
Even the Federalist Society has turned against Trump yet here you are spewing your latest piece of propaganda to distract from the real issues...

Before the Assyrian destruction of Samaria, there were 2 rival kings of Israel,Menahem...and Pekah.  Obama has set himself up as a rival President to Trump.   How soon will destruction obliterate America?
yes I will judge you for being a trump supporter. your point?
Trump 2020 - all day long!!
In the reaction to Obama's eulogy by some "conservative" pundits, we are reminded of the racism that fueled their 8 year war against him, and contributed to the election of the current person. But the majority of voters elected Obama TWICE. A minority elected Trump. There is hope
Why walk around with a Trump mask on ?? Your presence makes people uncomfortable
Trump illegally sits in the Oval Office that was meant for a person who loves America and cares about it's people! We are embarrassed of this fiasco! #evictTrump

Fat boy is triggered. Trump scores again.
Sorry, I just don't have time for any fool who is just *now* coming around to the realization that maybe Trump is not totally on the level when it comes to the Constitution.
Don't like conspiracy theories but there are times trump tried to self sabotage
Texas politicians on Thursday pushed back on the idea of delaying November's general election after a startling tweet from President Donald Trump floating the proposal.‚Äã
Trump talked about it; Biden did it #TaraReade
He seems super duper concerned about how politicians act that aren‚Äôt Donald Trump or other Republicans.
I suppose that is worse than madam defarge questioning trump's election victory.  And how many times has a Republican lodged an objection to the Congress counting the electoral college votes?  The answer would be zero.   The dems have done it in 2001 2005 and 2017
Trump is finished. Wake up. People weren't as educated back then. America has always been flooded with embeciles.
1) Trump clowns around during National Anthem...
SEAN HANNITY:  When will you interview President Trump's newest adviser?  As soon as he met her he was impressed.  He thought look at that mind.   She is a doctor who specializes in dream demons.   Trump made a perfect call to Russia and boasted "We have RAS PUTIN."

No, Dems need to do everything to right this country after the systemic damage from Trump and past Republicans. Republicans cheated to maintain their power, it‚Äôs no surprise the GOP never wins the popular vote. Dems should use every trick because that‚Äôs what their opponent does.
House Ethics panel recommends $50,000 fine for Republican Rep. Schweikert's campaign finance violations. What was it Trump said about draining the swamp?
"Oh! A scientist in Newsweek says X! That proves it!" "Oh, look! Trump's people trotted out 20 people in White Coats!!!!" It's like when Triston Farnon mixed iodine crystals with turpentine and got clouds of purple smoke--a trick that makes them go "Ooh" and "ahh."
That's very comforting to know. Social media should never have allowed domestic terrorist, #Trump, full rein on their platforms.

This is not from the New England Journal of Medicine. Before putting conservative crap on here.
Purposefully done by Trump to influence the election.
Given your OP-ed from April excoriating Biden for suggesting Trump would do exactly what he did today (try to delay an election) , I'd say your crystal ball is awfully wonky...

I agree. I never said our past presidents weren‚Äôt bad. I think they were but like you said no president has been so openly racist homophobic and ignorant its dangerous to have a president that‚Äôs acts the way he does so like I said not voting is essentially voting for trump imo
Think again. A cough or sneeze actually disperses the virus up to 12 feet. But enjoy the covid and trumps witch doctor
Trump don‚Äôt care he‚Äôs rich people steadily getting laid off because of his slow actions at the start of this virus
Yes. The (looney tunes) Nobel Peace Prize for Obama in 2009 was a ‚Äúthank god, you guys aren‚Äôt totally insane after all‚Äù moment. By 2021, there are two scenarios: a rampant Trump, or a hobbled Biden Administration. America will be deeply diminished in either case.
Ultimately, trump is so predictable now. All we have to do is think of the worst possible action/statement he can make... and sure as shit..  9 times out of 10.. he‚Äôs doing it.
There is going to be a point where people start to make a calculation and break from Trump... hopefully this might be what Chad is doing here
Let Pelosi &amp; Schumer continue 2 say ‚Äúno‚Äù.  Trump has show the America ppl how much he cares about them. Let the unemployment benefits expire. Who will the American ppl blame if their money is cut off. Trump has done what he needs 2 do.
Hey yall dont forget, conservatives are not hateful. This is me and a Trump loving 16 year old. He asked me if we could switch hats. And of course said, "Yes." I am gay and he supports me. This is why I am conservative.
For those of you who still have questions about the November elections being delayed in November, the NYT has published a great article answering questions. The firewall is five free articles per month so even w/o subscription you may be able to read.

Does #Directive51 allow Trump to delay the election? I'd rather do that than allow the Dems to steal an election with voter fraud.  After 2016 #ObaMAGAate we know there is nothing they won't do.     via
How many votes kept the Dictator-in-Chief in power and not even have a trial about his abuse of power?  Now he's suggesting a delaying the election? (pffffff) You dont want election day to be a federal holiday and the POTUS wants to delay it!
President Trump is still in office, so I don‚Äôt comprehend what you mean? Unless you‚Äôre referring to Pres Obama who illegally spied on Pres Trump during the campaign.
A statement without corresponding evidence is an assertion. Prove Trump has never made such a misstatement...
You left out the Demons and Witches f-ing us while we sleep.  A terrible happening which she just happens to have the cure for, the alien DNA injections.  Hey, if Trump supporters want to let her inject them w alien DNA, it's fine w me.
Obviously. We are all in agreeance. Now back to the facts. Who is guilty?! Yes we know the Clintons. I guess we will see about Trump. Nothing yet.
Trump's goal is to dominate the news. It doesn't matter how or how outrageous. The more the better.  Stop repeating it. Just stop.
Where is trump name?
Pres. Trump ends housing rule, tenants may now face eviction amid COVID-19 pandemic
Anything to see here?
perfect choice considering his past as well but having trump as a president for another 4 years shouldn‚Äôt even be an option. Anyone not voting is a vote for trump in my opinion but to each their own I can see why people wouldn‚Äôt want to vote but I still think it‚Äôs very important
I‚Äôve got news for Trump. America has WAY more decent people, inclusive, talented people, than the shitty, evil, corrupt, racist tribe he subscribes to. We out number him &amp; We Will Vote! Pack your bags Orange Asshole #NobodyLikesTrump #WeWillVote
I don‚Äôt think his people are smart enough. He should do something for the Bernie supporters at times in the 2016 race Trump said things to make them them; As the election gets closer I‚Äôm sure he will talk about Biden being establishment and talk about trade and other issues
Yeah so  was the guy who didn‚Äôt even think we should look into Trump‚Äôs actions that led to impeachment so his claims to care about our democracy ring pretty fucking hollow.
Thought there was asymptomatic exposure. I am not sure where you live but we are not the same as trump. We don‚Äôt get tested, we don‚Äôt get immediate results, and we aren‚Äôt full of shit like you are.
Nah, he just makes up countries like Nambia. Trump transcripts are gibberish.  Also willing to bet your assertion is incorrect.
the thing is like this works though moderate republicans just want trump w/o the uh more erratic parts of his admin

I just discovered Daily Mail TV and enjoying it immensely. I recomnend it Mr Trump. Seems very fair and respectful.

Hi Rep. AOC, PLEASE PUSH THIS:  IF trump wants to open schools WITHOUT ANY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, WHY DELAY THE ELECTION?? Let‚Äôs VOTE!! Trump‚Äôs trying to delegitimize &amp; UNDERMINE the election! Do NOT let him do that! My name is Beverly &amp; I approve this tweet!
Apparently Trump has told Rudy that he will be pardoned. Otherwise he would not dare stick his head up.
Trump is truly insane, that‚Äôs murderous madness.
How‚Äôs that saying go, not everyone that voted for trump is a racist but every racist voted for trump.
Trump never been?
Nancy your are talking about that group of people!  The working class are Trump supporters
She loves Trump, don‚Äôt say that to her lol. üò≠ü§£
So, if you are I‚Äôll with Covid symptoms and can‚Äôt return to work, or if you have been laid off and can‚Äôt afford your rent, Trump can dial up his ‚ÄúICE machine‚Äù to descend upon you with rubber bullets and pepper spray.  He will cage our children if you protest about eviction.
OMG SAME I WAS SO SAD WHEN I UNFOLLOWED HER BC I LIKED HER SM BUT LIKE FUCK TRUMP YA KNOW
Then if you care about her saying that, you support trump. Like I said in the absolute first place. If you don‚Äôt agree with that statement, your a orange vagina grabbing president lover just like the KKK
These people must have all gone to tRump University. BankruptRus
I don't get the adoration of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He got cozy with the Kennedys for political clout, cheated on his wife and got the maid pregnant, and is known to be an awful person for other reasons, too. Just because he dislikes Trump doesn't make him a hero.

Peter Strzok said "no way he gets elected but we can't take that risk"  which meant there was a definite plan to prevent Trump from winning. If it failed they wanted Plan B to stop it. Why are Strzok &amp; others not in jail yet? When Democrats go after Repub's they don't waste time.
Trump was so unpopular it made no sense he won but let's not let it happen again. Also let's take back the Senate. Vote Blue.
Y‚Äôall say all this and then tell folk vote or die when their options are Trump or Biden üôÉ

That‚Äôs complete nonsensical lies, but Trump is so delusional he may even believe his own lies.
Well that‚Äôs true, but only because Trump thought he has been campaigning this whole time instead of actually being the president...
Sorry if this offends you, but Obama is trash. Total scumbag.
But then you conveniently ignore the lawless Barr that is making a mockery of justice. Looking forward to see you gone, almost as much as seeing the fat ass of Trump booted out.
And here I thought Trump's Tweets were going to be the dumbest crap I'd read on Twitter today. Scooter here is making a late push...
Trump went to NJ and didn‚Äôt quarantine. He golfed with Favre and sent out pictures. Trump set the example.
I care ABOUT our POLICE! If you think this Republican is voting for trump,... Guess Again; Look out the window into Trump's America! For God's sake it a NIGHTMARE!
It‚Äôs the lawful thing to do, when the government is a lawless corrupt DOJ with Barr, giving special treatment to those that coverup to protect Trump.

Remember how they tried to make us feel bad for Dick Cheney's equally evil but more cowardly daughter cause her lord Trump turned on her? Respectability for them, corporate war and exploitation for everyone else
if you watch filthy rich, you'd see that trump cut ties with epstein over a decade ago. he used to be in the club, for intel. you can't get information on people if they don't trust you to share it.
After watching the speakers today sending off our patriot   I know our nation is better and stronger than Trump and his administration. Our VOTE MATTERS - every citizen 18 and older has the obligation to cast a vote on November 3rd.
That is the question but I do think trump has put the gop on the midwest track.  Probably won't help in 2020.  But if the electoral college projections are to be believed Romney 2012 plus Florida 31 plus ohio 17 and iowa 5 is  mid 260s

Trump does not care and he never will.
Openly rooting for a pandemic that destroyed our economy is a real good look for this pud  and the rest of  folks. Well done. Must be nice not worrying about a job or paying bills. You really owned Trump.
Trump the clown!
Hahahaha it‚Äôs true a lot of accounts going after trump because this guy was his lawyer on the impeachment trial , but not even one word about Clinton , or not even mention that Dershowitz has always been a democrat
Yea it was fun for a while but that kid madly in love with trump cant reason with stupid cant argue with ignorant.
We now face a huge increase in unemployment and the lowest GDP in history. This is as bad or worst than the GREAT DEPRESSION! All caused by Trump!
Reminder , he has always been a democrat , just changed to trump impeachment team because he said it was a total hoax (it was ) always was non sense that impeachment , but he is against trump he even campaigned against trump , you can‚Äôt make it up #ClintonCrimeFamily
I think Pelosi should impeach Trump on his failures with Coronavirus.   But we know she won't do that.
Trump doesn't understand science or economics. #TrumpHatesScience
Anyone else catch the part where Trump isn't a wannabe dictator because he hasn't tried to curtail free press or try to arrest political opponents...  Sometimes I feel like Trump thumpers simply refuse to pay attention, bc it's the only way to say this shit with a straight face.
Eeee he is a Democrat and the one mentioned on the documents is Clinton , no trump . Sorry you can‚Äôt make it up
True but the safer choice is biden imo hes the more likely to get trump out of office and for that reason alone he has my vote tbh

trump has done more for the black community than any other president other than abe. libs are making them feel oppressed for why? they're not. he's created millions of jobs, stocks and 401k have sky rocketed, he's providing other opportunities like low income areas, nasa, korea

Nah joe biden weird af too but theres no way trump is the better candidate so out of the two evils hes the better choice.
So far Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, Clinton are listed.... waiting for Trump to show up
At John Lewis‚Äô funeral, Obama didn‚Äôt have sense 2 know he was making a total fool of himself by spewing his hate 4 republicans. He accused them of the filibuster &amp; Jim Crow laws. Those were causes promoted by democrats. Trump Hate has made Obama crazy.
The hype is real! Can‚Äôt wait to see which puppets are getting roasted all night and tomorrow morning! Expect to see Bill C., Hillary, Trump, Melania, Prince Andrew, Weinstein, Musk, Bill Gates, Bezos, Piers, Murdoch, Rothschilds, etc. on there. About time they all got arrested.

Sandi, I find it very odd you promote yourself. If all roads lead to Trump, the evidence, PROVE IT. The Clintons have blood on their hands and incriminating evidence in stacks. Being in court as a crappy journalist means exactly that. Congrats on getting a glimpse of a pedophile.

President Donald Trump promised that a wall on the border would radically change undocumented immigration and customs enforcement. The president's wall isn‚Äôt as sturdy as he promised: Smugglers have been using a commercial saw to cut through it!
Without Republican checks and balances Trump has a lot of power to use towards those cheating ends. And an equally corrupt lunatic in Barr.
I don‚Äôt worry about President Trump‚Äôs tweets!  That‚Äôs how America knows the truth of what is going on.  He keeps in touch with Americans, which is much more than I can say about the democrats.
This is Trump's equivalence of burning the place down because he knows he's going to lose, so he might as well take down-ballot Republicans with him. This is what a malignant narcissist does.
Trump has not removed Fauci because of the appearance, Trump knows Fauci is not being forthright on Hydroxy..it works, pandemic would be slowed to a crawl..but can‚Äôt let that happen until November..
Trump clearly would have done same in 2016 if he lost, he would have dragged it out for as long as he could get away with.
Ah, taking those same creative liberties with reality that your orange dream supreme is so fond of taking. That's okay, puddin' pop. Next time, I'll use much smaller words and speak slower for you. Anyone who can honestly continue to support Trump at this point ain't too bright.

Trump is not the one oppressing voters, that would be your party. Mail In elections would take our vote away.
I never really understood what Republicans were about until ‚Äúthe Trump ‚Äú took office. Now it all makes sense. If you want to be controlled in any way,your on the right, if you want to converse and gather opinions and debate the best outcomes your on the left.
Remember when Obama ran for president he said he would always be transparent? He lied. Trump is brazenly transparent and dems are too blind to appreciate it.
32.9, 60, 0 - 32.9% drop in the GDP; 60 seconds - yesterday, an American died every 60 seconds from the coronavirus; 0 - the number of times  stood up for our troops in his latest conversation with Putin. This is Trump‚Äôs  cc

Real Republicans are not anti science. Uneducated idiots are anti science. Some of them seem to vote Republican because they think that Trump represents them. But no, Trump despises them, as he despises all other people. Give us back the real GOP. Intelligent and thoughtful.

It wouldn‚Äôt matter. US congress sets the E day at a national level; meaning it has to be on the same day for everyone. States have no control. Undermining would be a crime. There would surely be court battles but I‚Äôm pretty sure; in the end, Trump would be removed by Inaug Day.
You need to listen to what the Democrats want to do. Socialism is coming if Trump loses. More violence in states, and it will infiltrate into Republican controlled states. Higher taxes and less jobs, when the Democrats allow you to go back to work.

President Trump dont pay any attention to the once bullied bullies. People use to hate Clinton until Bush, same Obama, and now you. We all feel. The fact is people are scared for various and a combination of reasons. Nobody ever makes all the correct or wrong choices.
In the unlikely case that the election is delayed... Trump should not be the one in charge, but Congress.

If Trump was the CEO of any business other than   etc., he would be fired. If it were a Trump business, he would have his job but he would be filing for bankruptcy AGAIN... America doesn‚Äôt need this winning.

It's the Trump the virus
This drives me crazy. Trump IS focusing on all the things he listed.
That would be fine. Hillary conceded in a phone call to Trump on the night of the election.
It really would. I pray for everyone in this entire world. I pray for trump too. For him to make wise decisions. I pray for evil people and for dictators and for every person that has done me wrong.
Where has this man been while trump has been saying he might not accept the results of the election if it doesn‚Äôt go in his favor???
Trump probably sent condolences to Ben Carson's family.
You mean the Trump virus correct?
He's not going to try. It's another one of the lefts false rumors. The kefts wants to delay it not Trump. If we've learned anything these past 4 years is that what ever the lefts say is the direct oppose or just plain out right lie.
GOP Senators might want to listen to Calabresi. As flawed as polls can be, I sure haven't seen one indicate that Trump is helping any Republican win right now.
What a bunch of phonies. No wonder Trump stayed away.
don't forget about Donald Young...he was murdered... These Democrats will destroy us all to get rid of President Trump and cover their tracks
Trump has seen the #BlueWave on the horizon
You two have it WRONG. President  Trump  was asking  a question  so he could point out that mail in voting is not needed!!
FYI: Joe Biden's Cold War Criticisms Of NATO And Germany Sound A Lot Like Donald Trump
Amen! You are so right! Trump will win in HISTORICAL LANDSLIDE NUMBERS for the 2020 election. People have had their belly full of the Democrat BS!!!!
Why would Trump ever leave the Golf course when he can have others fail to lead the country?
Declaring a national emergency doesn't give him unlimited power. He messed up. We agree on that.... but ALL OF THEM DID. You should be pushing to have everyone in congress and the governors voted out just as much as you are pushing for trump to be. Be consistent with your anger
Trump is telling his supporters to vote in person. He knows ballots get lost in mail. He doesn't want his lost. Also setting up for the inevitable Dem surge after mail is counted, to claim foul. Also setting up for the inevitable "don't vote or you'll get covid" shaming by media.
here‚Äôs who‚Äôs responsible (that‚Äôs my belief) for Herman cain‚Äôs death &amp; too many others we don‚Äôt even know:  donald trump. He also knows that, which is why he makes everybody sign a liability waiver. He has no guilt or shame &amp; doesn‚Äôt give a damn.
Cool. So do you think trump could declare a national emergency because of the riots and violence right now and just send the military into these states/cities to put it down and the governors would just say "oh ok then"... no.
What a site to see! After visiting Double Eagle Energy's rig site, President Trump departed on Air Force One. As he was leaving, B&amp;L Pipeco Services rolled in loaded trucks to deliver a production string of casing.
At some point GOP folks need to count their losses and borrow themselves sense. A dead man isn‚Äôt valuable to trump, neither is trump valuable to a dead man. Protect yourself, stay alive and all else can be figured out after the pandemic is over. Stop play Russian roulette
Many people will dance in the streets when that happens. I for sure will be buying people drinks when Trump passes away.
i mean, in 2016 republicans settled for TRUMP to avoid CLINTON! people, get it together. let's get rid of this jackass. there is no valid excuse to do otherwise.
#VoteInPerson #Trump2020  #KeepTheFaith  Thank you President Trump for standing strong for the #SilentMajority who do not want the libs to silence our voices or the voices of the unborn. We cannot allow the #CancelCulture to overcome the righteous.
And as I said, ok let's say we agree and trump didn't do anything... why aren't you just as angry at congress for not stepping up at that point and doing something?
This won't work. Trump appointed a postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, to specifically slow the mail. The goal is not to increase revenue or efficiency. The goal is to sabotage mail-in voting no matter what.
To sum up - Trump is threatening to contest the #November3rd election results are if he doesn‚Äôt win. Try to keep the results in court if he can. Setting up, in advance, the election will be rigged if he doesn‚Äôt win. If this doesn‚Äôt concern U, U R not an American
No. Shan‚Äôt.   Journalists have afforded Trump a comfort zone for his lies and abuses, so don‚Äôt get defensive when your profession shares the criticism of a failed presidency.   You claim to be the Fourth estate, then act like it.
not sure. the are trying to put trump out but they've also been responsible for the election of hundreds of racist trash republicans.
Thank you   Trump is destroying every good &amp; decent thing about America. He‚Äôs dividing families, &amp; friends. He is the most corrupt, self-absorbed man on the planet and we can NOT survive another 4 yrs. #WeWillVote #RidenWithBiden
I can‚Äôt believe we had the damn cure and Trump let Herman Cain die.
I'm voting for Trump.  I firmly believe that he is the one to bring this economy back.  I believe he can bring back jobs to the US.  The pandemic was the worst of the worst the left could do to this country to stop the vote. That is all it is. They are evil.
Trump Kim contest the election all he wants to. He is still going to lose.

You are such a sycophant.  Trump calling it the China Virus when it has a NAME- COVID-19.  Trump let this virus get out if control b/c he got "bored".  This whole fiasco is on the R's. ALL OF IT! You said &amp; did NOTHING --. We the People will not forget this for a LOOOOONG time.

I dont blindly follow Trump smart guy. Trump isn't a politician which is why I voted for him as the success of leftist Operation Dumb Down for people such as yourself.
Senate Republicans are expected to roll out their $1 trillion plan Thursday, but deep divisions remain over a payroll tax cut President Trump wants.
BTW anyone without substantial amounts of being a piece of shit instantly knew the answer and would not be afraid to speak it.   No they did not deserved to be punished, and neither do these peaceful mothers, and more than anything why the fuck are you ok with the trump gustapo?
but never an actual trump, of course.
Even if legislation passes both chambers, it would need the signature of President Trump, who's opposed the removal of historic statues elsewhere.
yes, because trump is trying to leave it that way.
"I came here to be free, I'm voting for Trump, if only I can get past these Robocops in my way..." Trump campaign leans into Goya controversy in new Spanish ads

Here are some of the items President Trump touched on in his Wednesday coronavirus briefing.
The agreement is part of President Trump's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, under which multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being developed simultaneously. #Vaccine #COVID19 #Coronavirus
You'll have to ask Ghislaine Maxwell the first question, and Trump's concentration camps have migrant children instead, not any better in my estimation.  And it's "descent" not "decent".  The difference is, Trump is not a decent president.
Watch live: Trump Wednesday coronavirus briefing
The White House issued a 13-page statement expressing ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù about multiple provisions of the bill, including the renaming of some military institutions.
Watch Live: President Trump could send federal agents to Chicago, Albuquerque
Or 1.8 million lives saved from covid, 2 million was what we were told. So statistically Trump saved 1.8 million Americans. Has to be an American record. That is literally an awesome job. Thanks Mr. President
From what I can tell it starts at anything Trump disagrees with.
People always tell me that the left blames problems in the US on Trump for no reason like... he isn‚Äôt our president???
What ever is left after Trump gives it all away to Putin..
President Trump says federal agents could be deployed elsewhere as he makes law and order a central element in his struggling reelection campaign.
This is too much especially for a social studies teacher mentioning the president. Wow!
Biden, Obama discuss Trump's COVID-19 response in socially distanced conversation
Trump's COVID-19 briefing was 'exactly what Americans needed to hear,' Dr. Saphier says
When they asked for help in the past all trump did was steal PPE from blue states, so why let him know you are getting more stuff to stealI doubt it. They are determined to follow this clown right over the cliff. There are posts by his cult all over Facebook still arguing against wearing face masks, and lots still touting using trump's drug (hydroxychloroquine). Just unbelievable
It backfired, because Texas and Florida are red states, and we're being decimated because of idiot governors who want to please trump
OH NO JOE! Biden Blames Trump for Avoiding ‚ÄúIntercourse with the World‚Äù ...  via
Trump's in free fall. He's seeing his numbers going further down every day.  His campaign will try to come up with something that will appeal to more people, but with him, a loose cannon, they have an impossible job. We need to pay close attention because he's getting desperate
OH NO JOE! Biden Blames Trump for Avoiding ‚ÄúIntercourse with the World‚Äù ...  via  Who could possibly vote for this? MUST LISTEN
Abbott was more interested in pleasing trump than in protecting Texans. With his wishy-washy policies, he's really thrown us under the bus. I knew we were in trouble on Mother's day and all restaurants opened and i saw parking lots full. And his ambivalence on masks . Failure

I see all the trump cult out in force defending the use of that useless drug. I see it all over Facebook. One thing you can say about his entire cult is that trump appeals to the poorly educated and the stupid (he said that) and with all these clowns, you can't fix stupid!

donald trump, who is president of this country, is both an economic and national security threat to the entire world.  He's killed 150,000 Americsns, 40 million people unemployed, and the economy is in the toilet
Yes, and that sure didn't work out well. And he's trying to shift the blame for Cain's death on China, instead of saying that the trump virus spread to Cain because he refused to wear a mask

You idiot! You should be holding trump RESPONSIBLE. He totally  bungled the response, called it a hoax, refuses to mandate wearing masks. This is the "TRUMP VIRUS"
trump has no sense of humor! He isn't kidding
wow Texas is on the mapüìçJoe Rogan is moving here, Elon Musk is opening the new Tesla factory here, and Trump just came for a republican Party and sign some bills.  what‚Äôs going on.
Y'all spent $7 million to see Trump in Odessa when you should have used that to donate to  feed/shelter the homeless  get COVID-19 tests to those who need it  support BLM and LGBTQ+ movements  support your neighbors who can't pay rent this month due to unemployment  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wearing my mask, I would rather risk dying of Covid-19 by voting in an election office than to let Trump delay the 2020 Presidential election.
Are you shitting me? It‚Äôs ok to call out Biden for this but not trump for his shit on the same level?
I voted for Hillary, but a lot of people did not vote. By not voting, we "earned" trump.
Most Trump supporters don't belong to a "party".  I don't give a damn about a effin party.  And if ppl are not going to vote for him over this tweet, they're too stupid to be voting.
Trump tells Vanessa Guill√©n's family he doesn't want Fort Hood soldier's murder to be "swept under the rug"
This is absolutely true. It's not disrespectful, it just states facts. There is a pattern: follow trump by refusing to wear a mask and you are putting yourself and others at risk
Again, if ‚Äútriggering libs‚Äù is your basis for being involved in politics or blind allegiance to someone, you should 100% keep your unamerican ass out of it. There‚Äôs a fat chunk of decent republicans against trump.
‚ÄúIt also comes as he is trailing significantly in the polls to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who predicted in April that Trump would seek to push back the date of the election.‚Äù
I don't expect everyone to think the same, I just miss being around others with shared viewpoints.  P. S.--This is also in response to my hometown's seemingly uncritical excitement at having Trump visit. I get it; it's the president. But this is not just any president.
It would, but they won't. They are going to continue to cling to trump and will go down with his shipwreck in November, that is, the ones who survive
Cornyn has become a toadie for trump. Too stupid to understand that when the trump shipwreck goes down in November, it's going to take a LOT of these sychophants with him
And look at all the people he knowingly exposed. How many people are going to have to die to prove a point for trump.
Lots, and it's still happening. At the trump fundraiser in Midland, Texas, the vast majority didn't wear masks.
trump held a quasi rally here in Midland, Texas, and the vast majority were not wearing masks. Hope that hydroxychloroquine works for them

Let's be clear: the Republicans weren't for the AFFH rule in 2015, which is why they're using Trump as cover for repealing it now. Don't let them revise their way around this in 2020. "Oh, we supported the Rule, it was only that meanie Trump who did away with it!"

you haven't personally seen or heard him do this, so your only basis is what the media has reported. Be a free thinker...its so much more liberating than having someone tell you, show you, or instruct you how to think. And im pretty sure Pres Trump would agree with me on that.
Seems like the crimes and burning of buildings was on a daily rise until Trump stepped in. So sad you have not stepped into the light. You live and dwell in the darkness and can not see the light.

I, for one, support Trump's move to withdraw some 11,000 troops from Germany.  I don't think boots on the ground are necessary.  A steady campaign of drone strikes and carpet bombing should be adequate to break their spirit and win the day.

You helped answer the questions, how does Trump get away with all the lies and why has he not paid any price for them?
No sweetie, they said describe Biden not Trump.
There are riots in Portland involving criminal activity. To say Trump wants to fight ‚Äúmoms‚Äù and ‚Äúveterans‚Äù because he‚Äôs trying to help stop these riots is a disingenuous statement.
Genocide? That is a grossly false statement. And if we remove him, then that qualifies as going down as the greatest generation? Another ridiculous statement. You don‚Äôt have to support Trump, but to not support him for these reasons is asinine.
I wouldn't want to be in the same room with Trump &amp; discuss anything. Ever.

It is as if these idiots don‚Äôt realize that Trump is president for four years. They want us to think that Biden is some how the current POTUS and trump will bring change to that. Shit gets worse if trump stays that is the facts. All she cries about expands under him.
This is an utter lack of class and character. But it‚Äôs no surprise that the RNC tried it. Just donate one cent to Trump‚Äôs campaign instead of buying their garbage. It‚Äôll cost them a lot more than a penny to process.

If people are going to hold Cuomo accountable then they should also hold Trump accountable. That is all I‚Äôm saying.

People are calling out Cuomo for a poor response to the pandemic...it is apropos that one mentions the abysmal response by the president.  The same people complaining about Cuomo are the ones supporting Trump. Not that big of a leap.
And I love that Trump‚Äôs supporters like to trot out the ol‚Äô free speech defense...while simultaneously complaining that people are being disrespectful to America when they exercise their free speech by kneeling.  The irony and hypocrisy is palpable.

Did people in power make mistakes concerning Covid-19? Yes. Some corrected those mistakes, while others continued to spread lies and misinformation.  Guess which category Trump falls in?
Scientists and doctors have been saying for months now to wear a mask. Trump is a little late to the party.
It was a partial ban,not total.And the virus was here by way of Europe in the early stages.He didn‚Äôt ban anyone from Europe did he?Y‚Äôall keep pointing to 1 thing, ONE, that Trump did.He could‚Äôve saved many more lives by wearing a damn mask.He is the reason there are anti-maskers.
Unlike the actual facts about Trump: paid Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about their affair...stole money from kids‚Äô cancer charity...tried to coerce foreign interference in an election...shall I go on?
Yes, I recognize that it has been happening for a long time. Thank you for acknowledging that. You can see by my qualifier ‚Äúespecially,‚Äù that I know it‚Äôs been going on for awhile but It has gotten...wait for it...especially bad during Trump‚Äôs administration. Do you get it now?

So when the city council votes to disband the police department resulting in 20% immediately leaving it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault? Let me ask you, would you risk your life daily possibly orphaning your kids for a city that spits on you?
Come now, trump is a foot taller.
Don‚Äôt feel ashamed. The Chinese Government has stolen IP from the US for the last 30 years. Most US Presidents tolerate it to keep good relations. Trump simply called ‚ÄúBS‚Äù and told them to pack up and get out.

Omg he made a mistake, wow. At least he‚Äôs an eloquent speaker unlike Fraud in chief Trump! Person woman man camera Tv! Wow he can pass a simple memory test how impressive!!!

You obviously don‚Äôt know what John Lewis stood for ü§°. As if trump wouldn‚Äôt make a speech at a funeral about himself and how he‚Äôs the greatest president ever.
Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn‚Äôt want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis‚Äôs name! EVER!
You know what, forget I. I shouldn‚Äôt be insulting someone because I‚Äôm very privileged and was born into a wealthy family. If you think Donald Trump, despite the fact that he made our country a freakshow, will be a good President, vote for him. It‚Äôs your right.

President Trump, I respectfully disagree with your desire to delay the election.  I agree that the potential for fraud is high with mail in voting.  We need to come up with a solution to combat fraud, but not delay the election.  In person voting w/precautions against Covid.
Did Herman Cain receive the medication?  You guys are fools. The president is unhinged and has yet to broach the subject of Cain's death!  He doesn't care if you, your children or your parents die. He does not care about honor or country. He cares about Trump!
I came here for the ratio.
Trump is only tweeting it to distract from the news that the US is in recession. The Trump Recession.
I am PISSED OFF and I‚Äôve been no fan of Herman Cain‚Äôs politics!!  What an appalling waste that he would die for Donald Fucking Trump!!
What are you talking about? Didn‚Äôt you see the quotation marks? That was what Trump said in his ad, that we won‚Äôt be safe in Biden‚Äôs America and he will keep us all safe, but the irony is that absolutely nobody is safe in Trump‚Äôs America as showcased by the horrors occurring now.
No. Trump is now threatening to postpone the election.

Obama was never a true American citizen. Maybe Trump was right ‚Äî again.

Fucking  might be useless, but he is up for reelection.   Cornyn,  by the way, laughed it off ad another trump joke.
Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôd hope to delay. Because you know he‚Äôs going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?

Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?

Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?ü§™üòúü§™üòúü§™üòú
BREAKING NEWS: Cain, who called the coronavirus a hoax, spoke out against wearing masks, and most likely contracted it from a Trump Rally, has died from...  The coronavirus.
Another reminder that people need to take this shit seriously. Herman went to that Trump rally, strutting around without a mask, likely contracted the virus there and now he's dead because of his decision.
seems to be agreeing with me!  Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‚ÄòINACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äô vote
Anyone in Congress who, when asked, doesn't emphatically state that Trump can't delay the election needs to lose their seat.
They don't hate the drug, they hate Trump.  If Obama was in office the wonders of this drug would be leading every news channel in the US.
At the same time, his potential VP is threatening Trump voters with harassment
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
People are falsely claiming that if the election gets postponed that Pelosi with act as interim come Jan 20th when Trump's term is up per the Constitution, but this is false because literally every member of the House is up for reelection. Their terms are up same day, same time.
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‚ÄòTrump Respects The Constitution‚Äô, it is ‚ÄòTrump cannot garner the required support to do a coup‚Äô.

Yeah, when Trump crushes Biden!
About a week ago, I saw a meme of Trump with a bowl of mashed potatoes on his head.  Wish I had kept it.
It sends a clear signal to Putin that he should help get Trump re-elected and, in exchange, Trump will do whatever he wants him to.
Six...that‚Äôs how many conversations Trump has had with Putin since March when we learned that Russia put a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  And he didn‚Äôt bring this up in any of those conversations.
Is there a push to undermine President Trump?  Why won't the Republicans put on their gloves and fight fire with fire.  The Democrats are running roughshod over the Republicans.  I don't want socialism, government controlled healthcare, raised taxes, etc.
So, instead of quietly shifting troops to other areas, which would help a longtime ally save face, Trump makes a big, blowhard announcement the day after he had a meeting with his handler, Vladimir Putin.  Also, it's been three weeks since Bountygate. Not a word.
This is Trump‚Äôs America!
Could be on purpose, call it an experiment and you have ethics rules and such.  Great way to undermine that idiot Trump's plan
Those of you who are bystanders and cheerleaders of trump's corruption should make your break now.  Endorse Biden.  Change your legacies from "complicit traitors and criminals" to "merely useful idiots".  It's too late for the ringleaders.

It's none of business what trump and putin talk about....
JFK would roll over?  Are you high???  Stop with the comments.  You support a traitorous trump KKKlansman.  STFU
Are you seriously going to try &amp; argue it took 2 months to come up with a plan to slash unemployment, ignore the pending eviction crisis, while pushing $30B to DoD projects, $2B for a new FBI bldg to keep the Trump hotel afloat and better tax breaks for your lobbyists lunches?
Had that conversation with family member. Hates Trump for the grabbing comments. Thinks it's vile..blah blah...  "What about your idol Rod Stewart? You think he's done anything like that?"  I shit you not....."Well that's different!"

I served 4 years in US Army Intelligence &amp; Security Command, during the height of the Cold War. Trump is absolutely a traitor, and the ultimate ‚Äúuseful idiot‚Äù owned by the Russians.

As one of your constituents, I'll tell you what doesn't sound like a serious approach to passing the next COVID19 relief bill: - Waiting 2 months to pass a Senate bill - Including $1.8B for a new FBI HQ to prevent competition to the nearby Trump Hotel /1
No we wouldn‚Äôt. Many people sounded the alarm including Peter Navarro, as early as January 2020. That‚Äôs because pandemics are like forest fires; you‚Äôve got to contain with everything you‚Äôve got early. This is the Trump virus now. Own it.

In the Republicans' world, the politicians always trump health officials.
Yeah, he's called tRump
Please tell me how many times Obama made speeches vilifying Americans referring to them as radicals, criminals, and rioters. Please tell me how many speeches trump has given to unify the country or listen to his opposition? Trump‚Äôs go to is ‚Äúdemocrat city‚Äù

This is classic flawed thinking. Tax cut for the rich by trump A ok. Spending by Trump irresponsible but A ok compared to Dems bc one example of them wanting to spend more. Nevermind that Biden is on record he will roll back tax cuts on the rich and balance the budget.
I‚Äôm really not here supporting trump, but my dude sounds just like the old guys you visit at nursing homes, barely get words out. The White House is not going to treat this man well
Barr is a trump prick.
Anybody watch the ABC 20/20 on Covid?  Taped it, just now watching it.  I'd expect some rage tweeting from trump.
Agreed. The Trump name will be dust and this period a 2nd Dark Ages.
Reality? Hahahaha! If you were REALLY in reality, you'd know that Trump didn't cause any deaths. But Gov. Cuomo sure did. I would venture to say that Nancy Pelosi contributed to the death toll, as well as Mayor De Blasio.
So basically if you make a good appearance on TV and seem to agree with Trump, he wants to consider them an expert. He doesn‚Äôt even vet these people to make sure they are credible. He counts on his supporters being dumb.
Guess he‚Äôs anticipating Trump‚Äôs incarceration.
You are not a happy person.  Whether it's because you have chosen a corrupt political stance; your physical appearance, whatever.  You have chosen to take it out on President Trump.  Perhaps, you are afraid of Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer.  You need to resign!
I think the devil made that deal. Not trump.
We definitely need progress.  Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat‚Äù America is a disaster.
Yes, sick of Trump and supporters.
Its going to be tough, but I believe if we all stay vigilante and not yield to the thugs at the ballot box ( they will be there), we will save our DEMOCRACY and send trump where he belongs.Either Russia in exile or prison.

Trump has a lock on most ignorant president in history.
It‚Äôs about time!  I have no children but I wouldn‚Äôt send mine to school.  Trump wants everything opened and back to where it was pre-pandemic so he can campaign on how well he handled everything.  He doesn‚Äôt care about the people that will die to make him look good.
Pretty sure I'm taking the next day off. I'll be up late waiting for them to reluctantly declare Trump the winner. Biden will win a handful of states, and they'll Harper on that all night.
Trump abides by the rules now news has to ask "are the masks really safe?"
Hey Chuckles the virus is here and 150,000 people possibly more are dead. Trump has no plan. He golfs every weekend while people keep getting sick. When will you see his incompetence? If he was a Democrat you would be screaming for his head. Your hypocrisy is showing.
Trump's is the most corrupt administration in the history of this country.    Anyone who supports trump is either a criminal or a fool.  Or both.
President Trump continues to criminally withhold and redact those files. With Trump's new file-release deadline in 2021, the JFK Act remains the defining, still unspeakable aspect of the 2020 election.
Covering their butts.  When you hang out with people in the gutter, you don't bring them up, they take you down to their level.  Republicans are in the gutter with trump.

Yep, which is why Trump should have been removed from office.

So now you're NOT a Reagan Republican.... got it.... they dont want you anymore either....Yeah i read a very little of the report and if he followed the domestic plan it might not have gotten as bad. Even with the states being closed people were protesting to reopen and the states were losing money so they opened sooner so some of it really cant be all on trump right?
So idk how reality is anti trump.
Isn't vox anti Trump? Even when he does good, they either twist it or dont write anything about it. I could go to google and look up either, "Why is Trump a racist?" or, "How is Trump not a racist?" and get thousands of articles going either way. I could also look up

I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.

In 2016 I had serious issues with Hillary &amp; her team.  Remember she supported arming Ukrainians to fight Russians, just for ex.  I know Trump is bad but I will need to believe that Biden is not going to be also bad, in an assortment of slightly different ways than Trump is bad.

Trump's also incestuous.
There are many women who want and can be houewives. But he is lumping working women and housewives together into one group. They are a separate breed and both should be treated with respect.  I'm doubtful that trump respects women regardless of whether they work or not.

Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.

Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn‚Äôt leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.

The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!

Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?

I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.
Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the marquee event for the president's self-proclaimed reelection campaign kickoff.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Everything Trump touches, dies.  Ask Herman Cain.  Oh wait. You can't. He's dead.  Mask denier, dead today from Covid.
I sure as heck hope he doesn't support Trump's desire to postpone the election.

Trump lost the popular vote by 4% in 2016.
Obama fought for what he believed in and would not back down.  Trump does the same thing.  Mitt, rolled over, and still does whenever the Leftist press put pressure on him.
You mean conman.  Not businessman.  Lmao it's funny that people like you even still exist I'm not sure if its dishonesty or stupidity but to almost every human being on this planet besides a small % of clowns in this country know what Trump is.  It's sad, I feel bad for you.
Do you think the Trump crime family will wait until January to flee the country, or will they be headed to Moscow as soon as the polls close on November 3rd?
You Starting to realize you've aligned yourself with actual criminal scum traitors?  Is it dawning now Adam?  Just a bit? A shred of realization of what You have promoted, because believe me if Trump slides us into fascism, this tweet doesn't eliminate the last several years.
68% of ‚ÄúTrump voters‚Äù maybe.
Fun fact: misleading information about an election (like saying absentee = good, mail in = bad) with the goal of suppressing votes is a good reason to report a tweet. It'd be SUCH  a shame if everybody did this and Trump faced a consequence for once
Man! I do love it when you screw with the Liberal's brains President Trump! ü§£
... cowards or taking an anti-Trump position? ... almost certainly both ...
Yes, vote for Biden to turn us back to the conditions that created Trump in the first place just so he can say he supports these progressive policies, only to do nothing about them.  We had one chance to crush facism in this country, and you centrists dropped the ball.
This is one of the scariest things I have seen Trump tweet...and that is saying a lot.
Just another sellout Black azzzh01e being paid to suppress Black support of President Trump what a disgrace
Marco Rubio is a spineless coward and a yesman of a politician, unworthy of public office.   Not only has he debased himself for Trump, he KNOWINGLY allowed Covid to ravage Floridians in exchange for temporary political expedience.   Vote lil Marco out.
Trump seems to think he can delay elections. Throw this guy out of office already.
This dude is the  ‚Äúrapid response‚Äù director Lolololol   Hard to believe Trump is polling so badly with online representation like this
Nah, Trump supporters are NOT that way at all
It‚Äôs up to Congress not Trump
Trump is behind in Texas.
This is called Projection!! They call him a ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù daily. With Zero proof!! They project what they are!! Who got Criminal Justice Reform done? Opportunity Zones? Record funding to Black Colleges? Trump did! He is the worst ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù ever!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  #MAGA

I disagree, to every Trump supporter, the election is November 15th now.
Hey  as your constituent, I'm curious to know whether you believe it is appropriate for President Trump to float the idea of delaying the election.  I'll hang up and listen.
I wonder who will replace you in a few months. I wonder why y‚Äôall never stay long. Trump talks about bring in more jobs but he‚Äôs fired more people in his administration than has ever been in all administrations combined so who be  number 9,997.
don't forget he has 'perfect' sex every time!  turns out he does know everything ha
Must be true. Look at Trump
appointed by Trump, what would you expect?
Love the NBA but they‚Äôre the most hypocritically professional sports league. Speak up to Trump, but hush up for their communism leaders #puppets
This is odd logic as it's QUITE EASY to confirm the violence going on in democratic states, it's pretty laughable really how everyone ignores it cause they hate the orange man so bad, theyd willingly become vassals like good sheep so they are spared. Bad trump bad!!

I'm in west Plano and I've seen three Trump flags. No yard signs for either candidate but I'm sure that's due to HOA restrictions. We aren't putting any Biden signs in our yard; 2020 is so crazy that we don't want to be a target.
Isn‚Äôt president trump still in office for ALL of his transgressions? Or we‚Äôre not ready for that convo
No, you're not the only one, Monica. This is just one of Trump's peculiarities that I do not like or understand. Another example, if he knew HCQ cured Covid-19 way back in March, shouldn't he by EO mandated it's usage and saved many of the seniors' lives?
The test he took was a dementia test, and said the questions about months was the hardest... Trump has an equal amount of scandals. Just know, I hate Biden just as much as you do if not more, both are horrible for the country and all around horrible people.
Bluer areas are near the border more than ever now cause Trump's put them through so much shit.
Our country is divided but not defeated. We really need to pull together and tell Putin that we don‚Äôt want a country like his and  run Trump out of our white house
If you listen 2 Mary Trump's Interview &amp; read her book it speaks volumes of what a mad man we have in our Oval Office. It's crystal clear he's lying about the Bounty to protect Putin. Without ? Trump is THE biggest TRAITOR this country has seen in a long time.
Every time U get caught with your pants down U ALWAYS USE "A lot of People are Saying" YET we NEVER hear who these people are. It's a PATTERN-CHECK OUT TRUMP'S RECORD 2 PROTECT PUTIN:  #Helsinki #Kurds #Bounty #Germany INTENTIONALLY Endangers Allies-OUR Troops!
It boggles the mind ANY AMERICAN will even bother 2 listen 2 a Pathological LIAR over what Scientists &amp; Doctors have told us over and over. If Trump is talking about the virus just turn your TV off, quit listening 2 someone who's ALWAYS WRONG! Don't allow him 2 make U a statistic
Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE

Sure thing boss.

Because a black man started it &amp; Trump went crazy
Getting help would be an admission (his brain) that he needs it &gt; in HIS mirror he still looks much the same...so he still does everything himself.....not trusting anyone to create that awesome Trump winning look ha....   * that cheap bronzer is quite the puzzle tho....
trump was in texas and none of yall wanted to recreate november 22nd, 1963? what a shame.
Damn third world country thinking they're smarter than us ! HUH?  Buddy we've got TRUMP...the Mr. Pillow Man....and now a true ringer - The Alien Demon Seed Witch Doctor - we don't need no stinkin' masks here....we kick ass #1
How do you see the future of America? Are you praying that Trump will save you? He‚Äôll be gone in four years. Then what will you do? Find another savior? Or finally wake up and start saving the country yourself?
Donald Trump is the worst person in the history of our country. Must be spawned from #DemonSperm.
Trump's already taken care of that. 155,000 dead Americans and counting. 40 million lost jobs. Trillions in new debt. No strategy, no plan, promoting fake cures. Now go inject your Lysol.
Every day I read profiles that include the word conservative yet the timeline is constantly begging the government to do something. Do you realize that means you‚Äôre not really a conservative? The only thing I want Trump to do is do his job. Jail lawbreakers. All lawbreakers.
Now do Trump.
If God's in control, he hates Trump
If Trump wins this election, either by fair or dishonest means, the dollar will crash and we will be done for as a world power. Standard of living will drop. Alt-reality will be here to stay.
The more and more these undocumented people riot and protest, only makes me vote for Trump even more.
Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's wet dream.  He bows in submission to Putin, giving him ANYTHING he wants.    One of Russia's greatest wishes has been the withdrawal of Americans from our European allies.  Putin's slave (Trump) is withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.
So long as you act (in your daily life) like your views and your values don‚Äôt matter, guess what‚Äôs going to happen? They‚Äôre going to be ignored. People are filled with frustration over all the evil stuff going on, yet the knee-jerk reaction is to beg Trump to do something.
I think Trump is a great choice.
I fully expect him to end a press conference with a thumbs up and say "Vote Trump 2020"
Imagine paying the same for Trump‚Äôs roundtable as he paid for stormy Daniels‚Äô silence.
She‚Äôs trying to talk shit about us for hating Trump but then she ends up blocking us! Makes sense
Trump‚Äôs acceptance is not required.    Of all Trump‚Äôs tricks, his best is to get his opposition to defend a corrupted system. By saying he won‚Äôt automatically accept the results of the election, his opponents commit to defending the election results if there is interference.
Well, the cult conspiracy vote is a very important segment of the Trump electorate. He's gotta go where his strengths are.  "Trust the plan." McGruber! üí•üî•üí•

America has completely lost its mind. Either you're smart enough to be really worried, Or you're just too [fill in the blank] to care. Every single day with Trump is Russian Roulette.
Nope, just telling the truth. The truth hurts  doesn‚Äôt it. Mr. Trump
Actually Trump pulling troops out from Germany is not that big a deal and might in fact be good. *closes app*
I didn‚Äôt call Trump a racist. I‚Äôm not asking you to not call me racist. You could call me a cunt for all I care. You are entitled to your opinions. Some will hurt, but only the ones that have personal history. But that‚Äôs my own burden to carry.
Shoot  why not sooner if it's so important?  How long have you had the authority to do this?  One would think that it would have been done long ago unless this is a purely political move.  I'm not a Trump supporter so not saying it has anything to do with him.
The same reason the in-depth investigation into the Trump family‚Äôs fraudulent tax schemes was met with a collective yawn. How does he get away with this??
It looks like a world in which Trump enablers have been knocked out of the majority in the Senate, and I'm all in for that.
We agree. So endorse Biden.  It's the only patriotic option. We cannot survive another 4 years of this. Mary Trump knows it. We know it. You know it.
Trump is flying to West Texas, which is the center of the universe for global warming denial - literally the cryptonite behind the entire anti-science genetic sequence of the Republican party. Great place to re-energize their lunacy.
The Bots on Twitter are saying #NobodyLikesTrump  Which means nothing because 95% of America Loves Trump!
Be careful GOP you may turn off women on either side of aisle l think this is a time in history that l say tread carefully painting everyone as a progressive liberal does not fly with Trump in office such a strong fiscal conservative with great character

'They didn't run the plays': Ex-officials say Trump administration didn't use pandemic 'playbooks'  I don't know how he could have been more clear?? He had Dr Fauci and Dr Birk up there everyday for about a month telling us what they knew for us to do!
We took away my Mom's keys and then my Dad's.   It meant more driving for us, but it kept everyone safe.  When it's time, loving family steps in.  That's the problem for Trump - he has no loving family &amp; his supporters don't like him either.

He never respected President Trump. He never had the decency or etiquette to show any respect to our Commander and Chief so I think President Trump has done the right thing!Don't blame Trump for coronavirus deaths. Majority of Covid + people that die are obese with DM2 and hypertension, COVID- 19 just finished them off.
POTUS continues to erode public faith in elections. Does Trump work for the SVR/FSB? or is he an agent for the GRU? Obviously directed by Putin. Or - he could just be a kook.
I signed up for mail-in voting, but if Trump screws with the USPS and I can't trust my mail in ballot will be counted or delivered, I don't care if I have to drive 100 miles, stand in line for a week, wearing a mask, in temperatures below 0, I'm VOTING on November 3, 2020.
Don't believe Trump's team makes many, if any, mistakes. Sorry, not sorry! These criminals will not be able to walk down the street.
2015 when tRump decided to run
Lots of Trump/Putin calls of late....coaching sessions perhaps. ü§î
2020 has unveiled that there's a lot more racists in America than you originally thought.  Trump has brought back out all the racist termites out of the woodwork that otherwise wouldn't feel emboldened to spread those beliefs.  He makes xenophobes and bigots feel comfortable.
They‚Äôre going to test a straight-jacketed trump with face guard, because polls show  MAGAmericans like them some crazy
As if YouTube didn‚Äôt just censor licensed doctors from sharing vital Information to the American public, it‚Äôs not science the Trump ‚Äúcult‚Äù is in denial of its the mainstream media and big tech.
Forget the hypocrisy and think about it this way. Repubs got wiped out in 2008 when the incumbent at fault for the mess wasn't even on the ballot. Consider how many more rats are deserting the Trump ship versus Bush.
It won‚Äôt matter, she has it all documented and secure as a backup plan.   If she dies it will ALL come out.   Hey will have to choose who to pin all this shit on.  We will never know all.  As you can bet both parties are involved.  I just think Trump has made too many ppl mad.
But may he still RIP...I just wish he had followed science instead of Trump.üôèüèª
This is FALSE. It‚Äôs floated around last 1 1/2 years. Maybe 2 years. Trump loves WOMEN, period. We‚Äôve known that forever. STOP LYING!
You are correct.  I misstated my facts...over 80% of immigrants come in via air...however it's only 40% that overstay their visas and become undocumented immigrants.  I am not a republican nor blind trump follower so I can admit when I am wrong..
Trump knew and Definitely knews what he was doing. The pandemic was an Excellent excuse for him to throw the Election off.The worse it got and the more he denied it being real (which he knew it was) Was all trickery. If he made thing bad enough people wouldn't  be able to vote.
They have to do this in order to get him to do anything. Trump runs on hamberders, diet coke, stimulants, and, most importantly, flattery.
Sort of like "collusion" and "conspiracy". Trump folk sure do like their obnoxious semantics arguments
Only Congress can write immigration law. That‚Äôs in the law books. Activist judges are demanding that the Trump admin break the law as it is written.
Trump Murdered him!
New theory, Trump is only hiding tax returns because he can't let his kids find out they have no real money (Ivanka knew and locked down Jared's fortune).
And your a dispicable liar. Herman Caine had stage 4 cancer and had chemotherapy. Those are the kind who die from COVID. It was HIS CHOICE TO GO TO THE RALLY. NOBODY FORCED HIM. He DID wear a mask. Who cares what you want to make up so Trump looks bad. You look bad for lying.
I think it‚Äôs Trump and GOP.  He hired Acosta.  Epstein died on his watch.   The Netflix doc showed Trump.   I think August is going to be pretty interesting...
The guy that cut the deal with Epstein to keep Epstein free...Trump appointed as Labor Secretary.  Epstein died under Trumps watch.   He wished Ghislane well.  And then there are all the pics.   All roads lead to Trump.   Beautiful August it will be.  üëçü•≥ü•≥

you get the ballot via mail after you verify registration for that election cycle via the personal information. Then you fill out the ballot. You have to sign it and provide a phone #
Personal info no one would know unless you were majorly hacked. SSN, b-date, name, address, etc... a few more things I can‚Äôt remember. To prove you are you. Then they send the ballot. They have your signature on file as well.

I just say, be informed. Really be informed. If you agree with Trump‚Äôs policies, vote for Trump. If you don‚Äôt, then don‚Äôt. But sadly, I feel like he‚Äôs already planning on losing and therefore blaming voter fraud. Be informed. Understand the likelihood of fraud actually happening

Trump should give Americans the proof that votes will be bad, fraudulent or somehow wrong! State voting commissions do NOT HAVE proof. Trump‚Äôs dementia is starting to effect him. Sad. He should drop out.
I honestly don‚Äôt remember. I registered years ago. But with the information they expect with each voting cycle, you‚Äôd have to be majority hacked with identity theft before anyone could impersonate you. MAJORILY! Easier to get an ID than go thru this
YES WE ARE!!! President Trump!

Giddy Kitty Trump Kitty.
No wonder you filled the bill with unnecessary PORK. The FBI BUILDING. Do you honestly think Americans are interested in building a new building in the same place so no hotel developer can put a real hotel next to Trump‚Äôs. Big payday for Trump. You are a bunch of goons.

I don‚Äôt like trump but let be far

Had Trump not stopped travel it would have been much higher! Quadruple geniuses Pelosi and Schumer criticizing his every move.  The rioting sure isn‚Äôt by Trump supporters but glad you are acknowledging that they are rioters. Now will Democrat mayors and Governors do something?
It‚Äôs only a handful of states that send out mass mail-in-ballots. Not sure which states. But you have to see if those states alone would swing an election to validate your conspiracy theory. Those are the only possible states that fraud is likely to occur.
Senate majority leader, it is time for you to get out of the way of Trump and keep quiet on the edge of the swampy, OR you can get busy passing legislation the House passed months ago. Know why?? It is obvious you want to show little production from the pitiful Senate.
I respectfully disagree since my state allows us to register in advance and mail in our ballots. Can‚Äôt speak for all state, but you also can‚Äôt call ALL mail-in-ballots fraudulent. You have to be rigistered and eligible to vote.

Your reply sounded like you were talking about the mail-in-voting. I tried to say that even Trump‚Äôs own studies that he funded came back that the mail-in-voting was a 6 in 1 billion chance of fraud. Not enough to sway an election. Read for yourself
Sorry Lyndsey, it is your fella Trump that began the politicizing of courts. Just watch Yrump and Barr.
You know I was thinking if Biden would say China if You got information on Trump show us the emails. The other side would be outraged, But should they be?

So we will have to worry about your tweets until you become president? What if trump stomps you like you know he will? Will your tweets still be worrisome? What a dumb tweet
You have no morals at all. When your out,I pray your investigated and held to the same laws you and trump family though didn't apply to you people. Republicans are without morals and know,if they loose power this election it will be 10 yrs before we trust them a little again.
Trump can't delay the election. But his tweet is terrifying           (by Erwin Chemerinsky)
You mean if Trump showed up, the ultimate conman? He would be an uninvited interloper bragging about himself  President Obama said what John Lewis could no longer say. He was invited. He honored John and made it all about John and John's legacy.
You have no problem with trump funneling payments,made just below the amount to have to report to IRS,In 48 separate payments. Hes paid his own companies and JR's üòø Millions of dollars funneled through her company and parscals company got 39 million. Why small payments,no trace?

I could go on, but honestly, help me understand. I don‚Äôt see anything good about his policies or his ethics. I‚Äôm not a fund all the illegals, either. He‚Äôs a bully. Honestly, with his approach, all of his ‚Äúwinnings‚Äù are not sustainable.
Trump Giddy Kitty #Trump #catslovetrump2020 #POTUS #FLOTUS
Yes and that generation will be out voted soon enough.  It is coming.  Fact.   Everyone actually knows it.  That is why Trump is saying is you vote for Biden, things will never be the same.  Regardless we are as a nation due to the younger..headed that direction.
He‚Äôs blantantly trying to defund government funded entities and fund them with capitalist companies. It may be the right thing to do... not sure, but then open it up for competition. Not just his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.
Trump cheated in the last election so of course he is trying to cheat this one too.
Mr neither. I read about it but never actually saw it. Here you go
He could have done this in March.  Too late Donnie. People are jobless. People are hungry. People going homeless.  People are dying.  Trump delivers for Putin. Putin wants Americans dead. #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump  #VOTE
The Republicans and Tricky Donny Trump setting up the post office for failure and to stop mail in voting to try and keep their jobs in Washington and so he can manipulate a te-election this is CRIMINAL
He‚Äôs the epitome of white privilege. How do you think he understands what the real working man is going through? He doesn‚Äôt believe in Science? But he wants Science (vaccines) to save us from Covid?
Her ads in Arizona are disgusting and typical Trump style. I voted against her once and I will vote against her again. Kelly will do a good job.
Help me understand how you think Trump is helping? I see a country in more turmoil now than I ever recall in my life. He‚Äôs all about capitalism, but at all cost. He‚Äôs not a man of the people. How could he be? He‚Äôs never had to earn anything on his own.
Not that I need to explain myself, but Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories are not based on real, viable facts. You don‚Äôt have to be dem or rep to see that. Find the proof. If you find the proof of all of Trump‚Äôs claims, please show them to me.

Biden is not really a step.  It will take a long time to undo the damage Trump has done.  Biden is a start.  Voting for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.   Trump is honestly more than 2 steps back, than the direction you want the country to go.

Yeah, and like being trump‚Äôs campaign manager is something to brag about...or admit to.

Exactly what President Trump is doing.  Expose the deep state, send them to Gitmo, reverse decades of regulation that were meant to hinder small businesses, and implement a new digital dollar backed by Gold (....wait for it - should be October).  Even more is coming!
Puh -leeze! ALL of the parents I know are terrified to send their children to school without changes in how the learning is provided &amp; proper social distancing measures in place. Biden supporters are NOT radical, but rational thinkers. Everything tRump is just wrong for everyone.
Why? Is he going to deliver it to PUTIN? Trump delivers to PUTIN.  #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump
You mean like how Herman was safe in Trump's America after he was made to sign that waver? Right.......................... You are pitiful excuse for a man.

Lol.  It‚Äôs hilarious how you cultists cling to that one story.  How about Trump making Acosta a member of his cabinet?

No do Acosta being a member of Trump‚Äôs cabinet.  Now do ‚ÄúI wish her well.‚Äù  If you don‚Äôt think Epstein killed himself (I don‚Äôt) do you even realize you‚Äôre accusing Bill Barr of covering up his murder?
Yes I agree.  But Eisenhower was a war hero.  And Trump is a crook and a disgrace to humanity.

#TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump Trump delivers for Putin.
I hear ya seester. Things are crazy. I don't wish ill will on any person, but I do wish Trump supporters would wake up and smell the coffee or the science, or we'll continue to see the death toll rise. They wouldn't eat spoiled food if a doc said it was bad, why not listen now?
Why does most of DC get to go to John Lewis's funeral yet we can't be with our families when our loved ones die?!? It's all political! You know you can't beat Trump at the polls! Just wait until November!
Excuses for Trump losing. But it just might be he is a loser and nobody likes him.
Oh, you mean the Trump virus?  The one you ignored for months? The one you said would go away? That virus?
That says so much about you, not Trump.
October surprise is a rehash of the supposed spying on trump in 2016. Possible indictments coming for Obama and Biden plus dozens more. Do you think that with everything going on anyone is going to care?

YOU are the one not understanding. And obv haven‚Äôt read the thread where I started off by saying that an absentee ballot you need to request and the mail in voting Trump is speaking of you do not. Many states have strict rules over WHO can get an absentee. Don‚Äôt be rude
No, I feel sorry for us as a nation.  I'm including his cult, they have lost too.  He was damaged all of.  Internationally, we are suffering due to his inept leadership.  We and generations after us will pay for his 4 years of terror.  Trump and the GOP have given us PTSD.
So, do you get paid to lie and apologize for trump, or do you do it for free?
Trump retweeted one of his supporters yelling white power.
That's a rapid response?   Snide remark about a puppet show.  Trump should be running for president of his third grade class.
Wishing his family peace and comfort.  So many have tragically died for no other reason then trump's stupidity.
USPS will be lucky to make it.  trump does not want mail-in ballots.  He will do whatever it takes.
I'd like to see Andrew Cuomo and trump in a cage match.
The power to remove Trump from office.
‚ÄúTo some degree‚Äù is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
I miss when we had REAL Presidents.  Pres. Obama, Pres. Bush and Pres. Clinton.  Now we have cheeto trump...killing us.
TRUMP is the only person to give up his salary.   We have 446 former members of Congress who receive government pensions who are lobbyist on both sides of aisle.   Does that make any sense? NO. We even have people in prison who receive pensions.   We need to end this madness.
But she called it a republican hoax, right? Of course she made fun of trump, everybody makes fun of trump. He's a clown. We elected a man with no political experience, no previous employment, no military service, as POTUS. A vainglorious braggart and bully.
Larry, there's always a tweet. ‚ÄúLeadership: Whatever happens, you‚Äôre responsible. If it doesn‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôre responsible.‚Äù Trump 2013
So, Dems forced Trump to hold his last rally and made Herman go to it without a mask? Can you find that clip of Nancy saying it will go away like a miracle? All those libs discrediting Dr. Fauci? Calling the virus a hoax? I'll wait.
If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about ‚Äúmail in voting‚Äù, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.
I guess Trump is right and the campaign is going fine.
Trump has never, and this is true, owned a pet, let alone a dog. Think about that.
Yes, we will crack open some trump vodka, grill some trump steaks, stare for a moment at our diploma from trump U, then catch a trump shuttle to Atlantic City to gamble at one of his fine casinos. Like that.
Oh, you think he was happy? Lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator? Other than a tax break for the wealthy, tRump hasn't kept any of his promises. Turns out he wasn't too busy to gold and Mexico didn't pay for the wall. Economy in the toilet and 150,000 dead. Whee!
Pretty sure we all knew that. If you didn't before, Trump was playing that card pretty strongly (ü§≠)about a month or so ago.
Cannot wait to vote Trump gone on 10/3
My worry is also that now Trump has installed one of his flunkies to run the USPS. Do I trust him to get ballots where they should go? Nope!
I love them. Such pretty ladies!!!  Dogs are the best.  My dogs have really been supportive during this time.  Here they are when trump is on TV.  Keno turns his back and Jamie hides in her bed.  (I may have made this up.)

trump still wont pay respects to Civil Rights Leader John Lewis. trump is a disgusting and corrupt president.
That's Donald Trump. Instead of celebrating a civil rights leader like John Lewis he would rather celebrate stupidity in Herman Cain. All is had to do was wear a mask but when you listen to stupid you do stupid things and his stupidity took his life.
Don‚Äôt get me started on the millions of $ grifted by the trump family in the past 4 years.  He‚Äôs a failure and a farce.  #Biden2020
tRump wants to delay the election but he does not have the power to do that. Can Congress move election day sooner? Let's say in SEP. Let's end this madness of a blatantly inept regime. Or we are still stuck with the sycophants in the Senate who would block the move?
I can‚Äôt stand Trump and cannot wait until he‚Äôs gone - but on this he is correct. If you want to vote absentee, you must request a mail ballot for each election cycle. If we were to use mail in ballots, they would just be mailed to all registered voter at their last known address
I love America, and for that reason I would NEVER vote Trump
I can‚Äôt stand Trump, but there IS a difference. An absentee ballot must be requested by the voter. Mail in ballots would be mailed out to all registered voters.
My vote didn‚Äôt go to Trump in 2016, but the man thought I ‚Äúlistened‚Äù to and supported him because I follow him on Twitter.   He‚Äôs the President of the United States.  Regardless of what I, or anyone else, think(s), his opinions matter and are being misrepresented ALL THE TIME.
It's tragic. I am sorry he listened to trump.  I wish his family peace and comfort.

Trump is trolling Mr. Turley.  He does this all the time.
Herman Cain at the Trump rally.
I feel as though crediting a president with jobs is like crediting him with low gas prices and the stock market (both of which Trump has done). However, he has no real effect on any of those things. Can you genuinely say your standard of living is better now than it was in 2015?
Obama was never a true American citizen. Maybe Trump was right ‚Äî again.
‚ÄúPretty good‚Äù - only 160+ who should NOT be dead. If folks like you &amp; Trump would stop lying about masks &amp; hydroxychloroquine. And, why is it always ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù or ‚ÄúLiberals with you?‚Äù How about Democrats, Independents, doctors, nurses, and MOST Republicans?
Speaking of Cain. Why hasn't Trump responded to his death? He is the one responsible for it after all. Had it not been for that unnecessary rally Cain would still be alive. Makes Trump an accomplice to        ,  I will let you fill in the blank.
Something about trump should be trending.  How about #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpIsKillingAmericans  #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpIsNotWell   Any of those?

Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôd hope to delay. Because you know he‚Äôs going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Trump is such a petty, small, jealous man.
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?
Trump's America
is trying to distract from John Lewis's funeral.  Because trump is a petty little man who will always be overshadowed by greater men. And women.
Honestly, now that Trump has his high donor flunky running the USPS, I no longer want mail in voting - because I do not trust that Dems will receive their ballots or that those ballots will make it back to be counted via the USPS.
Everyone calm down. Trump has no control over this. If he does somehow causes a non-election then the right people are in place to remove him within 48 hours.
He went to one trump rally too many.
Trump had nothing to do with that. Propaganda!
Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?
I think 1 way would be to have Secys. of States loyal to Trump refuse to certify the results?
I remember my oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.  Trump and every elected Republican who supports trump's assault on the Constitution is the enemy.
I cant wait to see all the Trumpers trying to call bs on the election.  Clowns.  I'm ready for them to feel the pain I've felt having to deal w/ Trump's sorry ass for the last 4 years.   Literally the WORST president ever. EVER.  (Yes I would have taken Hillary over him, stfu)

Hi, I'm planning on voting in person, is that still allowed? Or do I need to sign something promising to vote for Trump? Is that how democracy works now?
Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Apply that logic to red state management; for instance Gov Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, Herman Cain chose to go to the Trump rally and he appeared to be having a wonderful time. RIP, Mr. Cain.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?ü§™üòúü§™üòúü§™üòú
BREAKING NEWS: Cain, who called the coronavirus a hoax, spoke out against wearing masks, and most likely contracted it from a Trump Rally, has died from...  The coronavirus.
He committed suicide willingly for Trump. Nobody made him go, as far as we're aware.
Another reminder that people need to take this shit seriously. Herman went to that Trump rally, strutting around without a mask, likely contracted the virus there and now he's dead because of his decision.
seems to be agreeing with me!  Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‚ÄòINACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äô vote
Anyone in Congress who, when asked, doesn't emphatically state that Trump can't delay the election needs to lose their seat.
They don't hate the drug, they hate Trump.  If Obama was in office the wonders of this drug would be leading every news channel in the US.
At the same time, his potential VP is threatening Trump voters with harassment
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
People are falsely claiming that if the election gets postponed that Pelosi with act as interim come Jan 20th when Trump's term is up per the Constitution, but this is false because literally every member of the House is up for reelection. Their terms are up same day, same time.
Trump suggests delay of election:         Good suggestion because: 1) Resolving pandemic. 2) fraudulent mail in voting. #1
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‚ÄòTrump Respects The Constitution‚Äô, it is ‚ÄòTrump cannot garner the required support to do a coup‚Äô.

If we have learned anything so far, it is that Trump is perpetually full of shit. But Democrats are not prepared for an event where Trump/Republicans see the writing on the wall and tell their voters to stay home, purposefully staging the results to make them look fraudulent.
Too bad we can't just pretend there's no trump..  Donald Trump‚Äôs Campaign Is Pretending There‚Äôs No Pandemic

Because that one epidemiologist agrees with Trump.  And Dear Leader can never, ever be wrong.  I mean, what's the point of joining a cult if one must apply critical thinking skills?
This is the doctor the President, his idiot son and all the conservatives were retweeting yesterday.  She *literally* called it a cure.

So you missed this video being pushed by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Breitbart and a host of other conservative outlets?  Sure...

Are they going to talk about the money Trump enterprises is skimming from the RNC?
Yeah, when Trump crushes Biden!
Fauci has more than kept his cool. Very few people could manage better in the Trump Circus.
About a week ago, I saw a meme of Trump with a bowl of mashed potatoes on his head.  Wish I had kept it.
It sends a clear signal to Putin that he should help get Trump re-elected and, in exchange, Trump will do whatever he wants him to.
Six...that‚Äôs how many conversations Trump has had with Putin since March when we learned that Russia put a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  And he didn‚Äôt bring this up in any of those conversations.
Is there a push to undermine President Trump?  Why won't the Republicans put on their gloves and fight fire with fire.  The Democrats are running roughshod over the Republicans.  I don't want socialism, government controlled healthcare, raised taxes, etc.
So, instead of quietly shifting troops to other areas, which would help a longtime ally save face, Trump makes a big, blowhard announcement the day after he had a meeting with his handler, Vladimir Putin.  Also, it's been three weeks since Bountygate. Not a word.

So basically if you make a good appearance on TV and seem to agree with Trump, he wants to consider them an expert. He doesn‚Äôt even vet these people to make sure they are credible. He counts on his supporters being dumb.

Trump did push for Russia to rejoin. Trump has only addressed the bounties by saying that he wasn't briefed. There's plenty information available for him to understand Russia's intentions, but the buffoon dithers. So, the conclusion is that you are talking out of your ass.

So, do you get paid to lie and apologize for trump, or do you do it for free?
Trump retweeted one of his supporters yelling white power.

The power to remove Trump from office.
‚ÄúTo some degree‚Äù is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
TRUMP is the only person to give up his salary.   We have 446 former members of Congress who receive government pensions who are lobbyist on both sides of aisle.   Does that make any sense? NO. We even have people in prison who receive pensions.   We need to end this madness.
But she called it a republican hoax, right? Of course she made fun of trump, everybody makes fun of trump. He's a clown. We elected a man with no political experience, no previous employment, no military service, as POTUS. A vainglorious braggart and bully.

If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about ‚Äúmail in voting‚Äù, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.
I guess Trump is right and the campaign is going fine.
Trump has never, and this is true, owned a pet, let alone a dog. Think about that.
Yes, we will crack open some trump vodka, grill some trump steaks, stare for a moment at our diploma from trump U, then catch a trump shuttle to Atlantic City to gamble at one of his fine casinos. Like that.
Oh, you think he was happy? Lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator? Other than a tax break for the wealthy, tRump hasn't kept any of his promises. Turns out he wasn't too busy to gold and Mexico didn't pay for the wall. Economy in the toilet and 150,000 dead. Whee!
Pretty sure we all knew that. If you didn't before, Trump was playing that card pretty strongly (ü§≠)about a month or so ago.

That's Donald Trump. Instead of celebrating a civil rights leader like John Lewis he would rather celebrate stupidity in Herman Cain. All is had to do was wear a mask but when you listen to stupid you do stupid things and his stupidity took his life.
Don‚Äôt get me started on the millions of $ grifted by the trump family in the past 4 years.  He‚Äôs a failure and a farce.  #Biden2020
tRump wants to delay the election but he does not have the power to do that. Can Congress move election day sooner? Let's say in SEP. Let's end this madness of a blatantly inept regime. Or we are still stuck with the sycophants in the Senate who would block the move?
I can‚Äôt stand Trump and cannot wait until he‚Äôs gone - but on this he is correct. If you want to vote absentee, you must request a mail ballot for each election cycle. If we were to use mail in ballots, they would just be mailed to all registered voter at their last known address
I can‚Äôt stand Trump, but there IS a difference. An absentee ballot must be requested by the voter. Mail in ballots would be mailed out to all registered voters.

Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôd hope to delay. Because you know he‚Äôs going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Trump is such a petty, small, jealous man.
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?
Trump's America
is trying to distract from John Lewis's funeral.  Because trump is a petty little man who will always be overshadowed by greater men. And women.
Honestly, now that Trump has his high donor flunky running the USPS, I no longer want mail in voting - because I do not trust that Dems will receive their ballots or that those ballots will make it back to be counted via the USPS.
Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?
I think 1 way would be to have Secys. of States loyal to Trump refuse to certify the results?
I remember my oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.  Trump and every elected Republican who supports trump's assault on the Constitution is the enemy.
You think Donald Trump supports Democracy?   Have you been asleep these past three years?
Hi, I'm planning on voting in person, is that still allowed? Or do I need to sign something promising to vote for Trump? Is that how democracy works now?
Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Apply that logic to red state management; for instance Gov Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, Herman Cain chose to go to the Trump rally and he appeared to be having a wonderful time. RIP, Mr. Cain.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?ü§™üòúü§™üòúü§™üòú

I remember his big, maskless smile at Trump‚Äôs Omaha rally.
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‚ÄòTrump Respects The Constitution‚Äô, it is ‚ÄòTrump cannot garner the required support to do a coup‚Äô.

Mr. Trump, do you understand ANYTHING about science or even just basic math and numbers? You brag about the 55+ Million Covid tests performed in the US. Admirable. However, on a tests-per-capita basis (do u understand that?) we are currently 21st in the world!
Trump has surrounded himself with like-minded lowlifes. I wonder if a sane person is left in the WH.

I am so embarrassed for Trump. He is not at all self-aware. No insight into himself. So clueless as to why he is so unappealing.
You are not a happy person.  Whether it's because you have chosen a corrupt political stance; your physical appearance, whatever.  You have chosen to take it out on President Trump.  Perhaps, you are afraid of Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer.  You need to resign!

Trump wants to stop mail in ballots. Having been in military and served overseas THE ONLY WAY I COULD VOTE WAS BY MAIL IN BALLOT. So if trump tries that he is denying service members their constitutional rights, the rights they are defending.

FWIW KBTX, I‚Äôm not in agreement with these other comments; Trump says unsubstantiated allegations (feels like) everyday now.
Herman Cain, inspiration to many, including a young conservative me, died literally so President Trump could continue behaving as if COVID is not a big deal.  His socials continued to tweet how it's a hoax as he was in the hospital.  Stop this now, GOP voters. No more should die.
Only the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù who disagree publicly with Trump ‚Äúknow better‚Äù  Other experts have their videos deleted from all social media.
So Herman Cain died of Covid? Trump, you killed another person, with your fucking ego which needs constant adoration. Trump is a mass murderer.üò°üò°üò°

Ma‚Äôam you have seriously lost your mind. You really believe the whole world is orchestrating a conspiracy to get Trump out of office by faking a pandemic somehow. I hope you eventually hear how crazy you sound.
And tRump will not learn thing one from this lesson.

I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.
I'm not going to be using write-ins or voting third party but I do not understand the whole "a third party vote is a vote for Trump" thing. Sure, it isn't an effective vote AGAINST Trump. But its a vote for who you voted for. Seems like a stupid lib take to me.

I have lost a number of friends because of my anti-trump stance. hum let me change that to acquaintance for friends will stand by you regardless. even though they have "unfriended" me, if they need me I am there for them.
I think I understand what the protesters are trying to accomplish, it is not working, and all they are doing is playing into Trump‚Äôs plan.  They are giving him all the excuse he supposedly needs to start to create Martial Law, then where will we all be?
Not a caption, but you know Trump spent 30 minutes washing the "commoner" off of his hands.
Folks, I only have a few ‚Äúfollowers ‚Äú, you have many!!! Get the word out that if Trump is not re-elected America will go to Hell!!!!
B.s. in January Trump tried to ban travel from The source, and you people went public telling people to act as usual, go to festivals, visit china town. Cuomo forced covid-19 sick into old folks home. Mass murdering thousands.
Absolute brain-washed disillusionment. We do NOT have a 2 party system in America! BOTH Joe &amp; tRump are OWNED by the SAME damn billionaires. Why do you think  have done NOTHING to fix this country? Becuz of the $. I'm putting my vote to actual use. #VoteGreen2020
indeed, and certainly none without many billions of federal dollars for major school reconstruction and many more personnel, tests, and well-paid cleaners with protective gear -- Trump's son Barron is not going to a reopened face to face school, talk about hypocrisy
Why we can‚Äôt have nice things. ‚ÄúWhen Trump talks, his base listens. That carries profound implications for efforts to limit the spread in the U.S., especially when he contradicts public health officials or state and local leaders.‚Äù
Interesting thread with pics on the, alleged, transgressions of the Houston consulate. I can see why the Trump admin moved to close it, but I wonder what airing the grievances in public will do for Sino-US relations
And trump retweets this why????  #TrumpMeltdown #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Never underestimate the general public‚Äôs mass stupidity in most political matters. Or the determined ‚Äúevil‚Äù plans/intentions of the politicians. All this privatizing BS now is yet another personal grudge of tRump -bc Bezos uses #USPS
Cry me a river. If they would work for their constituents instead of being trump lapdogs and shills, they might be better off. Once you mess with a skunk, it‚Äôs hard to get the smell off.
Another HUGE reason we need to re-elect Trump in November in order to get conservative Supreme Court &amp; other Judges. I pray that ppl who consider yourselves Christians will WAKE UP &amp; realize you cannot vote democrat if you are a Christian! Look at democrat politics!! WAKE UP!!!
‚ÄúThe Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed this week, saying Chinese agents tried to steal medical and other research in Texas. ‚Äù
I concur. Portnoy did a great job without the sneaky gotcha BS that ‚Äúreal journalists‚Äù now rely on.  Trump needs more interviews like this and Biden needs to sit down with
biggest problem with attacking Biden is that Trump has no integrity, scruples, or character. Therefore, Trump has no credibility when it comes to judging another person‚Äôs integrity, scruples, or character.
Same thing here in Texass w/our limp dick  They have their heads so far up tRump‚Äôs ass that all they can see is the $$$$ he gives them to fuck us all over &amp; their delusions of grandeur for continued power from their GOP loyalty. Kill us all.
Everything Trump touches is contaminated.
Here we go again.... People are lying to pollsters because they don't want to be doxxed, or called racist fascist or any other ist. Here's are article from 2016 claiming the polls were accurate.
Speaking of tRump &amp; his WEEKLY golf vacations for the entirety of his ‚Äúpresidency,‚Äù has anyone been able to count high enough to tell US how much his outings are costing #WeThePeople in OUR tax dollars lately?
Texans are being poorly served all the way down including our senators, many of the congresspersons, our governor, lt. governor, et. al. They‚Äôre either kissing Trump‚Äôs ass in a ploy to retain power or bending a knee to special interests with $$$$. I really hope Nov brings change.

Thank you Trump!
Here is a joke.  trump.
Plus the way they did not ask for Big Cat‚Äôs opinion or insight on doing the trump interview after saying he would be such a big part of the company and would be included in these types of decisions
The truth is that leadership starts at the top. When you have someone like Portnoy meeting with a highly controversial and racist person like a Donald Trump it should be very alarming because it just shows how much a scumbag Portnoy is.
I feel the same way. There's no way Dave could turn down an interview with Trump, but he should've told Big Cat.
Doesn't matter if watch or don't watch. May not matter if you vote or don't vote.  How many people can you convince to vote Trump that wouldn't may be all that matters...

That was the whole point here. They way you are acquiring your drugs so cheap is because your government threatens to not honor patents. Trump said no more stealing of intellectual property. Your cheap drugs are going away. Now you will pay what we pay.
Are you F'n kidding me about distrust China. I am sure there are scores of countries who can and will say same about trumpmeriKKKa, trump and all on his cabinet. They have no reason to trust him, you or anyone else associated with trump.

Sorry, just trying to keep up here... So 150 days in, if the state is doing poorly, it's Trump's fault and NOT the governor's fault... But if the state is doing well, such as NY, that would be to the credit of the governor and NOT because of Trump.Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
Today Trump offered to temp extend unemployment until a deal can be reached, Dems in the House killed it. DEMS killed unemployment, where is that in the media?

A bad day for Trump!
President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
The  found in an analysis of more than 200 Portland arrests that even those accused of breaking the law during the¬†liberal city‚Äôs¬†nightly rallies don‚Äôt neatly fit into President Donald Trump‚Äôs depiction of protesters as¬†‚Äúanarchists and agitators.‚Äù
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there‚Äôs that.
Donald trump could never do you hear me. NEVER. #JohnLewisMemorial

I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. ü§£
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his ‚Äújoke‚Äù about injecting people with bleach. He wasn‚Äôt joking.
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.

I wonder what Superspreader Trump will say about this?  Trump, now has one less vote.

The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Iowa is purple and going blue. 2016 was vote against Hillary, 2020 is about vote against Trump.
This is the REAL Donald Trump that most people don‚Äôt get to see because of the slanted one sided Media!!!!
I love all these anecdotes about ‚Äúoooh, big strong republican man doesn‚Äôt like trump and won‚Äôt vote for him‚Äù but they don‚Äôt make a whit of difference if we don‚Äôt ALL go vote against trump. Register. Get your friends registered. Help people get to the polls.

Voters unwillingness to reveal support for Trump is affecting poll numbers After 2016 many voters made a decision not to reveal any true feelings to pollsters
Truth!
There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.
Send a message to voters instead please!  Trump won't listen nor his cultists.  We need to all vote as if we are losing this race and even then if we win it through a massive #BlueWave expect Trump and his cult to fight and possibly use violence in protest against it.

some people love to agitate and create chaos.  If Trump knew her I think he'd place her over Betsy DeVoss.  she would work in tandem with Stephen Miller to malignantly misinform Millions of ignorant Americans to do what is harmful to them.

Watching this helps steel my resolve to do everything possible to rid our democracy of Trump and ALL of his  enablers in November. The parties will continue to have their policy differences, yet they can treat each other with respect and love America equally. #WeWillVote

This is a lie. LMAO. Trump has denounced white supremacists multiple times. And you all call Trump supporters dumb. There are dummies on both sides, but there are far more dumb Democrats than Trump supporters, for sure.

As for the dems are mean too.  Yeah again back to that we tell kids to get over it... Hell you are telling me get over it, but heaven forbid we tell trump to get over it!
Ultimately any dumbass who went to a political rally inside an arena with zero social distancing and zero mask mandate during the Covid 19 pandemic is responsible for their own death. But Trump is complicit and negligent
Look, I'm anti NATO but that doesn't make me pro Trump.
When I hear that Right Wing Nut Jobs and #MAGAts say that Liberals created COVID to make Trump look bad I have to stop and think for a moment, Trump doesn't need anyone to make him look bad! MFG he does that all by himself!
he signed a pledge to support whoever the nominee is. and he has always said he will do what it takes to stop trump. running independenf would hurt that cause.
No Free world under Trump and current GOP leadership. Try something else.
Good, I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump discipline. Notice the question marks at the end obviously meant as a thought that he completely cleared up in his 5:30 press conference, but I love how people go crazy by a thought by the President on a social media platform that allows kiddie porn
President Trump suggested delaying the election because of the coronavirus, something he cannot legally do. Top Republicans quickly rejected the idea.

Trump is not and never will be in the same class as those 3 past Presidents.
Guys it‚Äôs time to wake up. Trump has lost his marbles. All he is worried and concerned about is his re-election while over 1000 people are dying in this country due to his his mismanagement of this virus. Work with your fellow Senators to kick the moron out.

I understand your stylistic objections to Obama.  I have a similar hostile response to oleaginous politicians like Cruz who insult your intelligence; and that‚Äôs even before Trump turned Republicans into the nihiliststic Trolling for Liberal Tears Party.
No it doesn't. At least not until they put him in the ground. What does matter he made the personal decision to not listen to medical professionals, chose the political road, and now his family has to lay him to rest - all for Donald J. Trump.
Oh my God. Did he tell everyone that he got it at a Trump rally where everyone was discouraged from wearing masks? A rally that never should have happened in the first place? That every doctor said was a bad idea? Thought not.

Trump is scared. He knows what will happen on November 3rd
Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.

That's kinda like true, only a few stay near the border, and the ones that stay near the border often aren't the criminals Trump is so scared of.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Finally because Herman Cain was killed by Trump Virus, he mentions the more than 150,000.
You know what's going to be sad? The fact that three former Presidents prior to  will probably show respect and condolences to his family and be willing to pay their respects to him on behalf of the nation and Trump couldn't do the same for John Lewis. That's sad.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There‚Äôs way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There‚Äôs little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.

Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.

Texas is fine.  We all know these covid numbers are propaganda to derail Trump.
im in texas and im not gonna vite for biden. if that leads to texas going to trump then so be it.
It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
trump knows he can‚Äôt change the election,he‚Äôs trying to cause confusion so people give up because they‚Äôll believe his lies! Americans have to be smarter than that! Look at the facts! I have applied for my mail in ballot! This is NOT a new system! trump and his family used it!!!
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.

There are 154,000 Herman Cain's thanks to the Trump Virus.
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!

Isn't this the same woman that wrote a tell-all book about her and her illegal dealings Phaedra Parks. Damn how much is Trump's camp paying her &amp; your Diamond and Silk's?? I really want to know what they are getting in exchange for their souls.

From what I was saying the Democrats they were just bitching and yelling at him never let him answer any of the questions. The Democrats are the ones that are lying dividing and trying to cheat this whole time Trump has been in the presidency
Well unfortunately he's a Trump supporter and believes in a lot of stupid conspiracy theories.
I've been dying for him to use my phrase I gifted him a couple years ago. Describing talking to Trump voters as "being bukkaked with stupid". I guess I can understand not using it on MSNBC or CNN but maybe the Podcast is a fit.

If he hadn‚Äôt followed Trump and gone to the Tulsa rally, he would still be alive!  People that follow Trump, either die or cause someone else to die! #Trumpisthevirus
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He‚Äôll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
Delaying the election is the least of my worries lol. Trump could theoretically make state legislatures bind electoral votes to him and SCOTUS could green-light it.

In what will be the first of many, a high profile #COVID19 denier and GOPer  Herman Caine has died of COVID after attending the OK rally held by Trump.
And every warning has fallen on deaf ears. And when state leaders actually try to do something useful to help, the Trump bunch cry out unconstitutional. It is so sadly stupid that anyone cares about those idiots.

Trump 2020.  He does what is has promised.  Salute to the pres.  now if only the Republicans in Congress would step up their act.
We will vote and we will vote Trump, right Joe?
I live in a suburb of Dallas. A blue collar suburb. We have quite a few low income housing complexes here. I live in an eclectic neighborhood of many races. My home values are fine and seeing an increase as opposed to going down. Trump is wrong.

In the last 24 hours Trump promoted segregation, the GDP is down 33%, he is pulling Troops out of Germany (you're welcome Putin) AND he wants to delay the election.    "Make other countries feel sorry for us" should be his new campaign slogan.
Yes, Trump has to go. I will swim through a flood to vote his ass out. Whatever it takes.
Yeah, I realized it wasn't that peculiar being that he was over 70 and had cancer. It's just unfortunate. Folks are being dickholes about it, though, because he went to a Trump rally. They won't say that protesting in large groups is just as risky. Hypocrits.
Sue? We‚Äôre voting for Trump, even Joe knows it.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on!

What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I didn't agree with Hernan Cain's politics but it is sad that he died from following Trump.
Are you sure?  It's possible Putin's English is better than Trump's. ;-)
I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Completely predictable.
I wasn't old enough to vote against George Wallace in 1968. Voting against Donald Trump in 2020 is the next best thing.
Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.
I bet Trump got Afghanistan‚Äôs #GDP up a bit by looking the other way as Russia paid all those bounties for dead Americans.
Last public appearance prior to contracting covid was the trump Tulsa rally.   Every cult eventually becomes a death cult.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won‚Äôt oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.

Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
Very sad bc this dude should still be alive. This is what happens when the disinformation of the trump administration and his supporters resonates in their minds.
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
No, he can't, but he can work to get a contested election thrown to the House of Representatives, where despite having a majority of Democrats, each state gets one vote. There are more red states than blue states so that would throw the election Trump's way. VOTE!!!!
He will if he doesn‚Äôt wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Trump must leave.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.
Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the marquee event for the president's self-proclaimed reelection campaign kickoff.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Sad. Oh well. He gambled with his life and lost big. My condolences to his family. trump is culpable.

Yes, vote for Biden to turn us back to the conditions that created Trump in the first place just so he can say he supports these progressive policies, only to do nothing about them.  We had one chance to crush facism in this country, and you centrists dropped the ball.
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I‚Äôd agree with you. Trump doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about Federal law, so don‚Äôt act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It‚Äôs his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.

No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.

100% not!! But you know that. That‚Äôs why your President (Trump) not your lover President (XI) is taking care of it.
People need to know ALL the WAYS Trump is cheating!
How do you see the future of America? Are you praying that Trump will save you? He‚Äôll be gone in four years. Then what will you do? Find another savior? Or finally wake up and start saving the country yourself?
Again I disagree with some of your opinions but you are always consistent. Starting to think I need to listen more to your opinions. Thanks for being a voice of reason for the Democratic Party. It‚Äôs hard to find these days! Trump should hire you because you offer balanced opinion

Every day I read profiles that include the word conservative yet the timeline is constantly begging the government to do something. Do you realize that means you‚Äôre not really a conservative? The only thing I want Trump to do is do his job. Jail lawbreakers. All lawbreakers.

If Trump wins this election, either by fair or dishonest means, the dollar will crash and we will be done for as a world power. Standard of living will drop. Alt-reality will be here to stay.
The more and more these undocumented people riot and protest, only makes me vote for Trump even more.
Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's wet dream.  He bows in submission to Putin, giving him ANYTHING he wants.    One of Russia's greatest wishes has been the withdrawal of Americans from our European allies.  Putin's slave (Trump) is withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.
So long as you act (in your daily life) like your views and your values don‚Äôt matter, guess what‚Äôs going to happen? They‚Äôre going to be ignored. People are filled with frustration over all the evil stuff going on, yet the knee-jerk reaction is to beg Trump to do something.

That's kinda like true, only a few stay near the border, and the ones that stay near the border often aren't the criminals Trump is so scared of.
Its actually true. Those are not even their kids. This was all set up by rich ppl long ago and the Bush administration. They were crooked. Its honestly why Trump matters so much. Why would they do this to someone unless he had a lot of dirt on them
Trump made that guy pull the trigger?  Interesting take on the video!
She works for the cartel. There is just so much people dont know about what's going on and they all throw shit at Trump and blame him. 6 months ago I hated Trump. The media! Well, I have more power than the media!! Its called my finger tips

Voters in Texas. Early voting starts October 20th 2020. I will vote the for #TRUMP #FNC #FBN
I dont care what Trump has done. They are both crooks. Only one has been here only 3.5 yrs and the other has been sniffing everyone for almost 50 yrs!! Joe has never done anything, except pass laws to put more black ppl in jail. Facts
Election games used to make Trump look bad and to get rid of them so they can go back to crooked business as usual! Those tariffs were fucking with all the illegal money coming back in. Clintons money was getting taxed way too much!!
If Obama or Clinton hasd EVER said anything close to what Trump said, would it be considered ‚Äúa joke‚Äù by Cornyn and the rest of the complacent Republicans?!?
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn‚Äôt leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
Well, they already conquered Trump, sooo....

I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
Imagine not buying into the GOP strategy of everyone open schools so economy will be better in Oct so Trump can claim He Alone Can Fix It.

I'm going to miss when the Trump presidency is over and every expert he hired seems like they were the 50th caller to a radio station that morning.
You are the actual disaster. The trump virus cannot be cured with your vile tweets.
Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?
Trump wants it
What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
How does an otherwise universally-accepted smart individual, business leader and visionary essentially meet his untimely death because he actively chose to shill for Trump?   How?
I'm not sure how you feel sorry for this guy?... blame Trump? Seems like he was a grown man that refused to educate himself (C-19) , putting his life/ supporters at risk. What if he gave it to YOUR child?
Herman Cain is dead from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally without a mask... I spot 8 other black Republicans next to him. One was smart enough to wear a mask the rest think Trump is their god.   Stop politicizing Covid19 Black people, your lives matter!
I've got as much to learn from you Bob as Trump does from a lecture in quantum mechanics from Richard Feynman.  I typically laugh at clowns for being the clowns they are.  The notion Walsh is a Democrat is laughable, just probably every  take you have, political or otherwise.
But... why didn‚Äôt Trump give him his Hydroxychloroquine
He went to a Trump Rally without a mask and got Covid19 how is this BLM fault
Wait he died from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally üëÄ I wonder what excuse Trump will have this time... last time he said his friend should have lost weight
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
It would seem this experiment would Trump AG Barr opinion wouldn't it?
that‚Äôs how it works. This situation is primed  what prevails is the hopeful attitude of those who are protesting who look to vote trump out dismantle his and republican policy
You mean conman.  Not businessman.  Lmao it's funny that people like you even still exist I'm not sure if its dishonesty or stupidity but to almost every human being on this planet besides a small % of clowns in this country know what Trump is.  It's sad, I feel bad for you.
You Starting to realize you've aligned yourself with actual criminal scum traitors?  Is it dawning now Adam?  Just a bit? A shred of realization of what You have promoted, because believe me if Trump slides us into fascism, this tweet doesn't eliminate the last several years.

In 2008 President Bush quipped that he‚Äôd rather be FDR than Hoover during his economic crisis.   President Trump has arguably replaced Hoover as a warning on how not to handle an economic crisis.
Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.

Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
The wall, what he's doing at the border, which is effecting nearby towns like Laredo. Also, rural Texans benefited the most from Obamacare, which is a pretty bad system, but not as bad as Trump makes it seem. etc.
Sure thing boss.

She‚Äôs trying to talk shit about us for hating Trump but then she ends up blocking us! Makes sense
Trump‚Äôs acceptance is not required.    Of all Trump‚Äôs tricks, his best is to get his opposition to defend a corrupted system. By saying he won‚Äôt automatically accept the results of the election, his opponents commit to defending the election results if there is interference.
Anyone thats part of this New world order thats about to happen. They will be the first to speak out against Trump. They even invite each other on their talk shows. All of this is being set into place due to the richest people in the world wanting it to be set in place. Get ready
Im not hating on that fact. Im hating on the fact that we are constantly lied to! Those are nor their kids. Facts. If people knew the truth about what is facts as of right now. Trump would win 4 damn sure. Im not apart of anything, but my own thoughts. Play a lot of chess too!

Herman Cain was a grown ass man who knew better. Just because you don't like taxes, is no reason to believe that every reputable health organization on the planet is lying to you or that Trump is in anyway competent.

When Obama became president. right wingers could not believe he disrupted their all white boys club. From when he won they conspired to prevent it happening again, to stop equality at any and all costs and trump made being overtly racist ok again. They've taken us back to 1950's
Trump wants to stop mail in ballots. Having been in military and served overseas THE ONLY WAY I COULD VOTE WAS BY MAIL IN BALLOT. So if trump tries that he is denying service members their constitutional rights, the rights they are defending.
KBTX recognizes this post does not provide enough context for the situation and does not further the conversation in a productive way.  This article provides more information, stating the president does not have the authority to delay Election Day.
I don‚Äôt follow trump. But it‚Äôs a smart idea to keep informed of both sides and especially the policies being implement by the president reguardless of political views to see how you are going to be affected

Hillary Clinton and a bunch of dems never accepted President Trump‚Äôs election &amp; most likely won‚Äôt accept it when he wins again in November!
FWIW KBTX, I‚Äôm not in agreement with these other comments; Trump says unsubstantiated allegations (feels like) everyday now.
Herman Cain, inspiration to many, including a young conservative me, died literally so President Trump could continue behaving as if COVID is not a big deal.  His socials continued to tweet how it's a hoax as he was in the hospital.  Stop this now, GOP voters. No more should die.
Only the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù who disagree publicly with Trump ‚Äúknow better‚Äù  Other experts have their videos deleted from all social media.
So Herman Cain died of Covid? Trump, you killed another person, with your fucking ego which needs constant adoration. Trump is a mass murderer.üò°üò°üò°
After Barr hearing all Trump administration officials sould only respond to congressional inquiries in writing. Democrats should never be allowed power again...
No, it‚Äôs the height of stupidity for you to buy into an absurd and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory and truly believe Trump is anything but an incompetent, narcissistic, tantrum throwing baby. It‚Äôs amazing how trump supporters are blind to the signs everyone else can plainly see
Ma‚Äôam you have seriously lost your mind. You really believe the whole world is orchestrating a conspiracy to get Trump out of office by faking a pandemic somehow. I hope you eventually hear how crazy you sound.
And tRump will not learn thing one from this lesson.
Oh my god. You people are brainwashed. You can‚Äôt see that trump is terrified of losing the election? You think it‚Äôs acceptable we let him stay in office despite the fact that over 50% of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic ?

President Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election in a Thursday morning tweet while further perpetuating the false claim that mail-in voting leads to widespread voter fraud.
Vote President Trump and his enablers out of office November 3, 2020.
DELAY THE VOTE?  President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.

Go listen to  and  replayed #WITHpod from this week. All these ballots are the same, but Trump has convinced his most loyal followers they‚Äôre different because whatever he says is truth and everything else is a lie.

I mean you could just be ideologically opposed for voting for someone with sexual assault accusations. I don't blame anyone if that's their reason for not voting. Trump just has even more, and one of them is going to win the presidency, and one of them is more dangerous.
I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.
I'm not going to be using write-ins or voting third party but I do not understand the whole "a third party vote is a vote for Trump" thing. Sure, it isn't an effective vote AGAINST Trump. But its a vote for who you voted for. Seems like a stupid lib take to me.
The problem with Trump's mental state is, for his co-conspirators (VP &amp; Cabinet) a feature, and not a bug.

Yeah out of the mindset that only conservatives can be Christians. Out of the beliefs that I'm a bad Christian for disagreeing with how the church should engage with politics, and for calling Trump on his lies and immorality
Pathetic.  isn!t even smarter than Joe Biden‚Äôs DOG.  ‚ÄúPerson, woman, man, camera, TV‚Äú: The 5 words that Trump says prove he's smarter than Biden
Joe Biden and Barack Obama are stepping up their attacks on President Donald Trump and defending their time in the White House in a new video.
I supported you for about a month until you turned into trump, iii. No more and don't count on ever being supported by true Texans again.
The Trump administration is planning to expand an operation that would send federal law enforcement agents to Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee in the coming weeks, the White House announced Wednesday night.
The meeting shown in the video illustrates the larger role Obama is expected to play for Biden in the months before November.
I trust Biden more than a draft dodging con man. When Trump loses, I hope he tries to stay and has to be dragged out kicking and screaming like the petulant child he is.President Trump is intellectually and intelligently smarter than the whole Liberal side! Every time he sets a trap they step in it whole hog! These people are sick and stupid!
Honestly I can listening to any politician speak. That includes Trump. The only guy I liked was Reagan
Like sports I don't keep up with everything... I'm just here to support Trump. Once his next 4 years is up I'm packing my shit and going to the phillipines... I've had it here....
President Trump
Since the DemoncRATS are constantly making demands.  Trump should make demands of his own. Voting in person only if you don't wear a mask. democRATS would immediately push for in person voting. Just to show him COVID19 spreads..
This is not a joke. Now it‚Äôs cost a life because Trump‚Äôs people are too irresponsible to listen to science? What have they become??
TRUMP NEVER TAKES A RECESS. TRUMP NEVER TAKES A VACATION. TRUMP DOESN'T GET PAID. TRUMP DOESN'T MISS A DAY. ONE HONEYMOON IN THREE YEARS.  SO WHY SHOULD THE HOUSE MAKING 100 XS HIS INCOME GET A RECESS. RECESS' ARE FOR SCHOOL STUDENTS...
They know trump is right and we r too.  That scares them
JUST WRONG.  IT TRUMP LOSES ITS ONLY GET WORSE OPEN UR EYES TAKE  OFF UR BLINDERS AAND LISTEN W UR EARS.
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING AND PRODUCING ANYTHING IS TRUMP AND HIS LOYAL ADMINISTRATION.
G W Bush hoBAMA And VP Joe Biden to Attend John Lewis funeral.  Trump and  Jimmy Carter will not.
And don't forget, They're blaming Trump.
A police organization that sat out 2016 after endorsing Obama/Biden in 2008 and 2012 is endorsing Trump in 2020. What‚Äôs your point?
fuck trump.
Texans for Trump
Oh now CNN USES TRUMPS VISIT AGAINST HIM  SHOWING ALL THE PEOPLE AT MIDLAND TEXAS.  CNN WAS THERE DISQUISED AS A DIFFERENT NEWS I QUESS.  BEINGS UP THE FACT HIS AID TESTED POSITIVE BEFORE TRUMP LEFT
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE INFORM.....  INFORM THEM, TRUMP IS IN ODESSA, MIDLAND TEXS SO...  SO THEY CAN RUSH. RUSH SOME NEWS REPORTERS TO COVER TRUMP.  IT WOULD BE BIG RATINGS FOR THEM.
CNN INCREASES ITS COMMERCIALS JUST TO AVOID SHOWING TRUMP.  CNN HAS BEEN BROADCAST EU. AND OTHER COUNTRIES  TO AVOID..  TO AVOID ANY THING TRUMP RELATED.
CNN  ISN'T EVEN SHOWING TRUMP IN MIDLAND.  NO SURPRISE HERE...  LOW LIFE FUCKING NEWS.
Streets of Midland Texas  Lines of Trump supporters.
Barr is scary!  He is tRump's puppet.  HE is supposed to be the AG for the US not POTUS...
If this is being interpreted as a negative, let‚Äôs consider How much Trump spent moving the hospital ship to NY‚Äôs harbor and how many COVID patients were treated there.
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS TO REMOVE TRUMP DEMOCRATS DECIDE TO BURN DOWN AMERICA  BLAME TRUMP. BLAME EVERYONE EXCEPT THEMSELVES.
President Trump set a trap, and the usual idiots from the Left stepped right in whole hog!
Donald Trump Jr. Twitter has temporarily SUSPENDED his Account For Posting A video.  Look out folks.  FB and Twitter wouldn't SUSPEND Kathy Griffin Account for showing Trump's severed head.  Look out PEOPLE. Your next, careful what you post.....
Oh I get it, they are using their time for a trump law &amp; order campaign ad.
It makes Trump look good and takes fear of Americans away
It‚Äôs because they would burn the country down instead of give Trump a win
MASKS PEOPLE MASKS. NANCY HAD HERS UP .THEN TOOK IT DOWN. IF THIS WERE TRUMP ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE.
This is some resister shit if I‚Äôve ever seen it. Y‚Äôall are almost as stupid as trump supporters. Please quit letting these people gas you up, girl. This ain‚Äôt it.
Are you the BOD member at Fox News who is causing the swing to the left? I understand you were never a Trump fan. I don‚Äôt understand how you never Trumpers act like you prefer the radical left positions over Trump. You‚Äôre cutting off nose to spite faceüëé
NANCY ATTENDS LEWIS MEMORIAL AND IS MASKLESS IF TRUMP HAD DONE THAT ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOSE.  IT WOULD BE CNN FRONT AND CENTER.  I CAN HEAR IT NOW. "HOW DISRESPECTFUL OF HIM".
The Biden people aren‚Äôt acting like they‚Äôre trying to get votes for them only votes against trump. Do better!
Poor little Dem .. Has one follower. DO BLUE DEM. HATES TRUMP, A VEGAN. A BLUE WAVE. SEE HOW FAST SHE BLOCKS ME WHEN SHE READS MY FROFILE.  IS THIS INDICTATIVE OF A DEM.  1 FOLLOWER..???
If I recall correctly, Trump said exactly that a couple months ago in one of his daily COVID press briefings...that CNN and MSNBC kept cutting away from.
So it‚Äôs ok for governors to send in ‚Äústorm troopers‚Äù to enforce rules on private property but Trump is not allowed to defend federal property. Again the the hypocrisy from the Dems.
Tell that to this Lincoln project who are intent on voting Trump out of office and they are Republicans! Apparently they listen to too much fake news! Donald Trump was anointed by God to lead this country at this time!
Ppl do realize Trump‚Äôs been President for the past 4 yrs, yes? Are they conceding his 1st term was ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù?. I love how social conservatives are cool displaying items with all caps ‚ÄúBS‚Äù at the register of a family gas station now üòÇ

They will be after they shoot each other. Heck more rioters have been shot by rioters that the Feds have shot.  Oh let me see.   The fed have yet to open fire. The rioters should be pleased with Trump refraining from doing what he could lawfully do.
TRUMP CANCEL CONVENTION  SOMETHING DEMONCRATS DIDN'T EXPECT.  SO WHAT WILL THEY BITCH ABOUT NOW...
LORI LIGHTHEAD TRUMP IS COVERING UP HIS FAILED ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC.  LORI DUMBFUCK. HOBAMA DID NOTHING ABOUT H1N1. HE LET 2XS AS MANY DIE.  WHERE WERE YOU THEN.  SDSTFU....
IF TRUMP WERE TO DIE TOMMOROW DO YOU HONESTLY THINK HIS FUNERAL WOULD GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AND MSM COVERAGE AS MCCAIN FLOYD LEWIS.......

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Wonder who has final say on this? Why President Trump, of course!
Trump 2020
Thing I can tell you, I was working on car that doesn't run in my driveway.  My neighbor DemoncRAT. Who ripped down my Trump flag last year. Saw me lying on ground under my car. Called cops told them I was drunk. When cop arrived I was in my house cooking supper. All bullshit
Well said truth . Trump 2020 !
Assuming they'll do the same for Trump #resign
This has been an issue for decades. It isn‚Äôt going to be solved overnight. To start the people of Chicago need to vote people out of office that isn‚Äôt doing a damn thing, refusing  help because it‚Äôs coming from Trump. Time to put hate aside and think about the American people.
Who was it hobama kicked out of USA just before ELECTION day 2016? 34 or 35 consulates. No news coverage about that. TRUMP shuts down Chinese consulate I Houston Texas. Biggest news coverage since H1N1.....lol
Biden would smell the kid up. At least trump can throw a ball.
Trump = Disaster
I need YOU back cuz seriously Kanye? Million-dollar babies? Why are people believing TRUMP OVER TRAINED MED PROFESSIONALS! I need your sanity...and humor!
"I miss Obama" has become a meme, but between this and the pic of Trump attempting to catch a baseball I saw today, right now, I miss W.
I know, but till I get into court and get a dismissal I'm stuck. It's illegal to be put on probation and not even a conviction.  I'm on a breathelizer And have to pay monthly fees...law and order... Go figure. All because my neighbor is a demoncrat. Hates me and TRUMP...
Please note school is set to open 8/20 in Florida about which Trump is adamant. He has just cancelled the convention which was set for 8/24 over safety concerns.
I am baffled by the number of people who listen to Donald Trump over EDUCATED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
Charmin utra strong Just said if TRUMP said let everyone home schooled See how fast schools would open , I agree.
the Trump virus!
OREGON wasn't The way it is now UNTIL TRUMP THREATENED TO CALL IN FEDS..  OH REALLLLYYYY..  SAYS ONE DEMONCRAT ON FOX.  WHY THEN WAS SEATTLE LIKE IT WAS.
It's a HOSTAGE situation. Remove TRUMP or we'll tear down everything. Notice terrorist PROTESTORS are now making demands in Chicago Oregon and many cities.  Mayor's, governors are going along with them because they know they are losing. It's a "HAIL MARY"
Yeah, even Trump can be forced to bow sometimes. He is fighting against rabid Dems, vicious media, &amp; public fear. He is politically adjusting to masks &amp; vaccines in order to counter act the fear. He should however make clear vaccines should not be mandatory nor given to under 45
I think the Biden people are hiding something. Well that is the charge they make over Trump taxes. However tax returns does not reveal ability to handle the office of the president but the cognitive test does. What‚Äôs the Biden people hiding or afraid of?  We all know &amp; they do to
George Floyd was just the fuse, in the stick of dynamite Laid in place November 2016.   Stop using George Floyd as a reason all this bullshitttt democRATS have been PROTESTING AGAINST TRUMP from day one.
I had a mental breakdown 7/4/2019.  I don't know what drugs were given me since  11/3/2019. I've forgotten 89 % of what I did know.   That being said, can someone tell me , Wasn't it 24 people running against TRUMP 2016.? Biden 8+ - %.....
Really well that's funny cause rioting and protesting does not make Trump look bad, it makes him look great and America's hero when he sends them good guys to kick the butts of the bad guys!
Thank you President Trump we do appreciate it!
Funny, FEDS raid  Epstein, in unmarked cars.  Even I don't approve of Epstein's crap, but my point is Federal agents raid him and bring CNN along which is against federal regulations And no one said shit.  Trump sends feds to federal building and SUDDENLY It's illegal.
I've been in dozens stores. Always someone says oh I love your mask. But my co-workers are MEXICAN Pakistani. And they hate TRUMP. I'm waiting for one to say I can't wear it. I'LL own me a motel 6...
My co - workers asked if I really wear mine. They didn't say anything out of character. But believe me, they hate TRUMP.   I'm just waiting for them to tell me I can't wear it to work. In fact I'm crossing my fingers that they do...
What‚Äôs treason? Be specific. The Russia thing debunked. The Ukraine debunked. Are talking about selling out to China? Oh that‚Äôs right the Bidens. What treason has Trump done. Using IRS &amp; FBI to spy on political rivals? Oh that right Obama/Biden. What treason?
As reapportionment nerds already know, this looks a lot like a fight that marked the 1920s - the first and only time (so far) that Congress failed to reapportion the House based on the Census.
If President Trump steals it then so be it, at least a liberal will not get to steal it, so let's go steal it!
Once local authority was removed from local officials then the Gastpo was in charge. That‚Äôs what some of the protesters R calling for, a federalize police force. It‚Äôs not Trump calling for this. He is just trying to protect people &amp; property, something he and all were sworn to do
I know but don‚Äôt give up. Failing to vote For Trump is a vote for Biden. Can‚Äôt have that. Sometimes we got to suck it up because the alternate choice suchs even more
Really. What has Trump said that is like ‚Äúwe will burn the system‚Äù which is what several BLM leaders have said. They have said they don‚Äôt want peace. How is that unifying?Trump did say they should go back to steam catapults.
If you‚Äôre mad everything is canceled for the rest of the year ask yourself if you wear a mask. If the answer is no blame yourself. If the answer is yes blame Trump.
Before Trump, there was no one who would go after Epstein.
Why Trump might quit ‚Äì POLITICO

The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúsuburban strategy‚Äù failed and this marked the beginning of the end of racism in America?
All Trump has to do is be honest and say ok ok we lied about this PLANDEMIC were going open up no more masks no force vaccinations everything back normal n I'm sure the voilence will stop because people will have something productive to do n my ass can finally go see a movie
Aah - you took the blue pill.  Not very effective claims on a day Trump suggested delaying the election and falsely claimed that the country had universal mail-in elections (something other than absentee ballots). Sorry, can't return a "nice" try, your response is just a.... try.
If by hero "federal agents" you mean mercenary thugs sent by Trump, and if by "protecting federal property" you mean ASSAULTING VETERANS and Moms, then you'd be right and not embarrassingly full of shit. ...
Is trump the last person to realize that kushner is an idiot?
She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.

I feel like trump is doing that for votes. Not because he cares... üòïüòï
Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.
I betcha Trump wishes he could do that opening pitch now and crack some joke about them beating dead birds.
she also supports BLM and is anti trump and pro LGBTQ+ so she‚Äôs a real steal. Also comes with 2 dogs.
Sorry, Ana.    You helped gaslight the country and are part of the reason we have Trump.  Lay out your path of understanding and remorse if you want credibility.   Until then your words are opportunistic and hollow.

Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.

Yet we can‚Äôt stay gridlocked like this - it seems like whether we ditch the filibuster or not, we still end up at Trump 3.0.  When and how does the suffering that the reactionaries are inflicting on us end?
Lmao. Racist!!  It‚Äôs the tRump virus because if he were a competent leader he would have prevented all this death!

Fine by me if it also means we drag Trump out of office.
What is it going to take to get Trump to shut his racist mouth and stop saying ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù?  It‚Äôs so offensive and does not make anyone believe he‚Äôs somehow not responsible.
Trump will remain a factor, but minority parties have a way of many voices being relevant.  And Trump isn‚Äôt on the 2022 ballot either.
I‚Äôm not surprised that MSM are having a moment Today! It‚Äôs what they do! Trump can play them like a Fiddle! We won‚Äôt be having  Mail-In Votes Dimwads!
Trump and his complicit republicans are doing a good job of making our democracy ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.  I hate all of them for violating their oaths of office.  There is nothing worse than a liar with no honor and no ethics.

You‚Äôve got four more years to keep Trump on mute. By 2024 you‚Äôll be in a mental asylum lol
That is exactly correct.  Trump continues to make horrendous mistakes and refuses to listen to the experts because he thinks he is an expert at everything.
Take a good look at Twitter "trending" tonight.   MichelleObama Podcast  Evict Trump CNNTownhall TrumpHatesScience  Notice a pattern?
So you think ONE person can run a nation wide response solely on their own without anyone else involved? You do realized the blue cities and states "resisted" when Trump ordered their compliance, as did all the sheeple.   There is the problem right there - own it.
You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
I think this is what they call getting rid of the riff raff. It's why people like Trump like borders and country club memberships. Jack up the prices until "undesirables" can't afford to hang, then all you have left are the willfully ignorant deplorables.
Look, supporters of Trump, and Herman Cain, and...you can say what you want, but big gatherings, and opening up, and skipping the wearing of masks...these are dangerous, and dispiriting to our front line health care givers. Help them out!

This country is so fucked. Has to be the biggest collection of the dumbest fucking people on the planet
Obama used John Lewis funeral to try to save his hide because he spied on Trump campaign and got caught. Desperation is the nail on the coffin.
And where is the f4cking stock market ? They don‚Äôt care that trump is running the country into the ground or that the republican want to take away consumer spending ability with unemployment? They used to react to tan suits now nothing

Why Trump Might Quit    We couldn't get that lucky.... it will be a long hard fought battle for the White House.
The governors were tasked with protecting their own states, and the mayors tasked with their cities. So, are you saying they were all inept? Only certain cities took it real hard. Mostly those busy trying to "resist" anything Trump says.
Or making fun of the man‚Äôs death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump‚Äôs lead, by attending a gathering that didn‚Äôt need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....

This is what America is supposed to be about-what it has been for 244 years and will be no longer if Trump is re-elected.
Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äù refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN‚ÄôT wearing masks because Europe‚ù§Ô∏èTrump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb

The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.

Ive been a Trump supporter from day 1, barely hanging on through other bullshit. I like his hardliner stance on China, but any pursuit of this nonsense by Trump, and Im done. One of the most dangerous things I've heard a high ranking US leader say in my lifetime.
It totally is! My husband got all freaked out about one of them and I I had to walk him through the logic of trusting Trump until he gives us a reason not to üòÇ
Because Trump lied and said the Covid was a Hoax.  How many more will follow to the slaughter house? How many more will be lost listening to his lies? Can't have sympathy for those following the dictator tRUmp.
What's up with the Space Force? The Intergalactic Commander-in-Chief never mentions it. It's become the Tiffany Trump of U.S. Armed Forces.
Joe needs to get ahead of it and start talking about a desperate Trump who will say and do anything. Frame Trump as a loser grabbing at straws.
For your amusement... #Trump #MaskUp! üò∑ #MakeUp
Yeah, the do it in their sneaky way.  They don't SAY he contracted it there, they just IMPLY it by saying things like, "Herman Cain, tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the Trump Rally in Tulsa".  They say it in such a way that STUPID DEMOCRATS hear it the BAD way !!!
Donald TRUMP saying the  words "ISN'T DOING HER JOB" is as believable as the words "TRUST ME" spoken by the same man
I‚Äôm dying for Trump to be gone! #DyingForTrump
‚ÄúThose who dismiss these concerns as identity politics must somehow overlook the White identity politics that drives his public appeal. Trump‚Äôs approach is apostasy from the American ideal. It is the kind of thing that can lead to the breaking of nations.‚Äù
Cain died of tRump virus! He was cancer free for 10 years!
You are so right.
Stop gaslighting us into thinking that Biden is the savior. His politics gave us Trump.
Any Trump Presser.....Rambling garbage.
What would our GDP report have been today if Trump handled COVID like Morrison (Australia), Trudeau (Canada) or Merkel (Germany)?
Yeah, she is also running for an office so shock tweets like Trump? So does she have covid too since she said she was with him?
Trump can't walk down a ramp or drink a glass of water with one hand. He can't even pronounce his words right. Should I continue?
First question at the Trump retooling meeting :  Okay guys, we want ideas on the best ways to polish a turd?  GO...

I think the Trump administration is the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT in history.  I think I'll delay sending my money to the IRS until all AMERICANS  can properly, securely and safely believe their government.
You know Trump is in trouble when co-founder of Federalist Society calls Trump a fascist.
And Obama has Class unlike tRump.
Why Trump Might Quit    We couldn't get that lucky.... it will be a long hard fought battle for the White House.
A Trump Putin puppet coward!!!
Or making fun of the man‚Äôs death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump‚Äôs lead, by attending a gathering that didn‚Äôt need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen the trump criticism that you speak of and I live in Texas.
I can‚Äôt say I blame him... I would totally take the Trump approach of ignoring it hoping it will go away
Barr is on the way to that. Give it time. He lied about taking orders from trump. He‚Äôs lied about Lafayette square. He fired prosecutors who were investigating trumps cronies. Roger stone. You haven‚Äôt got much of a leg to stand on here. Better quit before you get further behind.
Cornyn has fallen further in my book than almost any Texas politician during the Trump era.
Just tuned in to MSM And they are about to loose their minds that Trump will delay the Election ü§£ü§£

Maybe I‚Äôm slicing things too thin, but Calabresi‚Äôs subheadline says Trump should be removed ‚Äúunless he relents.‚Äù If Trump relents in his calls to delay the election, is Calabresi still planning to vote for him? Seems to be a little wiggle room here...
James drinks straight from Trump‚Äôs little toad!!
This is what America is supposed to be about-what it has been for 244 years and will be no longer if Trump is re-elected.
Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äù refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN‚ÄôT wearing masks because Europe‚ù§Ô∏èTrump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Thank the lord for President Trump hearing the assertion of the Gillian case too it was more than a sexual assault it was a stalking&amp; brutal attack against that soldier with more than one person involved w/ it    will amnesty be granted
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Anyone campaigning and voting for Trump is the enemy of America.
The National Baketball Association has the words Black Lives Matter written in enormous letters on their court, and trump still thinks his message is winning? Someone told him to stop, but it‚Äôs too late, we know who he is. #TrumpIsLosing

Party agnostic, I‚Äôve always been a sucker when former Presidents are together at historic events  Sadly, I don‚Äôt see that happening for years as I don‚Äôt see Trump performing ceremonial duties of former Presidents
This is about the nominee for the defense department they pulled today.  This Senator already gave a statement that he had a conversation with a Trump last night recommending Trump withdrawal him nomination.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people‚Äôs lives?
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.

You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.

Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!Hmm.  Epstein, Ghislaine, Donald Trump, Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach ...
If you‚Äôre mad everything is canceled for the rest of the year ask yourself if you wear a mask. If the answer is no blame yourself. If the answer is yes blame Trump.
Before Trump, there was no one who would go after Epstein.

If shutdowns are required, there is no reason that a slight delay in voting isnt something that can be done, we already delayed other conventions. Donald Trump Suggests Delaying ‚ÄòMost Inaccurate and Fraudulent‚Äô 2020 Election
If Trump is going to lose anyway, isn‚Äôt this a great year to put forth a third party conservative candidate to lay the groundwork for a victory in 2024? Who can we recruit?   Anybody is preferable to 95% of what the Republican Party is offering.
Important. Congress and SCOTUS must stand up to this kind of behavior.
Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.

I don't think it's breaking news that Donald Trump will have to use absentee balloting in November. He lives at the White House but his residence is in Florida. duh The media acts like absentee balloting and mail-in voting are the same thing. They're NOT.

(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.

Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
Is that why you are running scared and doing what you do best, lying to the American people  about everything !!!  The ‚ÄúTrump Virus,  Voter fraud and the economy!!!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He‚Äôs no better than any of them.
WhY is it we punish families and small businesses for bKP but he is smart? WHy is his business allow to drain our precious economy but no one else?  Why is he not held to the same starndards Everything Trump supports list and rage at others for he has done MANY times and recorded
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump‚Äôs
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
Regardless, as I have repeated, what u as a trump support, is the preceived injustice &amp; power others in DC have, but he is no different.  He is not an outside, he is part of their club &amp; always has been, but back to bKP...
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!‚≠êÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚≠êÔ∏è

Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.

Does not want to go down with the ship, but he was glad to sail along ... hypocrite, cya maneuver.  You cannot wash off the stench of Trump that easily.  Sorry.
'Donald Trump killed Herman Cain': Liberals waste absolutely zero time politicizing Herman Cain‚Äôs death  and blaming Trump
President Trump made a stop in Texas on Wednesday, visiting the Double Eagle Oil Rig in Midland. Correspondent Clayton Neville had more information on Thursday's WBAP Morning News.
I don‚Äôt remember Will‚Äôs criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you‚Äôre right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that‚Äôs not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.

Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn‚Äôt exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don‚Äôt buy that he‚Äôd have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump‚Äôs rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I‚Äôm not convinced Trump‚Äôs team can thwart it.

No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him

I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump‚Äôs birth certificate to verify his birth info).

Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump‚Äôs term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You‚Äôre all talk with no action.  Why hasn‚Äôt anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn‚Äôt like trump when McCain was alive but since then you‚Äôre playing good guy to trump. It‚Äôs obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.

Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don‚Äôt matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
Trump is often persuading.  His goal here may be to draw attention to problems in mail-in voting.  Or it may be to get Democrats to commit to accepting the results of the election.  Or it could be a random thought, but don't ignore persuasion or you will misunderstand Trump.
The ignorant love Trump.
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples‚Äô lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn‚Äôt accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.Trump's America.

You can spin it any way you want, everyone knows Trump denied there was a problem for 2 months while other countries were setting up PPE and tests.
No, because Trump owns them...
Trump was working with faulty info.  Which was what people want. Presidents have advisers for a reason his were on the other side. So he made discussions based on that he know that now so do the people

Funny how Democrats cherry pick the constitution. Last I heard Democrats thought it was an outdated document that needed to be brought into the real world. Anyway...PRESIDENT Trump sure knows how to ruffle the Democrats feathers, and you fall for it every time! üòÇüòÇ#Trump2020 üá∫üá∏
All I can say is look at the company that he was with! Howard Stern has demons among him, and he is a pervert! I can judge for myself what is evil, and what is good! I sent Trump a warning also, but weather he read it is another thing. I hate the evil in the hearts of men!
Curiously that is how long I have been free from demonic oppression!  If u r talk about Trump I really don‚Äôt care! What man on this earth is qualified to make things great! That other puppet is not any better! No one sees liberals for the evil they are, or the curses they bring!

I don't take spiritual advice from anyone who is voting for Trump. Repent yourself.
You clearly missed my point. I'm talking about how Trump and the Republicans might steal the election from the American people.
Trump first announced his candidacy for President in the late summer of 2015. And you can bet he was planning it several months if not years ahead, starting with his "birtherist" claims against Obama.
Trump's fumbling is easily explained by his inability to trust intelligence agencies who are clearly opposed to him, and obfuscation by your friends in Beijing.

You think Greg Abbott wouldn't call the Texas legislature back into session to save Trump? Hell, he's killed thousands at Trump's behest.

Could it be a Gambit to get Republican-controlled legislatures to appoint Trump electors? Which gets us this.
By the way -- if Trump did try to exploit this provision of the Constitution and get Republican-controlled legislatures to appoint electors, this would be the outcome.
What are your thoughts on Trump saying we should delay the election?
When trump was elected, my thoughts is he will never go away. He will spends years and years on his conspiracy theories. His hateful rhetoric will last until he dies.
I've seen a number of people trying to defend Trump by saying the 32.9% drop in GDP isn't as bad as it sounds, since that is the annualized number based on one quarter.  Because an 8.225% GDP drop in three months is perfectly fine, I guess.
Trump, of course, has no ability to cancel the presidential election. But could this be part of a gambit to get Republican-controlled state legislatures to simply appoint electors who will vote for Trump without a vote of the people at all? Because that would be constitutional.

The Crazy D‚Äôs are grasping at straws, trying to blame President Trump for COVID-19. Sad, huh that they deny that China is not our friend. Truth is: COVID stands for China‚Äôs Own Viral Infectious Disease! Trump‚Äôs been saying that from the beginning. He was right!

where are you getting THAT from? " Easy: your blaming Trump for their actions to shield them from accountability. Looks pretty obvious... don't you think ??

Dude, Trump has 5 kids from 3 different women.
Wrong.  CNN reported on several occasions that there was no wiretap on Trump‚Äôs campaign.  That was patently false.  Not only was there a wiretap, but it was illegally unmasked and the transcripts walked into the WH.
Sadly, the lightning bolt did not animate her and she did not walk to Washington and beat Donald Trump with her torch.
A friend posted pictures allegedly of swords confiscated by police in Portland and used them to justify Trump deploying the Gestapo.  I asked my friend, who regularly carries an AR-15 at political protests, when he became an opponent of the right to keep and bear arms.
It not Trump, it‚Äôs that he is exposing their corruption. And threatening their power and illicit funds. Show me how a political figure can go into politics broke and leave a multi millionaire. Obama for example.
I have requested my mail in ballot. I encourage everyone that can, do so. Every vote counts!  Even though we know he‚Äôs gonna protest mail in votes!  By the way trump and Family have mailed in their ballots for years. So has the VP.  Why is it a problem now?
did I just hear Mary trump school Megan McCain on her attending a dinner for her aunt at the White House‚Ä¶ I think I did!

Pro Trump demonstration in Temecula California. Over 5000 people saying they had enough of Liberal Democrat Pelosi &amp; Gavin Newsom destructive policies against the state of California. Protesters ask to recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom.John Lewis didn't go to George Bush inauguration but he was there.  Descent people find a way to have humility,  Trump has a mental issue.  He doesn't even relate to his wife and child.
Most Americans voted for Trump

Trump‚Äôs housing tweets, explained
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.
Thinks? Pretty much certain the way he is acting.  All five year olds, ever: If I can‚Äôt play with it, I‚Äôm going to break it so nobody can play with it.  Trump is a bully with no compassion, he will tear everything down in the tim between the election and the inauguration.
Hehehe. We all know what bless your heart really means.  Good for him.  Trump wants fox to be state media.
Obama criticism is one thing, but to act like Trump is better for the black community when he‚Äôs letting a pandemic kill us is really worms for brains
Please tell me he coughed on trump at least
You are ignoring that trump thinks he is above the law and his supporters are letting him be so he could do this.
Amen! 4 years is enough....unless he suspends elections Heil trump üò¨

Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
This sounds like something Trump would say
Boy bye!  NOW you love Trump.  Playing golf with him during COVID increases, acting like a damn fool for Cavanaugh. Lighting the skin tone of your opponent because you are desperate. You are effectively helping him destroy the US and you will deserve it.  Karma has no deadline.
That is assuming trump will leave the office.  Economy can be repaired.  Letting a dictator take over the country only has one solution.
I live here too and more and more are seeing what is going on even if they dont want to admit it.  I dont care how we get there so long as Trump loses and gets kicked out.
You don‚Äôt understand because you are not affected. You are blinded by privilege. Must be nice. How does that feel?ü§î In your next life,I so hope that you don‚Äôt come back as a person of color.  You are blind and clueless as to how Trump really feels about brown folks.
While Trump ignored the Coronavirus pandemic, his idiot son tweeted nonsense.

Recently spent time in mountains of KY, poorest of the poor - surprised at how many were Trump supporters. The see the Deep State of none for thee &amp; all for me &amp; they are repulsed.
I have said it once and I will say it again. President Trump has a chance of doing some really great things if he is fortunate to win a second term and can overcome the Democrats madness. We should give him the chance to do what Democrats have been unable to do for years.
Please please help us President Trump. #Hcqworks

There is truth to what you are saying. There are for profit prisons. Obama shut a lot of them down, Trump opened them back up as soon as he came into office. Also a felon must be ‚Äúoff paper‚Äù to vote. It takes a lot to get off paper. It‚Äôs a form of voter suppression
New low...As people die daily?  I would say the deaths that are occurring and Trump playing golf,unbothered; is the new low.
What the hell is wrong with you.  We have a President talking to Putin without telling us what is being said. With almost 150,000 Americans dead and you are hooked on 4 Americans who died? Trump has got to go!!!

On Joes worst day he's better than Trump on his best day
Anything less than the current disaster is acceptable. Just wait until Trump's idiocy affects you...your tune will change, Romney.
I think a lot of people support Trump cause they are tired of lifelong Politicians. No reason for people to be in Washington 20 years and average person having to work two jobs just to live. Democratic Party needs to find someone not a ‚ÄúPolitician‚Äù
Kristie, The only time the Dems open their mouths at all is when it is an Anti-Trump smear.  The Dems are power hungry for a New World Order BUT they will NOT have the opportunity unless God Almighty allows it! Trump WILL win re-election!!!!!!!

You are, undoubtedly, part of the problem because none is as blind as he who will not see. Money for HBCUs and an unemployment rate inherited from the previous administration is apparently enough to keep you out of the "suburbs" Trump wants to protect.
Sean notice that all of these Democrat idiots are running to the same beat " That Trump will not leave if not elected". Only a child could come up with an idea like that. Had to come from Pelosi who is already on record as saying. These folks are so childish it's scary.

I really would like to know if Trump‚Äôs son is going to school face to face when school starts.
do you ever get tired of lying every time you get behind the podium. You said Trump hasn‚Äôt changed?? So I guess saying the virus is going to disappear is the same as him saying things are going to get worse. Now all of the sudden he thinks mask are patriotic?üëÄ
And they continue blaming the cause for the spread of the virus on President Trump. I guess people are so self centered and not concerned about spreading it to others including their loved ones.
As Eric and I said before this came out .. Trump had his best week of of consistant critical thinking messaging on the big issues ever.  Best favorability ratings (likely not registered voters) in months. Focused, consistent messsging on the big issues works!
Trump has no idea how this process works, Jake.
I am 66 yrs old today. Met you at SpartaCon in Maryland  (was a panel host). Wondering if my fave Imperator/Templar might take a moment to shout out a Happy Birthday? And, for the record, Trump sux! üòá

We must demand accountability from #Facebook for profiting off of Donald Trump's misleading, dangerous ads.Key federal oversight bodies must investigate Facebook &amp; stop them from profiting off vote-suppressing ads.
This was a dumb statement   Trump won‚Äôt get a pass You won‚Äôt get a pass  Effective communication means I don‚Äôt have to interpret what you are saying  Say what you mean, and mean what you say!
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
Many people are saying that the Trump administration will now be known as The Washington Felony Team
Can someone explain to me in the 40 years she has been in Washington what is one Government Department she has made better?  In 40 years of being in DC I someone to tell me 1 thing that she has done that has help the average US person. I don‚Äôt really care for Trump but he only 3.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
Name one fault Trump has taken responsibility for. Politicians, Dem or Rep, don‚Äôt do that. That‚Äôs why we call them politicians.
Very accurate depiction of Trump‚Äôs coronavirus briefing.
President Trump should cut off all law enforcement funding immediately or whatever funds they receive that's within his discretion.
Do people not see what trump is doing. He is stationing these military men around the country because the election is coming up and they will enterfer with the election and when it‚Äôs time to leave the White House they will protect him. Let‚Äôs watch and see !!!
So Trump has n blood on his hands, right?
So, Trump's secret police is out terrorizing the American populace in an effort to show what another president would do?  C'mon Boris, you can't be that far up Donald's butt...or can you?

Yes but they were using scare tactics and nobody stopped them. These protest turned violent because Trump called them thugs but they have a legitimate reason to be angry.
Not me, nothing will stop me from voting for Trump
Trump wants to Keep America great again. But he's running this country like a dictatorship and yet. People still support him. What a fucking joke
Pop never criticized Morey, so that‚Äôs bullshit you made up.  Pop supported Adam Silver‚Äôs response to the controversy.  There is difference.  Trump has done nothing to help Hong Kong maintain its independence, and that‚Äôs a fact.

Well as Trump is prone to do. He creates a problem that doesn't exist and comes up with a solution. Here's some facts from the states that already have mail-in voting.  No advantage for Dem or Rep. Simply Trumps way to drum up Republican support.
Then these trump supporters wanna say black lives don‚Äôt matter, they do bless this manüôèüèΩ
Cain died in Georgia. Trump would stack an all white jury, and be found not guilty.
Don't listen to this piece of shit. All teachers can go on strike for violating safety. Trump's on his way out soon.
Trump fired and hired a new post office chief. To create damage to post office.
Crashing economy. I'm so tired of Trump brand winning.
It's almost like people prefer a podcast with interesting guests that cover a myriad of topics over a podcast with some screeching broad that talks about Trump nonstop.
Herman Cain speaking out on Tulsa, OK President Trump rally, "masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOLPLE ARE FED UP!" It's a little difficult to feel bad for somebody who ignored science, and put himself in that position.
Trump" smart people know it ( election fraud will happen with mail ballots), stupid people may not and some people may not want to talk about it"
$PRPO I‚Äôm out the trump rumors messed up the momentum of this one .
My prediction is that in October, Trump will try to an executive order to prevent the states from doing Mail-In Ballots. States will then have to be in a mad rush to try to get stuff set up for voter turnout with more people than average because of that take away.

Trump is not a saint &amp; because of his incompetence the USA has lost 150,000 &amp; shame on him he refuses to take responsibility. His love affair with Putin is questionable. He refuses to accept that Putin has paid people to kill our military troops in Afghanistan. Facts or fake?????
Trump's gonna lose because he's a dumbfuck who won't get off Twitter and concentrate on that small job of running the country
Man oh man, I can't wait til people find out Trump gets a pension and money for office space and a staff when he leaves office.
Its a bot
President Trump tweeted the possibility of postponing the elections. It is a move that can only be made by Congress. Do you think the 2020 election should be delayed?
Nancy P and the democrats have been working with china for several years to develop a plan to get Trump out. This is all on purpose by democrats.

Trump Logic: It‚Äôs safe enough during COVID-19 (THE USA WHO HAS THE MOST POSITIVE CASES AND DEATHS IN THE WORLD) to send children to schools and open the country but it‚Äôs not safe enough to vote.   This dude is a disgrace and needs to be removed from office.
How else would he get listening devices in the walls?  Putin still needs intel after trump is voted out.
If a city hosts a Trump rally, they need to be paid in advance.  This is why American banks won't give Trump building loans.
He won because of people like yourself. It isn't hard to impress trump supporters.
This is obscene! Why is this happening?  Trump Administration is incompetent!
You are a disgusting, trump pandering excuse for a human being!
What about voting machine from when Hillary was running against trump
So stop disabled, elderly, military votes ?  Did you know Trump votes by mail and so do millions of other legitimate registered voters?  Stopping people from voting is ridiculous.
Bot! Bot! Bot! Trump doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you, your friends or anybody. He just cares only for himself. Always has been about him. Always will be about him.

We knew trump is and will always be a dishonest person who  can not stand defeat! Now it seems the Democratic Party (majority but not all) has joined him to try to get personal wealth from taxes paid by all Americans! Too bad America!
This is how Donald Trump gets 4 more years
Trump's staff no doubt reminds him of Carville's quote "It's the economy, stupid." about the  importance of a good economy to being re-elected. He will try every dirty trick in the book to circumvent the election. He's nuts.
Legal experts say the president does not have the power to move Election Day.

Its not that they actually believe it works, its that Reps want people to believe that Dems are aware of a ‚Äúcure‚Äù but deliberately won‚Äôt release it because they want everything shut down for the remainder of the election so Trump loses. The drug itself is irrelevant
Actually, you can see the racism in Biden‚Äôs comment.  One must make a prejudicial assumption to see Trump‚Äôs comment as racist.

I agree. However, for schools to open and stay open, we'll need to implement public health measures that the Trump administration has resisted.
And I‚Äôll be wherever the fuck I want to be. You do t like it? GTFO social media. Trump jails children, loses their family and YOU support that.
Wow you are ignorant. I have done plenty of research. The detention centers were built by Obama...duh. But it was the Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy in 2018 when separating immigrant parents from their children started. And was widely rejected by BOTH parties.
love seeing you going to Midland I really hope you can help get the oil industry back to work as a oilfield worker I am one of the many that has been layed off since March and need to get to work to feed my family thank you Mr.Trump your a wonderful president
Imagine Trump and Pence coming down with COVID-19 at the beginning of October. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You and Obama left Trump with a mess. He had the economy in great shape before 6 Covid. Fauci was working on Covid under your administration
Hey bot we don‚Äôt love Trump.
Air Force One spotted by Aim this morning after it‚Äôs landing at the Midland International Air and Space Port. President Trump will be visiting a rig in Midland to see how the energy industry has been impacted, in an effort to help strengthen the oil and gas production in the US.
It's literally a bot that copy and pastes his tweets and replaces letters
Don‚Äôt worry the numbers will start to look better now that Trump has made hospitals STOP üõë reporting to the CDC.  He signed a Executive order to make them send the numbers to the White House.  He‚Äôll fix em like those too hard CDC school guidelines.
Trump putting an executive order to STOP ALL CENSORSHIP, thank you! #TRUMP2020
The #CowardInChief is sending troops into our cities but is too much of a coward to question Putin about bounties on American soldiers. There is no bigger traitor in American history than Donald Trump.  He should be dealt with as a traitor,removed from office and thrown in prison
Lest you think this is all bluster, it is actually Donald Trump and Bill Barr preparing the American people for their unmarked goon-squad SS troops to put down riots when Donald Trump refuses to leave office after losing the election...
Stark differences remain between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counter from Republicans for the next coronavirus aid package.
The rule of law in America is now an illusion.  Our legal institutions are meaningless as long as  is unwilling to enforce it‚Äôs judgments.
Agree, totally. At the moment, all white Americans are aware of racism like never before. We passively ignored it too long. That‚Äôs on us. It literally took the overtness of Trump and MAGAts to wake us. So it‚Äôs not just yesteryear‚Äôs  Republicans at fault.
The thing about Trump's latest dustup with #hydroxycholoroquine apparently involves #DemonDNA.   And #SpaceAliens.   Yes, Trump made a fool of himself. Yes, conservative media are defending him.   But don't underestimate Trump's #Propaganda skill.
President Trump issued a memorandum seeking to exclude people in the country illegally from being included during the process for redrawing congressional districts.
#StellaImmanuel? I guess #DemonDNA and #DemonSemen are where Republicans have decided to make their stand.  I've heard that #Witches and #Reptilians are involved.   There was once some doubt about whether #Republicans are nutso. All doubt is now removed.
Texas is not "Trump country". It's actually divided on its support for him. It just depends on where you're at.
Trump = draft dodger.   If in some other universe Trumpkins were patriots &amp; IF in that other universe, some nation paid ppl to kill those Trumpkins, in that universe would the parent of those trumpkins want to discuss their killing w the person who pd to kill them?
Trump‚Äôs twitter feed is possibly the most negative on twitter!
Donald Trump is a Trojan Horse for Russia. Pass it on.
President Trump also referred to the intelligence as "fake news," and added that "a lot of people are saying that it's a fake issue."
You mean the children locked in cages by Trump administration, many of which they have lost contact and information to who their parents are? Maybe be concerned with ACTUAL atrocities happening instead of your fake BS ones that have ZERO credibility.
On this question I have evolved. Currently it‚Äôs impossible. In the post-Nixon years before Trump, I think there were many well-meaning Republicans who didn‚Äôt realize they were racist.
If trump wins, they‚Äôll blame independent voters instead of themselves
How about ‚ÄòTrump‚Äôs gestapo?‚Äô
If you would have told me just 5 things that happened with Trump as President I would have thought you were crazy as shit.

This should be funny. But it isn't #StellaEmmanuel  #Trump #COVID19
A petition for rulemaking has asked the FCC to develop oversight of online social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
Trump and Republicans are running with the "law and order" campaign. Creating disorder and making it look like trump is fixing things then trying to say this is what we have to look forward too if biden wins. Republicans are unified in this message, democrats need to step it up.
Put it this way.. I've had tires slashed windows broke because I have Trump bumper sticker and window flag
Won't happen. Dems aren't interested in helping anyone. There's an actual treatment for covid-19, but nobody wants to hear about it. There's only one priority take Trump down what ever it take. Even if it means sacrificing Americans.
Calls Susan Collins a Trump stooge! Moe.
when these ignorant #latinos flaunt signs that say ‚Äúlatinos for trump‚Äù i think to myself, who tf said you speak for the latinos? fuck you.
The og tweet was deleted but referenced the idea that voting between Biden and Trump is like choosing between getting shot by a handgun or a shotgun... which pissed me off bc of the actual lives lost to the spike in hate crimes and hate speech under Trump...
On the mind of so many Americans are stimulus checks, unemployment and the return to school.
Doug Jones‚Äôs victory in 2017 truly was perhaps the happiest day of the Trump era for me. I admire this man and subscribe to a pragmatic progressive politic that leads with the heart in all policies like him.
What does Putin have to do with Trump. The ignorance of some people are the problem. If you want to vote for Biden and his Pedophilia groupies then may God have Mercy on your soul! Because I sure won't!!!!
He pushed back against angry, skeptical Democrats who said President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is unconstitutionally suppressing dissent.
Don‚Äôt you dare then claim to be an ally during pride month and don‚Äôt you dare say that you support children at the border and that black lives matter while you indirectly perpetuate Trump‚Äôs fascism and white nationalism
I‚Äôve been spat on and called a ‚Äúdirty queer‚Äù &amp; a ‚Äúf***‚Äù at a B&amp;N and subjected to absolute fear walking around my neighborhood since Trump took office. So you can say the election doesn‚Äôt matter with your white cis-hetero privilege but don‚Äôt you dare then claim to be progressive
SCRIBD:¬† Barr Report, Twitter is Making a Big Push to Silence Discussion of a COVID-19 Cure, American Doctors Address COVID-19 Misinformation, Stimulus Check Is Coming, UN Orders Trump to Withdraw From Portland, &amp; Bitcoin Price:¬†Pumping
I think one of the most interesting things to come out of this phase in the Trump era is how the pandemic and Trump himself have sped up the liberalization of a state like Arizona. It‚Äôs a longtime Red state that‚Äôs been turning blue in similar ways as VA did.
It‚Äôs that thing Trump lacks in totality ‚Äî empathy. You just hate seeing us suffer.
If there are 10,000 peaceful protesters and one individual who commits arson, that‚Äôs 10,001 arsonists, according to Trump and Barr. Reminds me of an angry little guy with a funny little mustache who blamed all the people of one religion for everything bad.

This bizarre reasoning proves how unfit Trump is. USA TODAY: White House sought money for FBI building in GOP stimulus: source
Trump would absolutely mock someone he didn't like who walked like that.
I bet they even have an article congratulating Trump for winning the 2020 Presidential election too.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak from the White House at 5 pm Eastern on Tuesday. Officials have not said what his news conference will cover.
He has no respect for them and the position they hold , his arrogance has become Trump like. This hearing is for naught
All the people who said Trump would destroy America, their the ones destroying America, rioting out there and ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù protesting. Ironic
Barr being hammered very badly. Unfortunately, nobody can do nothing to charge, indict, fire in any way. Like Trump. They are doing criminal acts. And laughing.
The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center made the allegation in a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end DACA, but affirmed his ability to do so.
In an open letter from Young posted to  he says he changed his mind following the decision to send federal forces to Portland.
Watch out trump on what you say, these are the people that are going to vote you out
Hell yeah, TRUMP 2020 BABY.
#Trump tried to vote in 2004. Didn't go well.
But on another note I wanna know why tiktok keeps recommending trump supporters on my for you page my thumb hurts from blocking these people like???????
The hearing today is a circus!!! The Democrats are making fooos of themselves. I hope they continue that way because it is clear they are helping President Trump to secure his second turn!!! TUMP 2020 !!!! #ThanksDems!!!!!

The president's eldest son will have limited access to Twitter for 12 hours.
Most covid deaths were from when the democrats moved patients into nursing homes, killing off millions. Rep states didn‚Äôt call for that, only 5 dem states did, that‚Äôs crazy but none of y‚Äôall do the research and still this this mishandling of the covid situation is trump. Cmon ppl
Donald Trump Jr. has been temporarily suspended from certain functions on Twitter for violating the website's rules for spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
President Trump's biggest flex is making everyone believe he is stupid.
It‚Äôs difficult not to gloat. It will be impossible if Trump gets it.
do y‚Äôall remember when trump thought he could force the states to open and a reporter used a question to say ‚Äúwho told you that you have that authority??‚Äù LMAOOOOOOOO
Trump keeps pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, is an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
His family appears to be cause they're following Trump and retweet some of his stuff as support...and it makes sense cause him and Josh deliberately make an attempt to keep politics to themselves.Maybe not but I wouldn't be surprised if he is Republican considering he's Christian
A Bernie Sanders campaign cochair says choosing between Trump and Biden is like having 'a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you've got to do is eat half of it'    With friends like this who needs enemies. Fire her NOW!!

Great Reporting, most of us knew the down play was just to Spite Trump and for $$$
They do it because they follow orders from the DNC and to spite Trump
Libs are saying Trump will not pay respects to John Lewis. Is this true? If so, It‚Äôs a bad move
LMAO!! Trump is a LOSER!
You are a LOSER!!  LMAO  Yankees surprised by Trump announcing plans to throw first pitch without invite: NYT
Wish people would understand that Donald Trump is really for the people, he‚Äôs fighting against globalists, not the people. He‚Äôs been VERY consistent with his views from years back from past interviews where the news loved him and now they trash him. Smh.
I think ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù Joe would loose the respect of his voters if he called Trump ‚ÄúLier‚Äù Trump or Trump ‚ÄúCheetos‚Äù. He‚Äôs way above that.
I just want to help others who can't help themselves but I guess Jordan Peterson and Donald Trump already took care of that

It‚Äôs bigger than Trump. France pulled from the shelves with no reason in January.
Please know that we love and support and cherish you. Most of us believe God sent you to take on this evil for us. They are targeting you and trying to defeat you. Don't buy one bit of it! It's all bullshit. TRUMP FOREVER!
70s, 80s, and 90s. Awesome yrs. But while we were living our life. Gov. really started taking advantage. And now look at the mess we got. Damn it we had 1 to many joints and to many six packs. Fun days INDEED. Now we got to fix this shit. President Trump only hope
How appropriate, trump plays a round of golf with a sexual deviant  (Brett Favre) just like him. I guess they spend the round comparing notes.
Oh, disagreeing with someone is fascist now? Who told you that, Trump?
I will vote Trump #Trump2020

Yes! She speaks truth to power! The Fed is propping up the stock market to the tune of trillions! Trump is a loser!
Pedodent Trump is so empathic ...... or so....so.... empathetic ... ..  Towards other peop...paedos....  pedos...
IF Trump hasn't been a leader, &amp; has lied 20K times, &amp; has denounced masks, which even Mr Mayor now endorses, what else could Trump be lying about? Wrong about? TX! CCTX! T.H.I.N.K.!
It would look bad for Trump's kkk supporters. üòú Trump says he will not pay respects to civil-rights icon John lewis - Business Insider
Pedodent Trump, can you speak to the issue of scalp reduction as a cause of domestic violence?
Trump refused to pay respect because John Lewis supported BLM. Joe Biden visits Capitol Rotunda to pay respects to civil rights icon John Lewis
Americans know Trump's a racist. Typical not showing respect. President Trump says he will not visit John Lewis' casket in US Capitol  via
Wow cover it up Mayor so Trump can't come in
This is obviously a real real ignorant repressive. A Democrat would rather support Trump than Biden. Must be a Sanders supporter contaminating campaign.
Welp, have fun with another trump term
The Dem politicians, their propaganda media wing, complete with Democrat Doctors, all have 1 goal. Tank the economy, because historically any President with a bad economy doesnt get re elected. Fauci  is a HUGE Hillary supporter. Hillary hates Trump. They all wanted her to win.üëá
Getting all the facts out = "a hit piece" huh?  Sounds more like you're trying to distance yourself from Trump to keep that sweet resistance cash coming in
Just come out for trump already  so 2/3 of Americans will not buy your products.
I'm sure this will be a balanced conversation and not at all an echo chamber.  I'd put the over/under on 100 on how many times "Trump" is said.
A vote for blue means you don't know any better. Trump and Biden are womanizers! Old, white and creepy. Is this the best Dems have to offer? Can't beat reds so Join them?
He will do this at the cost inappropriately sniffing and touching women. Don't get me wrong, Trump is the same way! We deserve better!
‚ÄúEqual opportunity‚Äù outrage is usually a cover story for hate in general and racism or misogyny or both, in particular. Ten bucks says this person doesn‚Äôt really reject Trump or Trumpism.
WOW NOW THAT'S TRULY SCARY, IF THAT WOUL OF BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE PICTURE , ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE NOT COOL
Lol ! This is pretty good pre-2016 reasoning. But the truth is that whomever Trump endorses will have &gt;half the base locked down.  The GOP will belong to the Trump-esque faction for a generation to come. They have found a voice. Sad very sad. But true.
For tRump to ‚Äúpay his respects‚Äù to John Lewis would be disrespectful.
Exactly. They do it for tRump all the time. Did it with BritishOpenGate.
Melania Trump is renovating the Rose Garden, seems pointless because she isn‚Äôt going to be around the White House next spring to tend to the garden, can someone please tell this poor lady to cancel those plans
What has trump said about falling wall? Cat got his tongue?
Nothing can open safely until we adopt basic #PublicHealth measures. It is increasingly obvious that this won't happen w/ Trump in the White House - and may never happen in the red states. #Baseball is NOT back.
Ted, I hate to tell you, but countries that shut down are now enjoying a revived economy and lower Covid-19 rates than we are.  If your buddy trump had taken the initiative and shut down everything in the beginning, we would also be getting back to business!  This is all on you!
Would also be interesting to know why she blames Trump for not funding schools when others have asserted he has no legal authority to do so.  Hell, he doesn't even control the budget.
... was not allowed to be mentioned in any court proceeding despite the fact that those facts had been widely reported by then. So she gave up and took a 5-year plea deal. This is why Flynn, Stone AND TRUMP belong where she is and she should be both free and celebrated.
Democrats: Trump doesn't have the authority to tell schools what to do.  Also Democrats: Why hasn't Trump told schools what to do?
Another Trump grifter spending taxpayer money.
Ok and why have you failed to stand up for us  by speaking out against his racism, lies and so on? There are 140k + lives LOST to this pandemic and you are one of Donold Trump‚Äôs enablers. Shame on you.

It's unclear how O'Brien was infected or how much contact he had with President Trump recently, but O'Brien recently returned from a trip to Europe.
Micha Cohen and his niece Mary have definitely honestly disclosed. Trump's a bonified racist. Among so many more criminal acts. To many crimes don't have room on Twitter to elaborate.
More Americans now say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in his presidency. That's according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC.

I personally think the silent majority‚Äôs support of Trump is real, it carried him 2016 and will carry him again in 2020.  Also note, I am equally skilled in politics as I am in #EFT, which is to say, not very skilled
The debates will be pure magic.  Trump, with substance or not, will steamroll Biden..but I truly cannot imagine there are a lot of undecided voters.  Trump faced a weak (but polarizing) candidate in 2016, now he is just facing a weak one...it will be interesting

I didn't say Biden was the correct choice but Trump isn't it either.
TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THEN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT
I thought Joe Biden was being billed as a "uniter"? How did Joe Biden spend his weekend?   He joined an event with coastal elites honoring Kathy Griffin, who was once photographed holding a bloodied, severed head of President Trump.  Classy, Joe!
And by the way, dont forget, President Trump does not collect his paycheck. He gives his quarterly salary to charity. That's $400,000 x 8years =$3.2 million he does not personally take as his salary. Hardest working President in 100 years,maybe ever.
I live in Texas &amp; trump HAS NOT done his job well. He reopened nation too soon. #TrumpVirus

Dear Patriot, i agree, but it's not only the Chinese, it's our politicians, who are making obscene profits in China, using China, to get rid of Trump. The left is so power hungry, that they sacrifice American lives, not realizing that it helps China achieve world leadership.
Because Trump is president.
The poll also shows Trump's approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach.
Trump is selfishly abusing Reagan's legacy, and Reagan deserves every bit of it.
A strong, alpha male like our President Trump, happens only once in a lifetime. There is not one politician, who can measure up to this man.  Anyone else, would have thrown in the towel, long time ago, and gone home to enjoy their wealth. We the people, love Donald Trump !!!!!!!

Every Republican in office right now will bash these brothers as being against America because they are carrying guns. But when white people do it that support Trump they are called law abiding citizens. No MFs these are law abiding citizens that have the right to bear arms too!
You know white dudes storm a capital in Michigan and Trump calls them fine people. Then people protest and he calls them animals. I'm sure he won't call these black men that have the right to bear arms fine people but very bad people that are a danger to America. No they're not!
Trump and kkk followers are terrorists Trump is calling protesters terrorists. That puts him in the company of the world's autocrats
He is unfolding his oath. He didn't swear an oath to a party. He swore an oath to the Constitution! Unlike Trump Gestapo soldiers! Those are traitors of the highest order.
These men and women would be slapping the shit out Trump. And Robert E Lee was not an American he was a Confederate General that took arms against his nation. Horrible disgusting painting that I wish I could burn. While you're at it. Add Putin, and Hitler to it.

Unreal. The right-wing Putin-fellating lie that the dossier about Putin‚Äôs b*tch Trump was misleading. Page has the country‚Äôs best interests at heart.
The blue wave threatening to crush Trump's re-election chances is growing
THIS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR US THEN YOU AND THAT OBAMA,  HOW YHANK YOU FOR CALL HIM PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! CAUSE HE'S GONNA BE YOUR PRESIDENT ANOTHER 4 MORE YEARS, TAKE CARE JOEY
üòúüòúüòúüòúTrump praises DeSantis' despite record COVID-19 deaths in Florida, canceled GOP convention
That's what Kayne wants. He wants to help his communism traitor friend Trump by taking votes away from Biden. It's all a plan. He doesn't want to be president he wants to help Trump win again.
The rich support whoever they think will win. It's in their best interest. When the rich start funding Biden, it's over for Trump. #VoteBlue2020
Virginia just recently changed the name of one of its high schools from Robert E. Lee to John Lewis. Trump will be lucky to get a port-a-potty named for him. #VoteBlue2020
I have a Melania Trump joke, but you have to pay for it.
It‚Äôs a fun juxtaposition but let‚Äôs not forget that Trump‚Äôs failure on the wall is a good thing.
You know those tweets President Trump admitted he regretted send. Well I regret sending the one off the LPGA. I just realized it was a fcking rerun. So sorry. My bad ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üò±üò±
Not only are Trump and other "Republicans" creating more and more to talk about; but also more and more earlier crap keeps being unearthed as time goes by.
Why do people hate Donald Trump?
not trying to be political or anything but I saw this article a few days ago... if it helps lol
Agree 100%, its because Satan never sleeps, that is why evil never quits. So that is why, the evil left, MSM and swamp attacks our best President ever Trump, 24/7 !!  I follow back.
These liberal women do not want to be treated differently than men. So this is hypocritical for them to be outraged over this when they use same language when speaking of President Trump.
Trump says he's "been waiting for Congress to take action" to reduce drug prices.  House Democrats passed a bill to lower drug prices more than 7 months ago. Trump threatened to veto it.
The countless children across our County will suffer irreparable mental and emotional damage due to your blind political ambition and anti-Trump hate, reflected in your callous decision to shut down schools until this fall.. coincidentally before 11/3  We will NEVER forget this.

President Donald Trump on Thursday called for a bipartisan solution to high drug prices, tweeting out that he likes ‚ÄúSen. Grassley‚Äôs drug pricing bill very much, and it‚Äôs great to see Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs bill today. Let‚Äôs get it done in a bipartisan way!‚Äù
Is it like saying Hillary was under investigation days before the election, but staying quiet about an investigation into trump?
Disclaimer: I do not actually believe that covid was made to wipe out Trump supporters, no is that the purpose of the disinformation campaign. I just believe Trump‚Äôs trying to keep up support by saying ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs fine!,‚Äù and his supporters believe him as if there is no virus.
Yea but it's better to be a self thinking smart guy President Trump voter. Then the idiots backing BLMs destroying and killing our country.
Don‚Äôt worry. If Trump doesn‚Äôt deplete it, Biden will. And whoever is behind either one of those, won‚Äôt be on our side either. Quit blaming the party you oppose and realize that both parties hate you.
This is why everyone should vote to get the crazies out so we can start over from a sane beginning point!  Disagreement is ok but we are out of control as a nation!  Heaven help us and get Putin and trump out of control of our country.
INSANE is the correct explanation and the trump supporters I know are not that crazy!  Off base but not completely INSANE.
I told you they are neither Democrats nor Republicans and a vote for trump is a vote against Americans
So sad to hear, but 9 a day in Corpus Christi is not uncommon. Our governor  was too eager to help his buddy trump's reelection bid by sacrificing the very people he swore to protect.
Kristy I have wasted votes before doing what you suggest but not this time!  That would be a victory for trump and this country must get back in the real world.  Trump is neither democrat nor Republican and I fear he is anti American!  Not a joke!  He is out of control!
Yeah. BEFORE the anthem. Not during. BEFORE! But you want to make a big deal out of it. Stop using the anthem, flag and troops as props. Quit using your master Trump‚Äôs tactics. Or is he using yours? It gets confusing.
You are the best Donald Trump. We love what you do! üá∫üá∏
please Jean Pierre educate  on history of racist Presidents. Trump is not the first. Major foot in mouth.
I would say 99% of us Trump supporters don‚Äôt advertise. Good luck in November!
Trump's kid not in school. And private schools no kids. Yet these schools and trumps5kids6schools received millions from government stimulas aid.
I challenge all news agencies stop airing Trump's so called cov19 briefings. Without Dr. Fauci and talking propagandist campaigns. ü§™
Whoever the DNC decides to put in as Bidens running mate. That‚Äôs who will actually be running against Trump
The last thing this country needs is somebody in charge who has signs of dementia you may not like President Trump but you have to agree he‚Äôs done a lot of good for this country with trade deals eliminating terrorism being a very pro life president he is tireless. Love him.
WE BETTER WIN!!! OR ELSE WE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THOSE FAKE DEMOCRATS,  WHAT THEY DID TO YOU US AMERICA,  ALL THIS CRAZINESS,  WE'RE GOING TO DO IT TO THEM, IF I WOULD OF KNOWN I COULD OF DONE THIS TO OBAMA, NOBODY BETTER NOT  MESS WITH OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP OR ELSEüëä

I know things about mr trump and the catholic church that yall dont.   What you think I'm stupid enough to tell random ass people that shit, F you I dont want my door kicked in
He‚Äôs ok still better than trump tho
You know the answer Kevin! They are all bought and paid for, just like everyone else in DC. President Trump and about 6 of you are all any of us believe or trust.
Sorry about these posts on Mr. Sandmann, but it‚Äôs just funny how the GOP claims to have the thickest skin in the world unlike the Democrats, but get butt hurt when I talk critical of Trump or anyone who supports him.
Prominent Trump.supporter murdered in broad daylight on Milwaukee street. 60 year old black man. üíîüò±
Bernell Tremmell, 60, was shot in front of his business, Expression Publications, at 911 E. Wright. The building is covered in handmade signs, the most prominent of which read "Vote Donald Trump 2020," and "Re-Elect Trump 2020."Law enforcement sources tell "The Dan O'Donnell Show
retweet.." I just told my grandparents (who once lived under Mussolini) that ppl in the US think Trump is a fascist.  They laughed so hard, they cried."
Trump 2020!
All of Trump‚Äôs properties when they are in receivership. I figure that‚Äôll set me back $500 or so.
I‚Äôd like to see a multi partisan system that allows for electoral fusion and ranked choice voting, but rn our choices are limited. This novermber truly is an election between Trump and Biden.  represents the coalition of forces united behind a more progressive vision.
What century does Trump think American women are living in?
You know #AmericasGreatestMistake was believing a two bid con by the name of donald j trump.
Please! Check Biden‚Äôs Senate record with drug companies! Check how many times he  sponsored bills that sent our pharmaceuticals to China! Educate yourself! Blame Trump for decades of high prices! How stupid are the leftist?!?
Trump all the way! Do the crime, do the time stupid! Oh, those lies have already been proven false, just like the ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù federal agents. Sheeple.
And a pending national weather disaster here in South Texas. He's no leader. trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake
Fat dunce Trump punts.

Shannon Sharpe Just Sent a Stern Message to Donald Trump
Make no mistake, whenever any Republican or Trump family member prefaces anything with ‚Äúmake no mistake,‚Äù it‚Äôs a pack of lies fraught with mistakes.
Trump‚Äôs son is doing remote learning at home &amp; NOT GOING TO HIS PRIVATE SCHOOL, because of fear of the Coronavirus.  BUT THE REST OF U PEASANTS carry on. Full reopening plans for our kids.
Ahhhh, the new kinder, gentler potentate  Trump Tells Barstool President Dave Portnoy He Regrets His Tweets 'Too Often'
Yeah it‚Äôs easy to level off when Texas stops testing.  Trump pulled out the federal testing centers and now they stop reporting how many daily testing they‚Äôre doing.  Probably around 200 a day for the state. Lol.  That‚Äôll make the numbers go down.
The republican party will lose Texas. For too many years they have enforced their biblical views into our laws and way of life. But Texas is becoming more diverse and accepting. When trump loses I hope and pray to my god that he takes the entire GOP with him good riddance
McConnell starting filling the court with unqualified GOP supporters months ago. Was that in preparation for the court cases that will erupt because of Trump's use of the DHS and his future claims of rigged elections? Has this been the plan all along? #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Yet everyone else commenting on here is blaming Trump, go figure.
Vote for Trump if you want a strong, working-class America. Vote for Biden if you want a pedophile as your President.
The distilled spirits industry should not be used as a bargaining chip in trade disputes over airline subsidies and steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Tell the Trump Administration &amp; USTR that we need‚ÄØ#ToastsNotTariffs. Take action NOW!
Pretty sure the aclu is not supporting trump.
You said not to debate Obama so I didn‚Äôt know what period you were using. When Biden voted against the embassy in Jerusalem?  Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the ACLU, tweeted, ‚ÄúWow  Already trying to out-Trump Trump.
who tf am I gonna vote for. sure as hell not voting for trump. and Biden is a no for sure. CAN WE HAVE A NORMAL ELECTION FOR ONCE
Yes it does, when in uniform. That's like saying you can go to your boss, yell at him, curse him out, and then say he can't fire you. Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences. The same would go had she been yelling pro Trump stuff instead. She will be punished.
I'm not a Trump supporter. I don't care if she was yelling pro Trump or anti Trump stuff, neither should be done in uniform. All of us that have and do serve, know this.
Change from trump back to the previous 8 years?  Was that great? Unemployment and gdp and wars and gridlock?  I‚Äôm not saying trump is great but I can‚Äôt buy the logic that Biden is change. He will not last 4 years so who is vp matters most.
So anything is better than trump?  My problem with that logic is decades of voting for the same party has given us Chicago and Portland and Seattle. How could Biden change what he helped build?
I would like to see that too, but with Trump you have to condemn his felonies one at a time because there are so many. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

Romney is not a republican. As much as trump may not be a republican Biden is clearly not so your logic makes no sense. I can‚Äôt get the republican I want so I‚Äôm going to vote socialist?  Please explain that benefit.
Trump is a necrophile, a lover of death, your death, not his. I am not saying that he is an actual necrophile.  I am saying that he is a lover of death and therefore I call him a necrophile.
You know Trump can do so much better to control the citizens then you ever can
What is a doable plan to get ourselves and other people to vote? Donald Trump will win if there is low voter turnout.
My daughter is the teacher in Portland Oregon and my grandchild is an elementary student. No school. No trump.
Basic lesson: even Italy is doing much better than the USA in the coronavirus response.     Millions of Americans support Trump only b/c they believe stupid #ConspiracyTheories   #Covid_19
I am so tired of this argument, that if they didn‚Äôt get their candidate then we deserve Trump.  Bottom line that is what they are saying.  They had their chance to convince America and cannot accept their own failure.
As long as a Republican stands in lockstep with Trump he not only is aiding and abetting, he is a co-conspirator.
And his party now stands with and for Trump.
Trump virus...funny. More like communist China fauci virus.
The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels before deporting them to their home countries.
Denise..please explain what Trump has "messed up"? Go on..I'll wait.
Anybody else noticing that since Trump took Fauci off TV Fauci keeps making worse and worse predictions? Now Fauci says this virus is the perfect storm and may worsen and never go away. Wow!  He is now omnipotent,  Progressive Democrat Virus God. FFS.  Destroy this gov bureaucrat
I believe the ongoing riots and insurrection happening in Portland&amp;Seattle will spread on purpose as the Progressives work overtime to get Trump to install martial law, call out real troops, not Fed agents&amp;then will scream "abuse of power".Civil War is coming.
Glad to see Leo Terrell finally supporting President Trump.
So it‚Äôs ok to for this jerk congressman to disrespect her.  Please go back to how she really framed this story.  Since Trump, his followers have become really nasty.  They need to treat others with respect.
god really said: ‚Äúfuck it 2020 the year to end the world and start over again since we have trump as president‚Äù
Trump isn‚Äôt rioting.  It‚Äôs nutty agitators and Portland Antifa.  Anarchists will ultimately fail.
So, you take money from George Soros and you call President Trump a fascist? Soros is dedicated to the destruction of the United States and has said so. You took money from him so you too are dedicated to the destruction of the USA. That‚Äôs treason! Beware!
Was it dangerous to the two dead black children's that didn't matter to the mayor in Seattle? The black father whose life matters won't be able to kisses boy good nightever again I remember the video of him crying on the air the mayor didn't call the father but Trump did
This declaration by Trump is potentially lethally dangerous to the mayor of Portland, Oregon. There is now credible legal justification for the mayor to do whatever it takes to protect himself.
I hope Trump said.... YOU'RE FIRED!

Same could be said and shown about children at a Trump rally.  The best solution is to leave children out of it.
You could certainly say that!  I am not sure what you mean by damage but I agree the people making laws and leading have done a terrible job.  My advice would be to vote them all out.  I think if Trump was not there it would be much worse.

Trump owns the White House and the Senate majority is GOP led by closet fascists. They were elected by their constituents and Trump with Putin's assistance.  Compromise is/should be the name of the game in US politics. Otherwise, we become a dictatorship just as Trump wants.

I took a look at this article. It's an op-ed article and stinks of bullshit and the GOP. I cannot imagine Obama and Biden cooked up anything like the madness described here. It does sound like something Trump and the current GOP would do, but for the benefit of the 1%. #VoteBlue

Trump desperate for police votes. Over stating Defund. When BLM requesting police reforms. Now Trump escalating to a new war with BLM. Incompetent desperate president.
Hes doing his job obviously the ones in control of the cities can't. Are you blind you dont see whats going on you all just hate trump so much you turn your heads on the problem an just  focusing on Trump
Damn! Trump got PUNK‚ÄôD! Badly!
I am baffled as to why Trump is so insistent on sending kids back to school. With 143,000+ dead, does he believe COVID-19 to be a hoax to unseat him? Is he in denial? Does he honestly think it will just go away with positive thinking? Madness. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020

Your statement re: Mr David, in Portland. Is a flat out lie. How far you have fallen for Trump.

Wow... Trump avoids making prejudicial remarks.  Reporters are like the Pharisees of old.  Using ‚Äògotcha‚Äô questions that make one look bad no matter how they answer.  Let the courts take care of Maxwell.  Be decent and quit playing political football.

This display of fake remorse is a political stunt meant to appeal to African Americans.  Instead of proposing new ideas to reform police brutality, Trump says he wants more violence as he sends in federal troops to beat up African American protesters.
Now Americans know where Trump got the saying. Catering to White supremacy
Last flu season 2 years ago 10000 dead in Texas  Covid-19 so far only 4,000 dead  I guess I wasn't a election for Trump that you're 2 years ago when nothing was shut down and nobody had to wear a mask and kids still went to school.       :) fear-mongering =  terrorism
I'm sure President Trump only regret is not going into protect the two children who are murdered in Seattle black lives that a black father will never be able to kiss goodnight again .. Along with these black but dead lives from Chicago
the only thing I would gratify where Trump is not going into Seattle earlier and protect the lives of two black children whose lives used to matter but no longer do and these Chicago lives..  .. and these lives in Chicago that used to matter
Past three years under Trump's regime brought these protest to a head. Corrupt attorney General, Trump and enabling GOP turning away to abuse of racial injustice. BLM.
She knows..... She knows what he did to young girls üë≠ Scaramucci claims Ghislaine Maxwell ‚Äòhas the goods‚Äô on Trump and he hinted ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt talk‚Äô when he wished her well
... not long after Trump comes in to protect the lives.. like the mayor should have done it earlier in Seattle  to protect lives of two black children,  their lives used to matter but no longer do because they're dead and their father can never kiss them goodnight ever again!
Who protected the lives of the two children in Seattle? Was it the mayor? If I were Trump I would regret not going in earlier with Federal Force and not retreat like you!
Seattle mayor is responsible for two black lives that used to matter Chicago mayor is responsible for many lives that used to matter   Trump steps in only when mayor's fail.
Unlike Democrat mayors Trump regrets not protecting the 2 black lives of children that used to matter that were murdered in Seattle... Vid of many lives that used to matter in Chicago
You have the right to" peaceably assemble".... Assemblies not so peaceful.. are unconstitutional  If Trump protected Seattle when the mayor would not two black children would be alive and their dad would still be able to love them. :( #mayorfail
Sadly Trump didn't get Federal forces to protect these lives that matter in Chicago earlier.
The mayor of Seattle did nothing as  Black lives needlessly died of murder..children.. black children.. Trump's action stepping in where the governor and Mayors won't will protect  black lives that  matter to mayor's in Seattle and Chicago
"mostly peaceful protesters"  You know nobody's buying that b******* anymore.. Trump just doing his job protect property life when the city state and government won't

In Trump's America, 4 million people are infected with a virus that the entire WORLD is trying to combat, and over 145,000 people have DIED. All because of the Supreme Orange's INCOMPETENCE.

Dear Patriot, these so called leaders are not negligent, but doing exactly what they are told by their leadership. They want to destroy our civilization, to build a communist state. That's why our kids are not schooled in history, geography, etc.., just to hate America, &amp; TrumpTrump only puts Trump first. No one else!
Trumps sends mixed messages about wearing a mask and social distancing.  Trump is to stupid to realize that wearing a mask and social distancing go hand and hand with opening the economy.

Trump had 4 years to make America "great" and look at the mess he made. We can't afford 4 more years.
So stand up for Trump that has rolled back over 89 environmental regulations that would guarantee clean water and air for generation to come. Trumps gave a tax cut to the 1%.
Trumps lied about Mexico paying for his wall,  and no denuclearzation of North Korea, no draining the swamp, in fact Trump has added over 290 exlobbiest or CEO's. That's a lots Gators. Trump stole from his charity and paid restitution for a scam university. Trumps a loser.
Trump had 4 years to make us "great" And he has failed miserably. World leaders laugh at him because of his Indeceiseness, the economy is in the toilet, there is social unrest and rampant unemployment, 30% of American go to bed hungry and Trump chose to ignore a pandemic.

I think people are grossly underestimating just how badly this two-party system has ruined the checks and balances system. Trump can do anything he wants because he vicariously controls the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
Under trumps administration we have massive unemployment, our economy is in the toilet and a pandemic that trump chose to ignore by not realizing that wearing a mask and social distancing go hand in hand with safely opening the Country. And you want 4 more years of trumps shit?ü§£
John Lewis a great and inspirational man was laid to rest today without Trump giving his respects because he held a grudge against him. What a petty little man you are.
when ppl have ‚Äúno clue‚Äù why people hate trump it‚Äôs bc they don‚Äôt think homophobia, sexism, transphobia, racism, and abuse are that big of a deal apparently
Like Trump that has caused chaos, are country is headed for a depression, the economy is crippled, almost 30% of the population can't pay their rent and unemployment is rampant, we have Social unrest and a pandemic that Trump chose to ignore. Save America, vote Democrat.
Social Distancing, and wearing a mask will go hand in hand with the economy opening. Trump is setting a bad example and fighting a losing battle.
Trump has already killed 150K Americans. He would kill more just to try and justify pushing back the election. NO NO NO!  He will NOT get to push back the election so he can kill more of us with his dereliction of duty and criminal negligence with his response to #COVID19.
Me too. I can't believe Republicans made much about him wearing a tan suit and now put up with all the shit Trump dishes out!
Who out there can‚Äôt tell that the Democrats are using everything under the sun to force mail in ballots so they can cheat and steal the election?  Trump draws 1000‚Äôs to his rallies. Biden drew 19 total to his video 24 minutes in to it.

Trumps Law and Order campaign seems lame since unemployment is rampant, the economy is down the toilet, we have a pandemic that Trump chooses to ignore and all amid social unrest. Save America, vote Democrat.
Don‚Äôt believe it. The man is a story teller to suit his narrative. He‚Äôd say he was drinking cow piss if it made trump happy.
is 1000x better than Trump. I have not voted for a Dem for Pres since '92, and I will be voting for Biden in 2020.
Evil Trump shit...
It is amazing how Trump has destroyed so much of the GOP's political playbook. They have ruined so much and have become so hypocritical, their go-to slogans have become absurd. Family values, deficits, global might, and more have been washed away and are now laughable.

No, Laura. There are idiots all over the place. For example, there's a horribly xenophobic woman on Fox "News" spewing racism and her love of Trump.
You are at X but want to get to Z. There's a bus to Z, but it starts &amp; stops and takes a few wrong turns along the way.   There's another bus, driven by Trump, that says it's going to Z but instead drives right off a cliff killing everyone on board.   Choose your ride carefully.
On Trump‚Äôs plans to remove US troops from Germany. Mark Hertling is a former Commanding General of US Army Europe.
And under Trump's administration we have a pandemic, social unrest, a crippled economy, rampant unemployment and we are no longer respected as a world leader. America can not afford 4 more years.
Isn't it obvious? Because aborted fetuses can be sold by George Soros on the black market so he can make money to send to all of us liberals so we don't have to work and can troll Trump all day. Duuuuhhh!

Is trump putting up all those fences and walls around (our) Whitehouse in anticipation of losing the election?
And 5-8% of those polled will never admit they are voting for Trump just like in 2016.
Trump inherited a strong economy that has been under a upswing since the great recession ended in 2010. Trump hasn't the qualifications to run a Democracy. Trump only cares about Trump.
Trump already did that.
I do that why I vote Democrat. I don't like the turmoil Trump has cause. Trump has filled the swamp with over 289 exlobbiest or CEO's. He has rolled back almost 90 environmental regulations that help the rich get richer and he lies about healthcare and drug prices. Just a few.
Wasn't. So that's why I hate seeing a AG drop charges on the presidents allies and fire his foes. I don't like Barr's unconstitutional campaign to reelect Trump.
Trump is president and the Country is his responsibility. His whinny tweets don't help the problem. Trump has taken his secrets all the way to the Supreme Court. Who does he owe and who owns him? And I still am crying.
Barr has turned the Justice Department into a law firm with one client: Donald Trump. The AG is suppose to work for Americans not just the Republican friends of the president.
Barr's illegal armed invasion of Portland, Seattle and other cities. Barr's clearing of Lafayette Square of peaceful protesters so trump could have a photo op. Some participants have apologized. Barr drops criminal charges against Trump allies and fires his foes. Just a few.
Why can‚Äôt he wear a jacket? It‚Äôs the dress code, yes?  BTW, starting out with the debunked ‚Äúspying‚Äù bullshit was really not a good strategy. Showing clips of Trump‚Äôs failure to lead was also a bad strategy. Jesus.
Barr has turned the Justice Department into a law firm with one client: Donald Trump. He discharges people on presidential orders, has taken trumps financials and Mueller report to the supreme Court to supress them from the public, what are they hiding?
Like Trump, I'm sure he will lie.
The problem the Democrats have with AG William Barr is he takes his orders from trump and not the American people.
Trump is full B.S.he has had almost 4 years to do something about the cost of drugs and he is just now do something about it. Just a reelection ploy, like his beautiful healthcare.

Why Trump Might Quit    We couldn't get that lucky.... it will be a long hard fought battle for the White House.
A Trump Putin puppet coward!!!
The governors were tasked with protecting their own states, and the mayors tasked with their cities. So, are you saying they were all inept? Only certain cities took it real hard. Mostly those busy trying to "resist" anything Trump says.
Or making fun of the man‚Äôs death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump‚Äôs lead, by attending a gathering that didn‚Äôt need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen the trump criticism that you speak of and I live in Texas.
I can‚Äôt say I blame him... I would totally take the Trump approach of ignoring it hoping it will go away
Barr is on the way to that. Give it time. He lied about taking orders from trump. He‚Äôs lied about Lafayette square. He fired prosecutors who were investigating trumps cronies. Roger stone. You haven‚Äôt got much of a leg to stand on here. Better quit before you get further behind.
Cornyn has fallen further in my book than almost any Texas politician during the Trump era.
Just tuned in to MSM And they are about to loose their minds that Trump will delay the Election ü§£ü§£
Yet he is trying his best to stop it!? Yeah makes perfect fucking sense. Considering Obama released pedophiles and trump is putting them in jail.
Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton attended John Lewis‚Äô funeral.  The absence of the Trump speaks volumes.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Maybe I‚Äôm slicing things too thin, but Calabresi‚Äôs subheadline says Trump should be removed ‚Äúunless he relents.‚Äù If Trump relents in his calls to delay the election, is Calabresi still planning to vote for him? Seems to be a little wiggle room here...
James drinks straight from Trump‚Äôs little toad!!
Hey idiot. Trump did not take a salary when he took office. He is a multimillionaire. Maybe billionaire. He can afford to pay things himself and he does.
This is what America is supposed to be about-what it has been for 244 years and will be no longer if Trump is re-elected.
Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY ‚ÄúTrump supporters‚Äù refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN‚ÄôT wearing masks because Europe‚ù§Ô∏èTrump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb
Thank the lord for President Trump hearing the assertion of the Gillian case too it was more than a sexual assault it was a stalking&amp; brutal attack against that soldier with more than one person involved w/ it    will amnesty be granted
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Mitt Romney says "you can't tamper with paper." Counterfeit $20 bill says "hold my beer..."
Anyone campaigning and voting for Trump is the enemy of America.
The National Baketball Association has the words Black Lives Matter written in enormous letters on their court, and trump still thinks his message is winning? Someone told him to stop, but it‚Äôs too late, we know who he is. #TrumpIsLosing

Party agnostic, I‚Äôve always been a sucker when former Presidents are together at historic events  Sadly, I don‚Äôt see that happening for years as I don‚Äôt see Trump performing ceremonial duties of former Presidents
This is about the nominee for the defense department they pulled today.  This Senator already gave a statement that he had a conversation with a Trump last night recommending Trump withdrawal him nomination.
The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.
You like your treason fresh huh?  Trump will go down for the fasciae he is.

Sad that this man will not get any type of recognition simply because he‚Äôs a Trump supporter. At what point does the left stop picking and choosing?? Haven‚Äôt heard about him on CNN...
Trump is not a doctor, neither are you. Trump stands to benefit financially by selling this snake oil.

#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump often displays ignorance, but this tweet is actually a symptom of his brain decline, cognitive impairment, &amp; frank mental illness. He is out of touch with reality &amp; is incompetent.

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people‚Äôs lives?
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.

You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.

Important. Congress and SCOTUS must stand up to this kind of behavior.
Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he‚Äôs been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.

Wonder if Trump knows what a hanging chad is.
(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.

(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He‚Äôs no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump‚Äôs
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!‚≠êÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚≠êÔ∏è

I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn‚Äôt exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don‚Äôt buy that he‚Äôd have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump‚Äôs rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I‚Äôm not convinced Trump‚Äôs team can thwart it.

Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump‚Äôs term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You‚Äôre all talk with no action.  Why hasn‚Äôt anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn‚Äôt like trump when McCain was alive but since then you‚Äôre playing good guy to trump. It‚Äôs obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.

Bullshit Stop getting off the subject. You posted about what Trump supposedly did. I corrected you now you wanna talk about Obama. Every word you typed is an opinion.

During a one-on-one Wednesday from the oil fields of West Texas, President Trump discussed jobs in the oil and gas industries, coronavirus, a vaccine, and stimulus checks.
I think you‚Äôre assuming I‚Äôm voting for trump, I could very easily just stay home. I wouldn‚Äôt say at all you‚Äôre stupid just cause you don‚Äôt think exactly like me, I‚Äôm not wired like that.
Trump will challenge the election results and challege it in the courts,  allowing him to remain in office.  He said as much today when he  said "if done right" the results will be held up in court for years. That is where Barr helps him mount the challenge.  Be Aware!!!
Trump must have a lot of inner peace.
Trump today stated that mail in ballots will cause "if it's done right" years of legal challenge.  He just gave away what he will do, with Barr's help, challenge the election results and delay the swearing in of a new president.  Watch Rachel's space.
Today, I held an important conversation with my colleagues from the Women‚Äôs Working Group on Immigration about Trump‚Äôs attacks on migrant children.  We remain committed in our fight for children who, despite the pandemic, are expelled, detained and separated from their families.
I'm not trying to defend Trump, if I had to bet, I'd say he definitely has done some creep stuff with women. What I dislike, is this mindset that I hate the orange man so much that I'm gonna ignore that the other guy definitely seems like a creep as well. A little objectivity.
Trump would have beat his ass.
President  said #VanessaGuillen's death was a ‚Äúterrible story‚Äù and that he would help with funeral expenses.
Trump will not show up to Herman Cain‚Äôs funeral because he doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass about anyone!
There is a reason nobody asks Trump to speak at funerals. for one he has the vocabulary of a dim five year old and he will spend most of it saying how great he is
Today Trump said "if done right, it (the election) will be held up in court for years to come". Trump just told us what he will do, with Barr to help. BOLO!!!
Wonder what Trump thinks of the NBA right now üòÇüòÇüòÇ

US politics since 2017 has just been a series of Trump saying he was going to do something he can‚Äôt legally do, the Democrats saying it‚Äôs illegal, him doing it anyway, and 48 hours later the Democrats saying that presidents have always done it and to vote if you don‚Äôt like it.

These individuals who voted for Trump and will vote for him again in 2020 are ignorant and an embarrassment to this country. The only way Trump will win again is by cheating just as he did in 2016.

My take: Brennan was involved in having the dossier used in the election, but after, the CIA didn't want it used. The FBI (Comey/McCabe) was adamant to use it to hurt Trump as President.

Media will take the bait, and Trump knows this. It distracts from the GDP numbers and COVID deaths  Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not calculating a way to weaponize the FEC
Trying to summarize for my students why Trump can‚Äôt do this himself but knowing in my mind that he‚Äôll somehow find a way to get the FEC to delay the election results and now I feel like drinking heavily and it‚Äôs only 9:35 AM
We knew this was coming. We knew Trump would invalidate the results to stay in power. But what now in the midst of a global pandemic?
If you hate those who love Trump, why are you trolling President Trump's tweets?  I despise trolls.  I love my President and pray for him daily. So, go ahead and block me!
At what point is it fair to say that being a senator is not a lifetime position. It is evident in her mannerisms that she trembles and shakes. She may not have the stamina for the job, she certainly has demonstrated that she won‚Äôt stand up to Trump. It is time for someone new.
Donald Trump is the worst of both spectrums; he is a leftis populist and a rightist authoritarian, a danger to the republic.

I think it‚Äôs the other way around lol but we shall see.. voting restrictions still a major advantage the right has but I think there‚Äôs a lot of republicans who are realizing we cannot have 4 more yrs of trump and will vote dem this one time purely in the best interest of America
No Thanks ..We have had enough of Trump ... so fuck No !
And yes I believe Trump made a mistake, but not in banning travel from china, but instead, on not banning flights from every part of that continent, and yes i do believe that ‚Äúinfected china‚Äù sounds racist, but hey that‚Äôs why y‚Äôall voted for him exactly, his ‚Äúracism‚Äù made every
Trump seems to think that America is a country of one, (himself); instead of a country of many. We are a nation of immigrants and united we make it strong. Not divided like Trump has made it into. We need a change in the wind.
Another Trump failed project! Where is the money?
Living in this covid hot spot and dealing with the damage hurricane Hanna is causing to my home. Plus it‚Äôs still raining hard and several levies already broke, and to top it off, Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt resigned. This really sucks. ‚ÄúI WILL REBUILD.‚Äù
Metaphor for what trump's done to America #HurricaneHanna
So they are with hold our own money to force us back to work , take a hard look at south Texas we were doing well untill our governor took trumps advice the whole area is now infected , flooded &amp; hurricane battered &amp; trump is golfing yet again.

wrong actually, not voting is like not voting. a vote for joe biden is a vote for joe biden. a vote for trump is a vote for trump. either way you vote in Nov. you'll be voting for the advancement of white supremacy.
trump represents: police brutality, racism, hate, bigotry, divisiveness, ignorance, selfishness, greed and much more... any show of decency, love, respect, unity, compassion, equality, intelligence.. etc is a giant fuck you to trump.
Fool. Trump did everything he could to slow the spread. He stopped all travel to/from China first, then Europe. As for preparedness for a disaster such as COVID-19, that‚Äôs a STATE issue. Lo and behold most liberal states didn‚Äôt have a clue. Cuomo murdered thousands of old folks.
the year is 2031. coronavirus has successfully killed off 67% of the american population. trump has established dictatorship thru militarized means despite attempts to remove him from power. mando's bio reads: I'm 16 years into the 21 club. I dont 420. But, i do enjoy a drink fro

Like I said before, Trump wants violence so he can come in as the savior of law and order. The agents don‚Äôt want the media to record the abuses because it would show them abusing their authority.
It's crap like this that make Trump question where the money goes and everybody gets angry at him for asking questions. Why can't he just leave everything the way it's always been.
El mentiroso and his goons are at it hardcore
Trump is acting exactly like an abusive spouse.
Trump is president Boris , what a stupid statement from a clearly impaired individual.
Trump is testing the ground with the federal agents. That‚Äôs how he operates. If things go his way, then he takes it as a good sign and moves on to do the same in other cities. He wants to create chaos and then come out as the savior of law and order to get re-elected. Just watch
The trump administration is a prime example of group think. Trump is so out of touch with Americans and the coronavirus crisis.

Trump Supporters: if you simply followed rules, you will have no problems with the police!  Also Trump Supporters: They‚Äôre infringing on our rights by asking us to wear masks!!!   Maybe if you followed rules, everyone will be safe?. Trump wasn't joking, did you read the tweet? One of his better written tweets - he likely had help. It was definitely not a joke When Pompeo was questioned about it - he didn't say it was a joke - he said Barr would decide if the election would be delayed -  Ominous
After listening to Joy Reid w/ Mary Trump interview it appears Putin is like a father figure or replacement of Fred. Trump thinks highly of him. The man is mental! How many times has he talked to Putin? 16x's? Getting advice from our enemy! Great!üßêüò∑
To be fair tRump was pretty well set up to do what he has and is going to do. Our Congress just puts on a show and the Senate is worthless. All they care about is Power. It is past time for term limits in both houses and the Supreme Court.
Where has this guy been the last four years?? everything Trump has done while in office has been unconstitutional and without precedent.
The Nasty people are a larger group than we ever imagined. Life is hard now but it is going to get so much worse. People might vote for tRump just to stop their personal pain.
I'm so sorry that you felt fear. Fear sucks. I've been through Hurricanes but never an Earthquake. I would probably freak the F$ck out. I think tRump is freaking out the non-koolaid drinking population so much that they have nothing left for natural fear. Your fear is validated.
So Don Winslow did you send the same message to Pelosi and DeBlasio who downplayed the Wuhan when Trump ended flights to China and told people to party and go to movies and gather in large groups in Chinatown?Or are you just a hateful racist Progressive bigot who hates blacks?

Good to see someone in the Trump administration is listening to me.  Cut all advertising to the MSM.  Defund the MSM.
Trump probably wants to go back to private life where he can avoid the press constantly criticizing him. To best be surrounded again by folk telling him he's "The Best. Ever."
I loathe tRump with the intensity of a thousand suns -  tRump has earned it --
uh, moms don't want their children to be in danger. sending the kids back to school now is a decision trump is making that puts them in danger. I choose Biden and common sense.
Matt has few goals, none of which aimed at addressing the needs of his district. He is focused on impressing trump and melania (who once, he says, called him handsome), and constructing a career in the right-wing media. he needs to go and get off MY dime.
No. He was a grown man that should have known better but he chose Party over Country. Trump is still a mass murderer.

Heyyyy, Why doesn't he just ask Dr Immanuel (I use the term Dr loosely). Maybe she can summon some of her horny nocturnal demons. The ones that cause cysts, etc. I heard Trump repeatedly praise her yesterday.
I‚Äôm not surprised Trump is tweeting about delaying the election.  I‚Äôm also not going to get mad about it.  He‚Äôs just trying to stoke fear and anger.  It‚Äôs what he he does best.  Nothing is going to delay his downfall.

No sir.."Both" candidates aren't..Only one. Trump. Nice try to spin this but, since you can't "legally" defend Trump's position, you cast Biden into this..That is ridiculous

Don't go -  tRump is just doing this to interrupt Rep. John Lewis' Memorial.  Don't go.
Trump needs to go after their FCC licenses.  They are arms of the Democrat Party and not operating in the public interest.

Why do you think Trump is promoting a quack whose website claims that horny, nocturnal demons cause a myriad of health problems?
The war against hydroxychloroquine continues.  A life saving drug is deliberately shelved to spite Donald J. Trump.  How many have to die to promote hateful racist Progressive bigotry.
Well maybe Trump's quack can hook you up. She claims to be an expert on horny, nocturnal demons. Trump was praising her again this morning.

I did!! And thanks back at you
spends millions of dollars on Federal "Agents of domination" to quell $50K of damage to #FederalGovernment building. #Trump brags "Nobody knows more about money than me". I guess that math question wasn't on the #CognitiveTest .
Will Trump still be praising the doctor that  thinks cysts are caused by nocturnal, horny demons?
I‚Äôm never going to forgive her for voting to acquit Trump in the impeachment.
You inserted yourself in my reply about cowboys which had nothing to do with Trump or MAGA. STFU clown!
This is the voice Trump thinks is important
Trump knows he would have been attacked by liberals anyway! He did the right thing! Lewis fought against Trump from day one!

No the science does not.  What study can you point to?  The one where is was given to older dieing patients?    The one where it was administered w/o zinc?  It's the cure. Trump hate does not equal science.
Trump will not mandate a vaccine.  Contrary to liberals beliefs,  he has never "ruled as a dictator".  Biden on the other hand...

Trump‚Äôs interview with Axios..Sound like Bill Barr
He committed perjury but also he seems to be involved in tRump's  re-election he said re-election business is discussed in Cabinet meetings that seems wrong for an AG What about Barr's travel &amp; speeches could they be considered a part of the re-election effort Where is the line?
Thank you President Trump. May God Bless your day! üá∫üá∏üôå‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
Not enough...There is a time to say "troubling"..This isn't that time..Trump need to be called out
We aren't silent..In fact, the Pentagon told Trump we aren't doing this and that's why DHS is
We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party‚Äôs Soul Long Ago
What kind of #distorted mind begins to accept a moron that peddles this shit? Stop running interference for Trump and think for yourself.
I was only half kidding.  IDK what the GOP will look like in 4 years.  Maybe the Trumpism is exorcised after he gets his ass thoroughly trounced in Nov or maybe he and his family remain defacto Godfathers able to anoint a successor (or for that matter Trump runs again in 2024)
China and Russia both are chopping at the bits..Trump is blaming only China to deflect from Russia..
‚ÄúI am a big therapeutic person.‚Äù  ‚Äî #POTUS #Trump July 29, 2020
Trump should have NEVER had the edge in the beginning..Trump doesn't know how to run his business let alone the country..Remember, Biden helped personally to save jobs after the economy collapsed.
Here is a #Trump campaign leader making an absolutely insane and untrue claim. This is some next-level gaslighting as she claims the #AlienDNA doctor is ‚Äúthe only medical professional and actual doctor with experience treating COVID‚Äî19 willing to speak up...‚Äù WHAT? üò≥
Trump probably thinks alien DNA is blood from small Mexican children and he already has a supply on hand.
We‚Äôre you this fired up about the last flu season where thousands more were infected and died??!  Oh no because it had nothing to do with Trump!!!
Just when you think Trump can't possibly get any stupider.
Trump Failed The Entire Country #COVID19Response #WorstPresidentEver #TrumpVirus  "prior administrations not only knew there‚Äôd be a pandemic, they planned for it ‚Äì extensively."  Ex-officials say Trump administration didn't use pandemic 'playbooks'
Paying for a high position that is supposed to be for the people is shady as hell. He has proven that he is not for the people unless they are his people. He is protecting tRump to protect himself. They are both the Nasty Man from a Steven King Novel.I could EASILY counter ALL of these LEFTIST BIAS SOURCES with RIGHT BIAS SOURCES.  Your attempt at being clever has failed you. =) (even the so called fact checkers are leftist trolls that hate Trump! TDS is real!  lol)
Trump says coronavirus stimulus checks, direct payments may be more than $1,200  Yes more by 500.00 if you qualify. That‚Äôs all folks as Porky Pig would say it.
Stop lying, you're not going anywhere, for the next four years you're going to live exactly like you have. You will without a doubt continue to live under a Trump presidency #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Sorry he beat the cancer in 2006, so he had been in remission for 14 years. What does his cancer that he beat 14 years ago have to do with his death via the death-pack at the trump Tulsa rally?
Was B. Hussein O. a longshot? Trump is up on him at the same point.  Thursday, July 30, 2020  The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 48% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump‚Äôs job performance.
Not THIS American.  #IWillNotComply
What does colon cancer thar Cain beat in 2013 have to do with him getting coronavirus at Trump's Tulsa death rally that eventually killed him in 2020?
Sorry had to mute my TV MR.TRUMP is having his daily rant on TV. He going to tell us how well he reads and how he doesn't tell Russia to stop putting bounties on our military because they wouldn't do it because Vladimir Putin said so and why would he and anyway OBAMA did it. MUTE
Nope, not hardly.  Sounds like Trump is playing the "left" on this one.  They want mass voter fraud to occur by mail in votes, and the right is having NONE of that.  So if its mail only because of Covid, then lets wait until Covid is out of here.  Like on Nov 4 lol
My grandson is 16 and has Dylexia and got great help and is in 10th grade at top of his class.His MAMA my daughter also worked with him. Unfortunately Mr.TRUMP got no Motherly or Fatherly love. That stunted all kinds of learnings and feelings in Mr.TRUMP.
Actually Mr.TRUMP prefers Bugs Bunny comic books.
So we don't have to worry Mr.TRUMP can not cancel  on January 3 2021 there will be people elected and in office. This is not The Twilight Zone. Congress sets election dates not the PRESIDENT..
TRUMP TWEETS:
Anyway the answer is moot. MR.TRUMP can not delay the elections.The Congress sets the date. And you in your mind that there's no way in Hades that the Congress will be completely dissolved in January.
Imagine dying, for Donald Trump....
My TWITTER FRIENDS AND NOT SO GREAT FRIENDS. MR.TRUMP SAID THE ELECTION SHOULD BE DELAYED? IGNORE THAT TWEET OF IGNORANCE! JUST IGNORE IT. NO PRESIDENT CAN CANCEL AN ELECTION.THE CONGRESS DECIDES THE DATE OF ELECTIONS.EVIDENTLY MR.TRUMP DOESNT KNOW THAT. SEND HIM CONSTITUTION

Well now we know the truth:  hasn't done squat on #ObamaGate #SpyGate because along with his buddy #JuanMcCong, he was IN ON IT:
You trump supporters always ask for proof and when presented proof you dismiss it. But will literally believe every single word that comes out of trumps mouth like he‚Äôs the only president who never lied about anything.
He doesn‚Äôt care Americans are dying. He wants people at the polls instead of doing mail in voting. I don‚Äôt understand how Mail in can worsen Corona when more people will be mailing in their vote. Trump doesn‚Äôt want mail in cause he knows his going to loose

Funny how the left (who STILL can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt accept the outcome of the 2016 election) are now parading to people that trump won‚Äôt be able to handle the out come of this election üòÇ hypocrisy, and that‚Äôs the reason he‚Äôll more than likely win.

#UPDATE The United States will slash its military presence in Germany by 11,900 troops, relocating some to Italy and Belgium in a shift of Washington's NATO assets, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced Wednesday.The real  reason is,Trump thinks Angela Merkel does not like him.
Intelligence that Russia was paying the Taliban to kill U.S. troops 'WAS in Donald Trump's daily brief,' official claims - as White House insist spies don't agree on whether it's true.
More people like  need to interview Trump lol
Never underestimate the gullibility of the Trump Cult.
Trump supporters think that Trump really put the interviewer in his place lol
There's fools born every day and night. TRUMP tweets a nut case who believes drug companies use alien blood to make drugs. Plus many other CRAZY ideas. And the crazy part TRUMPO CULTISTS will buy every word and tweet. It would be funny if not so dangerous.
Trump gonna have to Pardon AG Barr. He just Murdered it. He slayed em all
Investigations take time. This was back in May &amp; caused 500M in damage.  All started by one Trump supporter pretending to be a leftist. Look up the definition of false flag. You‚Äôre going to see lots more of it from the far right. It‚Äôs a pattern.

I'm from Texas, but please win. We need you. Trump needs you. California needs you desperately
To hear you talk about the rule of law ,is to laugh.The rule of law is what Trump says it is and has nothing to do with the true rule of the law.
It‚Äôs funny you post stuff like this, knowing that there was collusion with trump and Russia during the 2016 elections (it was proven)
This mess falls on Trump, but it wouldn't have to be this bad if Texas had a leader who stood firm for the well being of Texans instead of his own political and financial gain. Abbott and Trump have killed Texas  Join  and vote for Biden in November
You do realize America is LITERALLY built on protests and riots? Ever since right before the Declaration of Independence. If anything the protestors in Portland are infinitely more American than you. The only person trying to ‚Äúdemolish the American way of life‚Äù is Trump. Wake up
Or, a theory that makes more sense, Trump is the fake media. Because the sheer number of people it would take to stay quiet about it if ALL of America‚Äôs news media was fake would probably be around a million or so and would probably be found out within 1 and a half years

Hunny they are leading in all polls. Democrats are losing no one.Think the TRUMP PARTY is losing B I G.
The young people are ignorant. If you had a clue as to how corrupt the Democrats and NeoCons are you would know why they hate Trump. We have been a guided democracy for decades. It isn't supposed to be possible to elect a president only a puppet.
The same person who doesn't care about rape of young men is again lying in CONGRESS and ignoring your god Mr.TRUMP raping AMERICA.
Out of fear and hate you allowed a orange painted money hungry man to destroy your party and AMERICANS RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER RESPECTED BECAUSE OF COURSE IF MR.TRUMP BUT MAINLY BECAUSE OF YOU HIS ENABLERS. FEARFULL LITTLE TURTLES HIDING YOUR HEAD INSIDE SHELL.

Goddamn, Republicans are so far down the Trump hole.
Hahahahaha. Good one. ü§£  "Voters?"  They were Democrats and even they weren't buying his socialist nonsense. They weren't "scared of Trump winning" in 2016. They STILL rejected him for Hillary. ü§£  Gotta hand it to Bernie tho. He made out like a capitalist personally.
Oh yeah I‚Äôm sure trump was so stoked to take a cognitive test that he couldn‚Äôt even answer what would you get if you started from 100 and counted back by 7
At least he‚Äôs more mentally stable. Trump can‚Äôt even answer a simple question without changing the subject
At least he's there. Trump wasn't.

I actually an a Senior Citzen Veteran Grandma. Christian who blocked my former pastor who on Facebook posts so many posts praising TRUMP &amp; putting down Democrats. He knows the Bible but still supports a little evil man like TRUMP .So I blocked someone I otherwise respected.
Trump when posting this tweet:
the people in these communities want this.  And Trump has every right to protect federal buildings.   thats in his jurisdiction
He thought that Lewis was ‚Äú lying‚Äù in state and Trump didn‚Äôt want any competition.
Vote for him and hold him accountable, challenge him, and push him as far left as possible. That's what most progressives plan to do. Ceasefire to get trump out of office, as soon as the election is over, fight for what you believe in.
What Trump has done makes Nixon look like a saint.  He has made a mockery of the GOP.  It is a shame that it one person to ruin the Reputation of the Republican Party.  One idiot, liar, thief and just all around Evil person.
Trump is visiting Morrisville in NC today and he may not catch the fade but I hope he catches that COVID
As far as I know Trump has not gone to any one of these riots and has been seen shooting anyone, but this is all his fault? #FakeNews #MAGA
No one could be as disgusting and lies more than Trump!!!!!  He doesn‚Äôt care about this country he only cares about himself.
Trump has done nothing to stop it.
Please use smaller words so Trump can better understand, such as person, woman, man, camera, TV.

Joe Biden is not going to DEFUND the police. Donnie TRUMP is just lying again.
Biden describes lower classes as entitled and regularly attacks welfare as entitlement. His view points haven‚Äôt ever changed, his actions reflect that. Trump on the other hand has a mouth, but his actions show character that Biden just doesn‚Äôt have.
Well said. The Trump cult is quite the mind controlled.
Honestly, Trump--examples include the wollman park ice rink, his executivevorder to strengthen families, his executive order to lower medication prices, his hong kong order which focuses on civil liberties that are much needed.
Shout a lot at Mr.Trump and buddies on TV. BUT WILL NEVER EVER GIVE UP!! AS ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS "THATS WHAT GIRLS DO" "WE PERSIST FOREVER"

Donald Trump's facebook ads are so targeted towards 60+ year old rural area conspiracy theorists. I know that shit works too
Which is insane. The #1 argument for Trump is that he's "not a politician" so a woman of color who worked her ass off to get where she is, is vilified and derided, while the orange asshole can kill 140,000+ Americans and it's no biggie

There was no need for this.  It is an embarrassment and criminal.  We have the right to protest!!!! They I‚Äôm sure Trump‚Äôs and the idiot in charge need to be held accountable for there communist like tactics.
A word about Trump's "test" results. üôÉ
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I fucking hate trump and want him out of the office
Everybody keeps trying to say Trump is the most racist or most dangerous president ever. That isn‚Äôt true. He IS however the most stupid president by a large margin. GWB and dementia era-Reagan being 2 and 3.
Those that hate the Jews call Trump a racist. They are all hypocrites, and this is just one example of many.
The anti-semities call Trump racist. Really?
It's currently Donald Trump's America
Oh trump dealing with social justice and throwing the COVID-19 Updates to distract EVERYBODY but putin.
Supports Trump? Hell no. Don't love him. He doesn't have me or my family in mind and won't keep us safe. Texas is fucked.
DEFUND THE POLICE AND LOCK TRUMP AND BARR UP!
I can't hear the fans chant 'WHAT' thanks to Trump #TrumpVirus
Why people blame trump for the virus? This was given to the state leaders which that represent YOU to see fit that the virus is under control. This administration is not a dictatorship. Stop being an idiot, please.
SORRY didn't realize Donnie TRUMP had friends only those he considers beholden to him.

As a TEXAN I find it shameful to hear you who is supposed to be serving Texans &amp; keeping us safe say not to believe the MEDICAL EXPERTS such as DR.FAUCI but believe your TRUMP cherry picked doctors 2. However thousands disagree with your cherry picked 2 doctors. GOP DEATH CULT

Wednesday, July 22, 2020 The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 49% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump‚Äôs job performance.
I'm not a government scholar but have studied how government is supposed to be run. However in the dictatorship we have not sure what the Democrats can do to rid the country of TRUMP and his REPUBLICAN ENABLERS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AND EVEN THEN HES NOT GONE TILL END JANUARY.
There's been other racist presidents but none as blatant and touted like trump
LOVE LOVE LOVE HOW YOUR GOD DONALD TRUMP HAS TUTORED REPUBLICANS IN THE ART OF LIES. YOU PASSED YOUR COURSE 101 LYING TO AMERICANS. YOU ALSO PASSED COURSE 102 ACTING UNCONSTITUTIONLY ! BET YOUR MAMA AND DADDY AND GRANDPARENTS ARE  PROUD! BET RONALD REAGAN AND BUSHES ARE PROUD.
Pay attention  You thought you might be different than literally every other person who acquiesced to what your Emperor Trump demanded of you. You'll be joining the many others under that bus.   We're coming for you.
YOU were actually elected president with 3000000 more votes than Donnie TRUMP . You have a mandate he doesn't. YOU ARE STILL LEADING OUT OF OFFICE .TRUMP A FAKE PRESIDENT IS DOING NO LEADING. THANK YOU AND BILL CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN FOR LEADING

This would be funny if not so serious and worrying about who will be PRESIDENT for the next 4 year's.
Trump said he wishes Ghislaine well
The republicans were doing the same thing to prevent Obama from doing things. How was he able to handle H1N1 and trump still hasn‚Äôt handled COVID??? If Obama was able to handle a pandemic with the opposing side not helping trump has no excuse either lol. #CORNY
5.. Your party no longer are the Christian JESUS Loving Party but the party shaking in their boots BOWING DOWN TO AN MORALLY EMPTY FAKE PRESIDENT OUT OF YOUR OWN IMMORALITY OR ABJECT FEAR OF A DICTATOR WANT TO BE DONALD TRUMP. F.D.R. SAID "YOU ONLY HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF"
How bout telling us why our troops were getting targeted by Russia and trump did nothing about it?
I pray he finds a much better teaching position. This is unconstitutional. Trump is our President. That is not a false statement.
Blame trump this is his fault if it weren‚Äôt for his overly inflated ego and incompetence it wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this bad. There were many people in his administration that told him several times he needs to take this more seriously but to him it was a democratic hoaxAt least Obama showed up. Where was Trump!

150,000 Americans have died because Trump lied. #TrumpVirus
I can't help wondering what people will say at trump's funeral.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
He just hands #Trump the election with these mental breakdowns over and over again...üá∫üá∏
And the reason why the Texas government is not shutting down because our governor is kissing Trump's ass and trying to stay open for the economy. Most republican states.  Its pretty ridicules.
"no, no, no, i wasn't paid to vote to not impeach trump or to confirm kavanaugh! i made those choices all on my own :)" that's  not better
Trump did this.
Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and start using those executive orders!Trump 2020!!
Thanks,I am so scared that we can‚Äôt mobilize our voters as we did in 2016. So many even here, don‚Äôt realize that Trump didn‚Äôt create the shutdowns. I lost all hope during OBAMA admin of this country not going socialist. Trump gave me back HOPE .W/ Biden there is no HOPE for USA
This crazy witch wants to get us invaded and ruled by a communist/hostile country.She is nuts but the Bernie bats and Bidenites eat this up with a spoon. It will be the end of our great country. I have never seen a more dangerous situation in my lifetime.We have to re-elect Trump
Trump did this with rejecting black tenants in his apartments citing lack of respect and tendencies towards crime they brought. Now he‚Äôs using classism again to protect the white soccer moms from the poor single mom just looking for a home to house her kids.
That guy is an asshat and most in Texas know it. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs the rep for a deeply religious section of Texas. Ever want to be creeped out?? Take a road trip thru his area. Even the churches have trump signs up.

The riots in our Dem controlled cities see  themselves as the beginning of an Arab spring.They want chaos, they want fear, they want Trump supporters to fear to get out of the houses! They want Trump gone and the rule of law suspended. They want Kamala Harris &amp;Biden to control us
What we saw democrats do to AG Barr is the opening salvo of what Kamala Harris threatens . We have to get out the vote and re-elect the President or we will find ourselves in concentration/re education camps. This is going to get a lot worse as they want to scare Trump voters!!

That‚Äôs absolutely shocking.... Said no one ever about Trump. But of course it‚Äôll be labeled a hoax perpetrated by the violent anarchist left. Insert massive eye roll.
Just another Trump lie. Not surprising.
How is business related success in par with the average black American? While I agree anyone can become successful in America, I also understand there is still alot of prejudice. Yes Obama was president, he got shat on by Trump saying he not American. Playing on his skin....

So the Dems will let us or our relatives die because of a Drug Trump says is good. That alone should be a reason to re-elect the President. They don‚Äôt care if we suffer or die. Trump could cure cancer and they would block the cure because they hate him so badly. #retirePelosinow
What does it say about a political party that keeps a drug away from the public that would stop a lot of suffering because The President took it and recommended it? The Dems are trying everything to keep the public from getting it. They want anyone who agrees with Trump to suffer

Mrs.Trump please tell the President to look into Dr. Stella Immanuel she will save US all from these lies the Media keeps vomiting about Covid 19.

Obama  had plans to get rid of Trump blow in his face now.

Called Pelosi‚Äôs office and asked politely to speak to her majesty and of course she was not available. I then politely lodged my complaint ref Pelosi calling virus ‚ÄúTrump virus‚Äù and was promptly hung up on.
It won‚Äôt be long when Trump catches the virus, and then we can tell him it‚Äôs only a Hoax. Drink some bleach and you‚Äôll be better.
Trump forgets that the 2 cases that were proven in voter fraud, was done by the Republicans. Yes it‚Äôs fixed, by corrupt Republicans.
We love ‚ù§Ô∏è our Trump!

Remember all of you call Pelosi‚Äôs Washington DC office tomorrow and tell her that we don‚Äôt appreciate her calling Covid 19 the ‚ÄúTrump Virus‚Äù That is unacceptable. We all need to call all day long and show her how pissed we are.

Yes. Even if I had a mail in ballot I‚Äôd stand in line. Trump would find some reason to invalidate mail in. I will stand in the blazing S. TX sun for a week to be at the front of the line.

Prominent Black Trump Supporter Murdered in Milwaukee

Leave it to Trump supporters to make America disgusting
Trump‚Äôs deployment of federal agents in cities has everything to do with his reelection
Trump doesn‚Äôt lie
We are with you President Trump. You were dealt a hand in 2016 with marked cards &amp;still won the pot! They have been dealing from the bottom of the deck ever since. It‚Äôs time to stop this insanity.Once you R re elected please go after the criminals in DC and the ones on the street
She was alway presidential. I can see her running against Ivanka Trump in 2028.
To blame a federal agent for the shooting.They believe that even though it won‚Äôt happen they will act like it did similar to their operations in Ferguson. They know the media will blame Trump and that‚Äôs the objective. Trump has them so scared because he doesn‚Äôt scare or back off!
When these thugs invade your home I suggest you have a shotgun loaded with #4 buckshot to defend yourself. I haven‚Äôt seen a human that can take  a load like that&amp; keep coming.This in case Biden wins because we don‚Äôt get the vote out for Trump. Immediately reload and negate threat
Criminals like Lori Lightfoot, AOC, Wheeler, Pelosi &amp; all these Dem Governors and Mayors need to be taken to task by the citizens in their jurisdictions.come November this violence and crazy cancel crap statue busting will get 100 times worse if we don‚Äôt re-elect President Trump!
All because something something comicsgate and Trump. Yet won't call out Antifa or BLM. Whata fucking joke
This is what we have in store if we lose President Trump!! Biden will absorb Antifa into the FBI  AOC AS THE HEAD OF THE EPA. Imagine the mayor of Seattle as Secretary of State. Whomever is VP will replace him as unfit. Imagine Lightfoot as VP then POTUS. Next concentration camps
Show this to all who have lost their jobs and businesses / livelihood due to the Governors keeping their states shut down to try and Blame Trump. The states did this not the Trump administration !!
For anyone who thinks that all this violence is something that just happens in big cities. Antifa leaders and even Kamala Harris has said they are coming after all of The Trump supporters and anyone who opposes them. Antifa is their attack arm with BLM. They are coming after us.
oh how i love people roasting trump

Obama is just trying to get ink. He is covertly being a Muslim trying to stir sh!t. It s a crying shame that the USSS does such an excellent job is all I have to say except this. He and that idiot Biden is why we elected Trump!!!!
This November we have to get the vote out! These Asshole are trying to scare people to not vote. They are going to do more. Soros is old/ill and wants USA destroyed before he dies. He has said this publicly many times. This is what this offensive is about.Soros can‚Äôt buy Trump!!!
We sane Americans outnumber these SORONAUTS/Antifa/BLM PROB 100k/200k to one of these idiots.I feel sorry for the residents who are being terrorized by these Marxist.These residents can stop this by voting for Donald Trump in Nov. Biden gets in Antifa has said they are empowered
These left Dem mayors and Governors appear to all want this chaos which is funded by Soros. This seems to be an offensive to try and scare Voters away because Dems are frightened of 4more years of Trump and the truth coming out. If Biden is elected lol the DOJ investigations stop
3-4,000 illegal children went missing under Trump's administration. And since he's associated with Epstein, I wouldn't put it past the fucker if he's doing pedo &amp; organ trafficking. Its a theory yes but bottom line we need proper immigration reform.
Has anyone on here ever had a call polling asking whether you are going to vote for Trump or Biden??? I am an old guy and have had the same number for 25 years and in all that time I have never been called by a pollster, has any of you??? Please ask around.
This is PUBLIC ENEMY #1 this man is the money paying these rioters and telling them to create chaos. He tells the mayors and Dem governors to not ask or allow Trump to send help. I want to see Soros deportation or funeral.
REMEMBER IF A DEMOCRAT ACUSES TRUMP OF DOING SOMETHING, THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES REALLY DOING WHAT THEY ARE ACUSING TRUMP OF. They are trying to scare Trump supporters into not showing up to vote.They are scared to death of us and they are trying to bluff and scare us like 2016

Its actually true. Those are not even their kids. This was all set up by rich ppl long ago and the Bush administration. They were crooked. Its honestly why Trump matters so much. Why would they do this to someone unless he had a lot of dirt on them

You‚Äôre absolutely right, I do yawn ü•±
Ad hominem attacks, how surprising. So the people who listen to a liar like Trump are woke and the people listening to reputable sources of info are sheep, huh? No wonder Trump loves the uneducated.
If Obama or Clinton hasd EVER said anything close to what Trump said, would it be considered ‚Äúa joke‚Äù by Cornyn and the rest of the complacent Republicans?!?
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn‚Äôt leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
I wonder how much Southeastern donates to Trump-friendly PACs.
Texas is fine.  We all know these covid numbers are propaganda to derail Trump.

Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn‚Äôt want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis‚Äôs name! EVER!
You have no foreign policy experience.  Your motives are selfish.  You are only opposed because in your fantasy you think opposing Trump makes you a hero.  You‚Äôre not...you‚Äôre a fraud.
You know what, forget I. I shouldn‚Äôt be insulting someone because I‚Äôm very privileged and was born into a wealthy family. If you think Donald Trump, despite the fact that he made our country a freakshow, will be a good President, vote for him. It‚Äôs your right.
Thread by  No mechanism exists that I am aware of for delaying a Presidential election. Trump also is aware of this. Trump is  Left again. This never gets old. Trump **wants mail in voting**. He is going to keep trolling them into demandin‚Ä¶

Well unfortunately he's a Trump supporter and believes in a lot of stupid conspiracy theories.
President Trump, I respectfully disagree with your desire to delay the election.  I agree that the potential for fraud is high with mail in voting.  We need to come up with a solution to combat fraud, but not delay the election.  In person voting w/precautions against Covid.

FRIENDLY REMINDER: If Trump cancelled the election, Nancy Pelosi does not automatically become president on January 20th. House of Representatives would be vacant come January 3rd, thusly on Jan. 20th there would technically be NO speaker of the house to assume the presidency.
Cancelling/Postponing the election will not only end in a constitutional crisis, but I don't think Trump understands that the constitution holds that at Noon on January 20th, both him and Pence will be jobless if the election has not yet taken place.
Wouldn't be great if they brought back  for one final episode where they surrounded the White House and dragged out a half-shaven Donald Trump in a wife beater and pajama bottoms and the last you saw of him was the in the back of the squad car with the closing credits?

Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.

Donald Trump is too nice to Russia and Venezuela! When we get a real man, not an effenminent homo, in the office, he‚Äôll make sure those countries don‚Äôt fuck with America again!
In 2008 President Bush quipped that he‚Äôd rather be FDR than Hoover during his economic crisis.   President Trump has arguably replaced Hoover as a warning on how not to handle an economic crisis.
Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.

I‚Äôm around military people constantly. All of my friends are either brats or former military. Home to me is Ft Hood. My family was represented in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. Most despise Trump. Shall I tag some? They see this very different than you ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trumps lack of a response is his fault. Trump not paying attention to his briefings is his fault. Trump not telling Putin there will be retaliation is his fault. Who are you blaming if not him? ü§î
It‚Äôs a thing if you understand Trump and his long standing ties to Russian organized crime. Again, everything isn‚Äôt political. I oppose the right because I was raised in a normal conservative environment. These people are not that. They are fascists.

Now certainly Bill Clinton knew Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine were mega child molesters. AS DID DONALD TRUMP!!
Hey Trump! To allay your fears, let‚Äôs not wait. We can vote you out of office this weekend!! #EvictTrump
Wh says you?  Trump kicked Epstein out of Margo resort area.   Lawyer for some of the victims said that President Trump was the only high profile person to actually want to help in 2009.  Get over it. You liberals will not continue to bash our President.
If Trump suspended democracy altogether tomorrow, you'd be the first person here telling us that democracy is a hoax. You're already cool with suspending habeas corpus and delaying elections.
We all kind of knew Trump wouldn't go quietly.

Sounds like someone with that level of concern would have some studies proving fraud. I wonder why Trump won't tweet those?  You're totally cool with governors administrating their own elections, disenfranchising millions, and gerrymandering by racial boundaries though.
What if it really came to that? We have established that Trump has no regard for the law and there are GOP senators that refuse to hold him accountable  What if Trump really tried to delay the election-who would be there to stop him?
Meh...better than what we have is a very low bar to clear...these cats all disappointed us in various ways as heads of state; but they were there - they did some work and we‚Äôd be better off both sans Trump and sans puppets of the corrupt establishment
Bill Clinton was screwing Ghislaine Maxwell. Was Clinton abusing underage girls? Don't know. Trump sure as hell was.
Do you really think if enough diehard, red-as-they-come Republicans speak out publicly against Trump, it would change anything?

You're not proving a point. Trump claims that if mail-in voting is allowed, there will be mass fraud. But he has nothing to back it up. (As usual)  Mail-in votes have unique barcodes for tracking and the signature is compared to the one on file of the registered voter.

The power to remove Trump from office.
‚ÄúTo some degree‚Äù is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
Questions that were obviously not on Trump's cognitive test.  I'll start Dolt is to idiot as vote by mail is to A) Lost in the mail B) Defund the post office C) Absentee ballot D) Well let me tell you, I am the greatest dolt in the world

You are really twisting what I wrote. Tell me, what did you think about Idi Amin‚Äôs reign of terror? Trump is on his way to do worse. The rally was like a Jonestown event. I‚Äôm not happy about anyone‚Äôs death, quite the opposite. I am angry Trump let this happen.
So, Dems forced Trump to hold his last rally and made Herman go to it without a mask? Can you find that clip of Nancy saying it will go away like a miracle? All those libs discrediting Dr. Fauci? Calling the virus a hoax? I'll wait.
"  ‚ÄúIf I can help you out with the funeral, I‚Äôll help you out, financially, I‚Äôll help you,‚Äù Trump said."  Trump reacting to this the same way he reacts to one of his flings turning up pregnant.
When you hear people say "Vote blue no matter who." - it's not that they're being flippant about the issue. It's that we desperately need a way out of Trump's reality.
‚Å¶ calls trump a ‚Äúman‚Äù and calls himself a Democrat. He‚Äôs wrong on both counts. trump is a weak man‚Äôs idea of a strong man.
No Damon. This is about Trump wins and when far left riots.  YOU and ALL DEMS SAY go break them in half.
Evict Trump, bone spurs, Kremlin Annex, Putin's puppet, Impeach 45, Reeeeeeeeesist, little hands, cheetos, Orange Man Bad, pumpkin lies, hamberders, ETC. Just blah, blah like spoiled children throwing an eternal fit, you think they'd get tired.
Too bad the trump disdain for reality killed him.
Take your Anti- American BS somewhere else. You are behind and Trump will crush Biden.   The Democrats are evil and America knows it.
Not here to play backgammon with the Democrats or Republicans   Americans &amp; Trump need to shit or get off the pot and stop this tit for tat game with these poser in Government and these riots freaks it not a show &amp; tell   This inst LIFE   This reminds me of a dam game show
" ‚ÄúWell, I saw this on one of the shows recently, and I was just looking, and it hit me very hard,‚Äù Trump said."  Really?  No one in your administration thought to mention this case to you?
We will be delivering our mail-in ballots in person.  I trust USPS carriers but Trump's new USPS bootlicker is already slowing down the mail.  This election is too important for any mishaps.
That‚Äôs not fair -  took time to explain that Trump was just kidding...
Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST!
And our Trump GOP elected officials     and the rest of the Texas Republican delegation back this DHS activity. #ETTD
If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about ‚Äúmail in voting‚Äù, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.
I believe in vaccinations too. They saved my life when I was a foreign service brat, living in third world countries.  That said, no way do I trust any vaccine coming from the Trump administration.  I'll wait until WHO or the EU endorses a vaccine.
NO! Senator McConnell &amp; Rep McCarthy, leaders of your party, recognized that Trump was talking about postponing an election he is losing badly. Of course, Trump has no power to do this. And leading elected Republicans think it was stupid, statement. Why are you defending it?
All bets are off until Trump whines about it. Depends on if he sticks to the script or not. If he's feeling left out in the cold, he may just go into a full tantrum and not approve anything except his executive orders anymore.
AOC is the second politician that spends the most on FB ads, only after Trump
if you think Biden is worse than Trump you don't know anything above stupid
Howdy handful of people that follow me. Voting by mail isn't going to work. It really easy for Trump's hand picked Post Master General (What's his name?) to compromise them. Lots of ways to make a mail in vote not count. Lots.  We should accept this now.
How is bringing politics into it on point?  ESPN is owned by Disney which is a huge conglomerate that is very conservative.  Most of their product  is not liberal. Now go back to being a great H-town fan and Dad.  You're a lot better a those than whining like Trump.
So glad to have your confirmation even though it was never needed... I think our constitution is pretty clear here. Now on the whole conspiracy pushing, there is ONLY one candidate who promotes that - Trump.
Trump threatens Democracy as we know it! #EvictTrump
Will You have a Republican Convention? If Not. Is it because Trump listening to his radical, Right Wing Donors?
We can't vote by mail.  Trump's compromised it.   He's installed a William Barr like Post Master General.   There's all sorts of arcane rules as to which mail in ballots count and which don't.  All of which fall under the purview of the Post Master.
Let me go to your house and steal your ballot and place a vote for Trump and mail it it in. You can‚Äôt argue you didn‚Äôt vote, they received it. Especially if you don‚Äôt like who your neighbor is voting for. How does that look for you? As a registered voter I refuse to allow this!

#CowardCornyn, Trump's most prolific and consistent apologist, tries to convince reporters and himself the president was joking about delaying the election. Trump was serious.   is not. He is a shell of a man and lacks any principles.
What I‚Äôm gathering is that a e shouldn‚Äôt vote for Donald Trump or Bill Clinton in November. Sounds good.
Yep, the plan is to get a Trump big donor to lead the postal service and then have him drive it into the ground and then blame it for being inefficient and then move forward to privatize it
Stella Immanuel for Trump's vice president. #Stella4TrumpVP
Trump only has the power to delay the election if we let him.
Trump has never, and this is true, owned a pet, let alone a dog. Think about that.
Uh, did you actually pay attention to anything those guys did? We were already well on the way to fascism way before Trump came along, and they all helped.
The current Post Master General has one job. Suppress the mail in vote.  Trump's going to win reelection if we vote by mail. We're going to have to go out to the polls.  It's not right. But it's true.
Trump literally never even said the word bleach. Yet here you are calling other people ignorant. You‚Äôre a joke.
me: I love strip clubs! My aunt: strip clubs work closely with pedophiles Me: didn‚Äôt you vote for trump?
Don't forget the Kennedy Center honors.   What happened to them? I guess Trump killed them too.   ETTD!
That is, if you haven‚Äôt already died from the #TrumpVirusCatastrophe   Eating Pizza is a great way to forget that Donald Trump is a sociopathic conman who‚Äôs responsible for the deaths of over 160,000 Americans due to his ignorance, incompetence, and lack of compassion.
Any 3rd party candidate in 2020 had even the tiniest shred of decency, intelligence, or class, they would drop out &amp; encourage their supporters to suck it up &amp; vote for Joe Biden, b/c Trump &amp; the GOP are existential threats to this nation.  It's telling none have done so. (2/2)
So, I'm reminded of how the VP choice for 3rd Party candidate Gary "What is Aleppo" Johnson come out just before the election and told everyone to vote for Hillary, because Trump was an existential threat to the country.  He showed real intelligence and class with that. (1/2)

Yeah, this is less a "Come to Jesus" moment and more like the next step in the original plan.  Someone was probably chosen to be their new leader a while ago. Now they will step up and lead the party on an anti-Trump course correction, and pray it's enough to keep the party alive
Over the past 20 years there‚Äôs been .00006% cases of fraud in all mail-in ballots cast in presidential elections. Trump wants to delay the election because he knows he has a .00006% chance of winning.
Lol, give us fake tRump? That will work I‚Äôm sure of it.
Yes, we will crack open some trump vodka, grill some trump steaks, stare for a moment at our diploma from trump U, then catch a trump shuttle to Atlantic City to gamble at one of his fine casinos. Like that.
When is Ramona going to be fired? Everyone is so sick of the meaningless apologies, disgusting behavior, and her Trump loving girlfriends can go to#RHONY
You act as if I don‚Äôt criticize Obama too. He made the cages, trump perpetuates them. Dumbass ‚Äúlaughing emoji‚Äù
Cain only died to make Trump look bad.  Gotta admire his commitment if it‚Äôs true
do you and the  have anything lined up this year to air if/when Trump drops another "October Surprise"?
I‚Äôm offended that Trump is front of the Texas Flag. He is anything but Texan or could care less about Texas.
#maddow  is right - the election doesn't have to be delayed for Trump to interfere with it. He, his boss Vlad and all the people raking in $ absolutely will do everything they can to ratfck the election. All of his allies will purge voter rolls, close polling places,
So...just abolish rules that don‚Äôt serve our interests? Sounds totally fair. What happens when the other side wants to get rid of rules that don‚Äôt benefit them? Hasn‚Äôt Trump been doing this his entire term?
This was always the plan.  Someone was probably designated a long time ago to be their new Figurehead when Trump ultimately destroyed the party. Now that the new internal polls are out, II expect that alarm just went off.
Just a bunch of #MAGAMorons on their way to infecting each other.  You can‚Äôt fix stupid, but you can bury it...
Trump has to go
I wouldn't worry about it. Trump is just talking out of his big orange a$$ again.
U really do need to get out of the Trump bubble. Most Americans DON"T want schools 2 open. Might help to stop listening solely to Fox, the PR station of the Prez.

HEADLINES: Trump stokes racist fears after revoking Obama-era housing rule intended to fight segregation
Once he gets beat by a landslide, Trump will act like the pestilent child he has always been and will do everything he can to set Biden up for failure. Hopefully, that will land him in jail...
... and the 150,000+ Americans who died from Trump‚Äôs Virus!
It is too little too late in my opinion.   After all of Trump's Constitutional abuses, this tweet is what caused him to pull his support?  Absurd...more like looking for an excuse to jump ship now that Trump is likely to lose.
Why would people who are just voting to get Trump out care to watch a Biden rally? And if rally size mattered at all wouldn't Bernie have won the dem nom?
Stuff like this has been going on for decades. It does a disservice to the gravity of the issues we face when people blame everything on Trump.
Anyone "undecided" is voting Trump
It's shameful that none of Trump's other unconstitutional acts have bothered him.    This reeks of fear that Trump's stench won't wash off.  Everyone that conveniently looked away from Trump's myriad of abuses b/c of tax cuts for the 1% &amp; rightwing judges will be stained forever.
Obama just gave Trump the election. better than Hillary's deplorable moment!!! played the race card again!!! asshole!
I will not trust any vaccine that trump and this administration has it's grubby hands in.
Trump is also super vocal ab it because sex trafficking is something that isn‚Äôt partisan, everyone can agree sex trafficking is evil. So he realized by having a unifying enemy he might look better if he looks to be combatting it  I mean he‚Äôs not  But still
President Donald Trump met Thursday with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a "terrible story" and that he would help with funeral expenses.

Trump was always only ever a useful idiot. Destructive sleight-of-hand while McConnell did their real work. This was always going to be their endgame. Milk Trump for everything, damn the consequences, cry before the election and pray it's enough to keep their party alive.
Trump became vocal + reminded people realized there‚Äôs a global slave trade and with creeps in supermarket everyone is assuming they‚Äôre traffickers bc they see it in the news more often, and w sex work becoming more visible people try to link the two and think it‚Äôs more prelevant
This is true in some states but most states, including Florida, you do not have to offer a reason to get a ballot. According to  President Trump was in Florida during early voting and could have voted in person
Trump now thinks he is invisible? Mr. President have you been eating bath salts again?
I think they were working on some evil shit to use on Hong Kong protestors. Tested but not what they wanted. Got out. They chose to have the world suffer if they were going to suffer. Possibly on purpose to hurt Trump and get rid of millions of their elderly. China is a mess.

Shadow work is excruciating, which is why most will never engage in it.  Just ask anyone whose done serious psychonaut work.  Toward that end, this article is spot on.
Oh, you think he was happy? Lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator? Other than a tax break for the wealthy, tRump hasn't kept any of his promises. Turns out he wasn't too busy to gold and Mexico didn't pay for the wall. Economy in the toilet and 150,000 dead. Whee!

He doesn‚Äôt want to die from the trump virus. It only kills Democrats after all
Trump will do absolutely anything to hold on to power. ANYTHING.
Because of the study design we don‚Äôt know if it was the HCQ or the color of the hospital gowns. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to randomized control and make it double blind where possible.
I‚Äôm sure Tiffany Trump will have some nice things to say about him. Lol

Still Won't Push Back at Trump, Even After He Threatens to Delay Election   #VoteHimOut2020
I look forward to not living in this bizarre alternate reality where everything happening is because the Democrats want to defeat Trump instead of because he just care about people.
Wait, don‚Äôt you believe it‚Äôs a big hoax perpetuated by Democrats to steal the election? Then why would you get tested? Why wear a mask? Oh right, Chip Roy and Donald Trump are peas in a pod - lie when it‚Äôs convenient, acknowledge reality when you must.
Haha, I understand socialism as I have traveled to several countries that embrace it.  Thanks for looking through my tweets and I truly hope you enjoy the next 4.5yrs with Trump as your president.     Yes, gig‚Äôem and here‚Äôs to Aggie football this fall

Slow-on-the-uptake Greg can't catch a break from his own batshit party. You can't even say "take this global pandemic seriously" without catching hell from the Trump wing.

Sorry Dems only get the two things offered for extension.  They CHOSE to SCREW the desperate, for leverage.  Trump / GOP now have the leverage, tomorrow folks get hungry and Dems keep not taking deal.
How would you describe Donald Trump's presidency?  Junior: GREAT!   Bo: RUFF!   Judge: Point to Bo.
Trump has no remorse that his ego rally in Tulsa infected people and killed several, including Herman 9-9-9 Cain.  Commenting on this, Trump in true buck passing form called it the China Virus.  It was  HIS rally that got Cain infected. Mr Empathy.

Never in my life have a seen a bigger  pile of human dung. He killed that man with his arrogance..If Trump was right about anything that man would still be alive.  Why didn't they save him with #hydroxychloroquine?   BECAUSE IT BULLSHIT.
They‚Äôre being sarcastic bc voter shaming is lame and you should try shaming people in power to be worth voting for or doing more to earn our votes rather than brow beating people who don‚Äôt wanna replace trump w the stuff that got us trump. Biden is not a solution to our problems
But to Trump's point, neither of those crises were as severe or malicious as CNN's treatment of him.
Where was Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù  - thrown under the bus, as usual. Playing catch-up as always
Ew no it‚Äôs a candidate‚Äôs job to earn people‚Äôs votes, it is not our fault Obama was a well spoken republican-lite who sold us out and gave us Mitt Romney‚Äôs healthcare plan, or that Hillary was so bad she lost to trump. The onus is on THEM to earn ppl‚Äôs votes to win, not us
...yes? Being a Trump supporter isnt suppossed to be a good thing. The fact you dont see it as in insult is the problem. Just from your timeline it's kinda obvious (half expected Ben Shapiro or PragerU or just flat put Trump retweets).

I'm so glad I have my lullaby playlist to listen to in the commercials, calm soothing music is what I need after hearing what Trump said. Though thank you Chris for playing Obama clips! There's a Go Vote! drink, isn't there? #inners

Herman Cain, dead at 74 from Trump Virus.
Trump effectively brushed back mail in voting.  Everyoen stands in line on Tuesday the sacred day.
At least now we know for sure that trump will not accept the outcome of the election when he loses.  OK, we will just have to drag him out of the White House kicking and screaming.
Trump knows HE would cheat if he could so he assumes everybody else would, too.  He doesn't understand that 72% of the country are 1000 times better people than he is.
But even this is unlikely. Trump's overarching goal I think, if he loses (which is likely), is to delegitimize the result. Country &amp; stability be damned if he can manufacture a claim he's been wronged.
So much for Trump's "secure phonecalls." He must be our enemies' dream POTUS. No need for any sophisticated listening equipment because everyone can hear him shouting on his phone!

Q. What the difference between Donald Trump and a bag of üí©?  A. The bag.
The intermediate step, as Trump would argue, is that if the ECollege can't select a winner (much depends on the 12th A.'s interpretation), then the House, the current one, would pick. Trump would win because each state would get one vote.

Gotcha. Doing what I can to get rid of Trump is normalizing fascism. Whining about the "system" and having the effect of a non voter is the real way to stop Trump's goons.

Breaking   At fundraiser, Biden says Trump "called for not having the election on November 3. He wants to postpone the election. Well that's for two reasons. One he believes it but two he doesn't want you to focus on what's going on today" with the funeral of John Lewis.
every week you rail on Trump causing division, Martha hits you up directly and we‚Äôre closer than we all think?   Compromise?   Like the ‚Äòpeaceful protests‚Äô (aka riots) in Seattle and Portland?        #TheStory
Any normal candidate who plays by the rules will get dunked on like Mitt and McCain.  Trump is the only way.  Fuck everybody except those I can help and shit lord on anyone since the world is not symmetrical in anyway.
I seriously hope that even after we throw Trump out along with as many of his  sycophant enablers that the republicans that are left have a permanent mark on them so we don‚Äôt forget come 2022 and 2024. We should eradicte them just as you would eradicate a disease
Trump will  still be being cursed for this centuries in the future. He is a totally inept idiot.

Donald Trump should never have made common-sense public health measures like masks in to a partisan political issue.
That‚Äôs actually terrifying to think about   Like  It‚Äôs paper  Trump can destroy that
I mean Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's not going to be a drama queen all of the time. Trump is dangerous. I want Biden to just be boring. I can't wait for a boring President, so my biggest concern will be the Cowboys, Mavs, and Longhorns.
(This is also relevant to why Trump did relatively well with "moderate" voters in the primary and to a lesser extent, the general)
I watched people say for years that Trump can‚Äôt do this or that because of the established rules. But then he goes and does it. The rules are not set. Oppose him with real power and stop pretending like he isn‚Äôt capable of the disastrous harm that he so very clearly is.

" Not as much as Donald Trump in a single term?" -fingerfly1
Wow Bush shit on Trump let‚Äôs goooo
Nope. A. Trump has no friends; just pawns. B. Trump enabled his death w his no-mask BS &amp; not cancelling his stupid hate rally. He killed his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù just as sure as if he‚Äôd shot him. Just like he‚Äôs blown off the 154,000 other dead Americans. Nope, I‚Äôm not going to be quiet.
Obama delivers call to action in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in 1960s
Would-be dictator Donald Trump would be unstoppable in a second term. That must not happen
And. he. was. wrong. He didn't have to die. If we had a competent leader he would still be alive. He unfortunately is responsible as much as trump for putting other pple lives at risk by downplaying public health precautions. it was just a mask and it could have saved his life.
Another on of tRump's lies. Mail in and absentee ballots are the same thing.Trump's Absentee vs. Mail-In Ballot Spin  via
Trump has wasted time on failed treatments and bad ideas, like; chloroquine and disinfectant, while not giving attention to prevention, like; masks and distancing. Private companies came up with all the vaccines. Warp Speed is helping build supplies. That is it.
2)If he thinks it‚Äôs the cure then one would think he‚Äôd have it available to every American today.  Commission your own study, Mr. Trump.  Surely you believe he has the power to manifest his claim with policy.... after all he‚Äôs the president.
Geez, why is it taking so long for these trump supporters to open their eyes? He‚Äôs a grifter, a conman, and a wannabe autocrat, and that will NEVER change.
1) If HCQ is the magic pill then why hasn‚Äôt trump put his claim into policy? Why isn‚Äôt he demanding his 63 million doses being held be distributed?  Do the testing.  Vet this drug.  We have the greatest scientists in the world, right?
In fact fear of the repercussions of a loss will drive Trump to pull out all the stops. He wins, or he and his family go to prison. He won't go easy.
Just about sums it all up.  The Tanned Man Has a Green Monster
If we're gonna thank God, Jim Jordan, shouldn't we obey His commandments &amp; follow his advice? Stuff like "love thy neighbor as thyself" &amp; "do not bear false witness" &amp; "do not commit adultery"? Trump also cackled about torture; is that what God wants? #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
I love them. Such pretty ladies!!!  Dogs are the best.  My dogs have really been supportive during this time.  Here they are when trump is on TV.  Keno turns his back and Jamie hides in her bed.  (I may have made this up.)
For the record, mail-in voting and absentee voting are in fact the same. Trump, in speaking just now from the White House, admitted to voting absentee because he cannot be in Florida. He expressed confidence in that system, but then undermined mail-in voting.
Cain went there willingly. It is the death of the many thousands of innocent people who got caught in Trump‚Äôs incompetency that he should be held responsible for.
If we go to mail in voting I will receive 6 ballots at my address. I can through my neighborhood 10 min before the mailman and pick up another 100 or so. Change all of them to President Trump, run em to PO and drop them off! So bring on the mail in ballots!
Paraphrase of  and he is right. There are 5 states Red and Blue with vote by mail. Ask your Trump thumpers to cute a case in each state of massive voter fraud due to mail in ballots.
If you still support trump, then you can no longer say you also support the Constitution. At some point you‚Äôre going to have to wake up and realize not only do you support a fascist but you are one as well. #2020worstyear #trump #TrumpIsUnwell #FascistTrump

I'm sorry my teenage daughter had to live through the last four years with this sorry excuse for a human being as president. Trump has no redeeming qualities that I would ever want in another human being.

Trump winning just the EC during pandemic after impeachment Russia etc will destroy Dems overnight.  Far Left will be discarded.
Guys, I hate to tell you this but Trump isn't going peacefully in January. This is going to be a sh*tshow! People may very well be harmed, but if he loses the election in November he will be physically removed even if we the people have to do it ourselves.
Whoever is translating for Vanessa Guillen‚Äôs mother while she speaks with Trump is horrible. Her responses are heartfelt and genuine and the translator is barely even trying.

Even if somehow only Trump's electors were left, if he lost, he wouldn't have 270 electors, and you need to have a majority of all elector slots, not just a plurality. That's why the 1824 election was decided by the House. Jackson only had a plurality of EC votes.

Aren‚Äôt you the press secretary? Oh shit. Never mind. Ignorant blonde republicans are easy to get confused. You‚Äôre right though. The country is at stake. Trump is trying to say he might delay elections. If you care about America, vote blue.

1/ My bigger worry is Trump, at some point, declaring that a tanked economy along with 1/4 million American deaths (which we'll likely hit by X-mas) along with ?questionable? election results constitutes a "catastrophic emergency" allowing him to act under (con't)

After what Trump has put us all through, the Democrats could elect a dead fish as president, and the world would celebrate.

I can‚Äôt stand Trump and cannot wait until he‚Äôs gone - but on this he is correct. If you want to vote absentee, you must request a mail ballot for each election cycle. If we were to use mail in ballots, they would just be mailed to all registered voter at their last known address
I love America, and for that reason I would NEVER vote Trump
And yet I have received these emails for several days, and have seen her post on Twitter about "our" program to fix the country post-Trump. I don't think you should count her out just yet.

Trump is responsible for the deaths of every American that thought COVID was a hoax. If he had just soberly and factual reported what he was told about it in secret meetings, significantly less people would have gone on for months thinking it was fake.
Unlike Trump, Cain wasn't in meetings with the experts getting facts about the virus. He, like others on the right, got info from right wing media, who were parroting Trump's lies about it. The media and leaders that he trusted lied to him, but why should he not have believed it?
The thing that is missing from the Herman Cain commentary is the realization that he was effectively murdered by Donald Trump.   Cain, like every other conservative in this country, was the victim of the media propaganda surrounding COVID. He had no way to believe it was real.
"Trump breaks laws. It is what he does."

Well, first of all, he probably wouldn't be allowed in the country, which suddenly gives me a brilliant idea! We can ship his remains to Russia! Putin is a harsher and smarter sociopath than Trump. Once Trump is no longer useful, he'll use another GOP member to achieve his goals.

It's not going to take Team Trump and the GOP to see who gets blamed for this.
Bless your heart. Trump can‚Äôt talk. He is illiterate and uses small vocabulary. With Biden‚Äôs stutter challenge, he is more articulate on any day. Also Biden will hire smart people instead of family and scum.
on your show? Why not #Trump's new med guru, Dr. Stella Immanuel, plus  who thinks Dr. Stella is an expert on #COVID19? She can tell us about about "Holy Ghost hand grenades" &amp; how "snake penises" cause illness in the night.
We are simply going to have to decide that we do not want Trump‚Äôs America. Why is that so difficult?

How did Trump bungle the pandemic? There‚Äôs a very long timeline of mistakes (see below), but perhaps you could check in with Herman Cain and get his take. Oh wait you can‚Äôt because he‚Äôs dead thanks to Trump and his idiotic ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear a mask‚Äù leadership.
Because President  is EVERYTHING that Trump will NEVER be. The list is endless.
Holy Shit! Trump's own cabinet is starting to die from Covid-19.

He should also drink bleach and stop having sex with demons.
No amount of stupid Trump can't overcome.
I was going to tell a joke about Trump he does that for himself every time he talks.
If not for the cult-like atmosphere trump has created- Herman Cain might be alive today.  As well as thousands of other Americans.

So how well did the democrats take the result of the last election?  It is over 3 years and they are still fighting the results.  What is going to happen when Trump gets re-elected?  4 more years of this crap?
So according to Trump it's too dangerous to hold an election in November but perfectly fine to send our kids back to school next month.  Makes sense
You'd think Trump would be behind this, as much of a fan of the "acting" title as he is: &gt;If no newly elected president is available, the speaker of the House of Representatives becomes acting president.&lt;
I read yesterday White women in PA are still Trump fans.
My words for 2015 hopin'-for-Trump Dems were usually "careful what you wish for"
That's how people in political parties are though. They prop up people that have no business running the country.  The Democrats are doing it for Joe and Republicans are doing it for Trump.  They are both too old and their brains are shot.
Kewl Human COVID-19 Petri dish = less people voting for Trump Pence
Project Blue Beam. It's a joke and a distraction that Trump is using to feed his hyper religious crazy fanbase.  They eat that shit up like crazy.  These nuts use Religion, Aliens, and Conspiracy as a way to keep the paranoia going while they pick their wallets and destroy minds.
Too bad Trump and the right wing hadn‚Äôt started wearing masks yet.
Considering Democrats are burning their own cities? Yea, I think President Trump will win by a lot #MyPresident #NotShy
Trump owns the DOJ right now. The very fact no one from the Obama admin has been sent to jail or even interviewed should tell you the DOJ doesn't have a case.
I agree but I also see the same thing going on with Donald Trump.   there might be something to not electing presidents after their past the age of 70.  for the most part they are just nowhere near as sharp as they need to be.

No, the elections should not be delayed. Trump fears losing and is grasping.
It so striking to compare Obama with Trump. One of them is supremely intelligent, well-educated, radiates good will and compassion, is supremely articulate, inspiring, a greater orator and thinks of the greater good for all and the other person has none of these traits.
Now that Trump is losing badly to Vice President Biden in the polls, he's attempting to undermine the validity of the election in advance. This is what desperation looks like on the most powerful man in the world.
To all those  expressing sympathy, know this: He died believing what Trump says abt the virus. He had an underlying condition and yet he still believed Trump. Wonder why most Americans don't believe the WH? If ur stomped by that question, ur in deeper trouble then we thought.

I am now waiting for the John Birch society to come out against Trump
I certainly hope more and more Republicans have grown sick and tired of Trump's bullshit that they will reject him in November... or better yet, deny him the nomination altogether.
apparently not everyone thought Trump was just joking, like this crazy guy who (checks notes) founded the Federalist Society
Just as badly done as Trump as Thanos.
Out of one side of his mouth, trump is claiming mail-in voting is corrupt. Out of the other side, his campaign is mailing information on how to vote-by-mail to his supporters.  What a hypocritical a**h*le.

to say there is no evidence of cheating on mail in ballots means you either forgot about absolutes or are parroting a company line, which is fine but it doesn't make it true.  The reality is Trump is negotiating to make sure they don't happen and the election will be on nov 3

The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Donald Trump is the Red Baron.  And we are all Snoopy.
Absolutely, Trump uses people all the time.
Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke.
Oh no, what shall we do now that one conservative dislikes Trump? A statement or tweet does not justify impeachment. Maybe if you could win fair and square you wouldn‚Äôt have to talk about impeachment. Also...no, I don‚Äôt want to join your Neo-Marxist fan club.
He never kicked him out of Mir a Lago.  That is a story Trump says.  He said he was a great guy up until 2004 when Epstien outbid him on a building and got in trouble.  Just because Trump says it now does not mean its true.  He tried to get rid of Berman.
I am really sorry that Trump rejected you as his campaign manager. I think it was a good decision though, after seeing you screw up McCain‚Äôs campaign. Good luck to you.
Not all!  Some are still avid Trump supporters.  The staunch republicans would rather vote Trump than put a dem in.  The sad thing is Today's Republican party is not the republican party of my father or grandfather. He has them brainwashed.

You found another tweet by someone who is falsifying trump as a fascist to support your argument. Way to go üëçüèªOpinion over facts, right? So whatcha going to do when Trump wins 300 electorals in November?
The Republicans don't want it to be made easy.
Tony DavisMAGA COUNTRY üá∫üá∏ I don't know about everyone else but these lying scumbags made me physically ill watching them lie straight faced to Congress for the umpteenth time. Hopefully, Trump will take them down a peg in his second term.

China was responsible for the virus. Trump is responsible for mismanaging it here.
Our President is an imbecile.
I'm not going to make light of it he's dead no matter how he died so I'm not going to make a joke about it. But if he was murdered then I think the list would be rather short.
Trump, as the President, has obviously never read our Constitution! Delay The Election?  Say Hi To President Nancy Pelosi |
Don‚Äôt keep going with the Trump supporter.  It‚Äôs a pointless task.
You can't even offer me any positive points on Trump. Sounds about right. That's why Trump doesn't represent the Republican Party - he may spout what you want to hear, but his actions fall short. He's a Russian political puppet. I will always support USA, and do not trust him
Texas. Trump all the way.
Trump never sent his SS guards to Chicago. Fighting armed drug lords is a little different than unarmed posters in Portland. Just saying.
I was polled about 6 months ago from CNN. I don‚Äôt think they liked my answers. My answer was Trump, Trump, and Trump.
I don't agree that Trump hates Black people, but he certainly doesn't do anything to protect us or keep us united during these difficult times.
Please enlighten me. OK - he started the wall. I will give him that. Other than that, what has he done? It's a shit show right now, with no end in site under Trump.
Trump is misleading us on purpose. He is being paid off by Russia to create this chaos. Which is why he is sitting back as thousands die from this very preventative virus.

Why would the family want to sit down with Trump. Believe me it is no honor.
Things have never been worse. Make America Great Again by NOT voting for Trump. REAL REPUBLICANS know, that Trump doesn't care about us. Disgrace to the party.
And Republicans treat Trump like a diety.
I'm so surprised Trump was able to con the press into not asking him about his economic disaster at today's press briefing.   So surprised.
Trump supporters right now
Act of a desperate man........let's delay the election so I can't lose.  Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress
Biden should be replaced if the Democrats have any chance to beat Trump. His Mental health is makes him unfit to be President. #ABC
Things have never been worse under Trump
With Bush v. Gore, there was not time to prep a legal team when the Republicans worked to steal that election. We know what's going to happen when Trump loses. Joe needs to be rallying teams of lawyers from every state that are ready to fight.
Meanwhile I found this pic of you at a Trump rally maskless with your culty friends!
Trump won‚Äôt try to delay the Election. He talking when he mentions delaying it. You won‚Äôt have to worry about Trump after 2024#ABC
Obama was responsible for the death of Osama bin Laden, so I disagree that he let ISIS thrive. The world we are living in now is pure chaos. I am by no means an Obama fan, but things under Trump have never been worse.
Only people with the last name ‚Äútrump‚Äù, nobody else cares or will care!
Trump wants to delay the Nov. 3 election. Looks to me somebody just realized he don't have a prayer. Trying to extend his rule of "King Trump" .  Better keep an eye on him now. He's getting desperate now. Lie, cheat, steal, bribe, kidnap important families. What ever it takes

Trump suggested today that we delay the election since he will obviously get hammered by even a senile old guy. Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy both said not happening.
Trump is now suggesting that it could take years to determine the winner of the election if it is not delayed.  #TrumpFascism
so TRUMP just had those papers randomly regarding voter mail fraud, ha  I think trump planted that reporter to have him ask the question so he could use covid to talk on subject postponing election
Should is make us feel better or even more scared??? Do they know more of what trump and barr are up to in private?

I so hope you do not win as Maine Senator. You are a flake. Not good for our country. We do not need another Trump and liar.

Trump supporters are think just like trump! I expect nothing less from them! Stupidity!

I've noticed that when Trump brings someone or something up it's usually for a reason. Sometimes it's because it's  good, &amp; sometimes it's cuz he's painting a target on it.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff drumpf‚Äôs call to delay the Nov. 3 election bc fear of (unsubstantiated) voter fraud. Republicans may be starting to distance themselves from drumpf.  It‚Äôs more than time for invertebrate Repbs to do so.

Obama delivers call to arms in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in 1960s. Anyone else miss Pres Obama SS president? üíîHis eulogy was a call to arms for voting rights, calling for further additions to VR Bill.

I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt a big deal. You‚Äôre just suggesting another dumb trump tweet is to distract from the economy being down (historically down). I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs intelligent enough for such a scheme.

Not a good day for Trump.
Will Mr. Trump be attending his memorial service?
If Trump mentions $PRPO and turns it into a $KODK moment, I‚Äôll vote for him!
Oh, this is good! We are absolutely living in the Twilight Zone, or rather, the tRump Twilight Zone!
Yes sir, their presence and outrageous actions are just making the entire situation worse. And worse, and worse...of course, that‚Äôs what tRump wants!
Who knew the Republican Party was so full of people with no sense of self-preservation. Not wearing a mask in obeisance to Trump is not a hill I would choose to die on. #HermanCain
Trump is supposed to be a leader. By Trump not wearing a mask, he is saying to his followers that it's ok not to!
This was just a distraction. The second-quarter GDP plunged by worst-ever 32.9% and Herman Cain died from COVID-19 that he probably caught at Trump's Tulsa rally. But, Trump's tweet about delaying the election is getting the most attention.
So you‚Äôre saying it was completely his choice to go and not wear a mask. So Democrats need to quit blaming his death on Trump. Y‚Äôall are so evil.
Trump suggests delaying November election -- but date is set by Congress
No one forced him to go to Trump‚Äôs rally. He chose to go and he lived his life how he wanted to. It seems Democrats want no one to take any risks ever again for fear of death or just something bad happening. Life is full of risk - get over it.
This nigga Trump says whatever he wants lol

Dude that's the whole point. He said EVERY DEVELOPER IS TREATED THE SAME. They are NOT. Every developer is NOT treated the same. One definition of "lie" is stating the opposite of the truth. He did that. I'm so tired of Cook doing the wrong thing. Trump/Austin, China, all of it.

Daydreaming that in the future there will be a "did you vote for Trump in 2020" question on job applications, that if you answer yes to just proves you have poor decision making abilities and are unsuited for any position...
Trump is only worried about 1 thing; himself. He will literally and metaphorically throw anyone or anything under the bus to not just save his pathetic ass but for financial gain.
That will depend entirely on how many in the military remain loyal to the country and how many are loyal solely to trump.

President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
So you don‚Äôt believe in the fact that hospitals are attributing more cases for financial gain? If not that‚Äôs fine but in your opinion are blue states inflating numbers to hurt Trump? Honest question nothing behind it.

While I totally agree with the punishment mandated in federal code, the #democrats are actually hoping rioters are killed so they can blame Trump. That‚Äôs what this is about and it shows the EXTREME EVIL the Dems will go to to prevent indictments for their crimes against children
Yes and Donald Trump is dissing him and not attending the pomp and circumstance...My Mama always said "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".

Notice how right wing trump supporters never reply to any actual arguments but ignore them &amp; only provide weak rebuttals tothe few insignificant comments they think matter in the scheme of the entire argumentü§£ hes silent for what matters but only responds to the insults.Pathetic
We ought to be afraid based on all that has happen what is to become of this country if Trump does not get in. He has ego issues an opens mouth to often but he has kept things going in spite of what‚Äôs thrown at him. Socialism is where this is going if he is not elected

Donald Trump is the most despicable man to ever place his hand on a holy Bible to take an oath of any kind.
Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn‚Äôt want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis‚Äôs name! EVER!
Remember that time she called Trump supporters "a basket of deplorables"?  Remember when that turned out to be prophetically true?
Vote for who ever you want. Just remember that if you want Trump out of office that a vote for anyone other then Biden is a vote in Trumps favor. The Democratic party can not afford to split our vote. We know the Republican party won't be writing in celebrities.

Those of us who hope for Trump's defeat should keep up hope, but we should also have a Plan B. It is not impossible that we could end up with another 4 years of Trump and Mitch, which would make the last 4 years seem like a resort vacation by comparison. What will we do then?
And there is a "Walking Dead" vibe in our politics now that makes people fanatically devoted to Trump like the Night King and his army of frozen corpses.
Yes, Trump *could* lose, and Democrats *could* retake the Senate. But it ain't over till it's over.  Backing Biden right now makes me feel like "Weekend at Bernie's."

Agreed but he‚Äôs a Trump bootlicker so not much hope of that happening
Too bad, never going to happen. Within the next generation, they will be the only superpower left.  While we invest in war, they invest in AI, renewable energy, space exploration, and cutting-edge comms technology while Trump destroys every  global partnerships built after WWII.
Trump's America: - civil unrest  - record unemployment - record economic dive - corrupt administration officials convicted  - same officials pardoned - letting a pandemic run unabated - cowering to Russia - Russians taking out bounties on American troops
Here‚Äôs the thing - states are not listening to president stupid. Schools in north Texas and Houston aren‚Äôt opening. Schools in Indiana aren‚Äôt opening. Trump is a total buffoon and while he should have 0 credibility, whatever he does have is diminishing.
Donald Trump is too nice to Russia and Venezuela! When we get a real man, not an effenminent homo, in the office, he‚Äôll make sure those countries don‚Äôt fuck with America again!
all you have to do is look at how hard they fought when President Trump announced he was taking it. All countries that deal with malaria take HCQ and subsequently have hardly ANY reported cases. The Demoncraps and their LAPDOGS the Marxist Media fought because they KNOW IT WORKS
Anti-vax, Kardashians, and flat earth were probably the test cases to see how stupid Americans are, leading to Trump stealing the election. That worked well for Putin. Now the anti mask thing is proving we‚Äôre even dumber, opening the door to who knows what type of manipulation.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Yes. And I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôd do the same even if the Trump supporter is not elderly. You never know what might come from a simple act of kindness. And at the end of the day, I have to be true to myself.
Ok now do Trump.
The President has no lawful authority to move or stop the election.   However, when has the law ever been a deterrent for Trump.   IF Trump chose to ignore the law. e.g. order poll workers to stay home and/or send federal officers to turn people away, what would be our recourse?
The sad deflection ploy again.   ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs urging came on the heels of the release of dire new economic figures from the Commerce Department that shows that the U.S. economy shrank at a 33% annual rate in the April-June quarter, creating the worst quarterly plunge ever.‚Äù

Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.
It is clearly unfounded, over the line, and outrageous to suggest such a thing, basically accusing Trump of treason! At least according to one conservative writer.

You do understand Trump will only believe the election is fair if he wins right? In 2016 the popular vote was rigged, according to him, cuz 3m voted illegally. But, the electoral college win was the greatest ever.
It's getting easier with Trump, though. He's fixing to run us into bankruptcy, which is all he's good at.

"Trump was always going to be blamed for the coronavirus response" Well, when you're in charge of it and fail, it's not someone else's fault. No matter how much you refuse to take the blame. Also, Trump is ALSO using it as a political weapon, so don't think that's a 1-side thing
Everyone should remember to vote  out of office next time he runs. He‚Äôs a grown nosed, two faced jerk. He cares about himself and nothing more. Trump proved that.

Actually, I think they hate Trump (because they can't control him &amp; don't own him) AND America's founding principles.  What's more, Trump is trying the hardest of the 13 presidents in my lifetime (Ike to Trump) to get the govt back to its Constitutional foundations.  /1

Maybe Trump needs to officially rename it the Pelosi Virus. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense. It keeps hanging around. It absorbs tons of American resources that just disappear with no reward. And it has a lot of support in California and NY.
Perhaps Trump should have done more. It would have kept NY from sending all those infected ppl to nursing homes and they‚Äôd be alive today. Liberal governors wouldn‚Äôt still have states on lockdown. And violent rioters wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to spread Covid. Good points.

Got into a Facebook debate for the first time in a year or so with some middle-aged Trump supporters/conservatives and I am just hit all over again by now none of these people read. They get all of their news from TV. It‚Äôs absolutely bonkers to me.
I prefer Bernie's take to "Trump's new tone," when he has been undermining his own scientists and catering to his worst instincts. I don't think Dems (or anyone) need to affirm Trump for doing the bare minimum, and should criticize him for having been detrimental to the effort.

Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice

Aah - you took the blue pill.  Not very effective claims on a day Trump suggested delaying the election and falsely claimed that the country had universal mail-in elections (something other than absentee ballots). Sorry, can't return a "nice" try, your response is just a.... try.
If by hero "federal agents" you mean mercenary thugs sent by Trump, and if by "protecting federal property" you mean ASSAULTING VETERANS and Moms, then you'd be right and not embarrassingly full of shit. ...
Is trump the last person to realize that kushner is an idiot?
She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.

Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.
Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke.
I betcha Trump wishes he could do that opening pitch now and crack some joke about them beating dead birds.

Sorry, Ana.    You helped gaslight the country and are part of the reason we have Trump.  Lay out your path of understanding and remorse if you want credibility.   Until then your words are opportunistic and hollow.
Oh no, what shall we do now that one conservative dislikes Trump? A statement or tweet does not justify impeachment. Maybe if you could win fair and square you wouldn‚Äôt have to talk about impeachment. Also...no, I don‚Äôt want to join your Neo-Marxist fan club.
Recently he‚Äôs been more of a trump sycophant &amp; attorney. Deal with it.
He never kicked him out of Mir a Lago.  That is a story Trump says.  He said he was a great guy up until 2004 when Epstien outbid him on a building and got in trouble.  Just because Trump says it now does not mean its true.  He tried to get rid of Berman.

Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it‚Äôs worst than the other. There will never be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù politician. Bernie wasn‚Äôt either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process

Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.

Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.

(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.
(2) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump at fake briefing now drones his monotone script with (a) reduced freestyle BS; (b) fewer questions from press; &amp; (c) always calling on Sinclair/OAN minions.
(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He‚Äôs no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump‚Äôs
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!‚≠êÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚≠êÔ∏è
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y‚Äôall goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?

Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
Who said we were worrying about Trump's tweets? They're spot on.
lol.  no one believes your bullshit Rafael.  Energy costs to $65,000 lolol.  Your Donald Trump economy is in the toilet.  All the problems are happening on your watch.  Blaming future democrats for your problems is laughable.
Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
Watching  make Zuck feel uncomfortable never gets old. I wanna see her debate trump.

I don‚Äôt remember Will‚Äôs criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you‚Äôre right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that‚Äôs not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.

Prayers tonight for this to happen
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn‚Äôt exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don‚Äôt buy that he‚Äôd have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Trump and his Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain......
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump‚Äôs rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I‚Äôm not convinced Trump‚Äôs team can thwart it.

So your asking him to lose? He avoids Trump he wins by a landslide, he debates Trump and he loses and gets a ton of vids made of him like Jeb Bush did in 2016
So who‚Äôs fault is this? Was it because of pelosi who toured China town to say you and me that this virus is nothing? Or is it because trump who closed our nation for China?
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.

No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him

Big tech lies about suppression of conservatives and efficacy of Hydroxychloriquine, crickets.... Roger Stone broke no law, but uttered a trivial error in memory and FBI raids his house at 6am in the morning.  This is why Trump will/must win

President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
Like Ford. Can't wait to find out what happened to all that missing Trump inauguration money. Gonna get juicy when he's out of office!
Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump‚Äôs term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You‚Äôre all talk with no action.  Why hasn‚Äôt anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn‚Äôt like trump when McCain was alive but since then you‚Äôre playing good guy to trump. It‚Äôs obvious
How do we truly know it‚Äôs reporting correctly.... it could easily be that trump is lowering the numbers to ‚Äúmake‚Äù it look better... still cases in Tarrant county really haven‚Äôt trended down

#Realrepublicans stand up, and against Trump. He is a RUSSIAN pawn, and continues to tell LIES. Do not trust him. He is a disgrace.
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.

For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that‚Äôs cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples‚Äô lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn‚Äôt accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.

Hey occupant of the House chair...  You want school delayed. You want economic recovery delayed. You want hydroxychloroquine delayed. You want everything delayed.  Maybe President Trump is tight, let‚Äôs add the election to your list of delays.  ü§£
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ‚Öì on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
Bullshit Stop getting off the subject. You posted about what Trump supposedly did. I corrected you now you wanna talk about Obama. Every word you typed is an opinion. Whats your point genius
If you still support trump, not only are you showing your cards in terms of racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, sexism, transphobia &amp; MANY MORE systemically oppressed people... but you‚Äôre showing the world you‚Äôre intellectually challenged, willfully ignorant, &amp; a FUGLY DOUCHE.

I don't know who 2 direct this 2 but will we someday see a "U.S. -vs- Trump Family" lawsuit? There is NO WAY they deserve the taxpayer supported services &amp; monies that are usually provided when an "official" leaves office.  Further, we should go after ALL of their assets. üóΩüí∞üá∫üá∏
If you don't like Trump, that's fine.  But don't call yourself a conservative if you are voting for the other side because given what they have openly showed us these past few months you would be voting for socialism and anarchy.
Wait until Spanky finds out that he really is a loser.
Trump sinking, rats jumping ship. Great Trump iceberg of undocumented Trump voters does not exist.
Give me one good reason why Trump would ever go to pay respect to someone who didn't respect him. JL refused to attend Trump's inauguration, And then all he wanted to do is impeach the President on a Hoax. If you were Trump Bob, would you go to an event to only get a coldshoulder
#DemonSpawn #TrumpImps By the way, you put politics ahead of the American people.  Your actions killed Americans.  Your compromising ethics to serve Trump, no matter the excuse, KILLED AMERICANS!

Some actually think Trump is more articulate. No rational person can look at Obama and thinks he can't actaully speak intelligently without the aid of a teleprompter.

Trump will go down in history as the world‚Äôs greatest mass murders in the history of the world.  Fact.152,000 dead and should not have died.
Trump killed #HermanCain . Everything he touches dies.
Trump has only one thing left. To stoke racial fear. Fear is what led to the Confederacy, the Klan, Jim Crow &amp; Nazism  But it was hope, unity and human decency that defeated those fears which are now remembered in history as cowardice &amp; evil  Trumpfedercy is next #SaveAmerica
üôÑ Obama is the reason Trump got elected. People hated BO‚Äôs attitude,behavior and policies so bad they were willing to take a chance on Trump. BO acted like a petulant child numerous times when he didn‚Äôt get his way

We are already not worried, Mr. President  about you. Just afraid Mr. Trump will use DOJ to coup d'etat democracy itself come November, and the so-called Republicans will STILL do nothing. After today, we are terrified. How to prevent?

Ad hominem attacks, how surprising. So the people who listen to a liar like Trump are woke and the people listening to reputable sources of info are sheep, huh? No wonder Trump loves the uneducated.

Idk im not for him. But Obama during his term deported thousands more than trump. And the ice facilities the way they are now is because of Obama. Not to mention Obama bombed countries left and right. Trump is brining light to the child trafficking pandemic and this is
Bless his Heart!! Fuck Trump!
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
You have no foreign policy experience.  Your motives are selfish.  You are only opposed because in your fantasy you think opposing Trump makes you a hero.  You‚Äôre not...you‚Äôre a fraud.

FRIENDLY REMINDER: If Trump cancelled the election, Nancy Pelosi does not automatically become president on January 20th. House of Representatives would be vacant come January 3rd, thusly on Jan. 20th there would technically be NO speaker of the house to assume the presidency.
Cancelling/Postponing the election will not only end in a constitutional crisis, but I don't think Trump understands that the constitution holds that at Noon on January 20th, both him and Pence will be jobless if the election has not yet taken place.
We will vote and we will vote Trump, right Joe?
Wouldn't be great if they brought back  for one final episode where they surrounded the White House and dragged out a half-shaven Donald Trump in a wife beater and pajama bottoms and the last you saw of him was the in the back of the squad car with the closing credits?

I'm going to miss when the Trump presidency is over and every expert he hired seems like they were the 50th caller to a radio station that morning.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
You are the actual disaster. The trump virus cannot be cured with your vile tweets.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on!
Trump wants it
Herman Cain is dead from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally without a mask... I spot 8 other black Republicans next to him. One was smart enough to wear a mask the rest think Trump is their god.   Stop politicizing Covid19 Black people, your lives matter!
But... why didn‚Äôt Trump give him his Hydroxychloroquine
He went to a Trump Rally without a mask and got Covid19 how is this BLM fault
Wait he died from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally üëÄ I wonder what excuse Trump will have this time... last time he said his friend should have lost weight
It would seem this experiment would Trump AG Barr opinion wouldn't it?

Our party never had balls. Trump was the one who forced is to start growing them.
If you listen 2 Mary Trump's Interview &amp; read her book it speaks volumes of what a mad man we have in our Oval Office. It's crystal clear he's lying about the Bounty to protect Putin. Without ? Trump is THE biggest TRAITOR this country has seen in a long time.
Every time U get caught with your pants down U ALWAYS USE "A lot of People are Saying" YET we NEVER hear who these people are. It's a PATTERN-CHECK OUT TRUMP'S RECORD 2 PROTECT PUTIN:  #Helsinki #Kurds #Bounty #Germany INTENTIONALLY Endangers Allies-OUR Troops!
It boggles the mind ANY AMERICAN will even bother 2 listen 2 a Pathological LIAR over what Scientists &amp; Doctors have told us over and over. If Trump is talking about the virus just turn your TV off, quit listening 2 someone who's ALWAYS WRONG! Don't allow him 2 make U a statistic
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE
How did he betray them on trade or immigration? Words have meaning,.. explain?  Who do you propose we put in office? Are you voting for Senseless Joe, he doesn't even know the day, the year or where he is.  What is your better plan? Grow up and stop your bitching, we need Trump.
Trump releases all his convicted friends so they don‚Äôt snitch on him. This administration is loaded with crooks and it‚Äôs only obvious to people w good common sense. It‚Äôs a shame what Donald has done to his bleach drunk supporters.
Democrats are the only ones who can fix back what you‚Äôve destroyed. Republicans always do a terrible job when in control of office. Trump destroyed this country trying to undo everything Obama built. Crime boss bunker boy Trump is no good for Americans.  #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots
Nope, just telling the truth. The truth hurts  doesn‚Äôt it. Mr. Trump
Shoot  why not sooner if it's so important?  How long have you had the authority to do this?  One would think that it would have been done long ago unless this is a purely political move.  I'm not a Trump supporter so not saying it has anything to do with him.
It is so funny to read the apologists' comments about why this hasn't been done sooner.  My favorites are, "it's Trump's fault that Nancy didn't use her authority sooner".  You guys crack me up!

This is about as clear as it gets why we need President Trump out of office mostly from his own mouth and tweets! My personal opinion.
Sure build one next to a Trump Tower!!

I see a lot of rage on Twitter, a lot of frustration, a lot of sarcasm and cutting remarks from my Bernie brothers and sisters. But what I don‚Äôt see is a viable plan, solution or alternative to letting Trump remain president for another 4 years...
Ok. What do we do? We vote Trump? Is that the change we want to see? Or we don‚Äôt vote? And Trump wins? Or we write in Bernie..anddddd Trump wins?
Bernie hasn‚Äôt ‚Äòcheated‚Äô on anyone. He ran a strong campaign, but SC and the American voter decided that getting rid of Trump was more likely with Biden as the nominee. Everything we hate about the Demstablishment is way way worse under Trump, so, we prioritize. That‚Äôs real life..
The BDN is going to put up a fight to get the platform changed; they may or may not succeed. But I‚Äôd ask you folks out there, who claim loyalty to Bernie but don‚Äôt trust his decisions when he makes them; Would y‚Äôall rather 4 more years of Trump? Politics= patience and compromise.

Across the board...If Trump loses in November, then Covid will be gone in February. If Trump wins, then Covid will still be here because there‚Äôs ‚Äúalways a reason to blame Trump‚Äù when he‚Äôs been touting HQC all along.

They're working together. Trump was necessary to advance goals quickly before the 70-90 year old Zionist boomer crowd with all the money and political clout dies off. Biden isna bigger Zionist than Trump, he's made Christian congressmen calling themselves "Zionist" a whole thing.
Was thinking more about the attitude of texans toward trump.  Texas is(I hope still)among the friendliest states
Oh someone‚Äôs gone bye bye, but it‚Äôs not Trump you lunatic
Anyone notice with everything happening Jared is hiding deep in the bunker, or deep somewhere?  We haven't heard a peep. Amazing a 30+ year old FAILED SENIOR ADVISOR is what Trump banked ALL of his Presidency on. #famil
Trump's Track Record tells U everything U need 2 know that he has no idea of how 2 lead a laundry mat. Meanwhile he wants to put our Teachers-Children in Jeopardy-open up country when California-Arizona-Texas-Florida are out of control.

Also, Trump was the one who sent the feds, who perpetrated the violence in Portland. The protesters were peaceful until the feds wanted them to leave because there were so many people. The people did not want to leave, so the feds use violent force and tear gas to get rid of them
Trump is like being on a cruise ship and hitting that last buffet before you have to get off the ship.  Playing all that free tax payer golf.
Maybe the Trump guy on the corner.
