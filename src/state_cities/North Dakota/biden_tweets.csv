I had a feeling she wouldn't vote Biden, despite how much she says she doesn't like Trump. Now she's setting up her reason, just like Trump saying the election will be rigged. She's still party over country. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.

If you lived through the Bushes and John McCain's Presidential campaign, you know being in politics for ages doesn't mean you're a smooth communicator.  Or why do you think Joe Biden, who has been in national politics since the 1970s, is being kept away from the spotlight?
I'm the farthest thing from a trump simp but idk man I still think he's got a good chance of winning I've pretty much been a doomer since February tho so take what I say with a g of salt   If there are no debates where Biden can fuck it up then Bcould win. I don't think otherwise

My IDGAF what you think opinion--  The 1994 Crime bill was a good bill and was a driving force in reducing crime in this country. Biden can take credit, whatever, doesn't change the fact. For all of you thinking crime is bad now, the 80s &amp; 90s are calling and would like a word.
Biden already released his. Where's Trump's?
Well I mean trump thinks he‚Äôs god and Biden wants to take his job so in his mind taking his job means hurting god.

Dude, Trump is like 2 1/2 years younger. I‚Äôm not gonna worry about it. What Biden has going for him, however, is that he‚Äôs not a fascist piece of shit.
Said it before, Biden is 78 and grew up in a totally different era about civil rights/racial attitudes. What society thinks is racist now was normal for him. He may have "evolved" but some things are ingrained in his psyche
Biden is a 78 yr old man that grew up in a totally different atmosphere and attitudes towards race and he is also from a State bordering Dixie. Pretty sure this is who he is and the apology is not
I was gonna let Biden slide on hurting the Bible but then he went too far, even for this atheist, and hurt God.

Assuming that Trump and Biden do debate Trump will initially trounce Biden and at some point Biden will crumble and may even break down and cry.  It is at that point that Trump must be merciful.

You can view it how you want, but Joe Biden is still a horrible candidate.  I predict record low voter turn out, and a debacle, ie: Bush vs. Gore 2000.
I don't have money to gamble, but if i did, I'd say yeah Biden wins.  Not because he's good, but because of other factors, mainly Corona virus.
I did vote for him....but I don't see the enthusiasm that I did in 2016. Being real,  not being a sycophant.  Joe Biden sucks. I'm not voting for either. Give me a good 3rd party candidate, but that won't happen.

You won't be laughing when Biden wins.    and before you call me a "libtard", I voted for Trump and I support a lot of his policies, ie: 2nd amendment, lower taxes, less govt restrictions.  Unfortunately, his schtick got old a while ago.  The support is gone.

Joe Biden is a mental GIANT compared to ant brain djtrump.
Biden should refuse to debate Trump.   How can you debate someone who lies constantly and refuses to engage in any reasonable or coherent dialogue..  Biden should just stay on his own course of rebuttal to Trumps BS and provide direct feedback to honest journalists.
If Biden won't give Trump 3 debates, then I see 3 big rally's in Trumps future. MAGA!
What exactly do you think is gonna happen with Trump out of office? Do you think Biden is gonna usher in the new wave of progressive leaders? Suddenly shift to supporting M4A? Bring these corporations in line who‚Äôve been stealing profits made off the backs of Americans forever?
If I had to pick someone, it would be Nina. I like her a lot in terms of what she did for Bernard and she‚Äôs nice to listen to talk.   All that being said, Biden is still a garbage candidate and even with the best possible VP pick he‚Äôs still not inspiring any confidence in me.
I‚Äôm sick of hearing how Trump is an existential threat, but nothing material has changed from before he was elected. What do they think is gonna happen after 1 term with flaccid tap water Joe Biden? [2/2]
tbh no not really. I was also being mostly sarcastic and didn‚Äôt mean anything personally towards you. But the sentiment you were expressing isn‚Äôt all that uncommon among Biden/Blue No Matter Who types.

The Repubs know Trump Will lose. The are trying to make the road for Biden worse!
If Trump comes across too unhinged it would hurt him. Biden has to be concerned about trump not giving a Shit &amp; being on crazed attack mode the entire debate. However, if Joe is calm and comes across as Presidential, a debate would help him. We know trump can't be Presidential!

I would, but I'm afraid my co-workers may do something to my car lol. Pretty sure I'm the only one voting Biden where I work. Dreading to hear all the bitching tomorrow too. I need a new job, anyone hiring in a warmer state? ü§™

Since Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, and Karen Bass have been discussed, if Biden is elected with one of them:  Harris or Bass would be just the second VP born west of Stonewall, TX (error in my original tweet) after Nixon. Susan Rice would be the second VP born in DC (Gore).
Re-upping this since we are in the middle of the Veepstakes for Joe Biden right now. Birthplaces of Vice Presidents. Strong preference for swings states (which NY once was) and also the state of Vermont.

I feel like you didn't read my response since I'm saying I'm not even convinced Biden/Harris is progress if all they do is bring the Dem party to the right; Mass incarceration, pot criminalized, still ICE, no univ healthcare, etc. It's gunna be BS ID politics. Hope I'm wrong.
it would actually slap if Biden could be construed as a socialist in any meaningful way
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have nothing to run on except being for law breakers at the expense of the law abiding

Normally I'm not againsts masks but this coming from Biden? No.
no, what happens in 2024 after a Biden win is that the dems go "oh, that worked" and run another conservative.  and we're *getting* four years of GOP, if not in 2021 then relatively soon. if your strategy is "win every time and change nothing", that's bound to fail eventually

Biden is responsible for a lot of hardline criminal justice policies that targeted people of color. He's a VERY oldschool democrat. He's no Strom Thurmond that's for sure but he's not what we're looking for progressively. I'll just tell people i'm voting for Harris.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
I assume you're donating all the profits to the Biden/Harris campaign.
C'mon already. I can't stand the fake judge, but she's obviously echoing Fox's lame talking points about Biden not being healthy/fit for office here.   Can we stop being outraged by the worst bad-faith interpretations of EVERYTHING?!
Biden's campaign is incoherent nonsense.  He's holding a knife to stab religious in the back if elected.
also lots of trump signs obviously but i just mean that in the places where you might think you'd see a biden sign, you didn't

Joe Biden eats little boys , prove me wrong

Cancel Biden!
I disagree. It's the moderates and independents that are going to decide this election and getting as many Republicans as possible to disavow Trump is the best way to get their vote. AOC supporters are voting for Biden anyway except for the few Bernie whiners who are sitting out.

It pretty obvious who we‚Äôre forced to vote for at this point but people are allowed to air their legitimate grievances with the candidate that‚Äôs been forced upon us. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to try to shut down how people feel about Biden.

Pretty simple, Biden and Harris are spend spend spend, open borders, they are both against fracking and cheap energy.   Both are for higher taxes.  Also both are phonies.  Their policies have done nothing to help minorities and Trump has.  Biden has done nada for 40yrs
what actual alternative is there to Biden though, i don't want to vote for the guy but i just see a bad choice and a worse one
Some things, not everything, will get better if Biden wins. Nothing will get better if we give up and let Trump win.

Yes but, if you vote for Biden and live somewhere like California where he's  guaranteed to win, you won't be doing much. But if enough people vote third party, we may see one party adopt their values. This isn't as good as getting a third party president, but it's something.

Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
It's an important and valid question. Joe Biden admitted he probably wouldn't live until the end of his first term. #KamalaHarrisVP #JoeBiden2020
Bill.   What happened to you?    Debates show the difference in policy.  Thinking on your feet.  How you handle pressure.   Only reason you made this idiotic post is yku know Biden would embarrass himself like he did in the Democratic debates and he‚Äôs a lot farther gone now
Wow, nothing slanted here from the ‚Äúimpartial media‚Äù. She actually says, that it‚Äôs likely that Biden won‚Äôt be able to fulfill his term. That‚Äôs where we are? The left is going to vote for a guy that isn‚Äôt going to make it 4 years and will be replaced with a failed candidate.

Well now we know for certain that the Democrats want alt-left wing evil. Harris is a pro-abortionist, and is also known for incarcerating many blacks. I have yet to hear anything positive about her or Biden.
For some strange reason I read your tweet as saying :‚ÄùHarris will blow Joe Biden.‚Äù Weird.
Along with the fact that she called out Joe Biden on his BS on national TV. also, she is the perfect VP to go against the party of "Law and Order" when those fucks wanna try to be like "she is too harsh in constitutes" when they have LITERALLY BEEN PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES
The turn around dialogue gets everyone farther from reality and the reality is BIDEN VS TRUMP. So, to me, while Biden is a fucking nightmare unto himself, tearing down anything anti üöΩ speaks for itself
During his time as Obama's VP, when did he ever show he was a "Uniter"? When did he ever express an appreciation for the local police forces? Didn't ANTIFA and BLM start their roots under the Obama/Biden administration? Biden is now a tool of the Socialist/Communist Left.

Biden could just as well have chosen Bernie, since he's adopted Bernie's agenda anyway. They could have made AOC an overlooking presence to secure the young commie vote.
If you're still playing the game that Kamala didn't call Biden a racist than you probably believe Joe had something to do with picking her as his running mate.
Biden just accurately conveyed the basic difference b/w strategy &amp; tactics, and while shocked I'm legit happy when any politician gets it correct.
Curious about Biden's Kamala Harris VP pick? See how she measures up on Rights For All.
Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American woman on a presidential ticket.
Kamala Harris basically called Biden a rapist and then Joe Biden offered her the vice presidency which she accepted. Huge sellout move on both ends and y‚Äôall are eating it up (even though most of you don‚Äôt know who Kamala Harris is) because she‚Äôs a black woman.
Not sure if Dr. Jill Biden can be Secretary.

You must not remember in 2016 when Trump was elected and all you liberals were crying and protesting because y‚Äôall are the losers and Biden will be defeated in November
There are too many supporters of trump that are capable of looking past the wrong things he does and either make things up or deny he does anything wrong.  And too many still are content with allowing these aggregious acts so long as it allows that darn Biden not to win.

Biden‚Äôs not gonna do anything because he won‚Äôt be president
Exactly why testing for H1N1 was suspended back in the Obama/Biden years.
People thinking Biden is gonna be President is pathetic.
So he is saying Biden is more active than him?
I knew I was going to like a Biden/Harris ticket, I did not know I would love it this much!
To my Christian followers, don't be fooled by "Catholic" Biden or "Baptist" Harris. You only have to take a look at Trump's history and track record to know that he is the candidate that Jesus would endorse.  #TrumpIsTheRealChristian #Jesus4Trump
Biden did not kill himself, just like Epstein
So your hoping Biden can‚Äôt for fill his duties as president due to cognitive deterioration? Hmmm...
Hopefully, with a new Biden/Harris ticket, we can start to tackle global warming...and keep it going into the future.
LIKE and RETWEET if you agree that Biden's choice of Kamala Harris just proves how desperate he is to win.
She sold out your race. Supporting her and Biden is a clown move.
I AM BEHIND YOU BIDEN/HARRIS 100%.
My personal preference for VP was  but today's announcement gave me the first bit of excitement I've felt toward this election/the Biden campaign.
Joe Biden has officially picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.   I can get behind this.
This looks like GREAT news for Trump! I'm assuming that the +7 Biden means that's how many Biden electoral votes have gone over to Trump, right? If so, that's fantastic!!  #goTrump #RedWave2020
I meant Biden. I'm talking about Biden.
JUST IN: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket. #Decision2020
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate and has started telling people close to him as he nears the most consequential announcement of his political career.
The presumptive Democratic nominee in this year‚Äôs presidential election has previously said he will choose a woman to be his running mate.
I hate Biden and the establishment Democrats so this isn't what you think it is. But I applaud your effort for trying. üòÜ
You might be surprised by Joe Biden's pick for VP, but you won't be as surprised as Joe Biden.
Exactly!! Why do men always get shut out of political discussions? It's time for us to take our power back!
In a 2011 op-ed, then-Vice President Joe Biden was extolling payroll tax cuts as "real money for real people," calling the cuts "extra money" that Americans "can use to help with bills...Biden wrote that payroll tax cuts will fuel the economy, "spurring growth and creating jobs."
HE KNOWS THAT. Of course he knows that. How much do you want to bet that most of Trump's supposed "gaffes" are just him really subtly poking fun at Biden not being all there?

I think trump is going to dump you as soon as Biden announces his VP. #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I think as soon as Biden announces his VP, trump is going to dump you and pick a real "wife" person to back him up.
Two hours Joe Biden won't waste while President.
If you want a good laugh just watch all of Biden‚Äôs speeches and interviews. Biden is a clown ü§°

Might be a bad comparison. Let‚Äôs ask Biden ‚Äúdaaaaabaaaaa hydroxicorawho compared to payroll rakes..... maybe aaaaa and in fact aaaaaaa, I better not say anything cause biyicle might fall with alligators in the aaaaaaaaaaa.....‚Äù never mind! üòÇ
You must be related to Biden.
WASHINGTON (AP) - US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.I guess I'm alright with Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate.   If I'm being completely honest though, she wasn't my first choice. I was hoping he'd pick Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I‚Äôm glad to report that this will cost her the 2024 election even if she wins with Biden. Time to start fighting for a strong progressive challenger is now!
Mother's not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris beat my meat, without a chaperone!
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts‚Äô predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
Everyone stay home so Joe Biden can go out and campaign. We need to do it for his health and his election chances. Be a patriot!
Our Country is Collapsing under Trump's Total LACK OF LEADERSHIP! If Biden loses, America DIES! (The man below Knows this is TRUE, but he will üî• burn this country Down to try to finish his Demolition of the USA!)
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum."
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Polls are wrong, Trump will beat Biden: Billionaire fund manager Gundlach | Fox Business
Kamala Harris has abandoned her integrity for a little bit of power.  A country ran by Biden/Harris is terrifying. üòØüòØ #Election2020
I think you miss spelled expansion. You meant depression right? And yes he did run the poor policies that Biden and Obama implemented into the ground.

Joe Biden should get Jon Lovitz to stand in for Donald Trump during debate practice,......in his Liar character of course!
Trump doesn‚Äôt need to spy or investigate Biden.... Ukraine already is!!üò≤üòâ
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
As VP nominee she has to get her own. Besides, I doubt she wants to be groped by Biden.
Woke up to your tweet about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden‚Äôs running mate. Was once told to think of the Boy George song, to pronounce her name correctly 1/2
Woke up to a tweet by Kara Goldin about Kamala Harris. She is now Biden‚Äôs running mate. Puts me in mind of the Boy George song ‚ÄòKama Kama Kama Kama Kama Chameleon‚Äô üé∂
You mean Erick Erickson wasn‚Äôt going to vote for Biden?
I hope they perp walk Trump off the stage at Biden's inaugural?
You're right, Trump/Biden is a throwback to Harding/Coolidge, except Harding was smarter and much less corrupt than Trump and Coolidge had more personality than Mikey.
And while VP debates rarely matter that much, this one, with Biden picking more of a successor than a typical Veep, demands a performance that far outclasses those that underscored her failed attempt at securing the Democratic nomination in the first place.
While she might well outperform him on the debate stage, this idea that she‚Äôll give him the ol‚Äô one-two ‚Äúas a prosecutor‚Äù is a stretch. It didn‚Äôt work against Warren, or Sanders, or Biden, or even Gabbard.
What it does show is that if Biden would win the real power would be in the shadows, not sure who it is but it‚Äôs not Harris.
This was my take no matter who Biden picked as VP.
Welcome to Joe Biden's America . . . .
"Ms. Harris, a pragmatic moderate....."
in 2019 you stated that you believe the victims of Joe Biden. Do you not believe them anymore or are you just immoral?
I just think she‚Äôs inappropriate for the position when her state is in chaos. If you think Biden &amp; Harris are the best the DNC can do then there‚Äôs an issue. üò≥
Whoohoo! Biden/Harris 2020! Great choice  Happy dancing about
Glad your happy...as a lifelong Democrat, I am so disappointed in Joe picking her. I will vote for Biden but later I refuse to vote for her...she will not bring this country together anymore than Trump has
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
So is Biden still a segregationist?

Jr. Your dad is mentally ill &amp; suffering from some form of dementia! I know you are being told to try to claim the same for Biden, but the Shit is not going to work! Your best bet is to lock your dad in his Furher bunker &amp; take his phone away. Tha Will Not happen!  #VoteRepubsOUT
Really disappointed in  . With clips of his speeches of him falling asleep and messing up words this is not what America needs. We need the Joe Biden that was VP of Obama not this guy I see all the time. I like Joe Biden but not like this.
I want to put up a Biden yard sign but honestly worry what kind of bullshit that might be inviting this year.
Anyone find it absolutely ridiculous that the media is whining about  doing a presser from his club and are totally ok without Biden not leaving his basement.  He still invited the entire press to be there and took more questions from the left media than others

Yes and the Biden tweets have yet again been deleted from Twitter.
Biden really leaning into the masculinity in his whole campaign. I hate it, but it's probably a lesson he learned from 2016.
