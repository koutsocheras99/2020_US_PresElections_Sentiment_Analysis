And Joe Biden for that matter
Did you guys know there’s a conspiracy theory that Biden will win the election and then just give the Presidency to his female running mate and lmao have these ppl ever met a rich white man before?
media: "but does Biden really feel bad about it???"  also media: yeah that sucks but Trump has violated so many laws since Saturday we can't actually form a story around this, sorry
Trump.   Biden laughed when other kids threw pennies at us and will testify to feeling kind of bad about it.  Trump is doubling down about queer-bashing being Constitutionally-protected free speech, including when my elementary-school bully slammed my head into a stopsign.
Kamala Harris is reportedly losing favorite status in the tumultuous Biden veepstakes. Here's why.  via  No to Harris
this article in politico mentions some extremely broad positions from her book

Biden is going to need a strong VP, and Harris is strong.
Former Obama foreign policy aide with Maine ties on Biden’s running mate list
it's so awesome that so many people are earnestly pinning their hopes on Biden
Biden doesn't even know what he wants for breakfast
Former Obama foreign policy aide with Maine ties on Biden’s running mate list
Biden isn’t humane ask millions of people in the middle east and those languishing in US prisons. He’s said he has zero empathy for the plight of the younger generations. The planet will continue to burn and the rich will still pillage. But he’s still better than Trump.
More Trouble for Biden as More Disgusting Tweets Are Found

Biden condones the murder of innocent babies!
He must’ve eaten a lot of mashed potatoes before that pathetic inauguration speech, because looks like baby Trump had really low energy! You will not get another 4 years out of us you diaper wearing, girdle harnessed waist, Orange faced MONSTER! BIDEN 2020🇺🇸
Hey there Diaper Don, did you know that eating mashed potatoes gives you low energy? You’re looking so tired and weak, maybe it’s time for the baby to take a little nappy nap🤷🏼‍♀️from your concerned BIDEN SUPPORTER!🇺🇸👊🏽
Can't wait for Biden's inauguration.
Him and Biden are actually the reason trump was voted in, keep that in mind
A vote for Biden is like eating a bowl of ?
Fair or not, Trumpkins will beat Biden to death with Benghazi etc. if he chooses Rice. Biden will lose a large chunk of the middle he's lined up. She's terrific, but select her for something else.
Biden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting  via  Screw Sanders the socialist- defeat his socialism- avoid his crew members- Americans don’t want a socialist-
LP doesn't want to join the Democratic party. They just want to get Biden elected. Frankly that's me too. I'm an independent, I'm not about to join the Democratic party any time soon. But I do very much want to see a President Biden.
“Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden,” ⁦ ⁦ ⁦
If they're goal is for the President to not be re-elected, then yes, politically it is to their advantage the Ds nominated Biden rather than Sanders. I follow many of the LP principals and they have been straightforward, tactically, Biden is the answer for a Trump defeat
what side are you on?  Biden missing something?   Why frame it that way.   You suck.
"Donald Trump will not be defeated without the votes of the progressive base, which now skews toward younger people of color and for which issues of social injustice are paramount."
You can’t change spots on a leopard Joe Biden did nothing for the American people Beijing in washington for 50 years and it won’t change if he should get elected  , same old story nothing from nothing leaves nothing.
Let’s get something straight ,Media and Joe Biden  reappropriating funds somewhere else is called defunding , unless it  is going to the Police.
How, exactly, is Biden, who has been a private citizen for the last 3.5 years, destroying the US fossil fuel industry?
I mean, could be either MAGA or blue MAGA. They're both notorious for it. But, she is a Biden supporter.
Well, I guess with court docs placing #BillClinton on the isle-o-child-rape, we're reasonably protected from a Hillary "Oh shit, Biden is senile we've got to do something" candidacy.
Something all Americans should know your Democratic Representatives sold out to China year’s ago starting with the Clinton ‘s and then again with the Obama administration s andif Joe Biden is elected it will continue to sell out Americans to China
I'm hoping for a Lakers-Celtics finals. Forget Biden. That's kind of nostalgia the nation needs right now
Biden doesn’t have any sort of plan for what he’s gonna do as president he’s just gonna say well I’m not trump and that’s his whole fucking campaign and YOU VOTED FOR IT IN THE PRIMARIES????
Cherry picked that so Biden is running up a ramp instead of going down it 😂 you need to change your username if you're gonna cherry pick and take things out of context. He never called Mexicans as a whole as rapists, he called ms13 that.
Or, for a change, they can blame Biden’s mess on Biden. And the rest of the “first do some harm” Democrats. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and the rest of us along with them. NO to both capitalist parties.
They are going to pivot to full-on "Joe Biden is a radical leftist who will destroy America and take all your freedoms."  I think it will be primarily lefty fear mongering, flavored with racist pandering.
He has adopted zero of Bernie’s policies...quite literally zero. And all of Bernies policies are supported by an overwhelming majority of the dem party and a solid majority of the American people. Biden better than Trump but he’s still a pawn of the oligarchs 🤷🏼‍♂️
The Democratic electorate seems to have already made that decision itself by nominating Biden and for a second time rejecting Sanders. Which in this election, if the goal is to defeat the current president, was the right choice.
This is such a pathetic argument to convince people to vote for anyone yet it's the only one that anyone has to vote for Biden. The uninspiring aura about him, the racism that drips out of his mouth, the decades of right-wing policy, the lack of even pandering to the left 👍
It’s funny reading peoples responses as though Biden even knows this was posted. He doesn’t know where his handlers keep the butterscotch pudding, never mind what Twitter is

Will Joe Biden make us safe?
The thing is, if Biden ends up making a more conventional VP choice like Harris/Whitmer, it probably won’t seem to have been that consequential, since a conventional VP wouldn’t end up doing much.  But those of us who ❤️ Warren would mourn the loss of what COULD HAVE BEEN.
Lindsey, I say this with complete sincerity; denounce  You were friends with  Join Biden and reunite the country. #AmericaOrTrump
Vote trump out. You know Biden and  Obama prolly talk weekly, right?
but but trump said biden was a commie marxist
I agree the criminals are hoping that Biden will be president so they can make more money the world leaders of China need Biden so they can tell the United States of America what to do❗️
She was my top pick for President. I wanted Biden out of the running, at least he'll surround himself with intelligent, competent people. I'm voting blue no matter who.
Yes Trump is a coward..my brother volunteered for Vietnam..we need to elect Joe Biden
I think if Trump wins, it will be a huge fraudulent election. Biden can never ever concede!
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
And he will incite his followers to violence. Biden is going to have to make it clear that if Trump/Barr order, or incite violence against the people that they will be held accountable.
I wouldn't hold my breath on that. Fully expect an aggressive effort to push (all-too-willing) colleges to return to Obama policies, &amp; surge of lawsuits as a result. One of the few policy issues on which Biden is a true believer rather than a weathervane.
Precisely--had predicted this as a likely loss for student after oral argument. (Case had some procedural problems as well.) Outcome a good reminder of how skeptically even liberal circuits have come to look at the assumptions underlying Biden's approach to this issue.
You have nothing to worry about. Biden will accept and you will be gone. It’s that simple. #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBiden2020 #DumpTrump2020
When did ambitious become a bad word. In every job I have ever had I always worked hard all while thinking about the next job for me. When Kamala does it, somehow how it’s bad. So sick of this sexist mentality in our country.
Hopefully he’ll lose so badly that when polls close on the west coast that puts Biden over 270.
Yell at Joe Biden to make him his first Supreme Court nominee. That’ll set some hairs afire.
It absolutely is, but if we don't elect Biden, there will never be a chance to raise it again. Can't fix the country if it burns down.
Biden Election Day is Nov 3. Per POTUS declaration, if you are voting for Trump, be at the polls early the week of Nov 10th. Pass it on.
Trump probably wants to do that but he can't because he has to handle the coronavirus. He seems very anti-China. Biden on the other hand wants to be allies with them and that cannot be.
Time to call out Hidin' Joe Biden for his lack of support for Law and Order.
It’s really a (sad) advantage Biden has: he’s allowed to be angry.

Someone just yelled “you’re probably voting for biden” at me because I told them I could put their issue in front of everyone else’s and that they have to allow the timeframe given.
May he Rest In Peace.  May his memory be a blessing to those who knew him. I hope his passing helps people who still call this pandemic a hoax think again. Were you equally offended at these tweets like “one less liberal politician” when Beau Biden passed away?

"Mark my words. I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held," Biden said at a virtual fundraiser in April...  ‘Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so’
True. But Biden's slogan is a play on MAGA. Build Back Better...🙄

Funny - he has video taken of current violence at protests claiming it's how it will be under Biden. It IS happening under Trump.
Thank god Biden is running, otherwise I’d have to vote for one of the foreign countries entering the race. Any of them over YOU!
Not if Biden picks a good VP and croaks. I'm holding firm to the Simpsons prophecy. =p
But she is a black woman. I thought they were the only savior to the country? Biden won't think your lies are true. So hush.
I mean, there's a pretty good chance the Republic won't survive another Trump term. It will definitely survive Biden. That's enough.
Is it too late for Biden to do the same
Biden is 78. Who cares?
Yes to all of this but I don't see what Harris does for the ticket. She struggled to connect with voters during her own campaign, she's from CA which Biden will win handily anyway and her history as a prosecutor will be a stumbling block.
Seriously? You need to get your shit together before you go to prison... #NobodyLikesTrump #Biden
I wonder what Hillary Clinton is going to feel when which every women is selected as Bidens running mate &amp; if Biden wins will be the FIRST WOMEN PRESIDENT. Biden will step down his last year of his Presidency so his VP will become President to show Americans she’s up to challenge
Totally understandable. AP has a GREAT section called AP Fact Check, that will break down a speech by Trump or Biden, or a claim from someone about COVID, and inform the reader of the ACTUAL facts of that topic, or their claim. I've learned a TON from that section.
If Biden takes the same test and passes, I will gladly also make fun of Trump
Even if you're a supporter, you must see by now that if Joe Biden was your uncle, the family would be discussing how to gently take away his car keys.
Stop I'm dying you're hysterical. Almost as delusional as Biden who doesn't know what year it is or where he is lol bye
No Biden isn’t the creepiest guy alive. Mr “grab them by the pussy” is far more creepy.
If you don’t vote for Biden,you’re not blind!
This is the ONLY way Biden can solve any problems! He is a worthless JOKE! All his time in office, what has he done for ANYONE except make his son, Hunter RICH!
The Joe Biden pitch. “Vote for me and you won’t have to think about these uncomfortable truths anymore”
One of the few bright spots of Biden picks Kamala will be her having to walk back the whole “I think Biden is a closet racist” remark. That will be fun
Martha did not say that. She randomly threw out her name as a possibility if she weren’t picked as VP.  That said, anyone else getting the willies over the Biden line-up? 4 years of shrill shrews? Sorry, there!s no emoji for slitting one’s throat.
See, I don't trust Biden to actually get behind those things. He can say anything he wants. His history shows that he's beholden to power and not to the people.
If there WILL be debates. Biden could never handle that! And perhaps Biden will show up somewhere, just not in the proper place because he gets lost all the time!
Oh Biden is in bed with the Chinese. If he wins, America will be RULED by the CCP!

You watch, if Biden is elected it will magically become just another virus.  Though the virus itself may be real, the reaction to it and the "crisis" it has created were "manufactured" to muddy the campaign for Trump.

A diversion...thinks he can pull away votes for Biden.
Yes! The beauty of putting Warren in the VP role is that it affords as much power as POTUS allows—GWB allowed Cheney huge power.  Biden would have to agree to the policy, but would prob be content to let Warren be the one pulling the levers of government to make it all happen.

While I suspect that if Biden won CD-2 (RCV or not) the presidential race would be pretty wrapped up, the legal wrangling if #MESEN comes down to RCV for a 50th or 51st seat could get pretty intense (though again there's already precedent there too).
Joe Biden: Democracy requires consensus; I will return the country to dignity and decency. Joe, make sure you clue in your Party.  (RECLAIMING MY TIME is the new grandstanding technique in the House that shut down AG Barr.)
Still lost why people think choosing Biden equates to "socialism". That's why we have political parties in the first place. In order for that #BS to come even close to true, Rep's would have to sit quietly on their asses and Dem's would have to ask for MUCH more. #BalanceOverTime
Real deal: Democrats had AG Barr under oath, but they couldn’t get past their political grandstanding and rudeness to ask a productive question. Yoh, Biden—no decency or dignity here.
Who is it going to be? Suspense is not my favorite thing.  Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
Yes Americans now finding out the truth about Democrats. Big plus for Trump - Biden needs to inform his party members to shut up &amp; be smart.

The Sunrise Movement is deeply critical of Biden and has been for a long time. They even QTed a joke ad about him a couple of weeks back. I'm not sure they're on board with him at all.
No one thinks Biden would leave federal police in a state where the state has asked them to leave.
Joe Biden is not going to leave military police in a state where the governor doesn't want them.
Actually Trump is the first president who openly supports LGBT and Biden is against gay marriage. It's 2020 dude, we're all Patriots regardless of who you love
committing political and financial suicide. Trump and Biden are not good choices to change the direction of this country.
Good to know Joe Biden considers women and minorities to be inferior and incapable.
Racist AND sexist.   The hard truth is women — and particularly women of color — have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country.
I think the issue is you think decrim=legalization. That’s incorrect. Decriminalization =\= legalization. Biden and I support what you want. Any state can decriminalize whenever they want. Legalization is for the industry. Decriminalization addresses the arrests issue.
I’ve said multiple times now I support decriminalization. That’s what Biden supports. He doesn’t support commercialization for the same reasons I don’t support it and have explained. He knows the industry would target poor and POC as alcohol and tobacco have.
Ready for President Joe Biden to help the nation mourn for what we have lost and celebrate the incomparable legacies of John Lewis, Toni Morrison and other extraordinary Americans.
As long as those supporters vote, the matter of enthusiasm doesn’t matter.  I’m not particularly jazzed about Biden but you bet your ass I’ll vote for him!
my son mentioned something about Biden being on board with legalization. I told him he was nuts. I don't know what he saw to say that.
Biden is not my first choice but I'm rooting for the Democrats. Unfortunately I live in NY so the only excitement here is whether or not the Democrats will hold on to the NYS Senate.

Why does the press reprint such drivel? More  useless answers; I am more interested in the followup questions that push this illiterate President for a literate response. Normalizing these answers is negligent. What would you ask Biden if he responded this way?

Biden nor Pelosi admitted Trump was right ; this is how Trump keeps people gaslighted and misinformed.
If we're looking at the same story (Politico), he said it to a Biden donor, who anonymously told the reporter. He should still be more disciplined, but I don't think he directly fed the story.

I don't think Klobuchar would have announced that she advised Biden to choose a woman of color if he did not bless that disclosure.
Great thread! I think Biden gets it, too, though his people are trying their darndest to get the media talking about other names so it makes news when it breaks.
I don't consider myself a Democrat, but since I'll be holding my breath and voting for Biden I want to see what the platform actually says.
Biden literally fought for segregation
How can someone who thinks this support Biden? Honest question. He signed the 1995 crime bill and more blacks were on food stamps and black unemployment was higher than the current administration.
minus the fact he was one of the first people to close off the borders with China and the clown joe biden called that xenophobic. Sleepy joe was actually arguing NOT to close the borders to China. Do you understand that?
If I was Biden’s team I wouldn’t let him do an interview with Wallace when he’s up 15+ nationally and 7-12+ in key swing states. Man is -1 in Texas while he’s in a basement he needs to stay the course n let Trump keep bumbling the covid response.
At the point I voted for Warren it was basically a vote for Biden and I was quite alright with that. I like Bernie but his campaign staff did not inspire confidence to say the least.
Why do you think Biden is even in this equation dominated by community organizers and community organizer-In-chief Obama?
That’s all you have. Pathetic. Because ALL you are capable of as an “Orange Man Bad” type is to use the Covid as a political weapon. Using Covid to detract from the OBVIOUS issue...which is your Biden guy is a dementia-ridden racist who’s track record MORE than supports that.
Biden is up by 7 points in North Carolina.  Texas and Georgia, we’re coming for you next.  Register and Vote,  supporters!!!
I've seen all this already. What I'm saying is actions speak louder. Trumps actions have far bettered minorities, women and LGBT more than Biden and Obama who have also said offensive things. Just giving you facts, what you do with them is up to you.
These are all actual quotes from Biden
And Biden is the best pick? Who's done more actions to oppress blacks? Who created the crime bill of 1995?  Is that really a reason to vote trump out?

Here’s the stock sector you want to be in if the Democrats sweep the November elections  we know Sanders &amp; his socialist politicians are dangerous. But the biggest evil that exist in DC Democrats yes Pelosi &amp; Schumer. Biden needs to get them to resign now.
It would require more than just a Biden presidency to undo the tax reform.
Duckworth was a headfake to keep everyone off the trail. IMO Biden’s been settled on Warren for weeks...
What does Rice give Biden aside from a woman of color? He doesn't need the foreign policy boost and I doubt he gets anything electorally. Shes' qualified to take over as Pres. if needed but that also describes Duckworth, Harris, and to a lesser extent, Demings.
Yeah, I'm on trump's email list - Biden is either a trojan horse or is himself an "extreme left liberal." So is Adam Schiff. And of course Pelosi. And even Schumer for fuck's sake.

Then you were never a republican. There's not one Biden policy that aligns with republican beliefs
Biden should hire that same actor to play a senior trying to get a coronavirus test in Trump's America.
I just gave you an entire list and I can add more. Give me 5 things Biden has done . If not sit down
Im waiting for someone to give me information on the accomplishments Biden has
They're planning on not accepting the results again when Biden loses. Projection
#Beware Biden(Obama) will use AFFH to grab taxes and local authority from the suburbs.
I hope Biden and his team are watching this  segment about the Latino vote.
In your analogy, I'm pretty sure pissing on your own stuff is ~not~ voting for Biden (even if you think he sucks).   That stench—in the form of losing the supreme court for a generation—just won't go away.
Trump was NOT silent on this matter. Or were you listening to Creepy Biden at the time?
Still waiting for Biden accomplishments, he should have an entire book since he's been in government for 50 years
In the you can’t make this shit up news of the day a woman wearing a swastika mask says “If you vote for Biden, you will be living in Nazi Germany”😂😂😂I kid you not she said this as they were stocking up on TP and cheese bills😂😂😂
e🅱️ic YASS Qween Nanyc Pelosi CLAPS Dongbalfd Drumpbf's CHEEKS while 😎 Cool Joe Biden hits that YAH YEET awesome DAB
Let’s see the reaction to a report that biden will “wait and see”. I bet it’s similar to how yoho was just passionate and aoc was a raging bitch
What!s your agenda? Do you believe Biden is going to steer the country on a path of optimism, growth and unity?
there will be whole days you won't think about Joe Biden, and for 4 years you'll never think "oh fuck will this President destroy our country?"
How can you tell? By how defensive she got. Plus the Biden 2020 in her bio. Biden helped orchestrate the Dems shift to the right through the DLC. Maureen just wants to believe really bad she's one of the good guys. Don't be like Maureen.
Over the last several months make no mistake democrats are beyond playing dirty for this election. Biden’s biggest problem isn’t Trump it’s Pelosi Schumer Sanders &amp; dem socialist. Eventually Americans will realize Trump is no worst than them.
shame that the conservative fever dream has this new standard where criminals have to announce their crimes and if they dont, then they're 100% innocent. meanwhile, you all are ready to execute biden's son for actual fake news
IF Biden is elected by illegal mail in ballots, America will have a protest that will knock all these so called peaceful protesters on their asses! You've been warned.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I think Jill Biden is complicit, Why does she allow this? He is no longer well, face it.  Do you want to be flotus that badly? Selfish and cruel
This also depends on the accomplishments  of the Dem establishment. A successful Biden and/or Harris presidency in the interim would really hurt her brand and her appeal to voters.
U're right Joe, we stand still with you.Never quit on US people, never quit on World population. America is for us and we are for America and for the World's welfare. Vote Biden equal to love yourself and others after. We are example of unity &amp; good life. In God we trust.
I predict if Biden is elected by some miracle, he won't last one year and his Vice President will take over. If Hillary were to become his running mate it wouldn't take a year for him to be dead.
This is true! Im voting for biden this november because its clear we aren't united as a country - but i  also hope biden isnt the democratic nomination next time around. We need an complete goverment system overhaul. Democrats or Republicans being a majority idnt working.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN. #ResistanceTaskForce
Biden is one if the reasons the protests are happening. And, you absolutely suck at this.
Dems must always just stick to these questions of the trumpist/putin party: President Obama/VP Biden had a pandemic plan in place and trump threw it out! 150,00+ Americans are dead and will die.WHY? putiin has a bounty on US troops and trump does nothing. WHY? ASK EVERY DAY!
We’d be in the good timeline if they’d let gravel annihilate Biden at the first debate like he wanted
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims
Conducted by the same polling agency that says Biden is up by 20 points
🤦‍♀️ Carlin didn't vote 🤦‍♀️ And he hated all of thr US government. He'd have hated Trump as much as Biden.
why would Joe Biden comment on the views of a local political candidate lmao
So what? People defend Biden, and Clinton, and Trump, and Kavanaugh, and Moore, and...  It doesn't mean it didn't happen.
Blacks have always been Biden’s strongest demographic, and he always had the strongest Black support of anyone in the primary, including Harris &amp; Booker. Also, Warren polls extremely well with Blacks, too—better than Harris/Abrams in most cases. He needs to shore up the *left.*
Yeah. Right up until January 20th when Trump takes the oath for his second term and everybody in the punditocracy agrees that Biden shouldn't have blown off campaigning in boat parades.
didn't biden say he would veto M4A
This is abuse. Elder abuse. How can anyone allow him to continue? He is clearly not of right mind. He is rapidly declining. #dementia #KAG2020 #Trump2020 #elderabuse
I thought so a couple of weeks ago, but Susan Rice could very well be the pick, as she’s exceptionally qualified, and she worked with Biden in the Obama administration.
Didn't you see the Fox News interview with Chris Wallace? The defund the police thing was totally debunked, totally  trump couldn't find it in the pact that Biden and sanders made
If China owns Biden and they're so evil why does trump do so much business with them?
Joe Biden is a spud.
Have you ever seen a Biden for President sign? Nope!
Drove through three states last week Not one Biden sign Now Trump signs are another story 😃
Boaters for Biden apparently have things to do
This analysis ( is more than a month old, but can't imagine trends have changed much.   Here are a few relevant takeaways:
True Biden has not delivered, he talks the talk, but can’t wAlk the walk, 49 yrs in politics has delivered absolutely nada , nothing for any American ,
That is hardly a ringing endorsement of Biden
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Fuck Biden an all em high powered (white supremacy) supporters an em😤🖕🏿
Fresh air and excersize is good for you. Maybe Biden should get out more too
I saw 3 homes yesterday with "Republican for Biden". Nice to see.
Or just take a poll.
Biden is already leading Fla and numerous other key states. Just because you dont see many Biden signs means nothing. Some Trump signs are from 2016,and most trump supporters are vocal about their support. Biden hasnt even chose a running mate yet.
He already is.
Biden is leading polls in Fla, and overall
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
lmao my uncle's like "if Biden wins, i'm buying a gun. it's gonna be complete lawlessness" dawg u live next to the Hamptons
So kanye is predicting Biden too.
Yes,a waste. Any vote not for Biden is helping Trump. Its an easy choice.  If you truly care about this country and your fellow  (wo)man..you vote for Biden. Its the only vote that is 100% anti-trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Neither will Biden but you can't handle the truth
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

If you don’t vote for Biden I can’t forgive you for helping Trump. It’s just so obvious he’s the only true beneficiary of third party votes.
Yes I will be It’s stupid not to don’t want Joe Biden in their he well ruin this whole country completely it won’t be America ever again: Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍
A vote for Biden is a vote for this guy  #WattersWorld
You can tell how guilty he is because there are so many MAGAts going bat shit crazy saying Joe Biden is a child molester. It seems that everything the right is guilty of Q anon is brainwashing them to think it’s all left. It’s sick!
❗️ thank God we have a real man for a president not a whiny little socialistic racist like Biden❗️
“This guy doesn’t have a clue about the middle class. He has no clue about what makes America great. Actually, he has no clue, period." ---Joe Biden on Trump, 2016 Democratic Convention
I thought the Biden campaign turned him down. He’s also been donating tens of millions to Covid relief. I’m no fan of his but I think he’s sincere in wanting Trump out, and wanting to help with Covid related issues. Ask Cuomo, see what he has to say about him
OH NO JOE! Biden Blames Trump for Avoiding “Intercourse with the World” ...  via
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
I think the protests will absolutely continue if Biden's elected. This is a revolution. It's the #ThirdIndustrialRevolution to save our biosphere.
Please stop. You are a bad businessman and you are doing more harm by taking votes away from Biden in our effort to beat the trash that is Trump.
Why yes I am going to vote for Joe Biden this November #YouGoJoe
Just for shitzNgiggles I'd ask for money and then vote Biden
Bro, relax. Biden’s not winning. Lol
America are these the politicians you want laughing at a sad pathetic elected official. We all want Biden to heal our nation, but these politicians of the democrats leave a lot to be desired.
We could honestly live in the timeline where Trump and Biden both bite it by November. Kanye Decade incoming
We agree Biden should be in jail like the rest of the criminals such as Hillary Clinton Obama and his cohorts who tried to overturn our government❗️
CV19 will kill less people than either Trump or Biden.
Ok, You need to know Mr. Trump that Obama and Biden were not in office when this virus appeared, FYI... it was ah you!  You can’t put ANY of this on them, it’s all on YOU!! Biden2020
Just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election –  via
Joe Biden Democrats are vetting all Black candidates for Veep Nominee - No Whites Allowed. How's that for "Inclusion," folks? These people are American nut jobs &amp; nobody should vote them into elective office, ever again‼️👀🇺🇸

Dont know who this guy is but we need more of him. I don't like biden persay and hope he dosent get the dem nomination in 4 years but nothing is worse than trump. We need more Republicans to flip. Its not anout endorsing joe biden but not standing for hatred.
Biden maybe doesn't do sound bites so well, but he is a team player! Not me, us! Hell yeah
Biden 53%-Trump 38%
A conversation between President O. and future President Biden is warming. Biden has Obama’s friendship and insight.
Ya biden will just inject you with forced vaccines and microchips made by bill gates. Nbd
Thanks for the shout out. Last day in Twitmo. Back in full follow, retweet, like mode sometime tomorrow. Appreciate the support. #FBR #StrongerTogether #resist
This is a big pick for VP. Strong consideration for  would be wise... In search for VP, Biden has known quantity in Susan Rice -
Yes, we need a fascist dictator because Biden isn’t progressive enough.
That's Biden's bear.
Never Biden. Trump who?
Trump NEEDS the eyes on himself. That’s what sets him apart from Biden, Dukakis, HW, and the rest.
Sure Biden said something dumb two days ago. And here comes Trump to say and do three even stupider things.
The only campaign ads I see for Biden are from the three Maine news stations.  Shilling at no charge.
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
I was born in the wrong generation. Take me back to when Joe Biden offered to double my Bitcoin
Way to go Amy, get together with some other feckless leaders, rub their backs, massage each other’s clits and talk about your big plans.  The plans that don’t work.  Biden the diaper-wearing-dementia patient has been in govt for almost 50yrs.  Now he’s going to fix things?
Even the heaven has chose Biden.God is with Biden as we, all of us are standing on his side.  Let us vote for Biden, together we reinforce 🇺🇸 in joy and prosperity. Keep going on Joe. Strengthen the American pillars. We love you.
Just told my Dad that T*^mp is a pedophile &amp; accused of r*pe... he asked me what about Biden and the weird kissing... and yeah but come on dude!?! (I’m trying here folks)
I love The Reid Out with Joy🥰better than repeats of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy 😜 VOTING BIDEN 2020🇺🇸👍🏻
Wanna compare this w/ Biden interviews?
Joe Biden calls Trump the country's 'first' racist president  via  Joe really a low blow. Be tough not cheap shots. More importantly stay away from socialism.
I live in southern Maine... see tones of trump signs and flags.... have only seen 2 Biden signs and one bumper sticker.... me and the kids have been counting! And where I’m at is all liberal 🤣🤣🤣
Biden needs to tell that useless pos that there’s NOTHING to debate!!  Trump’s incompetence has been in full display for 3.5 years!!  No disputes to be debated! #VOTEDROPBOXES
He couldn’t he was busy lining up with Soros ,Clinton and the mop, to start the next chapter of deceit,rioting and dividing did you think the Russian hoax was the end of it it goes on till he has control thru Joe Biden
Schumer really. Schumer in the previous stimulus bills democrats gave the Kennedy Center &amp; Museums millions of millions of dollars &amp; in return the KC donated 5 millions dollars to the DNC. Biden’s biggest problem is the 2 Democratic leaders of the Senate &amp; House. Both wackos.
A vote for Creepy Joe Biden will cost you your home in the suburbs!
For me it depends on how they treat others who are not voting Biden. There is one I can think of immediately who is being an absolute ass to everyone.
More map envy
I saw people who support Biden and Kennedy saying they're Marxists and telling actual Marxists to read theory. They're co-opting everything.
And here’s the other thing: what do you have to lose? At this point, the president will either be biden or trump. If you wanted a different outcome, you needed to work for a different outcome. But there’s no time to mope about it now.
No one is saying that a biden administration will come with no new fires. No one is saying that a biden administration will fix any original fires. But it’s a hell of a lot easier to get at the root of the cause if we’re not swamped by endless limbs.
Recently, mainstream national politics have become increasingly conservative in a desperate game of white-comfort-keep-up. And now here we are, in a locked and loaded two party system with the option of trump or biden.
I’ve heard a lot of “but voting for biden won’t change anything!!” lately, and yeah you’re absolutely right. For years, Democrats and Republicans were becoming increasingly centrist in order to continue to exist in our current political system and cater to white people.
Looks like Trump campaign brilliant idea to constantly bring up Biden’s mental capacity is working out so well for them.
What’s becoming sad - Biden leaning toward socialism. America defeat any socialist running this election. We need to stay as a democracy.
Question asked because of this poll, which allegedly found that 50% of self-described "strong liberals" think employees should be fired for donating to Trump, and 36% of "strong conservaitves" feel the same way about Biden donors.
I would bet money that if Biden’s team wanted to have a sit down interview with Dave or Big Cat, they’d take it. It’s the President of the United States, you don’t say no to that.
I don’t think he will have any choice. If not today then after Vice President Biden becomes the 46th president. You can watch from your prison cell. Or Russia. Your choice, for now. #ResignNowTrump
Joe Biden ,and the Dems ,are in Bed with the Chinese Government , and he is not fit or cognate to be President.
Can’t be true, I heard Biden is working on the formula in his basement
Joe Biden wants to address health care disparities, toughen gun control, overhaul policing, provide free community college, erase student loan debt, invest in green energy and improve the nation's infrastructure.
I do not care of the Veep stakes at all, I have woman I like better than others for VP (and future President) but the nation is on fire, the only moral choice is to vote for Biden no matter who the VP is, he could pick Gabbard and I'd still vote for him.
What this country sorely needs now is a leader with compassion and empathy. One who speaks with an honesty that people trust. One who hasn’t lied over 18,000 times. Biden is in fact the very best candidate for these harsh times.
Biden talks like a gangster acts like and is a bigger racist then people know , king of what gangssters call the shakedown
Biden your right we need a President that’s accountable ,and productive ,and thinks of American people first, but it’s not you , it’s the one we have now . Vote for President Trump
Biden let’s not talk about empathy ,you are the most unauthentic person running for the Presidency , You never tell the truth ,all you do is talk marlarky ,you know Joe ,your the biggest shovel of BS .
Repeat after me: “PRESIDENT BIDEN”
This is just sad and wrong!!I can put all the fact but the first step act and record unemployment is huge and more then any other president itself.He donated money to black specific programs to Sharpton before president!!Biden said real racist things,trump didn’t!!
Waiting for what?Oh the facts are all there you can find them yourself.But he done more for black before president then Biden ever done!wake up and educate and you’ll see the truth.I have something real good people need to see,gotta find it.This is all sad and wrong!!
I hate it when MSM tries to paint #Biden as some "empathetic" and sweet caring old man. He has an extremely short fuse and is easily angered. Dude needs meds ASAP
They say America has seldom been more divided than it is today. If true, everyone stands to be called upon to take a side. I'm with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I'm with Colin Kaepernick. I'm with Anthony Fauci. I'm with Barack and Michelle Obama. I'm with Joe Biden.
Indeed. And now Trump buried the bar six feet under the ground for Biden. He can’t even trip over it.  What a buffoon.
I mean... can we bring up the 94 crime bill? At this point I smell blood and seeing Joe Biden lead Trump in humiliating fashion is enjoyable. But Biden has a very questionable history himself.
A-Rod's sleeper presidential picks are the incumbent and Biden.
The question is... would Biden pass ?
Could this be the same outfit who had HRC in the White House and has Biden ahead by 11 points? The figures quoted are absurd. Take a walk around and come back with the 75% of mask wearers you see.
Biden's even up in Ohio ...
Biden is going to be better than you expect.
HELLO...this is tRump’s    America not Biden’s ...he made this by never addressing the problem of Police profiling and letting it fester till no one could support it any longer.
The five words Biden should run on.  Trumps policies will kill you  They have killed almost 150,000 to date  #RidinWithBiden2020  #FAM46
We need and we shall vote for Biden.Let us vote for Biden and we close the case.
Yes we need Biden
This just aired on NBC Nightly News, and it's terrific. IMO this should be the template for the vast majority of Joe's ads. He's really good at empathy/normalcy.  ---&gt; Truth :60 | Joe Biden For President 2020  via
Honks for Biden!!!
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS  #FoxNews- Biden is now walking with socialist- he will lose the election. Biden even for you that was a low blow calling Trump a racist.
“Breaking News: President Trump said that he had canceled the portion of the Republican National Convention slated for Jacksonville, Fla., citing the virus,” ⁦
Biden won’t win 🙃
No, Biden will take away homes in the suburbs and "restructure" them. Didn't you listen to any of Biden's latest platform? Or are you so blinded by hatred that you don't care about any of it? How will YOU deal with socialism? Communism? Let's see how you deal with that.
the democrats deadass looked at joe biden and said “yeah he’s a better candidate than bernie”
According to CBS News Biden's lead has grown so much that he's going to get 100% of the vote.
You lick establishment boots, my dear. If you vote for Biden, you're voting for a modern architect of the prison industrial complex and are on the side of the authoritariana on the right who justify every horrible action of the police.
As Biden's lead over Trump grows, enthusiasm from Black voters still falls short:

Joe Biden and Michelle Obama 2020
Is this a movie portraying what like would be in a Biden America? I mean you wouldn’t possibly imply something that’s literally happening now in this presidency to one that hasn’t happened yet and calling the one that hasn’t happened yet bad? Right? I mean that would be silly.
Obama and Biden were ,and still are the dividers of this country  ,and its never changed .Biden in his campaign is still dividing ,remember when he said if your black and your voting for the President then you ain’t black , that’s racist and dividing . Biden is a liar.
This is why I'm voting for Biden
I prefer that someone doesn't cherry pick to make something suit their definition. According to you sexual harassment can only happen in the work place. That's false.  Also, you're exactly like the Kavanaugh and Biden defenders. The rape culture thanks you for your support.
Cut in half and it is Biden up by 6.5%, which is outside the margin of error.
Can you explain how he does that ? Lowest unemployment, 1st time black owned businesses up 40%, didn’t happen under Obama. Tax cuts.. Biden who said he will raise your taxes. How about Biden’s comments about desegregation will cause his kids to grow in  a racial jungle ??
You can tell the GOP expects to lose. They’re already running their Blame Biden for Trump’s Mess narrative &amp; testing what will stick so they can take Congress in 2022.  That doesn’t mean you don’t have to vote. They expected to lose in 2016, too.
Just Biden my time until November...#Biden2020Landslide
Sorry, this is #tRump’s nightmare America that Vice President Biden is going to fix when he becomes president.
Even on Joe Biden's worst day, he is still much more intelligent and qualified to lead our country than the narcissistic, incompetent,  self tanning we have now!
"Rapid response" doesn't have to equal "first random Biden video I stumble on in my sweaty, desperate haze of mediocrity, incompetence, and flop sweat." Just FYI, tiger.
Right?!? I do not understand how showing footage of things that are actually happening while Trump is President is an effective threat against Biden 🤦‍♀️
❗️ That hypocrite is never been a conservative why would any person with a brain vote for a criminal like Biden❓
Except that’s exactly what they are. One of Biden’s first acts as President must be a commission on Crimes against humanity by the Trump administration, then hold them all accountable.
I get the feeling that Biden actually believes this. But I know a big part of this is that there is this weird culture of not accusing past presidents of, well…. anything really.
Joe Biden is releasing a video of his first in-person meeting with Barack Obama since the coronavirus outbreak began, enlisting the former president to help slam his successor's response to the pandemic.
This is literally all because of Trump. It has nothing to do with Biden.
#TrumpsDomesticTerrorism Trump's attempt to distract attention from his failed coronavirus response, shattered economy, #BLMprotests &amp; #Biden is more extreme than we imagined. To peacefully protest do we now need gas masks, helmets, shields to stop rubber bullets, leaf blowers?
