NARAL Endorses Biden, Says He'll 'Expand Access to Abortion,' Allow Taxpayer Funding of it - Michael Foust
Dems look at black ppl as “black” and not as “people”.  Ppl have their own minds, jobs, hopes, dreams, probs.  Biden doesn’t offer anything f/ppl.  He just wants us all to be wards of the govt.  His “unity plan” is anything but!  When I meet w/ppl, I don’t care what color they...
So what we saving it from?  The only thing i can figure is his disastrous presidency and even more disastrous handling of the pandemic.  I think maybe you spelled joe Biden's name wrong.  Cause he will save America from the mess that is Trump.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
not at all democrats like biden either. we just have to settle for him because it’s better than having trump

Now I know I am dealing with someone who is either too lazy or too stupid to get the facts.   I live in Vegas. Biden is a huge favorite. He’s also a huge favorite on Betfair (the largest betting exchange in the world - but you knew that).  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
I feel the same. I mean, Biden is 78! So I just assumed the VP pick would be groomed to be the next nominee. Not to mention Kamala was already vetted pretty well during the primaries.
Fake news.Stay off cnn and MSNBC is controlled by commies.Yall sheeple believe it and think joes a good guy.Trump is 10 times the man biden would or ever could be.Trump has put more pedifiles in jail than the past 4 presidents combined and that enough to get me &amp; my familys vote!
You DO realize that Biden HASN’T released a list of who he’s considering, RIGHT???  A lot of the name out there are Media speculation based on the fact that Biden has been seen with them!  I’m guessing it’s down to Demmings, Rice, and $hillary 2.0 aka Harri$!
I mean... I'm not a Christian, but I don't begrudge politicians speaking at Christian seminars.  Same with any religion, really.  Bass isn't my favorite candidate, but this isn't a big deal.
Biden has either. Neither have I now that I think about it. Tweet me on Nov 4th and we will see which of the two has still not lost one.
I believe Biden will ruin our country and we will be taken over. Heard of the NWO? That, of course, is in revelation and I believe it bc God tells us it will happen. Too many things the left is doing right now, line up with the end times

Not that Biden has a realistic chance of winning, but regardless, the criminal cult of Scientology CANNOT be allowed to infest the White House.   If you haven't yet, watch the documentary "Going Clear" and  "Scientology and the Aftermath" series.

Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week  Hell, that's all he's got to talk about and it is bull sh$$ too !!!!
Most of their followers are mindless. That's what they count on.
Oh please. You think Biden doesn’t already know about this crap? This is coming out because all the Veep camps are at war. Harris was never inevitable, neither is Bass or Rice or Demings or or or... no one knows s**t lol
Lots of vetting happening, is my guess. The last thing this election needs is a VP pick with serious skeletons in her closet. The Trump ops will do everything they can to discredit and dehumanize Biden’s VP. Any transgression will be amplified and weaponized.
Okay, imagine a White House with Biden and Pelosi? I shutter when either speak. They should go all-in and have her as VP! Can you imagine the conversations? Eeek!

If Biden turns around this mess and gets America out of the second Great Depression he will coast to re-election if he runs. If voters are so itching for a woman President why did Biden trounce all the female candidates in this primary?
yeah, and it's a list of like a dozen candidates. She's "gained traction" per this cnn article, but it doesn't necessarily consider her a favorite. Wordings murky, as I'm sure sources intended. They might be just testing the waters. I trust the campaign.
why are so many in my feed freaking out about this? He hasn't picked his VP candidate yet. She was speaking TO scientologists. It's a quack "religion," but let the #Biden campaign vet.
I find conservative news funny to plant their flag on the "Biden and Libels are wrong. The USA economy is not 35% like they say, it's only 10% down." I'm sorry, both numbers are shit. #conservativenews

I want Biden to be a great president, remain healthy and run for re-election in 2024. He’s never committed to this serve one term nonsense that so many of these ghoulish people on here are hoping for. Hoping the POTUS is incapacitated so the VP can take over isn’t a good look.
suddenly he turns into joe biden...lol
Lmao the Dems won’t even discuss Biden’s allegations
Fauci was in the same position under OBAMA/BIDEN  and I take it they had a CDC protocol back then. They obviously didn't follow it then if they waited 4+months after the WHO called it a pandemic. Stopped counting cases, didn't restock PPE and ventilators.  We didn't see him.
Juan In the latest likely voters polls Trump is very close to Biden AND CONSIDERING EIGHTY PERCENT OR SO TRUMP VOTERS AREN'T IN POLLS REALITY IS TRUMP IS WAY AHEAD
BLM (funded by the left) has already started taking away our freedom of speech. And Biden wants to take away our guns. 1st and 2nd ammendments. Our freedom is being taken, you just don’t care
It’s a typical true comment. You are voting based on how you FEEL about Trump, instead of what will happen to our country if lead by Biden. Nobody is voting for Biden bc they think he’ll be a good president, they are voting for him bc they hate Trump. That’s not a good reason
Opinions are great, we all have them, but the choice of whom he picks as VP running mate is strictly Joe Biden's. Let's please try to calm down on all the guesses and in-fighting among us, please?  I can wait a little while.
That’s the problem. I can predict exactly what will happen if Biden is elected. They will kick him out of office on account of his dementia, then we will be run by the radical left. Biden is just a puppet for them
Neither will Biden. How about abolishing #COVID19 ?
Let’s be real here: Biden doesn’t even do the tweeting. He doesn’t even know what Twitter is. He also won’t ever be President.
Biden needs a a diverse cabinet. Not just race and sex but idology. He needs centrist to progressive dems. Everyone will need to work together.   Remember the No drama Obama cabinet. Joe might be trying to recreate it. Anyone who does not play well with others should be avoided.
Needs a spark? Do you not realize everyone has been waiting months to vote Trump out? Get out of the DC bubble. Americans don’t care who the VP choice is. That’s why dems coalesced around Biden so quickly. The normal rules of politics are dead this year.
Joe Biden has grown on me now that I’ve seen him move

It will be all over for Biden when he’s announce VP.
She is dynamic. But in looking at longevity an party dynamics she will be either 75 or 79 when she made a Presidential run after Biden and that is too old. She will make a great cabinet member but I am not sure we want to possibly lose a Senate seat.

GREAT. Stick with that and those "polls". It will be a great comfort for you in November.  Yeah Hillary is dislikable but at least she was there, debating and holding her own.  Biden is ABSENT and not just absent-minded, he's literally HIDING or they're hiding him. 😂🤣🤣😆😂🤣😁

I honestly don’t give a single fuck about Biden VP pick because it will ultimately be someone who is against M4A.

He must have been tweeting his endorsement of Biden.
Trump is President . Correct. But the lineage is contextual. It’s contextual in campaign sense because Biden is running of of that 8 year legacy. If the very resume of the democratic front runner is going to have a history of hypocrisy…It’s probably worth mentioning in 2020 race

The very good  documentary about Alex Jones and his influence on Trump leads to the following question: is Trump struggling to beat Biden because of how much harder it is to start viral conspiracy theories about him?
Nonsense, of course. Unemployment went from 10%+ to 4% under Obama/Biden. SLIGHTLY worse with Trump. As in “Great Depression” worse. You really need to consider where we are right now, instead of before the pandemic. That was on Trumps watch.

“Joe Biden defunded the police while vice president, and nobody noticed it at the time.”  Sick burn.
Biden is Clinton's puppet.
Who y’all think Biden choosing as his VP?
Miami Vice? So you used the Delorean to go back to the 80's when Biden was still coherent and Kamala Harris had her mouth full of Willie Brown?  I know it's hard to watch the DNC/BLM/Antifa #ShitShow but THAT is who you are. #dealwithit #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020
Yes.. Biden 2020!
Hey I'm not the one who has to explain why Biden can't finish a sentence or why it's okay for thousands of people to shop Walmart, Target, etc. but we need MAIL IN BALLOTS (so the DNC can rig the election). That's all you bro.  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020Victory
Biden better investigate EVERY PENNY SPENT BY EVERYONE OF TRUMP ADMIN!
The censorship is at Biblical proportions now. A family member posted a meme of Bīdëñ holding Up a Trûmp sïgñ. Fåcëbøøk took the meme down for vîølation of their cömmûnity standards. Moreover we did a gōōglë search for the meme the search resulted in the opposite.
Poll: Donald Trump Leads Joe Biden by Two Points in North Carolina  via
Not to mention Joe Biden‘s hands are not gonna be flying all over in the front of the camera. How many times have millions of Americans wished Donald Trump‘s hands were handcuffed when he was giving some kind of a speech or a briefing or a press conference?
😂😂😂😂😂 There you go again still dwelling on previous conspiracy theories from 2016 and back. You obviously are huge Kool-Aid drinker because you don’t realize the same things that you were accusing Joe Biden, Trump has been very effectively being guilty of.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It “You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I”m President” .. YES PLEASE.  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
She'd have a better chance at this if we weren't at SHOCKING levels of unemployment  AND  If Obama/Biden hadn't guided us out of the Great Recession (caused by our last GOP president).  Man - GOP is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with these arguments.
Considering that Biden might pick Kamala Harris as VP which I think is likely and I predicted that for some time makes me want vote for him even less because I really am not a fan of her either  At times she's even more repulsive to me than Biden
How many lies do you hear in the new Joe Biden commercial. I see three. Bailed out bank's. Not Americans. Health care. The worst most corrupt in American history. Ebola. W.H.O.
We all feel the same Unfortunately Trump is just that bad because I'll be honest as much as ans long as been a democratic voter I've been my whole life it was between Joe Biden and a generic Republican who was moderate I wouldn't vote for either one
No I agree with  on this one   It's wishful thinking though but we're not gonna lie to ourselves about the reality For me a vote for Biden is just a vote against Trump nothing more nothing less
I guess I can say Biden even though he has terrible political instincts and terrible policies and half brain dead he is not a terrible human being like Hillary Clinton is but he is likely to pick Kamala Harris for VP a former prosecutor yuck these dem man terrible lol
Great and the sad truth is it's looking like Biden is going to pick Harris as VP and now that I know all this is gonna make it that much harder to have to vote for the lesser evil I do know Trump has go but dam how many more shits sandwiches and crows do I have to eat
This describes Biden’s handlers, the hidden people behind the curtain!
😂😂😂 Biden can choose Donald Duck and beat trump
I'd feel so owned if they boycotted the election and I was stuck with Biden. Man, don't even know how I'd handle that.
So now  wants a racist beta male as POTUS! You know, “you ain’t black if you don’t vote for me” Biden.
How many times did Biden lose a primary and he was selected to be VP? Bernie lost in 2016 and he still had a fan base. Why are you white men so baffled by this?
Yeah she turns off people like me. I hate Latin commies. They better not even consider her. I am still voting for Biden, but I know others that this would be a deal breaker
Call me not surprise Harris voted  against a cut in the Pentagon and military budgets she totally sucks she's a complete neoliberal corporatist and of course Biden will probably likely pick her as VP lol
Biden did condemn it 2 days ago
Dishonest Trump was able to distract the media from his horrible GDP numbers, 39% DROP IN GDP, highest in history!  The American people know, they're out of jobs!  President Biden has a huge task ahead of him.
I hate the "settle for biden" campaign.  Why settle when you can revolt?
? XD thank you for defending an old white male rapist, totally is going to change literally anything when biden gets elected, like the fact that I am still going to be without healthcare and I will still lose my rights as a queer person
🤣😂🤣😂Biden stealing the election😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣::::deep breath::::😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  Does Biden even know he’s in the election?
Racial injustice does NOT exist. It’s being broadcasted by fake news to get you to vote for Biden. Those that fall for it are idiots.
Biden is China’s best friend!
Man, more tightening and bad news for Biden. It's honestly getting to the point where Biden should just drop out.
"leftists" *has biden 2020 in bio*
stop biden is not going to be president. Trump might not be president either. Trillion percent biden won’t be president.hell he might not even be running by say end of September he will become ill or something the old bait and switch.
Anything Nina Turner is involved in creates division.  Biden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting  via
i agee lets get it over already before the dems. Can do their bait and switch or cheat.cause the biggest number in the universe is how much we no biden will not be president.
Good grief! My DOG would be better than Trump! He’s a lunatic! Not worried at all. Biden is respected &amp; savvy enough to surround himself with SMART staff and actually listen to them! And he’s going to have a top notch VP at his side. We’re going to be juuuuust fine. #Biden2020
Um, no. He can get 47% and Biden probably gets 51-52% and that's a blowout. This isn't 2016 with 3rd parties. He gets 46% and it's 2008 or worse on November 3rd.
Biden is promoting only Science research will stop the Virus. Atheist? When did Americans lose Faith in God as their savior? Democrats are bearing false witnesses as Christian's. I better not see one in church! LOL
Why hasn't Biden been tested for the virus yet? He's running around campaigning and he could be the one who's killing these Americans.
Presidential Election is FREEDOM vs SOCIALISM. It’s  who has kicked ass 4 ALL OF IS; or  who can’t complete sentences! RULE OF LAW vs DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA! Biden would allow Antifa, BLM, 2 run America! Murder everywhere?  is ONLY CHOICE
The other thing is Joe Biden is trying redo the same thing failed policies.Uncanny how their campaigns aren't much different.Maybe that's why Obama isn't campaining hard for Biden. He'd be a liability. It would be a reminder of Obama's administration. Oh,yeah Joe was there too!
Biden is a worse decease for our country than COVID. He would certainly kill it.
Three months ago Joe Biden predicted trump would try to delay the election.  At the time, trump said Joe was wrong.  #trumpFail #Biden2020

Biden is doing about as well as Hillary was doing in 2016. If memory serves, that went well for her.
And Biden said that Trump is the first racist president ever you're looking at the first one and the only one he's the one who divided our country for 8 f****** years and it's still divided because of his horseshit crap that he did.
I am so sorry for your loss. 😞 I know how painful it is to lose a parent. It's heart wrenching. However, Trump took action on a travel ban as soon as he found out &amp; Biden shamed him for it up until March said he was fear mongering. Now they're trying to say Biden never said that
If Trump had died during this presidency, we would have been stuck with Pence... That’s scarier than any left anything. Gay, trans and civil rights would be N/A. The 2020/Biden ticket is a gamble but so was 2016 and look where we are now.
Can someone tell me what Biden and Obama has done for the black community? How about Hispanic? Or immigrants? Military? VA? Police reform? I’m curious.

Maybe so, but a patriot supports our cntry. A patriot would never support illegally taking away our 1st and 2nd amendments. Supporting Biden, by default, supports taking away our constitutional rights. Little by little they will take more and more freedoms away

Biden HAS adopted many progressive policies but it's never enough for them. He's been working on policy w/Bernie and co. They're acting like he hasn't made any concessions. Biden's moved so far to the left that he lost important endorsements. He needs to stop courting berners.
Cal Thomas: Biden’s disturbing pattern
God damnit I hate Biden
Leftist:  It was wrong to have harsher penalties for crack cocaine than regular cocaine. Also Leftist:  Voting for Joe Biden.
Everyone was rejected by the voters expect Biden sir..At this moment Kamala is probably the closest to the Presidency than all of those person's you just mentioned.. Strategy wins my dear...Kamala is very likeable to MANY people. Especially to those who voted for her as Senator
Clearly Biden was the best they could come up with, any1 else would have been better
WTF that’s so messed up. Would anything change if Biden were to become elected? Would that help at all? That’s so messed up how someone paying taxes and living like any other person basically tossed to the curb. I fucking hate this country more each day
You became a huge disappointment you should know better that the Democrat bill was full of pork and nonsense. In addition, you endorsed Joe Biden you should be ashamed of yourself.
are you mad that Bernie will be campaigning to elect Biden and his possible VP Harris? Because it seems like all of you are..now it makes sense
How do you sleep at night knowing you support a lunatic.  Biden will win, we will vote...our lives depend on it!!
#MuhammadAli son says dad would have hated ‘#racist’ #BlackLivesMatter  #antifa #Biden

You will defend this president forever. You tell me if Obama said that he wanted to postpone the 2012 election that you wouldn’t riot in the streets. Get out of here. Biden 2020
He really is and praying when Biden wins that maybe he’ll come back to office
Please vote for Biden.
&lt;Shrugs&gt; Even if the FEC found something wrong, you know the IMPEACHED, FAILED CORONAVIRUS-AWOL "president" will ignore it, as he ignores the law. Gawd, we need OBAMA, or BIDEN, or HILLARY, or JOHN LEWIS, or ROMNEY, or PELOSI running the government on behalf of The People.
If he wins the Dems will off him.  Understand they have a plan for who will ultimately run this country if they steal the election.  Biden is so out there that he can’t see the train rolling down the tracks on him.  Luckily he won’t be winning anyway.
Joe Biden has 3 feet in the grave and cannot even formulate words into sentences!  Ill take my chances with Trump anyday
bernie shouldnt be talking lol! dude literally quit knowing he had a bigger chance against trump than biden lol
You are so delusional you'll be being kicked out of the White House come November when BIDEN wins. I live in Nevada &amp; my son and I will personally Drive any people elderly disabled or otherwise that don't have a ride to vote so we can get rid of u then America will be great again
Gotta answer my own question. The date posted was 9 days before Trump was sworn in. Fauci knew that his bosses at the time Obama/Biden were leaving office with the cupboards bare. Not hard for him to predict the incoming administration to not be fully prepared.
I'm hoping Biden picks Brazille as his VP nominee.  And Harf as his Sec State. Juan Williams as his Press Sec'y. Tarlov as liaison with fellow commie governments. Maybe then I could enjoy Fox News again.
Dems LIKED Hillary and she lost. Dems don't even like Biden.  If he gets even close to winning, I'm betting the DNC rigged votes like they got caught doing last election.
Biggest battle of 2020?  Trump vs Biden?  Nahh  Polk vs Negreanu!  (Insert comical joke from Doug about more rake or illegal handicap parking)
So a tweet, Even a sarcastic one is grounds for impeachment? Get over it a rest!As with Obama/Biden first 3years we should have some juicy crimes already committed along the lines of Fast and furious,IRS scandal... Ya know weaponizing the alphabet agencies to hide corruption...
Politicians on both sides of the aisle have realized the popularity of criticizing China, whether on issues of trade, human rights, intellectual property, or the pandemic.  This will be significant going forward, regardless if Trump or Biden wins.  #ChinaUS #2020Election #China
Can we all agree to tweet this continuously the minute Biden concedes?  Or should I say “cloncedes” (re: “crimate clisis”) - and on the hour every hour for a full 24 hours on Nov. 4, 2020?  Yes?  Yes!  The press truly is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!!!
Biden. Aided and abetted by the media and you know the rest
I don’t think Biden rides around in a van.
So wrong.    Tho, lets see who’s “terrified” when it’s DEBATE TIME!    What do you think Danny Boy, are they gonna pull a “Covid-con” and let someone debate for Biden???    No can do, bro... the PEOPLE want to see the CANDIDATES debate!  (Even tho Biden is a sock puppet).
Too bad Biden couldnt
Interior Minister Bormann's own Sicherheitsdienst. The entire Federal security apparat needs to be brought to heel and completely overhauled the day Biden is sworn in.
I only meant that in that I feel go do your homework is less powerful than just citing sources and giving the full values for people to see. I’m more of a Biden sided person, tearing down the Police is dangerous and scary. They need more funding so that every side can be safer.

Along with Joe Biden.
Fair question, but I'd like to see direct evidence of this. Not hearsay. Unlike Biden who was relatively poor (By politician standards) &amp; became rich BY their "Public Service" Like many others did on both sides. Is your stance based on fact, likelihood or personal dislike?
Which Biden stooge typed this? You know he's not winning. I didn't know dementia was contagious?
Biden by 90% but “beware ignoring the youth vote and losing the black vote” I don’t think so
Whether you or Biden wins, America still loses.

Michael Flynn can blow this thing wide open, and implicate Barack Obama, and Joe Biden.
You mean Russia versus Biden?
What is it being dropped in bird shit? This guy need to join Biden. Same mentality.
I don’t want to wait till midnight pacific to hear Donald Trump has defeated Joe Biden.   I want it to be quick and painful for the Democrats; perhaps they will feel a small portion of the pain they have brought to this President in his first term   Then POTUS needs to open it up
Biden has been a much savvier campaigner than I expected
Yes, short of death nothing could keep me from voting for Biden on 11/3....straight blue ticket💙
3 swamp rats... great job guys a Biden presidency is awesome for the Republican Party. The whole idea is to stay marginalized and let the established elites and their corporate hacks keep the minions in line because Washington knows best. Winning strategy.
Considering the worse rioting is in places that have the most homogeneously Democrat city officials I don't see why Biden in office would make a difference.
That’s so excellent to hear! So of course you’re voting Joe Biden.
What is Joe Biden?
Then California letting non citizens vote should be something you’re strongly against. As well as foreign companies and citizens donating to Super PACs, leveraging foreign relationships and banking systems to create defamatory statements. Yet, the clintons and Biden did all that.
Well i mean, Bernie is in the same place she's in..campaigning for his good friend Joe Biden....so ummmm
i think that’s completely right and is actually a fairly sizable factor in why i like biden’s chances. people are exhausted
I a 71 year old Army vet not a traitor to my party  If your a republican pushing a Dem agenda your just another Hanoi Jane pushing Communisum   I don’t need another fake dossier to know Trump is the one to lead this nation  Not that blundering Biden  #trump 2020
Republicans for Biden
You realize Biden and Obama did that too?
*Slaps down 100 dollars.*  I think Biden wins.  Hillary was super close to beating Trump, and people hated her.  Biden isn't more liked, but he's definitely less hated.  Trump is also very, very hated, so I expect liberal voters to actually go out and vote this time.
This is your best video so far. I love the way you picked &amp; edited the current footage and all of the little touches that you really have to pay attention to notice - like the can of Goya being thrown at dump. Then the finish with the TV changing the channel to Biden. Excellent!
Who are you?  I hear "I am Joe Biden". Are you the same Joe Biden that for 8 years as VP only talked to the press. The same Joe Biden that states will represent all Americans but will only do fluff pressers.  Do you think so little of us? Or is it you really take us for dupes?
Trump is going to smash the ever loving fuck out of Biden.
Yeah super trash choice to keep the status quo. It's like he felt like since he made it out of something terrible so everyone must be good now. "Like it's not as bad as it was before I helped make change". That's the Biden mentality. No empathy for the youth and clearly everyone.
When did I blame him?  I never blamed Obama or Biden, and I never blamed Trump.  Only fools would put the blame on 1 person for a virus, while at the same time meeting by the 1000s where not every1 is not following precautions

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂......Biden said the wrong state, and 2020 census was 2 census ago....Riots and defunded police....Trump gets 410+ in EC
Nope. That's not Biden.
Shouldn't the Biden voters wait to find out who Biden's VP pick is before declaring their allegiance?   Or are they just gonna vote for whomever the DNC selects?  We all know Biden isn't going to be running anything.
Democrats have failed to 'live up' to their pledges&amp; promises in th past …why stop now? Dont be surprised if #basementjoe Biden chooses comrade Sanders [who btw brings much more to th table in th form of unification&amp;votes] over a promise to pick a black woman as his running mate
You mean to tell me “if Joe Biden gets elected your nana is gonna die” wasn’t a good messaging strategy? Shocked pikachu
We can be brothers after the much-ballyhooed Biden administration enacts such policies into law. I would also prefer if 10 million people didn't lose their homes in an economic crisis during that time, but haven't been able to figure out if neolibs were in favor of that outcome.
Same. Whomever. Whatever. Biden for my life.

Give Biden a go at all this COVID shit, tired of seeing Trump's racist ass drag this shit out months on months because he doesn't believe it's real
Biden won't be indicted but his participation in the conspiracy will be reported.
Nevada Governor Sisolak will take taxpayer money to *look a squirrel* about nonsense like "social justice reform" as most of Las Vegas is shut down, unemployed, killing themselves, and leaving the state in droves.  It helps voter fraud for Biden November, works for him...
Listen just because liberals are so good at lying and just oblivious to telling the truth and now starting to believe their own lies doesn't mean "we'yall" are losing. We didn't lose against Hilary like "ya'll" predicted and we are not losing now. Biden wins we all lose !!
Biden doesn't know how to use twitter, but whoever's being paid to run this account is kind of an asshole.

Obama is a tool. A man that can only pull out the race card to make a point. He’s DIVISIVE. He cares nothing about the “people”. He was on his horse today, giving a song-sing speech in a “preacher” voice! Please. We see his game. He’s got a brain dead Biden running.

Actually, I was joking (I do that a lot on Twitter). I just said 20 slaves because she appears on the $20 bill. Seriously, though, although I applaud her role in history, I don't think she's a good choice for the $20 bill. However, I understand Joe Biden invited her to be his VP.
Was just thinking that  would've been absolutely best choice for VP before  made that dumb, dumb commitment for VP before he looked at everyone.   O'Rourke inspires young people and excites a crowd. In future, think before mouth engages.
You don’t vote for the President!  You vote for his Electors!  Each state has at least three Electoral votes!  Thus, states like California and New York can’t decide who becomes President!  Candidates want to win strategic states!  Biden already has CA &amp; NY! He needs much more!

As a lifelong Republican I affirm my support for thankfully turned out to be Joe Biden. I made this formal announcement on January 20th, 2017. Get Out The Vote......
Not sure what you mean.  The odds of Biden winning are currently much better than marginal.  Of course so much can change by November.   If you truly believe this, you should immediately get on a betting site and put big $ on Trump.  He’s a +150 dog right now.
Thanks for endorsing Trump!   Biden sure doesn't speak in complete sentences
All points Joe Biden can pick up on and add to his agenda
Biden is a Virtual candidate, he refused an interview with Chris Wallace, never see him on  live TV interviews!  Biden  is a washed up Senile political Hack!

If you haven’t caught on yet, the MSM and Left are pushing mail in voting as the only way to get the election right. Biden. Cheat. Youarearacistifyoudenythis.
Enough already, pick your damn VP and let's get the campaign process on.
This is from April
So is Biden
Never. Interestingly though, every time my husband gets a call from a telemarketer, whether it be for solar or a extended car warranty, he just answers “My family is voting for Biden. No, we are voting for Biden. Mark us down as voting for Biden” They hang up on him and we laugh
He looked just as bad as Biden...I personally didn't watch it .. I didn't want to hear all the lies !
I believe Kamala Harris will make an excellent running mate with Joe Biden 2020.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
Is Biden contagious?😳
Then I'm sure you won't be voting for Biden
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
Nope...But there is a pretty good video of Joe Biden dropping the N word like it is his job.
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
There are tulsi supporters who actually thinks this is a possibility. What are they thinking , I’m ex-YangGang and it drives me nuts when people tweet , Biden gonna put Yang in a position. Lol never gonna happen.
That’s what you’re worried about? Alice convincing Bob to vote for Biden instead of Donald, in the privacy of their own home? The horror! My lord, Donald is worse off than I thought.  Fuck 😬
Everytime Biden opens his mouth he gives more votes to Trump. Just wait til Texas finds out what Biden wants to do with the oil. More votes for Trump.
Biden has no chance.

Why is it I get the feeling that Biden has already been elected and the cheating Democrats and MSM are just waiting to announce it in November ? God forbid it !!
Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.

So it's not necessarily that you want to vote for Biden but because of how you feel toward Trump?
skip, if you really believe that, you’re too stupid to vote.   Also, During 2009 swine flu pandemic, Obama  told states to shut down their testing.  Biden's top advisor has acknowledged that Obama administration didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic.  CBS News 2009

In don't think so. Everyone knows what a failure you are. We all want to go back to normal. Obama was the best president in our generation and Biden helped so we know he'll get us out of the hell hole you you put us in.

Anyone believe that George HW Bush, Gore, Biden, or Pence did not have presidential ambitions when they were picked?  I guess these Dems must have a special love for Dick Cheney. Other than his dumb FP, I’m not hating on Cheney. Not sure his lack of ambition made him a better VP.
Another reason why everyone will be Ridin’ With Biden in November.
This line of attack is gross and sexist. Does anyone wonder why George HW Bush, Gore, Biden, or Pence agreed to be nominated?  I’m sure these people tearing down Kamala Harris are all yuge fans of Dick Cheney. That guy was simply a hard working public servant who did his best.

Watching Joe Biden’s Speech. He has an actual plan. A plan to rebuild the economy.  A plan that doesn’t include, name calling, feral forces that are soon to be martial law. A plan that doesn’t include nepotism, racial division and a supreme white race.  A real plan.
Proof please. I don't think Biden is capable of public office. Want to see proof? This is a lot and I will post links. Can you do the same for me on your claim Barr is corrupt and incompetent?
He really has lost his mind, maybe that should be Biden's running mate
I’d prefer mail-in voting but you can BELIEVE that I will crawl across a mile of COVID-infected broken glass in gold lamè booty shorts to vote for Biden in November if that’s what it takes. #TrumpIsALoser #VotebyMail
What would be gain for being anti-Biden? The neolibs beat the left this cycle and at this point it is better to admit defeat and start working on building coalitions within the democratic party for 2024. The first step is to help Joe win as much as we know he sucks.
Is it just me or does the subtitle say that Joe Biden and the Dems can do things that the trumpster fire at the white house sees as undoable?  Curious that . . . Keep it up, Jr--you are helping get Joe elected.
I agree.  Bring it!  Texas, Alaska and Nevada are the biggest states in North America.  Without healthy competition, why bother even entering the fray?  I'm from Texas and here's my advice for Democrats: Go for it. What do you have to lose?  via
If the Green Party came back and had any chance of winning (and selected a good candidate instead of the DNC's pick) I'd vote against Biden. At this point he'll have to do something real horrible to have me vote against him. We can't afford 4 more Trump years.
What liberals don't understand is they control about 95% of the media but only about 35% of the voters.  Many of us don't accept what you call racism.   If Biden leads to more of your always outraged protest of violent nature.  Trump for four more.
Who will be our 47th president?  #Trump #Failure #Biden #2020Election #2024Election
And a Joe Biden presidency would just ensure that it gets worse
I think there’s a good chance that Biden’s VP pick will be the next president 🥰❤️😭
Why debate? Perhaps because 1/3 of the debate would be Biden trying to read off of his teleprompter.
(Note: this will also be a problem for Biden if he wins.)
Using a picture of trumps America to point out how bad things would be in Biden's America isn't the way I would have went... but whatever. 😀😂😀
No matter he says the unemployment is far behind and yet he won't he try to do it himself he only gets his money for lying to the people of Nevada. He gets paid to lie not to tell the truth. I think Sisolak is worse then Biden
Dude. YOU are President, the markets crashed, cities burned. So you’re saying Biden would continue what you started with your ineptness?
I’m the same age as Karen Bass and I would hope that Biden would pick someone a little bit younger.
The Tim Kaine of the Biden run? Who is Karen Bass?
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'  #FoxNews
Why would Biden endorse a supporter of Louis Farrakhan?
NEVER BIDEN!!!
Also, what  said is getting blown WAY out of proportion.  She said she hasn't been called up and asked to endorse Biden, but that she'll still be organizing and getting out the vote for him. THIS is what we're canceling her for saying?

Quick, what's worse - 4-8 years of Biden or 4 more of trump?  If anyone said Biden, they're a fucking idiot.
Didn't Harris say that Joe Biden is a racist at the dem debates?
At the dem debates, didn't Harris say that Joe Biden is a racist?
That's presidential behavior. Can't wait for the Biden presidency.
Joe Biden is trending now!
He being Biden is now!
Senator, really hope you will be doing everything in your power to make sure your supporters get out and vote for Biden.  Not voting for Biden, is a vote for Trump and that is truly something our country can not afford.
I will back whoever Biden chooses 100%. My least favorite is Elizabeth Warren but if she is his choice then she’ll become my choice.
Biden also has the excuse that he doesn't want to engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.
Joe Biden stated he would take funds from the police. Quit spewing lies.
Don’t need debating...VOTE DEMOCRAT....VOTE FOR BIDEN
Biden has had many chance to address these issues for 4 decades. His lack of leadership thus far should be a signal as to how badly he will do with these same issues if president.

No to 45. Yes to Biden. And now I follow you! That should help the ratio a little..😁 ✌❤
I look at this way. I don't think Biden could come up with an idea that good. He can't even complete a sentence with out stuttering. Go on Twitter and then the proof is right there no matter what people say. Ask the person to explain this and then show then the proof.

From what I’ve seen on Twitter people are pushing Elizabeth Warren they’re also pushing the 25th amendment if Biden wins. My hopes is Biden will pick a black woman for VP.
Remember, while you are gardening, a project Trump and his kids thought up for you to do, THIS is what  &amp;  were contributing to this country. Can't wait 2 have role models again in the White House.  We deserve better than U, lady.
My guess is that Biden will not make his selection based on Dodd's gripes — but if he was planning to choose someone other than Kamala for a different reason, Dodd just created a headache for him.
To follow that up, what does Biden's program cost? What will my public option fee be? I am going to need specific numbers.
Do you think NRA and/or support for what it supports ends with the election of Biden?  I don't and I fear that what Biden does that is right here is likely to be overturned in time unless there is a differently educated public to vote for what is sensible and humane.
Well yes Biden supporters aren’t cult like.
Chris Dodd running around bitching and moaning while Biden probably like “yeah, she kicked my ass that night but I still got the nomination so...”
Hércules fencing to protect the bunker btch! White House continues buildinfg 13-foot high ‘anti climb’ wall. The first thing Reagan did when he was elected was to remove the solar panels carter installed at the WH. The first thing Biden will do will Tear down this wall.
I don't like funding it with taxes. The fact that people believe the govt needs "funding" is an outdated idea. However, what I care about is cost. Biden caps the cost of insurance at 8%, but that does not include copays, deductibles. Only the monthly payment.
It already is funded by the poor, if they even have insurance. We all pay for it. We should all pay less for it. Thinking Bernie planned to place the burden on those he fought for his entire life, while Biden was trying to cut SS, in completely disingenuous.
Don’t care and not playing into this media narrative. Biden will choose.
Me too... Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Biden victory would bring an end to what the person described as the 'venal corruption' of the Trump era.
I'll bet Biden picks Susan Rice...
Karen Bass would be who I think Biden should pick for VP
Right. I have to think the Biden team understands this is a risk and that will be part of their decision.
Nice piece of fiction. Nice to have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight. I do recall the DEMS criticism of the China travel ban and Biden even called it xenophobic. By the way why isn’t Biden doing the presentation? Does Biden even know about this?
Joe Biden is on standby until ,Jan 21
Under Bernie's plan, if you earn $40k, your total payment for healthcare, not insurance, for the year, regardless of what care you needed, would $400. $60k would be $1200. Please show the math were Biden competes with that.
Oh no you're right if Joe Biden wins there will be more democratic mayors and governors that will allow their cities to burn just as easy as some of the ones now!
No, in 100 Days..   will become a 2 term president... and you sleepy joe...will be in your basement Wondering what Happened....? The people are tired of your High taxes coming,your non response to the nation violent protesters, and you “ Still Don’t Get it, Biden?
Biden has no chance. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
To Biden a Touring test is one where he can find his basement with both hands.  Beware, Biden might ask you out behind the woodshed.

Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
So, are the Dems planning on using the Electoral College to elect Hillary as the VP? 1) They hate the EC. So abuse of it might cause a change 2) State laws may bind electors for President...do they include VP? 3) What if Biden chooses noone. Who decides who the electors vote for?
Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.

Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
Mike, Biden has no chance to defeat Trump.
Can you please show me the evidence? He had a 4% tax on income after 30k. So more than half of America would pay nothing. That would not be the case under Biden's plan. Biden also includes copays, deductibles adding more cost. Insane to think his plan is cheaper.
You're supporting Joe Biden you won't be for long. The very second you see what he's going to turn America into, you will go right back to the smack. I'm a recovering addict myself and I'm supporting Trump because I support Law and Order not rioting and chaos.
Hey Eric:  Pretty obvious Biden’s handlers do not want him to sit for an hour interview.   His dementia will be obvious.  Taking bets that Biden will refuse to debate.  Covid will be the excuse.   MJ
And Chris Wallace will throw up softballs to Joe Biden too. That just tells you that he’s only going to go on MSDNC and CNN
Joe Biden is black?

I agree!  People just aren’t going to associate Warren and Biden unless she is nominated for VP.  Candidates meet with lots of people aren’t hanging on the latest inside baseball tic toc of who met with who.
When you tried to argue that Biden's plan is better than Bernie's and cheaper for the low income people, I had to turn the pod off.
Covid pal... are you that thick headed? Hardly the president’s fault... I think China may have been a factor. Biden will bow to China and become even richer if he’s elected.
My mind is made up as far as who im voting for social-media has nothing to with my decision...Biden!!

Biden isn’t going to pick Warren as VP and he isn’t aligning with her any more than Trump was aligning with Kanye in 2016.  Voters aren’t going to care if Biden meets with someone to talk about policy.

Marxism is not a new path. It is a path paved by suffering, blood and bones. No thanks Puppet Biden.
According to Joe Biden and appropriate punishment would be to give them no punishment at all and let them continue to do whatever they want. Think about that, important election in 2020 vote red or be dead

Nope .. pretty sure he’s going to get re-elected.. people are sick of special Interest voting from entrenched 40+ years politicians like Biden, Pelosi, McConnel and others
Mueller for A.G.  I like that. He’s one of the few honest Republicans left. And It would give Biden some added diversity on the political side.
Damn! The position I am in. I want Biden to win because of Trump.  I do not want Biden to be my president. I will vote for Biden but I do not support Biden. If there were an anti-Trump fund, I would contribute. Contributing to Biden for Biden would feel, what, hypocritical? Nasty
Trump supporters are simply voting against a self-serving currupt group of politicians some in office 40+ years..they are the problem. Biden represents 20 yrs of failed policies.
No one but Biden!!
Nothing would please me more than #America’sGreatestMistake not showing up for Biden’s inauguration

You are right. I think when Biden is elected, that you will see a slew of retiring justices. He just needs to hold on till January.
I choose America so I'm voting for Biden!!
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's those R voters who will down low vote for Biden. Goes both ways. Unclutch the pearls. Please.
This is just a snapshot of what will happen to America if Joe Biden wins in November! This is just a small taste of how our society will fall!
Covid has a 99% survivability rate in most of the United States. Under Joe Biden, who stated he would work on granting citizenship to all illegal immigrants, they would have access to free healthcare in his healthcare plan. You are correct about the mortality rate.
You would think most sane people would view Joe Biden, no matter what side of the isle you're on, and see him for the totally useless idiot he is,,, he is a meat suit puppet for whoever's behind him And those are the people who are going to be running this country if he wins!
I’m still soooooo pissed that I gotta settle for Biden
Hey Stick: Trump had “no path to victory” in 16 according to Fake News.  They are doing it again. Odds makers are betting on Trump. There is a Silent Majority Watching the chaos on our streets.   Biden has moved so far to the left.  It will not work in the mid west.  MJ
Stick:  Trump got 63 million votes. Crooked Hillary got 2.5 million more votes most of which came out of California.   Remember Crooked Hillary was supposed to win in a landslide.   There is far less enthusiasm for Biden.   The guy has dementia. Wait until the debates.  Ugly! MJ

If you think the LGBTQ community will sigh &amp; go home when Biden is elected, 'you've got another thing coming'
This is certainly plausible from the perspective that the states he's winning and the state's he's losing have some broad cultural similarities. But I doubt very much Biden will sweep the Sun Belt AND whiff the Rust Belt.
Clinton lost ME-02 due to the same demographics that abandoned her in Wisconsin, so it's hard to imagine Biden winning the former while losing the latter.  Maybe if he changed his campaign slogan to "Fuck Wisconsin" it would happen.
Hillary Clinton endorses Bob Casey and other pro life democrats. Nobody says anything. Nancy Pelosi endorses Henry Cuellar and other pro life democrats no one says anything. Then you stan for Joe Biden, a pro-life Democrat.  Interesting how values can waiver

If Biden wins OK-5 by 5 points, that would mean either OKC is dark blue, or he flipped some of the surrounding counties too.
People gave Biden a lot of flack for his "Trump's the first racist president" gaffe, but I know what he meant. He's arguably the first president whose *entire justification for running for president* was that he was a racist.
Here's the thing you don't seem to get about America... I can do both at the same time. Comfortable in the knowledge that there is nothing Biden would do to damage Palestine like trump has.
Democrats, from Biden on down, need to understand that this is just what the media is going to do to them, no matter what they do and no matter how reasonable and compromising they are, so they should not be scared off from implementing necessary reforms to fix democracy.
And every time he announces a policy that Republicans anywhere would be less than thrilled about, it's back to the diner in rural Pennsylvania to find Obama-Trump-Biden voters who "feel betrayed."
We'll get a million columns from people like David Brooks and Bret Stephens saying something like "Now Biden has swept Dems into their strongest position in a decade, he faces the daunting task of not alienating swing voters — his best bet is to adopt conservative policies."
Oh man, Halper knows EXACTLY how hypocritical she sounds and ties her tongue in knots trying to explain it.  To be clear, I support vetting the allegations against Buttar as thoroughly as were the allegations against Biden, and will, as I did then, see where that vetting goes.

Q: Who is actually voting for Biden &amp; not just against trump? *(I'm Blue no matter who but also actually like Joe).
If you turn even one voter away from Biden, because of your desire to further yourself and your career, then you're an idiot.
Joe Biden wants to address health care, gun control, policing, provide free community college, erase student loan debt, invest in green energy and improve the nation's infrastructure.
Haven't heard of anyone catching grief for donating to the Biden campaign.
Return to honor and dignity we pray. Vote Biden!
Maybe Biden should "Hang Trump' in his White House?👺👌
It's always funny how Biden talks about race and says that if you don't vote for him you ain't black but yet somehow Trump is the racist one?
DISCLAIMER: Bc of the Electoral College, the absolutely vote for Biden rule only applies in swing states, which are  Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania Florida North Carolina Arizona Nevada Msine Texas? Ohio? Georgia? Iowa? Nebraska?  In all other states, vote as you please!
No it actually wasn’t. Obama/Biden set up the detention centers and also deported more people than any other administration.
Then why won't  take the cognitive test that an  8 year old could pass? I'll help you out, Biden would fail it &amp; it will be on  ,  ,  ,  ,  &amp;  every hour until the election, "Biden failed" told ya!
We all want  to change and work towards a great deal of things but he can't do it alone. With all I hope to see from Biden hope also hope to see all parties in Congress working together. Start acting like #onenation. We have more in common than we choose to see.
Obama can you please be honest and let the American people Biden has been stuttering for as you know him. On Twitter it shows him stuttering when he tries to make sentence ( s ) and please have Biden take a test to see if is getting dimentia and have several doctors test him
I will crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden.
.Sir--Nope...and #Biden will destroy Mr. #tRump in November. It will not be close.
One hopes the backlash is in the House and Senate because it’s not happening here:  Gains by free market Republicans in Congress to push and pull Biden toward better policy would show the most voter wisdom.
I will crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden and I literally hate #45
I will crawl over broken glass to vote for Joe Biden.
Both, and fodder for his campaign ads.     is so stupid he doesn't realize that when he puts this on TV and says, "This is what it will look like if Biden wins," that we are aware that is the world he himself created.

This is the tactic. Divide and conquer.  Ladies, your religion is rife with misogyny, sexual harassment, rapists and patriarchy - all the things Trump stands for. #churchtoo ! Best to renounce your beliefs now, melt down your purity rings and vote for whichever woman Biden picks.
Biden’s mask has completely Cut off the oxygen to his already compromised brain...  😳😳
Biden is LOST
This clip of Biden talking about a nurse blowing air into his nostrils has got to be that the funniest &amp; most disturbing clips I've ever listened to. LOL 😆 no joke
Does unprecedented federalization of local law enforcement suddenly not matter a few months before an impossible election? GOP must cut loose  and focus on Senate majority if it wants to defend liberty in the Biden Administration. #itisover
Dude, can we please wait until Biden is sworn in before ramping up the pressure. I feel you &amp; all, but he's not the one hiring Russian thugs to "police" American cities three months before the biggest election of our lifetime.
Just say it... "Down with the USA" you know you want to say it, buddy, go ahead. I am waiting for Beijing Biden to publicly announce his new slogan, "Make America Great Again" as Hiden Biden is the Plagerizer in Chief for the Dems. Biden/Obama are frauds, they both hate Americans
This is total sensation!  He is leaving when Biden is sworn in! Come on people.
The whole argument is that Biden wants to make more affordable housing available to more people- instead of continuing to cram people into low cost, low quality urban centers. I'd love to afford a home one day, but that's not happening any time soon in Reno
Maybe one day the Biden handlers will let him emerge from his basement and take a look around at the mess his progressive friends have made of things.
As one podcaster said  if you vote Biden what’s happening now is going to happen” . Lol. This is trump administration we can’t make this up
Hence the exact reason why Biden's polls are so incredibly inflated!!
Nah, trump did just fine talking to the american indian *India not native) crowd via zoom  He'd be fine.  My issue is Biden would be fed answers behind the camera.
No, I’m dealing with reality, what about you?? Biden???
No matter how bad Biden is, tRump is so much worse!
BS. The words Biden and a Better America is a complete oxi moran (hope that is spelled right) under that fool higher taxes, less freedom, screwed up economy need I say more WAKE UP AMERICA.
This is for Obama you were a great President Biden I feel he needs to see a doctor about all that stuttering he does 3 times in 30 seconds he stuttered to say one simple thing when my 10 year daughter could have said it better without stuttering when saying it.
100% right. It's BIDEN'S job to court US.  That's it. It's his job to convince voters to vote for him. Party-based entitlement to votes has completely supplanted the idea that candidates should earn votes from people and they campaign solely to people who are already on board.
Please just vote for Biden. There are better choices, but we don't have time for that and definitely not for paper napkins.
The only reason we are not hearing about starting impeachment proceedings on Biden in February is because there’s almost no chance Rs will have the gavel.
Hey Biden supporting suburban moms, make sure to bake plenty of cookies to welcome your 400 new next door neighbors!
I am a suburban housewife. Although I am a suburban housewife at the moment, I know Biden is the best choice for preserving America as a whole. Trump is a misogynist, racist, xenophobe who brags about passing cognitive tests that only rule out dementia.
"And I just sit there and let them touch the prickly hairs on my legs"  "I learned about cockroaches, and Popcorn.. Popcorn was a mean...." - also Joe biden.   So careful. Still want me to "read carefully" 🤦‍♀️😂
Mmhm. I look at actions.  Not words.  If i were going off words biden still not get my vote..   "Kids are just as smart and special as white kids"-Joe biden .
Better than biden
I will show him respect if Biden agrees to take the test and ambit he may have a memory problem and or what year it is problem. I think Biden needs to quit hiding from the reporters and be a man and admit that he has a problem.
You are literally showing video of Trump's American at this moment and trying to say that it would be Biden's America! That is Trump's America and will continue to be if we don't take the trash out of the White House.
And odd I can name 20 before him that were racist. But do go on youre just proving biden is mentally incompetent
Hes still better than biden  I will never vote for the man who put us in the political climate *cough 1994 crime bill plan*  That we are in now.  You want the man who DESTROYED our black communities in charge of the country  Excuse me while i laugh at your blatant racism
If you don't vote for Biden, you no yellow!
You can sacrifice your day to vote we can’t let Biden win
The China Communist Party (CCP) Announces It is Behind Sleepy Joe Biden for President - Is Likely Doing All They Can to Stop Trump  via
As I recall, Obama and Biden’s policies pulled this country out of the Great Recession caused by the lax policies of the Bush Administration.
In which  calls his presidency punishment for Obama and Biden. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂   Not even his latest Spinal Tap drummer of a campaign manager Bill Stepien can prevent him from his Twitter self-destruction. Keep posting Donald. You’re destroying yourself.
Sen. Ron Johnson will not say where material to investigate Joe Biden is coming from, but a former pro-Russian lawmaker in Ukraine has said he is a source.
Biden does not have to.
It sure wasn't Obama keeping nukes out of Iran. Trump is now sanctioning Iran and China to stop the nonsense Biden/Obama set into motion. Trump Saved America!  is saving  #Nevada too. The  are trying to tax hardworking #NV families. #MAGA #USA Now #WalkAway
I was flamed for hours over the weekend for saying Biden is a friend of Wall Street and told I have no proof and I'm a liar and I made up or misinterpreted "nothing will fundamentally change".  We know who Joe is.
Hey Raymond:  What some forget is that Obama did not help many Socialists running in past elections.  And the more Obama shows up, the smaller Biden looks by comparison.   Obama won two Presidentisl elections.  Biden was incidental.  MJ
My father voted for  in his first time eligible &amp; regretted it 2 months in. #Biden isn't the solution but the better alternative to really #MAGA
Joe Biden thinks it didn't exist until 2016.  C'mon, Jack. Get serious. I'm. When they go aro...And then we go up...he was a bad dude and I...they touch the hair and watch it lay down.
Shithole administration for sure.  By shithole  senators. We see however a real "light coming in that tunnel" of Trumpy's Regime of dark horror put us in.  The Golden Throne King is over.  Vote Biden.
Biden speaks for only the mentally disengaged....
Pretty sure it was Biden who threatened to withhold UK aid if the UK investigation into Hunter Biden wasn’t stopped..Biden got the prosecutor fired..
"this isn't about trump", but the initial tweet is that this'll be Biden's America? You can't have it both ways.
Don't like that excitement.  Well, vote for Trumpy's health care of no care, we'll continue to have sick virus people that Can't work, can't support income tax today's 4 million cases &amp; 150,000 deaths by Aug 1. It's economics 101 We'll see who's better won't we. I'm voting Biden
I'm excited. First thing. Biden will get the health care system going, he's got good experience with Obamacare.  Trumpy dismantled it. Second, like Obama he'll get 52.6 million jobs working. Trumpy did it back ass backwards. That proved  are a shithole administration Amazing
Iran doesn't need to build nukes, China is preparing to sell nukes to Iran. Iran's ambitions were allowed to move forward by the nonchalant attitude of the Biden/Obama Administration. Iran will nuke Israel. For empowering Iran, Obama got his mural painted in Tehran, Iran. #USA
You think voting Biden in will stop the rioting? Nah fam it would get worse under Biden
Just under a self serving lockdown because I refuse to become a Supermessiah Trumpy Stat. I'll live today to vote for Biden in November.  Meanwhile Republicans will die before November due to him.
Does Biden even realize that he is a puppet, that what he said was racist and he needs to learn some US history?
Lmfao Biden couldn't tell his azz from his elbow on a Great day!😂
No they're not. Biden may not make it through his first term as president. He'll turn 78 right after he wins in Nov and he'd be 82 by then. If old age doesn't claim his life, what will his mental state be in 4 years? Just look at him now.
:::sigh::: Let it go. That slug has 6 months til he hands the keys to the kingdom over to Biden.  But if he chooses not to gtfo, then yea, magic would be awesome😉
Well your party is pretty chaotic at this time. Plenty of y’all voting for Biden, so that’s good. You’re gonna be footnote one history Lil’ Marco😂
I thought the basement was for Biden.
has said enough already. The #Democrat puppeteers better not let Beijing Biden publicly debate  it will be worse for Biden than what happened to  in Fabulous #LasVegas . But the Nielson ratings will be great when Mr. Malarkey chokes on words.Or if it was trump JR who took 1.5B$ from China instead of hunter Biden
Biden still wants to take away our guns, which again, is against our rights. You can’t just change the constitution bc you want to, it has to go through proper procedure

Dems look at black ppl as “black” and not as “people”.  Ppl have their own minds, jobs, hopes, dreams, probs.  Biden doesn’t offer anything f/ppl.  He just wants us all to be wards of the govt.  His “unity plan” is anything but!  When I meet w/ppl, I don’t care what color they...
So what we saving it from?  The only thing i can figure is his disastrous presidency and even more disastrous handling of the pandemic.  I think maybe you spelled joe Biden's name wrong.  Cause he will save America from the mess that is Trump.

Now I know I am dealing with someone who is either too lazy or too stupid to get the facts.   I live in Vegas. Biden is a huge favorite. He’s also a huge favorite on Betfair (the largest betting exchange in the world - but you knew that).  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
I feel the same. I mean, Biden is 78! So I just assumed the VP pick would be groomed to be the next nominee. Not to mention Kamala was already vetted pretty well during the primaries.
Fake news.Stay off cnn and MSNBC is controlled by commies.Yall sheeple believe it and think joes a good guy.Trump is 10 times the man biden would or ever could be.Trump has put more pedifiles in jail than the past 4 presidents combined and that enough to get me &amp; my familys vote!
You DO realize that Biden HASN’T released a list of who he’s considering, RIGHT???  A lot of the name out there are Media speculation based on the fact that Biden has been seen with them!  I’m guessing it’s down to Demmings, Rice, and $hillary 2.0 aka Harri$!
Biden has either. Neither have I now that I think about it. Tweet me on Nov 4th and we will see which of the two has still not lost one.
I believe Biden will ruin our country and we will be taken over. Heard of the NWO? That, of course, is in revelation and I believe it bc God tells us it will happen. Too many things the left is doing right now, line up with the end times

Gender equality does not necessarily translate into job experience, Joe Biden should not rule out a man as VP also.

Not that Biden has a realistic chance of winning, but regardless, the criminal cult of Scientology CANNOT be allowed to infest the White House.   If you haven't yet, watch the documentary "Going Clear" and  "Scientology and the Aftermath" series.

Most of their followers are mindless. That's what they count on.
Oh please. You think Biden doesn’t already know about this crap? This is coming out because all the Veep camps are at war. Harris was never inevitable, neither is Bass or Rice or Demings or or or... no one knows s**t lol
Lots of vetting happening, is my guess. The last thing this election needs is a VP pick with serious skeletons in her closet. The Trump ops will do everything they can to discredit and dehumanize Biden’s VP. Any transgression will be amplified and weaponized.
Okay, imagine a White House with Biden and Pelosi? I shutter when either speak. They should go all-in and have her as VP! Can you imagine the conversations? Eeek!

yeah, and it's a list of like a dozen candidates. She's "gained traction" per this cnn article, but it doesn't necessarily consider her a favorite. Wordings murky, as I'm sure sources intended. They might be just testing the waters. I trust the campaign.
Think Biden could get up and down those stairs? #Biden  #Nope
why are so many in my feed freaking out about this? He hasn't picked his VP candidate yet. She was speaking TO scientologists. It's a quack "religion," but let the #Biden campaign vet.

It’s a typical true comment. You are voting based on how you FEEL about Trump, instead of what will happen to our country if lead by Biden. Nobody is voting for Biden bc they think he’ll be a good president, they are voting for him bc they hate Trump. That’s not a good reason
Opinions are great, we all have them, but the choice of whom he picks as VP running mate is strictly Joe Biden's. Let's please try to calm down on all the guesses and in-fighting among us, please?  I can wait a little while.
That’s the problem. I can predict exactly what will happen if Biden is elected. They will kick him out of office on account of his dementia, then we will be run by the radical left. Biden is just a puppet for them
Neither will Biden. How about abolishing #COVID19 ?
Let’s be real here: Biden doesn’t even do the tweeting. He doesn’t even know what Twitter is. He also won’t ever be President.
Biden needs a a diverse cabinet. Not just race and sex but idology. He needs centrist to progressive dems. Everyone will need to work together.   Remember the No drama Obama cabinet. Joe might be trying to recreate it. Anyone who does not play well with others should be avoided.
Needs a spark? Do you not realize everyone has been waiting months to vote Trump out? Get out of the DC bubble. Americans don’t care who the VP choice is. That’s why dems coalesced around Biden so quickly. The normal rules of politics are dead this year.

It will be all over for Biden when he’s announce VP.
She is dynamic. But in looking at longevity an party dynamics she will be either 75 or 79 when she made a Presidential run after Biden and that is too old. She will make a great cabinet member but I am not sure we want to possibly lose a Senate seat.

Do some research buddy. The Democratic Party is not good for the country. Weather you hate trump or not he is saving the world for evil. He’s running the country like a business that it is. Biden will ruin this place. He won’t be in control. Just a PUPPET. 🙏🏻🇺🇸

Trump is President . Correct. But the lineage is contextual. It’s contextual in campaign sense because Biden is running of of that 8 year legacy. If the very resume of the democratic front runner is going to have a history of hypocrisy…It’s probably worth mentioning in 2020 race
The very good  documentary about Alex Jones and his influence on Trump leads to the following question: is Trump struggling to beat Biden because of how much harder it is to start viral conspiracy theories about him?
Nonsense, of course. Unemployment went from 10%+ to 4% under Obama/Biden. SLIGHTLY worse with Trump. As in “Great Depression” worse. You really need to consider where we are right now, instead of before the pandemic. That was on Trumps watch.

This is the kind of document that I hope someone on Team Biden is collecting. And I hope there is a team somewhere drafting the orders, regs and legislation to turn this around. I hope.
“Settle for Biden” is the most brilliant campaign idea the GOP has had in years.
So is Pence going to announce his running mate when Biden does?
Democratic Governor, aka a Joe Biden supporter.
I bet the IMPEACHED, FAILED, CORONAVIRUS-AWOL "president" is watching. Hope he steams over never being given a human rights award, like JOHN LEWIS, OBAMA, BIDEN, HILLARY, and PELOSI, and now DR FAUCI:
Yeah.  We sure are taking about  Why wouldn't we?  #TrumpMeltdown  #TrumpFailedAmerica  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpIsAPedo #EpsteinFiles
Michael Jackson paid settlements to his accusers but a lot of people think he was innocent.
I’ve seen  a vote Democrat, but not a “Biden” one
#GropingJoe Biden... living child molester
skip, unlike #YouAintBlackJoe  Trump actually writes his own tweets.  Biden has his staff write tweets for him.
Epstein and Maxwell deliberately courted every influential figure in order to make themselves more influential by association. This is not to say Trump is necessarily innocent though.
I know it's a Friday, but can Biden please announce his VP today?
I think it's a valid point though. Whether it's Biden or Trump, young people are getting screwed either way.
I've been a real Conservative Republican all my life and I'll vote for President Trump again. As will every Republican i know, plus all of the democrats i know are solidly voting for Trump. The only people I know that are voting for Biden are those on the dole.
The reason why next year will be excellent is because Biden will be president.
If you’re still voting democrat you’re not paying attention or you’ve lost your mind.  Released Epstein files implica Clinton. Democrat cities murder rates skyrocket. Mayors and governors don’t protect their citizens.  You’re either crazy or evil if you’re voting Biden
#democratscrackmeup ...politicians such as #basementjoe Biden are not the higher power they pretend to be #KUNGFLU #COVID19
I completely agree. So let's start by building homeless shelters and free medical clinics next to #GeorgeSoros, #Obama, #Clinton, #Biden, #Pelosi and #Schumer . . . because , evidently, they care much more about the poor (and #China) than #Trump does. I'd pay MORE taxes for that!
Obama and Biden are honorable men. Trump is immoral, corrupt incompetent, criminal, and traitorous.
“Joe Biden defunded the police while vice president, and nobody noticed it at the time.”  Sick burn.
Biden is Clinton's puppet.
Who y’all think Biden choosing as his VP?
Biden is going to be an excellent president. Trump will be answering for his crimes.
Miami Vice? So you used the Delorean to go back to the 80's when Biden was still coherent and Kamala Harris had her mouth full of Willie Brown?  I know it's hard to watch the DNC/BLM/Antifa #ShitShow but THAT is who you are. #dealwithit #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020
Yes.. Biden 2020!
Hey I'm not the one who has to explain why Biden can't finish a sentence or why it's okay for thousands of people to shop Walmart, Target, etc. but we need MAIL IN BALLOTS (so the DNC can rig the election). That's all you bro.  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020Victory
Biden better investigate EVERY PENNY SPENT BY EVERYONE OF TRUMP ADMIN!
The censorship is at Biblical proportions now. A family member posted a meme of Bīdëñ holding Up a Trûmp sïgñ. Fåcëbøøk took the meme down for vîølation of their cömmûnity standards. Moreover we did a gōōglë search for the meme the search resulted in the opposite.
Poll: Donald Trump Leads Joe Biden by Two Points in North Carolina  via
Not to mention Joe Biden‘s hands are not gonna be flying all over in the front of the camera. How many times have millions of Americans wished Donald Trump‘s hands were handcuffed when he was giving some kind of a speech or a briefing or a press conference?
😂😂😂😂😂 There you go again still dwelling on previous conspiracy theories from 2016 and back. You obviously are huge Kool-Aid drinker because you don’t realize the same things that you were accusing Joe Biden, Trump has been very effectively being guilty of.
I he'll from San Jose &amp; lived there  35  years of life. She was AWFUL in Alameda &amp; must b ignored here too. A vote 4 Biden is a vote 4 her to be President CAUSE Biden won't do a dam thing, she will push him aside
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It “You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I”m President” .. YES PLEASE.  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
How many lies do you hear in the new Joe Biden commercial. I see three. Bailed out bank's. Not Americans. Health care. The worst most corrupt in American history. Ebola. W.H.O.
This describes Biden’s handlers, the hidden people behind the curtain!
😂😂😂 Biden can choose Donald Duck and beat trump
I'd feel so owned if they boycotted the election and I was stuck with Biden. Man, don't even know how I'd handle that.
So now  wants a racist beta male as POTUS! You know, “you ain’t black if you don’t vote for me” Biden.
How many times did Biden lose a primary and he was selected to be VP? Bernie lost in 2016 and he still had a fan base. Why are you white men so baffled by this?
Yeah she turns off people like me. I hate Latin commies. They better not even consider her. I am still voting for Biden, but I know others that this would be a deal breaker
Biden did condemn it 2 days ago
Dishonest Trump was able to distract the media from his horrible GDP numbers, 39% DROP IN GDP, highest in history!  The American people know, they're out of jobs!  President Biden has a huge task ahead of him.
I hate the "settle for biden" campaign.  Why settle when you can revolt?
? XD thank you for defending an old white male rapist, totally is going to change literally anything when biden gets elected, like the fact that I am still going to be without healthcare and I will still lose my rights as a queer person
Racial injustice does NOT exist. It’s being broadcasted by fake news to get you to vote for Biden. Those that fall for it are idiots.
Biden is China’s best friend!
Man, more tightening and bad news for Biden. It's honestly getting to the point where Biden should just drop out.
"leftists" *has biden 2020 in bio*
stop biden is not going to be president. Trump might not be president either. Trillion percent biden won’t be president.hell he might not even be running by say end of September he will become ill or something the old bait and switch.
Biden's best effort: to choose a black(votes from blks.) Female  (votes from women).: if these 2 get in America will sink into the SEA.  Call/text all u know &amp; tell'em, Vote Trump just to keep them out!.
i agee lets get it over already before the dems. Can do their bait and switch or cheat.cause the biggest number in the universe is how much we no biden will not be president.
Good grief! My DOG would be better than Trump! He’s a lunatic! Not worried at all. Biden is respected &amp; savvy enough to surround himself with SMART staff and actually listen to them! And he’s going to have a top notch VP at his side. We’re going to be juuuuust fine. #Biden2020
Um, no. He can get 47% and Biden probably gets 51-52% and that's a blowout. This isn't 2016 with 3rd parties. He gets 46% and it's 2008 or worse on November 3rd.
Presidential Election is FREEDOM vs SOCIALISM. It’s  who has kicked ass 4 ALL OF IS; or  who can’t complete sentences! RULE OF LAW vs DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA! Biden would allow Antifa, BLM, 2 run America! Murder everywhere?  is ONLY CHOICE
Biden is a worse decease for our country than COVID. He would certainly kill it.
Three months ago Joe Biden predicted trump would try to delay the election.  At the time, trump said Joe was wrong.  #trumpFail #Biden2020

Biden is doing about as well as Hillary was doing in 2016. If memory serves, that went well for her.
And Biden said that Trump is the first racist president ever you're looking at the first one and the only one he's the one who divided our country for 8 f****** years and it's still divided because of his horseshit crap that he did.
I am so sorry for your loss. 😞 I know how painful it is to lose a parent. It's heart wrenching. However, Trump took action on a travel ban as soon as he found out &amp; Biden shamed him for it up until March said he was fear mongering. Now they're trying to say Biden never said that
If Trump had died during this presidency, we would have been stuck with Pence... That’s scarier than any left anything. Gay, trans and civil rights would be N/A. The 2020/Biden ticket is a gamble but so was 2016 and look where we are now.

Maybe so, but a patriot supports our cntry. A patriot would never support illegally taking away our 1st and 2nd amendments. Supporting Biden, by default, supports taking away our constitutional rights. Little by little they will take more and more freedoms away

Biden HAS adopted many progressive policies but it's never enough for them. He's been working on policy w/Bernie and co. They're acting like he hasn't made any concessions. Biden's moved so far to the left that he lost important endorsements. He needs to stop courting berners.
Cal Thomas: Biden’s disturbing pattern
God damnit I hate Biden
Leftist:  It was wrong to have harsher penalties for crack cocaine than regular cocaine. Also Leftist:  Voting for Joe Biden.
Everyone was rejected by the voters expect Biden sir..At this moment Kamala is probably the closest to the Presidency than all of those person's you just mentioned.. Strategy wins my dear...Kamala is very likeable to MANY people. Especially to those who voted for her as Senator
Clearly Biden was the best they could come up with, any1 else would have been better
WTF that’s so messed up. Would anything change if Biden were to become elected? Would that help at all? That’s so messed up how someone paying taxes and living like any other person basically tossed to the curb. I fucking hate this country more each day
You became a huge disappointment you should know better that the Democrat bill was full of pork and nonsense. In addition, you endorsed Joe Biden you should be ashamed of yourself.
are you mad that Bernie will be campaigning to elect Biden and his possible VP Harris? Because it seems like all of you are..now it makes sense
How do you sleep at night knowing you support a lunatic.  Biden will win, we will vote...our lives depend on it!!

He really is and praying when Biden wins that maybe he’ll come back to office
Please vote for Biden.
&lt;Shrugs&gt; Even if the FEC found something wrong, you know the IMPEACHED, FAILED CORONAVIRUS-AWOL "president" will ignore it, as he ignores the law. Gawd, we need OBAMA, or BIDEN, or HILLARY, or JOHN LEWIS, or ROMNEY, or PELOSI running the government on behalf of The People.
Joe Biden has 3 feet in the grave and cannot even formulate words into sentences!  Ill take my chances with Trump anyday
bernie shouldnt be talking lol! dude literally quit knowing he had a bigger chance against trump than biden lol
You are so delusional you'll be being kicked out of the White House come November when BIDEN wins. I live in Nevada &amp; my son and I will personally Drive any people elderly disabled or otherwise that don't have a ride to vote so we can get rid of u then America will be great again
Dems LIKED Hillary and she lost. Dems don't even like Biden.  If he gets even close to winning, I'm betting the DNC rigged votes like they got caught doing last election.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle have realized the popularity of criticizing China, whether on issues of trade, human rights, intellectual property, or the pandemic.  This will be significant going forward, regardless if Trump or Biden wins.  #ChinaUS #2020Election #China
Can we all agree to tweet this continuously the minute Biden concedes?  Or should I say “cloncedes” (re: “crimate clisis”) - and on the hour every hour for a full 24 hours on Nov. 4, 2020?  Yes?  Yes!  The press truly is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!!!
Biden. Aided and abetted by the media and you know the rest
I don’t think Biden rides around in a van.
So wrong.    Tho, lets see who’s “terrified” when it’s DEBATE TIME!    What do you think Danny Boy, are they gonna pull a “Covid-con” and let someone debate for Biden???    No can do, bro... the PEOPLE want to see the CANDIDATES debate!  (Even tho Biden is a sock puppet).
Too bad Biden couldnt
Interior Minister Bormann's own Sicherheitsdienst. The entire Federal security apparat needs to be brought to heel and completely overhauled the day Biden is sworn in.
I only meant that in that I feel go do your homework is less powerful than just citing sources and giving the full values for people to see. I’m more of a Biden sided person, tearing down the Police is dangerous and scary. They need more funding so that every side can be safer.

Along with Joe Biden.
Fair question, but I'd like to see direct evidence of this. Not hearsay. Unlike Biden who was relatively poor (By politician standards) &amp; became rich BY their "Public Service" Like many others did on both sides. Is your stance based on fact, likelihood or personal dislike?
Which Biden stooge typed this? You know he's not winning. I didn't know dementia was contagious?
Biden by 90% but “beware ignoring the youth vote and losing the black vote” I don’t think so
Whether you or Biden wins, America still loses.

Michael Flynn can blow this thing wide open, and implicate Barack Obama, and Joe Biden.
You mean Russia versus Biden?
What is it being dropped in bird shit? This guy need to join Biden. Same mentality.
I don’t want to wait till midnight pacific to hear Donald Trump has defeated Joe Biden.   I want it to be quick and painful for the Democrats; perhaps they will feel a small portion of the pain they have brought to this President in his first term   Then POTUS needs to open it up
Biden has been a much savvier campaigner than I expected
Yes, short of death nothing could keep me from voting for Biden on 11/3....straight blue ticket💙
3 swamp rats... great job guys a Biden presidency is awesome for the Republican Party. The whole idea is to stay marginalized and let the established elites and their corporate hacks keep the minions in line because Washington knows best. Winning strategy.
Considering the worse rioting is in places that have the most homogeneously Democrat city officials I don't see why Biden in office would make a difference.
That’s so excellent to hear! So of course you’re voting Joe Biden.
What is Joe Biden?
Then California letting non citizens vote should be something you’re strongly against. As well as foreign companies and citizens donating to Super PACs, leveraging foreign relationships and banking systems to create defamatory statements. Yet, the clintons and Biden did all that.
Well i mean, Bernie is in the same place she's in..campaigning for his good friend Joe Biden....so ummmm
i think that’s completely right and is actually a fairly sizable factor in why i like biden’s chances. people are exhausted
Republicans for Biden
You realize Biden and Obama did that too?
*Slaps down 100 dollars.*  I think Biden wins.  Hillary was super close to beating Trump, and people hated her.  Biden isn't more liked, but he's definitely less hated.  Trump is also very, very hated, so I expect liberal voters to actually go out and vote this time.
This is your best video so far. I love the way you picked &amp; edited the current footage and all of the little touches that you really have to pay attention to notice - like the can of Goya being thrown at dump. Then the finish with the TV changing the channel to Biden. Excellent!
Trump is going to smash the ever loving fuck out of Biden.
Yeah super trash choice to keep the status quo. It's like he felt like since he made it out of something terrible so everyone must be good now. "Like it's not as bad as it was before I helped make change". That's the Biden mentality. No empathy for the youth and clearly everyone.
When did I blame him?  I never blamed Obama or Biden, and I never blamed Trump.  Only fools would put the blame on 1 person for a virus, while at the same time meeting by the 1000s where not every1 is not following precautions

Shouldn't the Biden voters wait to find out who Biden's VP pick is before declaring their allegiance?   Or are they just gonna vote for whomever the DNC selects?  We all know Biden isn't going to be running anything.
Democrats have failed to 'live up' to their pledges&amp; promises in th past …why stop now? Dont be surprised if #basementjoe Biden chooses comrade Sanders [who btw brings much more to th table in th form of unification&amp;votes] over a promise to pick a black woman as his running mate
You mean to tell me “if Joe Biden gets elected your nana is gonna die” wasn’t a good messaging strategy? Shocked pikachu
We can be brothers after the much-ballyhooed Biden administration enacts such policies into law. I would also prefer if 10 million people didn't lose their homes in an economic crisis during that time, but haven't been able to figure out if neolibs were in favor of that outcome.
Same. Whomever. Whatever. Biden for my life.
I am voting for Biden because all the bad shit Biden will do won’t be broadcast on Twitter and brunch is more enjoyable that way. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

Listen just because liberals are so good at lying and just oblivious to telling the truth and now starting to believe their own lies doesn't mean "we'yall" are losing. We didn't lose against Hilary like "ya'll" predicted and we are not losing now. Biden wins we all lose !!

Actually, I was joking (I do that a lot on Twitter). I just said 20 slaves because she appears on the $20 bill. Seriously, though, although I applaud her role in history, I don't think she's a good choice for the $20 bill. However, I understand Joe Biden invited her to be his VP.
Blacks should be the ones that are terrified, Biden and Willie’s girl are responsible for locking up more of them than Confederates did back in the day.
Was just thinking that  would've been absolutely best choice for VP before  made that dumb, dumb commitment for VP before he looked at everyone.   O'Rourke inspires young people and excites a crowd. In future, think before mouth engages.
You don’t vote for the President!  You vote for his Electors!  Each state has at least three Electoral votes!  Thus, states like California and New York can’t decide who becomes President!  Candidates want to win strategic states!  Biden already has CA &amp; NY! He needs much more!

Not sure what you mean.  The odds of Biden winning are currently much better than marginal.  Of course so much can change by November.   If you truly believe this, you should immediately get on a betting site and put big $ on Trump.  He’s a +150 dog right now.

He looked just as bad as Biden...I personally didn't watch it .. I didn't want to hear all the lies !
I believe Kamala Harris will make an excellent running mate with Joe Biden 2020.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
Then I'm sure you won't be voting for Biden
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
Nope...But there is a pretty good video of Joe Biden dropping the N word like it is his job.
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
There are tulsi supporters who actually thinks this is a possibility. What are they thinking , I’m ex-YangGang and it drives me nuts when people tweet , Biden gonna put Yang in a position. Lol never gonna happen.
That’s what you’re worried about? Alice convincing Bob to vote for Biden instead of Donald, in the privacy of their own home? The horror! My lord, Donald is worse off than I thought.  Fuck 😬
Everytime Biden opens his mouth he gives more votes to Trump. Just wait til Texas finds out what Biden wants to do with the oil. More votes for Trump.
Biden has no chance.

Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.

Just like supporting a pedophile like Joe Biden doesn't matter to you, does it? How much video evidence do you need to see of him rubbing on children? Or do you enjoy grown men rubbing on children?
That’s fine Biden will raise your taxes &amp; defund the police. I’ll go with Trump 2020
You know Biden is not going to be running against you even though he's the nominee for now right? convention switch up.
What if Biden picked Obama to be his VP?  Doh!

Still didn’t answer the question.  Do you even know what the qualifications to be President are?  If Biden knew how to fix the country why didn’t he tell Obama
You know what.. I apologize. No disrespect. Please wake up. Please 🙏!! This ain't about Trump or Biden tbh. It's so much bigger than that. Are you willing to share with me why you would like to vote for Biden?
Truth hurts doesn’t it? Biden will raise your taxes &amp; defund the police. Go ahead and vote for Biden
Anyone who does not cast a vote for Trump is an idiot. What did Obama do for us in the 8 years he was president? Biden wants to raise taxes &amp; defund the police.

I'm trying not too, it is just getting scary more and more. As I know Biden will put me out of work, and everything I have worked for and am working to achieve will be destroyed. As I work for my money and what I have, it shouldn't be given to people who don't want to work.

Anyone believe that George HW Bush, Gore, Biden, or Pence did not have presidential ambitions when they were picked?  I guess these Dems must have a special love for Dick Cheney. Other than his dumb FP, I’m not hating on Cheney. Not sure his lack of ambition made him a better VP.
This line of attack is gross and sexist. Does anyone wonder why George HW Bush, Gore, Biden, or Pence agreed to be nominated?  I’m sure these people tearing down Kamala Harris are all yuge fans of Dick Cheney. That guy was simply a hard working public servant who did his best.

Biden has put his support behind the people actually running the cities. Biden literally stated he agrees with the mayors here. So no, it’s not a lie.

If the Green Party came back and had any chance of winning (and selected a good candidate instead of the DNC's pick) I'd vote against Biden. At this point he'll have to do something real horrible to have me vote against him. We can't afford 4 more Trump years.

Like who? Joe Biden and his son? Ripping China and Ukraine for millions? Working folks? Gimme a break. The only ones undermining our democracy is the Democrat party and Democrat controlled #fakenews media.
No to 45. Yes to Biden. And now I follow you! That should help the ratio a little..😁 ✌❤
I look at this way. I don't think Biden could come up with an idea that good. He can't even complete a sentence with out stuttering. Go on Twitter and then the proof is right there no matter what people say. Ask the person to explain this and then show then the proof.

VOTE LIKE BIDEN IS 20 POINTS DOWN .. BEAT THIS CANCER NAMED TRUMP
From what I’ve seen on Twitter people are pushing Elizabeth Warren they’re also pushing the 25th amendment if Biden wins. My hopes is Biden will pick a black woman for VP.
Remember, while you are gardening, a project Trump and his kids thought up for you to do, THIS is what  &amp;  were contributing to this country. Can't wait 2 have role models again in the White House.  We deserve better than U, lady.
My guess is that Biden will not make his selection based on Dodd's gripes — but if he was planning to choose someone other than Kamala for a different reason, Dodd just created a headache for him.
To follow that up, what does Biden's program cost? What will my public option fee be? I am going to need specific numbers.
Do you think NRA and/or support for what it supports ends with the election of Biden?  I don't and I fear that what Biden does that is right here is likely to be overturned in time unless there is a differently educated public to vote for what is sensible and humane.
Well yes Biden supporters aren’t cult like.
Chris Dodd running around bitching and moaning while Biden probably like “yeah, she kicked my ass that night but I still got the nomination so...”
Hércules fencing to protect the bunker btch! White House continues buildinfg 13-foot high ‘anti climb’ wall. The first thing Reagan did when he was elected was to remove the solar panels carter installed at the WH. The first thing Biden will do will Tear down this wall.
I don't like funding it with taxes. The fact that people believe the govt needs "funding" is an outdated idea. However, what I care about is cost. Biden caps the cost of insurance at 8%, but that does not include copays, deductibles. Only the monthly payment.
It already is funded by the poor, if they even have insurance. We all pay for it. We should all pay less for it. Thinking Bernie planned to place the burden on those he fought for his entire life, while Biden was trying to cut SS, in completely disingenuous.
Don’t care and not playing into this media narrative. Biden will choose.
Me too... Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Biden victory would bring an end to what the person described as the 'venal corruption' of the Trump era.
I'll bet Biden picks Susan Rice...
Karen Bass would be who I think Biden should pick for VP
Right. I have to think the Biden team understands this is a risk and that will be part of their decision.
Nice piece of fiction. Nice to have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight. I do recall the DEMS criticism of the China travel ban and Biden even called it xenophobic. By the way why isn’t Biden doing the presentation? Does Biden even know about this?
Joe Biden is on standby until ,Jan 21
Under Bernie's plan, if you earn $40k, your total payment for healthcare, not insurance, for the year, regardless of what care you needed, would $400. $60k would be $1200. Please show the math were Biden competes with that.
Oh no you're right if Joe Biden wins there will be more democratic mayors and governors that will allow their cities to burn just as easy as some of the ones now!
No, in 100 Days..   will become a 2 term president... and you sleepy joe...will be in your basement Wondering what Happened....? The people are tired of your High taxes coming,your non response to the nation violent protesters, and you “ Still Don’t Get it, Biden?
Biden has no chance. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
To Biden a Touring test is one where he can find his basement with both hands.  Beware, Biden might ask you out behind the woodshed.
Get some real sleep, and probably bake a celebratory pie or cake, or cookies woohoo, it’ll be celebration, I’ll bake it all oooh apple pie, yes, you know “as American as apple pie, I’ll bake an apple pie, I’m super excited just thinking about President Biden, nice ring to it🇺🇸
Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
So, are the Dems planning on using the Electoral College to elect Hillary as the VP? 1) They hate the EC. So abuse of it might cause a change 2) State laws may bind electors for President...do they include VP? 3) What if Biden chooses noone. Who decides who the electors vote for?
Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
How, by Prosecuting criminals and freeing innocent people like Flynn? Dems are trying to rig cause they know Biden is a rapist pedophile with dementia, he couldn't beat his way out of a wet paper bag.
I’ll start worrying in earnest about the damage Trump will do between then and Biden’s inauguration.
Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
Biden has signs of dementia. He is helpless without a teleprompter. His people also turned down a interview request with Chris Wallace.
Traveling across Nevada today I saw 100’s of Trump signs, flags, and bumper stickers. Zero and I mean ZERO Biden. Got to tell us something.
Mike, Biden has no chance to defeat Trump.
Can you please show me the evidence? He had a 4% tax on income after 30k. So more than half of America would pay nothing. That would not be the case under Biden's plan. Biden also includes copays, deductibles adding more cost. Insane to think his plan is cheaper.
You're supporting Joe Biden you won't be for long. The very second you see what he's going to turn America into, you will go right back to the smack. I'm a recovering addict myself and I'm supporting Trump because I support Law and Order not rioting and chaos.
Hey Eric:  Pretty obvious Biden’s handlers do not want him to sit for an hour interview.   His dementia will be obvious.  Taking bets that Biden will refuse to debate.  Covid will be the excuse.   MJ
And Chris Wallace will throw up softballs to Joe Biden too. That just tells you that he’s only going to go on MSDNC and CNN
Joe Biden is black?
#BasementBiden is still in hiding.    I'm betting his mental decline is increasing. He isn't to be trusted on direct questioning.   Prepared questions from reporters they can control.  #JoeBidenHasDementia #joebiden #ChrisWallace
I agree!  People just aren’t going to associate Warren and Biden unless she is nominated for VP.  Candidates meet with lots of people aren’t hanging on the latest inside baseball tic toc of who met with who.
When you tried to argue that Biden's plan is better than Bernie's and cheaper for the low income people, I had to turn the pod off.
Covid pal... are you that thick headed? Hardly the president’s fault... I think China may have been a factor. Biden will bow to China and become even richer if he’s elected.
My mind is made up as far as who im voting for social-media has nothing to with my decision...Biden!!
I wish all 5k of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It probably was just a prop for a photo opportunityOr if it was trump JR who took 1.5B$ from China instead of hunter Biden
Biden still wants to take away our guns, which again, is against our rights. You can’t just change the constitution bc you want to, it has to go through proper procedure

So what we saving it from?  The only thing i can figure is his disastrous presidency and even more disastrous handling of the pandemic.  I think maybe you spelled joe Biden's name wrong.  Cause he will save America from the mess that is Trump.

6 Reasons why #OBOZO and #basementjoe Biden would have BOTCHED the #Coronavirus Response  #KungFlu #COVID19
Now I know I am dealing with someone who is either too lazy or too stupid to get the facts.   I live in Vegas. Biden is a huge favorite. He’s also a huge favorite on Betfair (the largest betting exchange in the world - but you knew that).  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
I feel the same. I mean, Biden is 78! So I just assumed the VP pick would be groomed to be the next nominee. Not to mention Kamala was already vetted pretty well during the primaries.
Fake news.Stay off cnn and MSNBC is controlled by commies.Yall sheeple believe it and think joes a good guy.Trump is 10 times the man biden would or ever could be.Trump has put more pedifiles in jail than the past 4 presidents combined and that enough to get me &amp; my familys vote!
You DO realize that Biden HASN’T released a list of who he’s considering, RIGHT???  A lot of the name out there are Media speculation based on the fact that Biden has been seen with them!  I’m guessing it’s down to Demmings, Rice, and $hillary 2.0 aka Harri$!
I mean... I'm not a Christian, but I don't begrudge politicians speaking at Christian seminars.  Same with any religion, really.  Bass isn't my favorite candidate, but this isn't a big deal.
Biden has either. Neither have I now that I think about it. Tweet me on Nov 4th and we will see which of the two has still not lost one.
I believe Biden will ruin our country and we will be taken over. Heard of the NWO? That, of course, is in revelation and I believe it bc God tells us it will happen. Too many things the left is doing right now, line up with the end times

Most of their followers are mindless. That's what they count on.
Oh please. You think Biden doesn’t already know about this crap? This is coming out because all the Veep camps are at war. Harris was never inevitable, neither is Bass or Rice or Demings or or or... no one knows s**t lol
Lots of vetting happening, is my guess. The last thing this election needs is a VP pick with serious skeletons in her closet. The Trump ops will do everything they can to discredit and dehumanize Biden’s VP. Any transgression will be amplified and weaponized.
Okay, imagine a White House with Biden and Pelosi? I shutter when either speak. They should go all-in and have her as VP! Can you imagine the conversations? Eeek!

This is 100% right on. These are strong, talented women. No matter which one Biden picks, we must support the team. There IS NO OPTION!
If Biden turns around this mess and gets America out of the second Great Depression he will coast to re-election if he runs. If voters are so itching for a woman President why did Biden trounce all the female candidates in this primary?
yeah, and it's a list of like a dozen candidates. She's "gained traction" per this cnn article, but it doesn't necessarily consider her a favorite. Wordings murky, as I'm sure sources intended. They might be just testing the waters. I trust the campaign.
Think Biden could get up and down those stairs? #Biden  #Nope
why are so many in my feed freaking out about this? He hasn't picked his VP candidate yet. She was speaking TO scientologists. It's a quack "religion," but let the #Biden campaign vet.

suddenly he turns into joe biden...lol
Lmao the Dems won’t even discuss Biden’s allegations
Fauci was in the same position under OBAMA/BIDEN  and I take it they had a CDC protocol back then. They obviously didn't follow it then if they waited 4+months after the WHO called it a pandemic. Stopped counting cases, didn't restock PPE and ventilators.  We didn't see him.

BLM (funded by the left) has already started taking away our freedom of speech. And Biden wants to take away our guns. 1st and 2nd ammendments. Our freedom is being taken, you just don’t care
It’s a typical true comment. You are voting based on how you FEEL about Trump, instead of what will happen to our country if lead by Biden. Nobody is voting for Biden bc they think he’ll be a good president, they are voting for him bc they hate Trump. That’s not a good reason
Opinions are great, we all have them, but the choice of whom he picks as VP running mate is strictly Joe Biden's. Let's please try to calm down on all the guesses and in-fighting among us, please?  I can wait a little while.
That’s the problem. I can predict exactly what will happen if Biden is elected. They will kick him out of office on account of his dementia, then we will be run by the radical left. Biden is just a puppet for them
Neither will Biden. How about abolishing #COVID19 ?
Let’s be real here: Biden doesn’t even do the tweeting. He doesn’t even know what Twitter is. He also won’t ever be President.
Biden needs a a diverse cabinet. Not just race and sex but idology. He needs centrist to progressive dems. Everyone will need to work together.   Remember the No drama Obama cabinet. Joe might be trying to recreate it. Anyone who does not play well with others should be avoided.
Needs a spark? Do you not realize everyone has been waiting months to vote Trump out? Get out of the DC bubble. Americans don’t care who the VP choice is. That’s why dems coalesced around Biden so quickly. The normal rules of politics are dead this year.
Joe Biden has grown on me now that I’ve seen him move

It will be all over for Biden when he’s announce VP.
She is dynamic. But in looking at longevity an party dynamics she will be either 75 or 79 when she made a Presidential run after Biden and that is too old. She will make a great cabinet member but I am not sure we want to possibly lose a Senate seat.

Lol Biden as President would be a total puppet for radicals like AOC, Comrade Bernie, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tilab, etc. who continue to show a lack of respect for our country.  I seriously doubt Joe can even have a coherent thought on his own anymore.
Barr’s Testimony May Have Revealed Another Obama-Biden Scandal

Barr’s Testimony May Have Revealed Another Obama-Biden Scandal
Why do they need Security? Security = Police and Police are bad Afraid the Bernie/Biden Bros gonna be naughty?
Let's be honest here  Joe Biden probably doesn't know what a DM is
America has been so much since Trump is the president. The last clowns were terrible, Obama/Biden.
Thats adorable that some intern paid to run a pro Biden account follows you, and you are over here orgasming over it.

You're a joke there Mr. Biden.  AND you would be funny if you weren't so dangerous.  🤬
AMEN!!! Seems like his political loyalist running the post office is trying to screw up mail-in voting delivery. Also, people could remind him that he's never received a human rights award like JOHN LEWIS, HILLARY, PELOSI, OBAMA, BIDEN, and...
15 Million  jobs under Obama/ Biden !!!
He has no clue how hard it would be to fake a ballot. It's not as if it's a piece of paper with two boxes (Biden vs Trump). It has a whole slew of items, many specific to local races. They are sealed. Signed on the outside &amp; must match what is on file. This list goes on &amp; on...

Is that another bot account?  Sounds like the name of a bot account.  It will read: Moms for Biden with the handle ( or something.   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Don’t have the luxury of not voting for Biden.   We can still fight for change, it doesn’t end there.
I'm bracing myself for the eventual disappointment of Biden's VP pick. Only because he's signaled from the start it would only be someone like minded. He needs to pick a Progressive, badly. Even before ImPOTUS, the status quo was causing the US to fall far behind other nations.
Biden allies try to wreck Kamala Harris' vice presidential chances with tired, sexist attacks
Joe Biden will be wonderful at creating jobs if your last name is Biden, other than that what kept him for creating jobs when he was VP?
He forgot Biden saying fuck it, and sending every Trump enabler in the House, Senate, and Supreme Court to Guantanamo for indefinite detainment, because REPUBLICAN jurisprudence states a President has unlimited authority while in office.
Herman Cain’s wife for Biden’s VP
Lmao imagine looking at Joe Biden and saying that he’d install an “Afrocentric Marxist dictatorship”
At this rate I like many others don’t even care who gets elected anymore, Trump and Biden are two sides of the same coin. Neither will clean up the mess or help our country. They will put personal gain above all else as per usual. Either way we’re all screwed atm.
MARIE HARF SHOULD LOSE HER JOB 4 HER REMARKS ABOUT POTUS WANTING MORE PROBLEMS IN PORTLAND R ANYWHERE! She is as dumb as Joe Biden!
No one has told it to me, in fact I never see any media pushing what I am saying. Everything I believe comes straight from the Bible. The Bible tells of what is going to happen in the end, and it’s being played out by the left as we speak. If Biden wins, this country is done for
I just noticed that POTUS Trump has 84.4m Twitter followers and Joe Biden has 7.5m.  No wonder Dems are scared. That's a little bit of an enthusiasm gap.  Bwahahaha!!!
Snopes is your go to?!? Lolololololololololo Yeah, it’s nearly as “unbiased” as CNN. Good one, I needed that laugh.  Fake news is right.  Dumbass Biden admitted on camera to strong arming the Ukraine to drop the investigation into Hunter. #WhereIsHunter
Are you referring to Biden.
Democratic chairman subpoenas Pompeo for documents related to Biden, Burisma
The President is trying to work with a party that prefers to sit on their hands.We can all see it, the MSM can see it and are now airing the disconnect.But more telling is that the MSM in print and on air are noting the unresponsive nature of not only Biden but the Dem leadership
Love it but I'm pretty sure this one is fake.  Had me going until Tiger King.  He's so out of touch I don't think he knows what Netflix is (or else he would shut himself about Obama's content deal with them)
During the Obama administration,  the unemployment rate dropped from about 10% to 4.8%  We are now at 11.1%  Sort of seems like Biden might be the way to go...
It's also a crucial time for the proper authorities to take a closer look at Joe Biden and his lengthy history of groping children.  If he's this brazen in public, imagine how much worse he is behind closed doors...
Please pick Karen Bass. PLEASE. I can't wait.
To be fair, if Joe Biden was actually in control of the account, I would lol
Trump will win in a landslide besides the mas boter fraud coming from the corrupt Dems.  The polls showing Biden has a chance are completely phony.
I will b the 1st 2admit that the 2 choices there are aren't great. However, ppl change. Who Biden is now is better than who he was. Ppl change. I am different than who I was. 2nd, dealing w/ a closet racist is better than an overt. At least the closet knows...1/
He must have been tweeting his endorsement of Biden.
Trump is President . Correct. But the lineage is contextual. It’s contextual in campaign sense because Biden is running of of that 8 year legacy. If the very resume of the democratic front runner is going to have a history of hypocrisy…It’s probably worth mentioning in 2020 race
Hey, check out this cool site I found:  #Topic via  Yep the President is right, FB suspended me again for poking fun at democrats, Donna Brazile,  and Joe Biden!!!
The very good  documentary about Alex Jones and his influence on Trump leads to the following question: is Trump struggling to beat Biden because of how much harder it is to start viral conspiracy theories about him?
Nonsense, of course. Unemployment went from 10%+ to 4% under Obama/Biden. SLIGHTLY worse with Trump. As in “Great Depression” worse. You really need to consider where we are right now, instead of before the pandemic. That was on Trumps watch.

Look at the dates. Who the hell was running the FBI? Obama/Biden AG Was who at the time? To say the inaction by the AG during this time was to protect those high profile names is looking extremely likely. Barrs DOJ is kicking ass. Dershowitz is toast.

I’ve seen  a vote Democrat, but not a “Biden” one
#GropingJoe Biden... living child molester
skip, unlike #YouAintBlackJoe  Trump actually writes his own tweets.  Biden has his staff write tweets for him.
Epstein and Maxwell deliberately courted every influential figure in order to make themselves more influential by association. This is not to say Trump is necessarily innocent though.
I know it's a Friday, but can Biden please announce his VP today?
I think it's a valid point though. Whether it's Biden or Trump, young people are getting screwed either way.
I've been a real Conservative Republican all my life and I'll vote for President Trump again. As will every Republican i know, plus all of the democrats i know are solidly voting for Trump. The only people I know that are voting for Biden are those on the dole.
The reason why next year will be excellent is because Biden will be president.
If you’re still voting democrat you’re not paying attention or you’ve lost your mind.  Released Epstein files implica Clinton. Democrat cities murder rates skyrocket. Mayors and governors don’t protect their citizens.  You’re either crazy or evil if you’re voting Biden
#democratscrackmeup ...politicians such as #basementjoe Biden are not the higher power they pretend to be #KUNGFLU #COVID19
I completely agree. So let's start by building homeless shelters and free medical clinics next to #GeorgeSoros, #Obama, #Clinton, #Biden, #Pelosi and #Schumer . . . because , evidently, they care much more about the poor (and #China) than #Trump does. I'd pay MORE taxes for that!
Obama and Biden are honorable men. Trump is immoral, corrupt incompetent, criminal, and traitorous.
“Joe Biden defunded the police while vice president, and nobody noticed it at the time.”  Sick burn.
Biden is Clinton's puppet.
Who y’all think Biden choosing as his VP?
Biden is going to be an excellent president. Trump will be answering for his crimes.
Miami Vice? So you used the Delorean to go back to the 80's when Biden was still coherent and Kamala Harris had her mouth full of Willie Brown?  I know it's hard to watch the DNC/BLM/Antifa #ShitShow but THAT is who you are. #dealwithit #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020
Yes.. Biden 2020!
Hey I'm not the one who has to explain why Biden can't finish a sentence or why it's okay for thousands of people to shop Walmart, Target, etc. but we need MAIL IN BALLOTS (so the DNC can rig the election). That's all you bro.  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #Trump2020Victory

Poll: Donald Trump Leads Joe Biden by Two Points in North Carolina  via
Not to mention Joe Biden‘s hands are not gonna be flying all over in the front of the camera. How many times have millions of Americans wished Donald Trump‘s hands were handcuffed when he was giving some kind of a speech or a briefing or a press conference?
😂😂😂😂😂 There you go again still dwelling on previous conspiracy theories from 2016 and back. You obviously are huge Kool-Aid drinker because you don’t realize the same things that you were accusing Joe Biden, Trump has been very effectively being guilty of.
I he'll from San Jose &amp; lived there  35  years of life. She was AWFUL in Alameda &amp; must b ignored here too. A vote 4 Biden is a vote 4 her to be President CAUSE Biden won't do a dam thing, she will push him aside
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It “You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I”m President” .. YES PLEASE.  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
She'd have a better chance at this if we weren't at SHOCKING levels of unemployment  AND  If Obama/Biden hadn't guided us out of the Great Recession (caused by our last GOP president).  Man - GOP is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with these arguments.
Considering that Biden might pick Kamala Harris as VP which I think is likely and I predicted that for some time makes me want vote for him even less because I really am not a fan of her either  At times she's even more repulsive to me than Biden
How many lies do you hear in the new Joe Biden commercial. I see three. Bailed out bank's. Not Americans. Health care. The worst most corrupt in American history. Ebola. W.H.O.
We all feel the same Unfortunately Trump is just that bad because I'll be honest as much as ans long as been a democratic voter I've been my whole life it was between Joe Biden and a generic Republican who was moderate I wouldn't vote for either one
No I agree with  on this one   It's wishful thinking though but we're not gonna lie to ourselves about the reality For me a vote for Biden is just a vote against Trump nothing more nothing less
I guess I can say Biden even though he has terrible political instincts and terrible policies and half brain dead he is not a terrible human being like Hillary Clinton is but he is likely to pick Kamala Harris for VP a former prosecutor yuck these dem man terrible lol
Great and the sad truth is it's looking like Biden is going to pick Harris as VP and now that I know all this is gonna make it that much harder to have to vote for the lesser evil I do know Trump has go but dam how many more shits sandwiches and crows do I have to eat
This describes Biden’s handlers, the hidden people behind the curtain!
😂😂😂 Biden can choose Donald Duck and beat trump
I'd feel so owned if they boycotted the election and I was stuck with Biden. Man, don't even know how I'd handle that.
So now  wants a racist beta male as POTUS! You know, “you ain’t black if you don’t vote for me” Biden.
How many times did Biden lose a primary and he was selected to be VP? Bernie lost in 2016 and he still had a fan base. Why are you white men so baffled by this?
Yeah she turns off people like me. I hate Latin commies. They better not even consider her. I am still voting for Biden, but I know others that this would be a deal breaker
Call me not surprise Harris voted  against a cut in the Pentagon and military budgets she totally sucks she's a complete neoliberal corporatist and of course Biden will probably likely pick her as VP lol
Biden did condemn it 2 days ago
Dishonest Trump was able to distract the media from his horrible GDP numbers, 39% DROP IN GDP, highest in history!  The American people know, they're out of jobs!  President Biden has a huge task ahead of him.
I hate the "settle for biden" campaign.  Why settle when you can revolt?
? XD thank you for defending an old white male rapist, totally is going to change literally anything when biden gets elected, like the fact that I am still going to be without healthcare and I will still lose my rights as a queer person
🤣😂🤣😂Biden stealing the election😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣::::deep breath::::😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  Does Biden even know he’s in the election?
Racial injustice does NOT exist. It’s being broadcasted by fake news to get you to vote for Biden. Those that fall for it are idiots.
Biden is China’s best friend!
Man, more tightening and bad news for Biden. It's honestly getting to the point where Biden should just drop out.
"leftists" *has biden 2020 in bio*
stop biden is not going to be president. Trump might not be president either. Trillion percent biden won’t be president.hell he might not even be running by say end of September he will become ill or something the old bait and switch.

i agee lets get it over already before the dems. Can do their bait and switch or cheat.cause the biggest number in the universe is how much we no biden will not be president.
Good grief! My DOG would be better than Trump! He’s a lunatic! Not worried at all. Biden is respected &amp; savvy enough to surround himself with SMART staff and actually listen to them! And he’s going to have a top notch VP at his side. We’re going to be juuuuust fine. #Biden2020
Um, no. He can get 47% and Biden probably gets 51-52% and that's a blowout. This isn't 2016 with 3rd parties. He gets 46% and it's 2008 or worse on November 3rd.
Biden is promoting only Science research will stop the Virus. Atheist? When did Americans lose Faith in God as their savior? Democrats are bearing false witnesses as Christian's. I better not see one in church! LOL
Why hasn't Biden been tested for the virus yet? He's running around campaigning and he could be the one who's killing these Americans.
Presidential Election is FREEDOM vs SOCIALISM. It’s  who has kicked ass 4 ALL OF IS; or  who can’t complete sentences! RULE OF LAW vs DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA! Biden would allow Antifa, BLM, 2 run America! Murder everywhere?  is ONLY CHOICE
The other thing is Joe Biden is trying redo the same thing failed policies.Uncanny how their campaigns aren't much different.Maybe that's why Obama isn't campaining hard for Biden. He'd be a liability. It would be a reminder of Obama's administration. Oh,yeah Joe was there too!
Biden is a worse decease for our country than COVID. He would certainly kill it.
Three months ago Joe Biden predicted trump would try to delay the election.  At the time, trump said Joe was wrong.  #trumpFail #Biden2020

Biden is doing about as well as Hillary was doing in 2016. If memory serves, that went well for her.
And Biden said that Trump is the first racist president ever you're looking at the first one and the only one he's the one who divided our country for 8 f****** years and it's still divided because of his horseshit crap that he did.
I am so sorry for your loss. 😞 I know how painful it is to lose a parent. It's heart wrenching. However, Trump took action on a travel ban as soon as he found out &amp; Biden shamed him for it up until March said he was fear mongering. Now they're trying to say Biden never said that
If Trump had died during this presidency, we would have been stuck with Pence... That’s scarier than any left anything. Gay, trans and civil rights would be N/A. The 2020/Biden ticket is a gamble but so was 2016 and look where we are now.

Maybe so, but a patriot supports our cntry. A patriot would never support illegally taking away our 1st and 2nd amendments. Supporting Biden, by default, supports taking away our constitutional rights. Little by little they will take more and more freedoms away

Biden HAS adopted many progressive policies but it's never enough for them. He's been working on policy w/Bernie and co. They're acting like he hasn't made any concessions. Biden's moved so far to the left that he lost important endorsements. He needs to stop courting berners.

Everyone was rejected by the voters expect Biden sir..At this moment Kamala is probably the closest to the Presidency than all of those person's you just mentioned.. Strategy wins my dear...Kamala is very likeable to MANY people. Especially to those who voted for her as Senator
Clearly Biden was the best they could come up with, any1 else would have been better
WTF that’s so messed up. Would anything change if Biden were to become elected? Would that help at all? That’s so messed up how someone paying taxes and living like any other person basically tossed to the curb. I fucking hate this country more each day
You became a huge disappointment you should know better that the Democrat bill was full of pork and nonsense. In addition, you endorsed Joe Biden you should be ashamed of yourself.
are you mad that Bernie will be campaigning to elect Biden and his possible VP Harris? Because it seems like all of you are..now it makes sense
How do you sleep at night knowing you support a lunatic.  Biden will win, we will vote...our lives depend on it!!

Please vote for Biden.
&lt;Shrugs&gt; Even if the FEC found something wrong, you know the IMPEACHED, FAILED CORONAVIRUS-AWOL "president" will ignore it, as he ignores the law. Gawd, we need OBAMA, or BIDEN, or HILLARY, or JOHN LEWIS, or ROMNEY, or PELOSI running the government on behalf of The People.
If he wins the Dems will off him.  Understand they have a plan for who will ultimately run this country if they steal the election.  Biden is so out there that he can’t see the train rolling down the tracks on him.  Luckily he won’t be winning anyway.
Joe Biden has 3 feet in the grave and cannot even formulate words into sentences!  Ill take my chances with Trump anyday
bernie shouldnt be talking lol! dude literally quit knowing he had a bigger chance against trump than biden lol

Gotta answer my own question. The date posted was 9 days before Trump was sworn in. Fauci knew that his bosses at the time Obama/Biden were leaving office with the cupboards bare. Not hard for him to predict the incoming administration to not be fully prepared.
I'm hoping Biden picks Brazille as his VP nominee.  And Harf as his Sec State. Juan Williams as his Press Sec'y. Tarlov as liaison with fellow commie governments. Maybe then I could enjoy Fox News again.
Dems LIKED Hillary and she lost. Dems don't even like Biden.  If he gets even close to winning, I'm betting the DNC rigged votes like they got caught doing last election.
Biggest battle of 2020?  Trump vs Biden?  Nahh  Polk vs Negreanu!  (Insert comical joke from Doug about more rake or illegal handicap parking)

I don’t think Biden rides around in a van.
So wrong.    Tho, lets see who’s “terrified” when it’s DEBATE TIME!    What do you think Danny Boy, are they gonna pull a “Covid-con” and let someone debate for Biden???    No can do, bro... the PEOPLE want to see the CANDIDATES debate!  (Even tho Biden is a sock puppet).
Too bad Biden couldnt
Interior Minister Bormann's own Sicherheitsdienst. The entire Federal security apparat needs to be brought to heel and completely overhauled the day Biden is sworn in.
I only meant that in that I feel go do your homework is less powerful than just citing sources and giving the full values for people to see. I’m more of a Biden sided person, tearing down the Police is dangerous and scary. They need more funding so that every side can be safer.

Fair question, but I'd like to see direct evidence of this. Not hearsay. Unlike Biden who was relatively poor (By politician standards) &amp; became rich BY their "Public Service" Like many others did on both sides. Is your stance based on fact, likelihood or personal dislike?
Which Biden stooge typed this? You know he's not winning. I didn't know dementia was contagious?

I don’t want to wait till midnight pacific to hear Donald Trump has defeated Joe Biden.   I want it to be quick and painful for the Democrats; perhaps they will feel a small portion of the pain they have brought to this President in his first term   Then POTUS needs to open it up
Biden has been a much savvier campaigner than I expected
Yes, short of death nothing could keep me from voting for Biden on 11/3....straight blue ticket💙
3 swamp rats... great job guys a Biden presidency is awesome for the Republican Party. The whole idea is to stay marginalized and let the established elites and their corporate hacks keep the minions in line because Washington knows best. Winning strategy.
Considering the worse rioting is in places that have the most homogeneously Democrat city officials I don't see why Biden in office would make a difference.
That’s so excellent to hear! So of course you’re voting Joe Biden.
What is Joe Biden?
Then California letting non citizens vote should be something you’re strongly against. As well as foreign companies and citizens donating to Super PACs, leveraging foreign relationships and banking systems to create defamatory statements. Yet, the clintons and Biden did all that.
Well i mean, Bernie is in the same place she's in..campaigning for his good friend Joe Biden....so ummmm
i think that’s completely right and is actually a fairly sizable factor in why i like biden’s chances. people are exhausted
I a 71 year old Army vet not a traitor to my party  If your a republican pushing a Dem agenda your just another Hanoi Jane pushing Communisum   I don’t need another fake dossier to know Trump is the one to lead this nation  Not that blundering Biden  #trump 2020
Republicans for Biden
You realize Biden and Obama did that too?
*Slaps down 100 dollars.*  I think Biden wins.  Hillary was super close to beating Trump, and people hated her.  Biden isn't more liked, but he's definitely less hated.  Trump is also very, very hated, so I expect liberal voters to actually go out and vote this time.
This is your best video so far. I love the way you picked &amp; edited the current footage and all of the little touches that you really have to pay attention to notice - like the can of Goya being thrown at dump. Then the finish with the TV changing the channel to Biden. Excellent!
Who are you?  I hear "I am Joe Biden". Are you the same Joe Biden that for 8 years as VP only talked to the press. The same Joe Biden that states will represent all Americans but will only do fluff pressers.  Do you think so little of us? Or is it you really take us for dupes?
Trump is going to smash the ever loving fuck out of Biden.
Yeah super trash choice to keep the status quo. It's like he felt like since he made it out of something terrible so everyone must be good now. "Like it's not as bad as it was before I helped make change". That's the Biden mentality. No empathy for the youth and clearly everyone.
When did I blame him?  I never blamed Obama or Biden, and I never blamed Trump.  Only fools would put the blame on 1 person for a virus, while at the same time meeting by the 1000s where not every1 is not following precautions

Shouldn't the Biden voters wait to find out who Biden's VP pick is before declaring their allegiance?   Or are they just gonna vote for whomever the DNC selects?  We all know Biden isn't going to be running anything.

You mean to tell me “if Joe Biden gets elected your nana is gonna die” wasn’t a good messaging strategy? Shocked pikachu
We can be brothers after the much-ballyhooed Biden administration enacts such policies into law. I would also prefer if 10 million people didn't lose their homes in an economic crisis during that time, but haven't been able to figure out if neolibs were in favor of that outcome.

Give Biden a go at all this COVID shit, tired of seeing Trump's racist ass drag this shit out months on months because he doesn't believe it's real
Biden won't be indicted but his participation in the conspiracy will be reported.
NANCY COP KILLER AMERICAN TAX/MONIES THIEF PELOSI, SCHUMER COP KILLER AMERICAN TAX/MONIES THIEF, NADLER COP KILLER AMERICAN TAX/ MONIES THIEF,  OBAMA GAVE ORDERS 2 BIDEN &amp; HUNTER 2 STEAL AMERICAN TAX/MONIES OK'd AIR FORCE HELLI RIDE TO UKRAINE WITH OUR TAX/MONIES TO EXTORT LEADER
Nevada Governor Sisolak will take taxpayer money to *look a squirrel* about nonsense like "social justice reform" as most of Las Vegas is shut down, unemployed, killing themselves, and leaving the state in droves.  It helps voter fraud for Biden November, works for him...
Listen just because liberals are so good at lying and just oblivious to telling the truth and now starting to believe their own lies doesn't mean "we'yall" are losing. We didn't lose against Hilary like "ya'll" predicted and we are not losing now. Biden wins we all lose !!
Biden doesn't know how to use twitter, but whoever's being paid to run this account is kind of an asshole.
She won't deliver any swing state to Biden as she's from Kalifornia.
QUESTION? WHY DOES PELOSI THINK FOR ONE SECOND THE SAME AMOUNT OF AMERICAN VOTERS + NOW ALL POLICE FIREMEN EMTS AND THEYRE FAMILIES &amp; FRIENDS WILL KNEEL FOR HER OBAMA BIDEN NADLER AND LET THEM TELL WE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL HAVE THEM SHOVE MAIL FRAUD  DOWN OUR THROATS!!!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Wait...did Biden even have a twitter account back then?  It funny I can even remember
Joe Biden does he know where he's at are you kidding me don't destroy my country I'll tell you what free drug needles and free drugs I got an idea you want to hear this idea let's open a camp out in the Mojave desert will make a great you can do all the drugs and all the food
Obama is a tool. A man that can only pull out the race card to make a point. He’s DIVISIVE. He cares nothing about the “people”. He was on his horse today, giving a song-sing speech in a “preacher” voice! Please. We see his game. He’s got a brain dead Biden running.
😂😂😂😂 keep dreaming. Biden 2020! You will be in jail Donald.
Arrest Obama and Biden and put them behind bars. They are disgusting individuals.

My God I look forward to not having to wake up everyday to embarrassing tweets from Biden
Actually, I was joking (I do that a lot on Twitter). I just said 20 slaves because she appears on the $20 bill. Seriously, though, although I applaud her role in history, I don't think she's a good choice for the $20 bill. However, I understand Joe Biden invited her to be his VP.
Blacks should be the ones that are terrified, Biden and Willie’s girl are responsible for locking up more of them than Confederates did back in the day.
Was just thinking that  would've been absolutely best choice for VP before  made that dumb, dumb commitment for VP before he looked at everyone.   O'Rourke inspires young people and excites a crowd. In future, think before mouth engages.
You don’t vote for the President!  You vote for his Electors!  Each state has at least three Electoral votes!  Thus, states like California and New York can’t decide who becomes President!  Candidates want to win strategic states!  Biden already has CA &amp; NY! He needs much more!
Maybe he was talking about voting for Biden.

Joe Biden has a pretty long list of accomplishments, lol.  The only thing Trump has over Biden is the presidency, as Biden has never been President
George Wallace???? Maybe Joe Biden's dementia is rubbing off on obammy???
I really don't know how Biden wins with these numbers. Bad, bad, bad.
You need help, Biden!
As a lifelong Republican I affirm my support for thankfully turned out to be Joe Biden. I made this formal announcement on January 20th, 2017. Get Out The Vote......
Not sure what you mean.  The odds of Biden winning are currently much better than marginal.  Of course so much can change by November.   If you truly believe this, you should immediately get on a betting site and put big $ on Trump.  He’s a +150 dog right now.
Thanks for endorsing Trump!   Biden sure doesn't speak in complete sentences
All points Joe Biden can pick up on and add to his agenda
Biden is a Virtual candidate, he refused an interview with Chris Wallace, never see him on  live TV interviews!  Biden  is a washed up Senile political Hack!
Biden if he gets the Senate will do Dreamer bull. Watch the meltdown on "conservative" media and here on Twitter.
if you're a Biden supporter it is highly advised NOT to watch  Horribly painful
Hey skip, you’re the founder of “Jews for Biden”?  You do realize that the radical team he has is anti Semitic right?  Geeez skip, I guess history does repeat itself.  Wow. Just wow and SAD.
So,  and Trump are being briefed.... So basically Biden is our President, right?
trump is also a pedophile so you’d be voting for that too but we don’t want biden either, but we have to settle, it’s better than trump.

This nothing more but a Biden flip of you ain’t black if you don’t know to vote for Biden  I’m not Christian enough if I vote for Trump?  Total BS and already used  Find yourself new material or set down and shut up
I’m a Christian and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior  Listening to this proud peacock spouting out his credentials would make Paul shutter  Just when you thought you’ve seen it all a republican preacher selling Biden snake oil
Vote for biden you crack head. 😂😂😂 hes incredibly intelligent. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Says a Dem, yeah right pal  There are two choices Trump or Biden  I can handle 4 more of Trump but not 1 week of Biden  What now pal? Suck your thumb sitting on the sidelines or MAGA
If you haven’t caught on yet, the MSM and Left are pushing mail in voting as the only way to get the election right. Biden. Cheat. Youarearacistifyoudenythis.
Enough already, pick your damn VP and let's get the campaign process on.
This is from April
So is Biden
Never. Interestingly though, every time my husband gets a call from a telemarketer, whether it be for solar or a extended car warranty, he just answers “My family is voting for Biden. No, we are voting for Biden. Mark us down as voting for Biden” They hang up on him and we laugh
He looked just as bad as Biden...I personally didn't watch it .. I didn't want to hear all the lies !
I believe Kamala Harris will make an excellent running mate with Joe Biden 2020.
Trump has come to realize that he cannot defeat Biden. He's grabbing at straws, seeking a way to stay in power.
Is Biden contagious?😳
Then I'm sure you won't be voting for Biden
This is an honest competent poll that weights sample to Census Bureau data on 2016 turnout.  However, it's been shown that CB data undersamples GOP demographics by 2-3 pts.  Reality is more like Trump 50%, Biden 45%.
Nope...But there is a pretty good video of Joe Biden dropping the N word like it is his job.
Next week Biden announces his VP pick.  Hoping it's Kamala Harris.  She is awesome and won't take any crap for trump and his loonies.
There are tulsi supporters who actually thinks this is a possibility. What are they thinking , I’m ex-YangGang and it drives me nuts when people tweet , Biden gonna put Yang in a position. Lol never gonna happen.
That’s what you’re worried about? Alice convincing Bob to vote for Biden instead of Donald, in the privacy of their own home? The horror! My lord, Donald is worse off than I thought.  Fuck 😬
Everytime Biden opens his mouth he gives more votes to Trump. Just wait til Texas finds out what Biden wants to do with the oil. More votes for Trump.
Biden has no chance.

Why is it I get the feeling that Biden has already been elected and the cheating Democrats and MSM are just waiting to announce it in November ? God forbid it !!
Wrong. The Cato Institute did a poll last week which said 62 percent of Americans will not disclose who they support for fear of retribution. Translation: there are more voters voting for Trump than their are voting for Biden.

So it's not necessarily that you want to vote for Biden but because of how you feel toward Trump?
skip, if you really believe that, you’re too stupid to vote.   Also, During 2009 swine flu pandemic, Obama  told states to shut down their testing.  Biden's top advisor has acknowledged that Obama administration didn't do "anything right" to combat that pandemic.  CBS News 2009
No, that’s Biden
Fair enough, but the whole "Settle for Biden" name/message is just pathetic enough to turn some people off.
So what?  Biden helped Porochenko steal $40 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine and launder it through Caribbean bank accounts.  What you should be reporting on is how big a cut Biden and the Democrats got.

No problem Vote Biden your taxes will be higher&amp; let’s not forget he wants to defund the police.

" if you don't vote for me you're not black", " 1 million people have died of the Coronavirus", " actually that's where I used to work down the road" those are all Joe Biden and don't sound very articulate to me.
UBS: Rich Investors Will Be Fine Even If Biden Hikes Taxes
Yeah, all those reports of illegal ballot stuffing and wrong doing are ok, right?  Just like spying on Americans and the Clintons making millions on selling uranium to Russians? Or Biden making his entire family multi millionaires?

Just like supporting a pedophile like Joe Biden doesn't matter to you, does it? How much video evidence do you need to see of him rubbing on children? Or do you enjoy grown men rubbing on children?

You know Biden is not going to be running against you even though he's the nominee for now right? convention switch up.

Still didn’t answer the question.  Do you even know what the qualifications to be President are?  If Biden knew how to fix the country why didn’t he tell Obama
You know what.. I apologize. No disrespect. Please wake up. Please 🙏!! This ain't about Trump or Biden tbh. It's so much bigger than that. Are you willing to share with me why you would like to vote for Biden?
Truth hurts doesn’t it? Biden will raise your taxes &amp; defund the police. Go ahead and vote for Biden

Good bye to your oil. LOL Go ahead and see what Biden said about OIL.Trump 2020

LOL Biden has been in the government for years has done nothing for you or the people of the USA. I know you researched all the bills &amp; executive orders that President Trump signed. More than Obama did in the 8 years he was president. Trump still signing more for us.

This virus came from China! Do you know where China is? It came from China, the Chinese tried to hide it. Our great President close down that damn border and Biden was pissed about the closure of the border. Take your chances with a pedophile.

Voting for Biden promotes rape.  It encourages people who are racists or rapists to become politicians because they are not held to the same standards of everyday people.  They escape any and all accountability.  You. Are. Making. It. Ok. For. Politicians. To. Rape.
Of course I desperately want to see Trump defeated. However I'm concerned about the Biden team pulling it off.  Why?    1/3

will be leaving MSNBC to become Joe Biden's head speech writer. His cut and paste skills will be invaluable to  whose own plagiarism skills are well documented but extremely slow.
Biden is working with a lot of his fellow candidates. Bernie, Tom, Kamala, Elizabeth. That alone shows that anything great is possible.

Sooo THIS is what Hunter Biden has been up to...
All that said, however, you're absolutely right that it could very well go 'bad' with Biden because 'bad' was the plan all along, Trump or not.  But again, if that's the case, no votes will change that in the end.
Wont that highlight exactly whats wrong with the system?  People wont see it for the problem it is, till it affects them.  If Trump wins because the House picks him?  Wow.  That would be a stab in the back by Democrats to theit voters.  If Biden wins, then the GOP will join us.
Trump is the only one we can trust.  America is done if Biden becomes president
I get the impression from the Biden/Obama camp that they do the best they can for the people without biting the hands that feed them and they deeply value the long term strategies planned out by the 'deep state', CIA, Pentagon think tanks that do some hard to understand things.
Average media/university live phone poll in 2016 prior to the eve-of-election herding: Hillary by 8  Average media/university live phone poll in 2020 prior to the eve-of-election herding: Biden by 8  Repeat in 2020?
Then you’d better not vote Biden if you want complete sentences!
Yeah and the thing neither of us can know for sure is if he's a Deep State pawn representing a sudden twist in strategy OR he's a Putin pawn representing a total subversion of long term US agenda.  If its the first, it'll be more interesting to see what happens with Biden. But&gt;
Wow! Why are you talking about Obama and Biden like that?
I'm not thrilled about Biden and even less thrilled about having a Prosecutor as next in command.   Trump won because nobody was thrilled about Clinton/Kaine.  He had the lowest winning vote total since 2000.    DNC needs to throw us a bone if they are serious about voter turnout
He’s not articulate, but he is certainly more with it than Biden. They are now escorting Biden by the arm, to make sure he doesn’t say anything extemporaneous.
Biden still claims he marched during the civil rights movement, despite it being debunked.   Soooo.....you got #BlueTrump as far as Im concerned.
Man....you make my case foe me.  Biden, and his bots/#sheeple/Karens, are no better than #MAGA.  Its time for you to fade into history.
plan for how to go about that, shifting against European alliances and suddenly siding instead with Putin.  If the Deep State planned that and it's just Trump there to give the appearance of rationale for that strategy shift, then they'd be hard pressed to stick with that w/Biden
I have an issue with the Democratic Establishment for defending corporate interests over the peoples.  Biden is just their latest pawn, and he happens to have a extra helping of shit by being a racist rapist.  But hes Most Electable™ so why do you even need our help?  Lol
Oh yes please I need daddy Biden in office to get rid of the police and make everyone in America a trans lesbian 🙄
BIDEN can’t speak for himself!  Obama and the corrupt Democratic Party politicians are killing the party  Because they have NOTHING to convince America they’re right they are destroying the Country   on racism they recreated among us That’s all they got   Excuses NO RESULTS

I will vote for Joe Biden in honor of the great John Lewis.
Vote for Jo then just to scare both parties lol.  I feel like she can legit get between 10-15M votes because Biden and Trump suck ass
He won't be able to appeal to the single minded individuals that have been raised with the ideology of: Man=power.  While bafoon like, Trump can't appeal to Biden's mental acquity... he'd get slaughtered by the media Collusion blew up in his face.  Trump is pissing his diaper
In this scenario the House (2 year cycle) would also not have completed an election, and it would actually to to the Senate Pro Tem (Chuck Grassley) as he would be the only elected official in the line of succession.    If Trump/Biden aren’t elected.... Pelosi isn’t either.
So, by your logic, voting for trump in the primary is just dandy, whereas voting for trump OR biden in the general is an affront to democracy? If Trump believes the system is fair when it comes to the primary he should also think it is fair in the general.
Biden does not have to be threatened, eight years with Obama and dementia have taken a toll on his brain. His plagiarism throughout his political career shows he is not capable of original thought.
Andrew Baumann of  which conducted the poll, also noted that 60% say they would never vote for Trump compared to 31 for never Biden.   "There's a high dislike of Trump, so Biden just needs to give them a reason to vote for him."
Biden's net favorability is at 50-44, compared to Hillary Clinton's July 2016 number of 34% favorable to 63% unfavorable (yikes).   Trump's is actually up in that same period, 31-66 compared to 23-75 in July 2016.
Biden's lead jumps to 58-30 when you look at just likely youth voters in a four-way contest (including Green/Libertarian candidates)  Looks like there's room for either candidate with young independents, though: 22% Biden, 15 Trump, 30 undecided and 12 say they're not voting.
As I recall Eric, the #FakeNewsMedia pretty much ignored the Hunter Biden kerfuffel as much as they could from the start. So it’s no surprise they’d be running away from it now.
Don’t you want to give Biden a little extra time to get his faculties together? 😂
You are still deviding America and turning a eulogy into a Biden campaign since Joe is incapable o doing it himself. Your ego is shining thru and why not acknowledge America voted for a black president 8 years quite a ways from slavery. TRUMP FREED ALICE JOHNSON.

Does this article suggest that big donors are buying Bidens VP pick or that Biden is putting the VP slot up for sale? Either way his campaign is showing its colors... they're not for the common folk, they are beholden to the powerful elite.
He'll try to take the entire nation down the toilet with him after Biden is elected.
Well, that's a point for Biden.  Trump is so predictably contemptible of everything good about America.  GOP knows they are on their way out. Several will try to save themselves.  It won't work.
247 is the exact number of people running the Biden Super PAC,
That's what you need, a good ass whooping. BTW you boy Biden probably won't even make it to election day...
Scary that you actually think you know better. If you vote Biden, and he wins, just remember that you had a hand in taking away our freedom and destroying our country
They are probably watching Obama attack Trump at Lewis’s funeral. And, campaigning for Biden as well!
If they ask me anything...I'm telling them my name is Joe Biden and I approve this message.
Damn Biden, look at you being right about something. Lol
Yes, what’s at stake is our freedom. Vote Biden if you hate America, freedom and God
It's all about stalling to keep General Flynn quiet until after the election. General Flynn knows all about the malfeasance of the obama admin. Of course if he does start talking, it will be the end of the Biden campaign. The Deep State is calling all hands on deck.
Come back. We need you and not Biden
Biden supporter attacks rape survivor by saying "its like getting black folks lynched"  #BidenOutreach2020   I just cant stand these Biden Bros.  I'd vote for Biden, but his supporters are so misogynistic.  #Sheeple
I think a Reagan/Carter-size result is more likely—doesn’t seem like Biden has the momentum or popularity to win 49 States.  However Trump could alienate a lot more people between now and November so you never know.
30 million people set to be evicted next month and you’re tweeting Hunter Biden. Can you say One Term?
#ThursdayThoughts 'SPECTATOR SPORT' Why is #Biden following #IlhanOmars destroy #America lead; Declaring US 'Muslim America'? Elected Congress #Democrats forfeit US without a fight. On their knees begging for their lives they hand US over 2 islamic terrorists to murder for sport.
Joe Biden is credibly accused of sexual assault. Plus he is a racist.
BLM is a joke. We're not victims. To my black brothas and sistas, we built nations, we're Kings and Queens, show it!   We are weak minded that white folks have to save us? Wtf!   Joe Biden is getting the funding from BLM. He's lock up our people. Wake up!
Im all for "Down with Trump"  I just want him to take Biden with him.

Nope.  Obama is his own form of evil.  Just like Biden is.
As I said yesterday, she would be the worst pick for Biden! I love it! In the primary, she got ZERO % of the black vote? As SF DA she locked up black men 4 smoking weed; while doing it illegally herself? She is a nasty, hateful, person. Slept her way 2 her SF jobs! #WillieBrown
Im all for that.  Too bad it isnt priority for Biden....or any other establishment Democrat.  They like their life long #sheeple supported gravy trains.
Trump's base is over twice as enthusiastic as Biden's base.  Literally nothing could stop us from voting on Nov. 3 unless Trump delays the election, which he must.
He is laying the groundwork to claim a fraudulent election after Biden wins. He and his base are going to howl from Nov. 4 until January 20, and beyond. I hope howling is all they do. #NobodyLikesTrump #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Someone is getting nervous over his impending DEFEAT!!  Vote BIDEN in 2020!!  No Delays Permitted!!
Biden admitting the existence of deep state operatives in government jobs! These operatives are ready to reinstate regulations that will increase fuel costs, regulate business with burdensome rules, use the IRS to suppress Comservative groups.
In a forced in-person-voting-election, during a pandemic, what is the likelyhood that Biden benefits the most because those who oppose Trump the most are willing to risk their lives in the #AnythingButTrump Campaign?
But it should concern the Dem party. Those who are just voting against Trump and not for Biden will end up voting for the Republican candidate in 2024. The party should be working to wind them over long term ... but I admit I don't know how.
Yeah he looks like a typical biden voter
Biden. Is. Not. A. Good. Man.  He's a racist.  He's a rapist.  Charming doesn't mean someone is "good".
Biden will surprise everyone and go with Florida’s Andrew Gillum!
People are genuinely pressed I’m voting for Biden but like....I’m not gonna waste my vote for trump or the independent nominee
Wow. Bill Clinton and George Bush are younger than Joe Biden...
Was that DAYS before Trump's inauguration or after? After 8 years of Obama/Biden. Without foreknowledge of Covid-19 was that written with a major flu or reemergence of the swine flu in mind? He knew the feds weren't ready with vaccines or PPE. He knew BHO/JB screwed the CDC.
Inside the Beltway: Reality check: Trump has 5% lead over Biden - Washington Times
Illegitimate Russian asset. I do however love the idea of President Pelosi.  Delay and put Pelosi in office or have the election and put Biden in. You are definitely not the option.
I really don't think you can say it's ALL Biden's legislation.  Yeah, Biden's made some bad votes and promoted some stupid stuff to promote and I know what you're referring to but no legislation goes in on one person's opinions.  This is on many, and has been abused to boot.
🖕tRump and his admin along with complicit GOP, new about the virus in November. Trump and Xi made a deal (quid pro quo) tRump would pretend he didn't know for dirt on Biden and lucrative trademarks. Trump even approved of the  death camps for the uighur Muslims.
Does the open and arrogant dishonesty of Dem politicians piss you off?  If Biden wins the election as the result of mail in ballots, and fraud is discovered, do you think the reaction from conservatives will be:
They should cancel the election until Covid counts drop &amp; Biden comes out of basement and debates President Trump !   They can move it to 2021 ..
Trump Floats Whether to ‘Delay the Election,’ Something He Cannot Legally Do   Trump knows the more people who vote, the harder it is to steal an election. Right?      A call to action! Read, Join. Give.
If Biden wins the election with mail in ballots and any evidence of cheating arises, the left better be prepared, because the backlash is going to make the Antifa/BLM riots look like a field trip.
Joe Biden video with a message to his deep state operatives still in government positions, he wants them to be ready to reinstate the policies of the Obama administration.
You know there is a whole department that handles tax returns and they are very very very good at spotting illegal activity! If there was anything wrong Trump's taxes the IRS would have flagged it long ago! Why won't Joe Biden release a mental competency test?
Yes.  Look at Portland.  Man - is he really that stupid? Maybe he's laying the groundwork for an insanity defense for his crimes?
Biden voted via the basement. Leave him there.
Weird huh? Another crazy prediction: Trump won’t attend Biden’s inauguration. He’ll still be disputing the results
Heaven help us if Biden chooses her
Until the block of white, non-college educated voters is broken up or significantly outnumbered, this is what we'll struggle with. It doesn't matter if it's Warren, Bernie, Biden, or AOC in 2020, the next 4 years are digging out of the whole, not making giant steps forward.
Because Biden is a MUCH better choice...😆
can you run for President? Fuck Biden the DNC need to put you as the nominee!!
Fauci says eye protection can help prevent spread of coronavirus  In other words : Get back in your hole !!! Duct tape your whole body !!! Now WHO is crazy Biden ?
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Guaranteed Biden will surround himself with the most progressive cabinet you’ve ever seen politically (Bernie will help with this) and you’ll still cry over it and vaguely suggest Trump is better.
You can’t even try w ‘em.   I love that it’s like, “Biden is such dog shit, look at all this from 20 years ago”.   I like to look at Trump and see what he did 20 min ago.   Live in the present.  Be zen.  Be logical.  Understand how it works.  You do.  He obvi doesn’t.
Biden will lose, and it won't be close.
I mean Biden staffers who will finally be able to leak stories of having to shoot him up with speed before debates, feed answers into an earpiece, keep reminding him of his name/where he is. I want to see behind the smoke and mirrors, what it's taking to keep up this charade.
Biden predicted he would try to delay the election. But, there is NO reason we can't GO to vote. We go to everything else-the store, theme parks, beaches, work. Saying we can't vote in person is dumb....but we can go to the store in the same parking lot? 🤷🏼‍♀️ Makes ZERO sense.
Small businesses are the economic engines of our communities, and they need our support during these unprecedented times.   Unfortunately, Senate Republicans’ HEALS Act falls short of doing that.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe
She scared 99% of dems including her home state enough not to vote for her in the primary. And your right Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are old white men
#Trump gets more people at a press briefing than #Biden does at a #rally in a high school basketball court (pictured below). And the #media wants us to believe their deceitful and corrupt suppression #polls? I don't think so! We didn't believe them in 2016 either!
No, in my second tweet, I explain that the majority of voters preferred someone like Biden. They made up their own minds, just in a fashion that rendered it impossible for a progressive to win the primary. Campaign quality can’t overcome voter preference. I’m sad but accepting.
And Obama/Biden locked babies in cages and you looked the other way.  Because it was OK for your supreme leader to do that.  You looked the other way on sexual assault on women, child trafficking and child pedophiles.
Compared to Biden in the LATE stages, Trump was tested. Let’s get Biden tested.
Joe Biden called it from the beginning.
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election
It was largely math. The primary was up for grabs until all the conservatives dropped out to endorse Biden, and their voters treated the primary as over and voted for Biden as a bloc; if that hadn’t happened it might have stayed wide open. Or maybe not, what with COVID.
He can bribe me all he wants.  He can send me thousands of $$.  I'm STILL voting #Biden.  That's it, that's all...
I have a feeling Joe Biden will choose Kamala Harris as his VP.
A vote for a Biden is a vote for the Chinese Communist Party
We have plenty of PPE now after the President had to deal with the decimated stockpile that Obama/Biden did not replenish after their 2 botched disease fiascos.
Biden's Civil War
A Tale of Two channels...   Stimulus negotiations stall as millions of Americans need help. #CNN   Portland is a problem for Joe Biden #Fox    🤦🏼‍♀️🇺🇸✨
Notice ALL the negatives you listed have nothing to do with Trump. Corona virus came from CHINA. Ya know, Biden’s favorite country. The riots have been THE DEMOCRATS fault, in DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED CITIES &amp; STATES.
They had no issue with the US president withholding foreign aid for dirt on Biden or Putin putting bounties on US soldiers so no we’re already a dictatorship
Pt.-3 You can either vote 4 Biden, (who 1/2 time doesn't know where he is or who's propping him up) catering  agendas of the day or vote Trump (only other option). No Human is perfect, Lord only knows that "How things r said makes a difference",but Actions speak louder than words
He's trying to run out the clock on Biden, isn't he?
Registered Democrat voter in #Missouri!
Cool.  And yes joe Biden is BETTER than Trump.      Do you think Trump is the better candidate?   Have you been living in America the last four years?
The Democrat Party ideologues know they cannot win an election based on their socialist platform. Every “blue wave” anti Trump comment I read is based on personality, not policy! Biden is the same as Obama, a Trojan Horse figurehead loaded with deep state worms!
Outrageous--Racist -- doesn't know that America's Frontline Doctors presented multiple MD's only Dr. Stella is Black and he picks on her -- Calling Dr. Stella a crazy woman is typical of Biden--Not sure why he didn't say "put her back in chains"
I love  Now heads will be spinning until next week? Biden chose who?
Voting by mail scares trump. It'll show the most accurate of who the winner is....Biden 2020. Trump put a top campaign donor in place so he can interfere w the mail in votes. Trump is rigging the election!!!
Biden is a fragile, ill, old man (liar/thief) who is being used by the Democrats (he must owe them something) as a “front man” (bad casting) for “familiarity”. Skankamala Harris is an unlikable (shunned by Dems!), phony, liar, hyperbolic “taker”. What a pair of losers.
And here we go folks! He is making his play to delay the election..... we saw this coming!!!!! VOTE BIDEN 2020
I live in Nevada. Absent outright cheating there is no way in hell Trump wins here. We have the worst unemployment in the nation due to the virus. Our tourism has been killed and tax revenue is down to a trickle. We are hurting bad and will vote Biden.
We can undo it in January.  Either through Biden or Dem Congress.  Either way, they won't get many moved in the next 6 months.
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins
The lefties and #FakeNewsMedia slams #Trump because he uses hand rails when he walks up and down stairs? Yet #Biden needs to be led around by the arm like he's a lost toddler? And Fake News Media will just call this "cute" or endearing? Imagine if this was Trump? Wow 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🙄

What the heck is going on here? Maybe they should get #Biden one of those ridiculous kid leashes? 😂 Wow... 😂
Last Chance to Bet on #KamalaHarris as Biden’s Vice-Presidential Pick!
All of this is getting out of control 😡 The Demonrats love it! In their unhinged, feeble minds, they think cheering on these riots will somehow scare us Trump voters into submission by either not voting or voting for that zombified, sundowning Buffoon, Biden? #Trump2020Landslide
If you think that Joe Biden is impaired you should see the current occupant of the White House. He paints his face orange every day. Has the worst comb over in history is so impaired he can’t string a sentence together constantly repeats himself and can’t spell to save his life.
#basementjoe Biden's growing #bolshevik platform   #democrats #wrong4America #liberals #wrong4TheWorld #Marxists #wrong4TheUniverse
That said- I’m leaning pretty left these days so I’m very interested to see who he chooses. There’s theories floating around that if Biden wins, he’ll resign so the VP (which we know will be a woman) will be Prez &amp; no one will have voted for her. I don’t want the office that way
Did you read the article sir? It’s in there
Sullivan keeps conflating the Far Left with Biden supporters. For some odd reason he is ok with white nationalism. He only supported liberals to get away marriage. Now that he has that right, he can show his racist side
Biden speaks better than Trump
I don't think Biden lives another 4 years so actually it'll be the first black female President and I'm ready for President Susan Rice!!  Most qualified of the black females!!  Then Val Demings, then Harris!!  My Top 3 in order!
JEEZ!! I'm so undecided!! NAZI or Biden...HHHMMM..
You would think with that racist behavior it would be a “red” city...the reality is that the city overwhelmingly supported Hillary and will support Biden in ‘20. Same applies for our other lakefront liberal friends in Winnekta...cloak wearing racists. When will it change?
Well with Joe Biden his VP choice will tell us a lot then before the election wont it ?  And we can vote on it !
Biden aint none of those insults David.
I have pages would love to see Omaha and Biden’s lemme know when you’re ready I’ll send them all and I’ll be waiting for Obama’s lol
Matters to me not who Biden selects.
Biden is the Democrat. Are you a Democrat ? Then vote for the guy. I am an Independent and I choose THE DONALD.Florida will flip blue and Joe Biden will win that state too!
President Joe Biden won't defund police. Where are the masks? Why no social distancing? You can't stand a podium and advise people to wear masks and social distance and not practice what you preach! VERY POOR LEADERSHIP!!!
Race card/Woman card Harris. Bring back that 2016 failed playbook.  If you dont vote Biden, you ain't black! If you dont vote Biden, you ain't a woman!
And I will continue as I have, getting people to register and vote, speak my mind and of course, vote for #Biden I still remain optimistic that all this can be corrected and that in January, we will celebrate victory. But I got to say, its been a long road
How many Americans killed by Swine Flu while Obama/Biden stayed silent?575,000 in the first year and Obama DID NOTHING!
He knows he's going to lose. The more he bitches, the more desperate he is. But, he's also vengeful..if he's getting the boot, he's going to leave as big a mess behind as he can just to spite us, but especially to spite Joe Biden.
When we watch YOUR Fake Ads, we think, "President Joe Biden is going to be such a welcomed change! #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
I agree! Somehow they will keep Biden out of the debates.
To  Say it with me: President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden President Joe Biden You need to start getting used to that.
...cluttered than it was 4 yrs. ago. THE MOST RECENT CO. TO GET THE AD IN MY HOME? ALL THINGS AMAZON! That multi million dollar boost Amazon JUST GAVE to the ANTI AMERICAN BIDEN CAMPAIGN WAS THE LAST STRAW! I would NEVER call for others to boycott as that is what the PETTY LEFT..
Lord help you if this guy wins.  Forget everything bad i ever said about Ben McAdams (and Joe Biden) the alternatives are SO much worse.
JOE - as in Biden
We're ready for a Biden win! The only turmoil will be YOU refusing to concede and go! And if we have to, we'll have you removed from the WH by the same military you ordered to tear gas peaceful protesters!
The co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign slammed Joe Biden, saying the idea of voting for him is like eating “from a bowl of shit.”  Nina Turner made the remarks in response to a question about the choice between Biden and President Trump.
As a younger person, I voted for the only candidate running even older than Biden and found the youngest candidates extremely off putting (Pete and Tulsi). Young people care about issues more then you think.
Understand, the #Democrats don't want Biden. They want his running mate to take over if he wins. We have to watch who he chooses as running mate.
Just curious how long you have been a racist Apparently you don’t do your homework Joe Biden is the racist in this election  he has incarcerated more black African Americans than any other politician fact
BIDEN DOES NOT WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE! TRUMP IS LYING AGAIN!  What's happening now is #trump's America! YOU created this fucked up mess because you're incapable of leading a nation and you're playing dirty trying to steal the election to avoid PRISON!!! #TrumpIsLosing
Please find out who Joe Biden's handlers are.
Doesn't work because you left out corrupt Democraps and only included Republicants.   So you basically created a biden ad in a corrupt manner knowing that Democrats are even more corrupt as a whole.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The best reason for Biden to win.
He might be able to beat Biden off of write-ins.  Since I wasn't on planning on voting, maybe I'll show up and give one to the cause. Can't be any worse than those two.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Tulsi Gabbard was the only candidate worse than Biden (I can’t forgive her for voting “present” on impeachment). But I’ll vote for Biden over Trump in a heartbeat
So when Obama and Biden were in office, systemic racism wasn't an issue? Inner city crime in black neighborhoods wasn't a problem?  We see through the Democrap lies.  #MAGA #KAG #PelosiMustGo
Absolutely! A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for trump.
No surprise, China wants Trump gone. Biden is a cheap payoff
Pelosi knows and many of those ideas can come into fruition. In my Pollyanna view, I find hope in the Wall of Moms. &amp; Biden is the tugboat moving the gigantic ship into safe waters. We will survive and better.
My hunch is that Fox News viewers are so far gone that it doesn’t matter what sort of ridiculous accusations they make against Democratic presumptive nominee Hunter Biden or his crook son Joe
There’s nothing Biden could do to the United States that you haven’t already destroyed
Mary Trump is a hater!  I do not believe a word she said.  President Trump has done great things for the American people.  I will vote for him in November because creepy Joe Biden would be a disaster!
“Joe Biden is such a wimp. He only cancelled 1 convention. My brave President canceled 2 conventions!”
Joe Biden's disastrous plans for America's suburbs
To Biden, Pelosi, AOC, and Omar, these are heroes.
