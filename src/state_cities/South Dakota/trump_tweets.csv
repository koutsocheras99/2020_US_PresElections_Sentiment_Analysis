There are only 8 states with unemployment rates higher than 13%: MA, NJ, NY, NV, CA, MI, IL, and HI. Iowa is at 8%, behind states like UT, ID, ND, SD, MT, NE, NC, AR, ME, KY, and GA. That unemployment rate is a result of the failed policies in those 8 states moreso than Trump.
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
Absolutely! Thankfully, Rapid City has Mayor Steve Allender and a progressive City Council that instituted measures early on in the pandemic to protect the citizens of this city. We did not rely any help from the governor who is in Trump‚Äôs pocket.

The replies to this are hilarious, like did they forget the trump foundation was investigated and found it had committed fraud?

Then they would be finding themselves in the middle of local, state and federal election cycles.  And win or lose wrt Trump, it would be marketed as retaliating against defeat or overplaying a victory.  There is never a tactically good time to do this.
We all are. We have to trust the plan and especially President Trump and ourselves.  We see the ugly while the unwoke live it and have no idea. Stay calm and get some fresh air away from people.

I‚Äôm curious tho why you might support Trump, with him possibly being involved with Epstein and Maxwell, in the very least rape/assault outside of E &amp; M, but only blast pedophiles and sex traffickers who happen to be democrats. Both sides are shit and should be equally blasted.
Trump has many faults but from someone outside of MN, I was appalled at your govt response to the riots. Protestors burn down your businesses and they didn't do everything possible to stop them. City council wants to defund police but ask for tax payer paid personal security? Etc
So stop talking about it. All your doing is helping trump by creating more doubt in the election. You‚Äôre literally helping him. Just go out, vote as early as possible absentee or vote in person, and let the chips fall where they may
Idk why people keep feeding the idea that trump is going to delay the election. I‚Äôve seen tons of ‚Äúif they delay the election, this will happen‚Äù posts, which is about the same as saying ‚Äúif a giant jello spaghetti monster comes from Neptune, this will happen‚Äù neither will happen
Are you paying attention?   If you want the Republic to survive you must be actively with President Trump.    SD will not be safe if the left wins in Nov.  Nor will you.  Get in the fight.
donald trump is a con fake president
trump is responsible for this. it‚Äôs pathetic that an expert in health gets ridiculed and harassed daily
Narrator: but the book wasn‚Äôt fantastic. But Trump didn‚Äôt know that because he never read the book. Or... any book for that matter
He called himself his own husband, constantly forgets where he is, said 120 million people died due to the virus. He gives bizzare and weird speeches that don't have a point. The guy is clearly in decline, big time. Trump doesn't need to do much to show that.
Why didn‚Äôt  correct Meadows on the simple yes vote he claims Democrats refused to allow.  The problem with Trump and all of his sycophants is that they always try to blame someone else and never admit that they are preventing votes for personal gain. #Liars
Quit being a trump lackey and do what‚Äôs best for your country and maybe you could come to an agreement.
I both want you to be wrong and be right. I want the left to prove you wrong but I know they can't and the only way to fix this is to burn it down and start fresh. Trump is the only one that can freak out those liberals and centrists enough to stop standing still
So Trump Team pulls all their ads to refocus and this is what they come up with?   So desperate and sad. If you worked on this video, probably should find a different career.
There are a million things wrong with  . The fact that he doesn't know who  is, after having carried Trump's water for 3.5 years and 20,000 lies, is HILARIOUS!
Breaking: NY prosecutors have subpoenaed  for its records related to Trump &amp; his businesses. Deutsche Bank *has COMPLIED*, providing extensive documents &amp; other materials.
This is an old story from 2016. When it was between Trump and Hillary Clinton. There weren't many that really liked the choices either. Unfortunately, it seems the bottom of the barrel was scraped again this time. When will we find candidates we actually believe in?
Just shows how narcissistic Trump really is. He has no idea who the #2 GOP Senator is at all. God I hope the polls are right and this numb skull gets beat in November.
South Dakotans are paying very close attention to this kind of crap from Trump.  Twitter, Facebook Remove Trump Post Over False Claim About Children And COVID-19
The part of last virus stimulus package that dealt placed a moratorium on evictions is about to expire.  This is an aid to the Trump reelection efforts.  Those who oppose him are most likely to be victims of eviction.  Being evicted risks them being turned down at the poll.
Quite the special bond between Thune and Trump.
Ok let‚Äôs. Trump has a DOJ.
Now to clarify what I mean, I don't mean 'cheesing' things (although that can be a problem too), I mean people who repeatedly let the 'rule of cool' trump the rules in the book, and remove any risk or meaning from anything they do that is actually interesting.
Trump said innocent people don‚Äôt plead guilty tho...? I‚Äôm just trying to keep up with the logical loops his base follows.
President Trump gives a coronavirus briefing from the White House.
The only problem Donald Trump really has with abortion is that the price keeps going up.  The GOP only cares about abortion because it‚Äôs their way to get lower-income evangelicals to the polls to vote against their own economic interests.
Donald Trump will win BIG this November, and that‚Äôs a GREAT thing!
Trump Administration Proposes to Expand Telehealth¬†Benefits
Ah you watched the Trump interview with  I had the same reaction.
Well Trump has had almost four years with the DOJ. Either   1. He is protecting Obama  2. Incompetent  3. There‚Äôs no crime from Obama
Weird. Someone should tell that to Trump then since he said it before in interviews.
A great idea but a horrible strategy for getting elected. #1 for Trumpers is keeping their guns. You will lose the wavering Trump voters if you go this way before the election.  You already have the vote of the banners, you need to get the vote of the keepers and find compromise.
Trump will be 1 Term...Biden who will be like 81 in his 4th yr...will be a 1 termer also. Until our old as* pop. quits saying ...rhode scholar /afghan war vet/ mayor/ like Pete B.  ‚Äúis too young-needs more exp‚Äù We are gonna get more ü¶ï in WH.

The Republican convention is scheduled for Aug. 24-27, with Trump's speech capping the final night.
You have 8 followers.  Trump doesn't have dementia.  I have family that has it and Biden screams of it.  Get real.  Go bot someone else.
It is amazing how all of you play the victim and claim Trump is the one stealing the election.   Look at ALL the recent Democrats arrested for election fraud.  We aren't talking absentee ballots here.  Mail vote is easily fraudulent.  YOU want that.  It's Win at ALL costs for Dem
I don‚Äôt think it matters. People aren‚Äôt voting for Biden so much as they are voting against Trump. His VP is who is getting my vote.
Biden is the same age as Trump. And he was in the White House for 8 years. A comeback against you is a senior abuse so I may to apologise
The FBI was monitoring Russian communications and Trump‚Äôs people kept showing up on the calls. Not the other way around.
So, question. If you think Trump is Russia's puppet, wouldn't this be the greatest thing ever for you and your "Comrades" You love socialism, communism even...but not Russia? By natural logic, Trump SHOULD be your number one guy. What's not to understand here?
you are just as bad as trump maybe even worse. kentucky has suffered so much under your watch. you‚Äôve enriched yourself for decades while kentucky remains one of the poorest in the nation
Thread by  I knew it. I knew in early June, before number started falling, that Trump would at some point start bragging abou case"as a sign of success. This number means nothing EXCEPT that policy has failed, &amp;amp;  and
No where does it say that even if people don‚Äôt die from COVID they are still being counted, as you claimed. Also, I couldn‚Äôt find a single time Trump or the White House claimed people who had COVID but recovered are still counted as deaths. Could you please provide a source?
And a big fuck trump too
I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm mad as hell about kids going back to school! Fuck you Trump you worthless piece of shit.
Lol.  So what is a vote for Trump?  Going back to square wheels, re-writing the constitution, and pretending that debt doesn‚Äôt matter (till a D is in the WH)?  A vote for Biden is the best available option.
Trump is clearly out of his element and shows that he just does not understand the stats on this virus. Are the people that surround him just telling him what he wants to hear?
Wonder how that guy would feel if Trump were talking about his daughter or mother?   Be ok then?
you and your family are all grifters. the trump family has been stealing money from the federal government for decades. this will come to an end real soon!
Trump Wins in Portland - WSJ
Omg, all of them. Watching trump, is totally exhausting.
It is something. The charts Trump had. I haven‚Äôt seen more basic charts since I will a freshman in college.
HE DID NOT DO IT, he only voted to remove #tRump in 1 of these 2 votes, when there was no excuse not to remove this #MadPresident, even though it was a sham trial with #NoEvidence &amp; #NoWitnesses, he did NOT Speak out against these WRONGs, fearful of the GOP cult, &amp; WITHOUT HONOR.
Trump says he has done more for African Americans than any other president.  Let's compare him to Lyndon Johnson.  With Johnson you get the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act.  Would somebody please tell what Trump has done.  His record must be secret.
Pretty sure Biden knows how to pronounce Yosemite and has heard of it. Not sure if Trump has even BEEN to a national park besides Mt. Rushmore for 3rd of July and Trump National Golf Club
Watching the trump interview on Axios even I am astounded by how stupid trump is. And believe me I knew that before viewing . How anyone could ever want this moron for president is beyond comprehension.
I realize that Trump likes to keep everything about himself secret; however, I thought most people knew Trump failed his last EKG.  The doctors found no irregularities because they couldn't find a beating heart.  The EKG was nothing more than a flatline.
How did our two U.S. senators vote on the Great American Outdoors Act that President Trump signed into law today?  Thune (R) ‚úÖ Rounds (R) ‚ùå  This was not a partisan bill. It was a matter of valuing national parks and conservation efforts.  I can't wait to vote for
Trump on Covid Death toll: "IT IS WHAT IT IS".  What do you think South Dakotans think of this comment?
I think you‚Äôre confused on which party is lying. Study after study showed no effect whatsoever with Hydroxycholorquine, even the massive study in South Dakota where Noem is a Trump stooge. Sanford medical cut off the study. The U of M did a study that showed no effect.

I did no such thing.  You're good at spin like the rest of the liberal fakenews.  I was giving one example.  I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 but you better damn well know I am in November.  40+ years in politics, Biden is a moron.  Not to mention having dementia.  #FFS
Actually what you should've said was, "Jonathan Swan reveals the simple secret to damaging Trump: basic video editing for effect after an interview."  Pathetic fakenews.  #LiberalismIsTheRealPandemic
The White House is seeking opportunities to boost Trump, like providing another round of $1,200 stimulus payments and extending the supplemental jobless benefit and partial eviction ban.

Trump on Covid Death toll: "It is what it is".
He also did pass the First Step Act, which is an overall small bill, but a step in the right direction for prison reform.   Again, I‚Äôm not a trump supporter. I think he‚Äôs a danger to this country and should by no means win re-election.

It won't be over until Donald Trump is in prison and even then he may still have cult followers
It‚Äôs always about Trump. Hes a narcissist
I mean both can be right. Why does trump care all of a sudden? The minority and young vote is going to determine who wins this election and just a few weeks ago young people showed social media like tik tok could be used politically.
Remember these words you spoke    you‚Äôre the racist. Not Trump.  #Trump2020Landslide
He can‚Äôt possibly debate Trump.  It would be laughable at the very least.  No way the Dems would allow it.
Trump doesn't control universal studios lol.
The election will fix it. Vote Trump, vote out the rest of the Democrats, problem solved. Good luck, man.
You do realize that there is data on this subject and it makes your statement sound foolish (at best).  Trump even tried a voter fraud task force that fell apart because they couldn‚Äôt find anything they could use (politically).

President Trump announced Friday that he was exploring a U.S. ban of the popular social media app Tik Tok.  But that ban may now be on hold as Microsoft looks to buy the app from its Chinese parent company. An update on #Midday in KELOLAND. WATCH LIVE:
Biden is despicable, and I volunteered for Bernie too but I‚Äôll still vote for Biden. Trump is literally killing people. Can‚Äôt keep him in power
I don‚Äôt believe that mail in ballots will be counted. I think Trump will find a way to discredit them. I‚Äôll vote his assssss out in person, even if it means getting sick and dying.
When I talk to voters, affordable health care is their biggest concern. Trump and GOP leaders have done nothing in almost 4 years but continue to try to destroy the affordable care act. Where is their plan that they have claimed is so much better?
Opinion piece in the New York Times calls for "scrapping" the 60-year tradition of televised presidential debates:
Sooooooo question. What would you have done that was legal? Tell the states how to act and what to do? That sounds a lot like Dictatorship to me.... No matter what plan Trump would have had, the left would have howled "Tyranny" lol It's their fault.
How is it interesting? Democrats would get torched by the Super crazy left people if they said "No those EU people can't come here" The news would have called it peaceful protesting, Pelosi would have said "Xenophobic trump rejects Europe" They'd need to bow to BLM again lol
Better than trump

The economy is in shambles because the Democrats won't reopen their states like the cowards they are. Trump is not a dictator, if he was he'd force them to reopen but he can't. Trying to make them do it is a trap. They want us all to burn. They want to be king of the ashes.

The only way we will see better days will be once Trump is removed from office - by force if necessary.  I would love to see Trump led off the White House grounds in handcuffs.
I've been wondering why those who may have the proof that Russia is offering bounties to the Taliban for the slaughter of American soldiers, including when Trump knew, haven't submitted their proof to Adam Schiff, who can then investigate the President for treason
Yep blame trump or the government for ignoring the COVID-19 warnings back in the beginning of 2020.
Please show him this tweet of all the Trump supporters wearing masks because a week ago he finally said and did the right.
Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.

In all seriousness I do plan on listening. I‚Äôm not sure how you have come to your views but I am still open to listening. It would interesting to pick your brain a little. I‚Äôm not a big political guy but I do think Trump should have 4 more years. Reluctantly. I am still open. üòé
Donald Trump deserves life in prison and many people wish he was dead interesting how quickly he defended maximum punishment for anyone else but himself.
They don‚Äôt hate their base but the base is not enough to get elected because so many of them don‚Äôt get out and vote. The current dem candidate may not be progressives enough for the base but he‚Äôs better than the alternative and we won‚Äôt get ANY change if trump stays in power.

Trump Has Been Comparing Himself to Nixon. That‚Äôs Hooey.

My 3 children and I lived in low income housing for many years! I have a college degree and my full time income in SD didn‚Äôt stretch far enough! Shame on Trump! 2 of my 3 kids have college degrees and one in dental school!
No state has been worse than New York, but he gets a pass since he does not like Trump. Even though it was his policies that killed thousands of old people in nursing homes.
That's not some down time. He's set records. He also promised never to play golf when president. Comparing a little time on Twitter to the many days Trump has played is just silly.
BUT... Imagine if it was President Trump's name mentioned
Twitter is a garbage fire, it uses the souls of woke democrats  to keep on living. Just remember Twitter isn't real life, its just  where all the maniacs like to live in their echo chamber so they have something to feel good about. Vote Trump to shut them up :-)

Thanks, but I have plenty of facts.  Real facts. Not #alternativefacts."  And virtually every fact is evidence to the depraved ugliness that lives inside Trump.
Otherwise Trump wouldve kept that attorney on until after the election. The reason he had him fired was to make sure this all started coming out around now to make sure to keep HRC out as Bidens VP choice. I'm sure news will be soon dropping about her efforts to keep this quiet
If Trump had any part of this, why would he have wanted the attorney for SDNY who was heading this case and not proceeding fired? As soon as he was fired, within days, an arrest warrant for Maxwell was obtained. That's a dumb move had he wanted this to stay hidden.
WHAT IS THE LAST TRUMP IN THE BIBLE? When is the Rapture?
Trump is pissed that tiktokers ruined his big rally, so he‚Äôs trying to shut down tiktok. Trump doesn‚Äôt want people to mail in ballots, so he‚Äôs trying to defund the post office.  All while covid infections and deaths climb, the economy is turning to shit, and huge jobless rates.
Joe Biden don't care about what you want. Joe Biden can't remember what he cares about either. Maybe its time to vote Trump. Give the Democrats 4 more years to regroup, cut out the commie cancer and get back to American values.

God bless you! BUT you have SD Governor wrong, she's Anti Trump, Pro UN for YEARS! Kristi Noem got 190,000 doses of HCQ, but refusing to let anyone use it. SHE TOLD THE SD PHARM BOARD TO NOT USE IT! We still have 190,000 doses just sitting here. SD has a Crispr lab
"Oil is once again $40 a barrel, right where it was pre-pandemic, and 150 ethanol plants are still struggling to bounce back and invest in their rural communities."
Will America be Trump's greatest bankruptcy? Its very likely, given his incompetence. How many deaths will it take for the country to understand what has happened? At least 250,000 if we are lucky!
Correction, Trump is a womanizer of individuals over 18,  Epstein is a pervert who went after underage girls.  Big difference. One can consent, the other cannot.
We already did, we have trump
Depends. Plan for worst, but most likely the outcome will not be as extreme.   One factor is the rest of the Republican leadership, if they don't back Trump most of the outrage will fall apart.   Saying they will have street violence is a whole other thing from actually doing it.
According to Trump logic testing for covid gives you covid and if not tested you can‚Äôt have covid that would be a medical miracle
Is Stephen Miller claiming this is how Donald Trump won in 2016? Did influence outside the US play a part in Donald Trump's election?
A shift to mail voting is increasing the chances that voters won't know the winner of the presidential race on election night, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the results will be flawed or fraudulent, as Trump suggested on Thursday.
You back to Trump 2020?
I choose to believe in "The Plan" even though I might not see the next step. President Trump is the central part of that plan.
You're kidding me right?  If not for Covid things would be booming still.  A larger boom because of Trump and NOT the meek recover of Obama.  STOP LYING.  #LiberalismIsTheRealPandemic
Am I the only one that noticed her statement that JE told her that Trump was a good friend? Just because DT was not on the island doesn't mean he is 100% innocent.
Donald Trump legacy. Feb, 2020.  Novel virus‚úÖ  Lack of pandemic preparedness‚úÖ Overwhelmed hospitals‚úÖ Many deaths‚úÖ The unwillingness of the GOP to take this virus seriously and save lives is a reflection of the presidency.
If Trump is bringing them all down I commend him for it but let's remember that those who scream loudest have the most to hide. Trump might not have been on the jet/island but you can't deny they were acquaintances for years before the MarLago banning. Trump has a history.
I think Trump did know about it, but didn't have power to do anything until he came to office. This whole thing did not pick up steam and actually move forward until Trump became president. Clinton, Bush and Obama did nothing.
Why has  not asked about rallies? Like the Trump rally he went to and that got #HermanCain killed? #GymJordan is such a hollow tool.

So, if only Congress can change the date of the election.... Donald Trump took that tool out of their hands by making it his idea. Now it won't happen. Brilliant. #Election2020 #ElectionDay
I decided not to pay attention to what the said and only worry about it if it was a big deal a month after he said it. This skill has transferred well to Trump.
I think it‚Äôs quite the opposite. As I Trump supporter, I would guess you‚Äôre more about nationalism masked as patriotism. Even if you don‚Äôt know it, that‚Äôs what It is
GDP growth in 2019 continues to exceed pre-election forecasts. President Trump, real GDP beat expectations and grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate from the election to the end of 2019‚Äîfaster than the rate under President Obama‚Äôs expansion period. So now what
Did she ever blink? üòÑ
Yes. Vote Trump. Your other choice is a guy who can't remember where he is most of the time.
I think Trump did this as a way to get people freaking out so he can get them to admit kids should be back in school and/or stop pressure for the mail in voting push. Think about it, they're going to have to argue both sides of the argument on mail in voting AND schools.
Trump 3 years put that son of a bitch in jail and taking his pervert friends with him.
We wouldn‚Äôt have had to shut down the economy if trump, his administration and the GOP hadn‚Äôt bungled the response to Covid19. How did opening up the economy in Florida work for you? Record number of cases and deaths! That‚Äôs on you Matt.
Alex Jones. Infowars. You're spewing conspiracy theories to try and deceive the people. You're trying to cast doubt in their minds. This is how Donald Trump won in 2016.
That‚Äôs funny. That adrenochrome is getting to your head a bit. Better tell them people it‚Äôs over and we‚Äôre not listening to you anymore. TRUMP 2020!!!
I think the Russia hoax was a huge factor in the midterms. The Russia hoax was perpetrated impart to stop Trump but in part to help the Democrats win in the midterms.
I actually loved W.  I was in the USMC when he was president.  Hated Chaney, and still do.  W, like Obama, did what he thought was right for America.  Trump does whatever is right for himself
It‚Äôs all on the Governor and mayor now. They are now accountable.. trump played them like a fiddle.
If Biden somehow becomes our next president just remember, if you were one of those individuals stating "Trump's not my president", you can't get mad and argue if people start stating "Biden's not my president "
An obama pissing contest? Lol. So what's the worst thing trump has done? And how is he racist?
Don't act like you actually cared about this guy's death. You're trying to get political about it. But but trump tweeted about a different pizza guy. Grow tf up..
You should know since you are a regular on Trump's Ministry of Information and Propaganda (FOX News).
Why does Herman Cain look like he wants to get the hell away from Trump.
Limbaugh said the same thing.  Which means my Trump supporting family members will treat that as gospel.  Which is why I won‚Äôt talk about in on FB.  Here though, I can rightly call it a big flaming, smelly, obnoxious piece of BS of an opinion.
Why does the whole world revolve around trump for these people?
You do realize that Trump's Election Fraud Commission was disbanding because they couldn't find any evidence of widespread fraud. The fraud that is concerning is the rejection of valid ballots and removal of voters off the roles (something Republicans are very adept at).
Opinion | Help Me Find Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAnarchists‚Äô in Portland - The New York Times
Bullshit, quit spreading lies. You are trying to blame this crisis on the Democrats. It's trump and the entire GOP that are holding things up by being tight asses!!! This is a republican or Democrat problem. This is a public health crisis. Grow a pair of balls and save us!
Instead, they used #HermanCain's platform to keep digging the hole as he died. Herman Cain supported Trump and attended his rally as people died.   These people are beyond reason.
#HermanCain downplayed the risk of the virus and spouted falsehoods. He then got sick at Trump's rally and became a drain on resources and a risk to healthcare workers.  He deserves no respect.
Yes John you‚Äôre for the people not trump. Hahahaha ah Hahahaha üòÇ
Call on oan, right. Really hard hitting question while stroking trump ü§Æ
It is true that at some point, possibly 1 year from now or possibly 5 years from now, Donald Trump will no longer be president.  It is also true that the GOP needs to look at itself and maybe wash away some DC swamp muck.
And did the Trump's take their "how not to scam money from charity" classes yet?
He isn't a problem. Your family funneling our money into your family coffers &amp; to Trump sponsors is an actual crime.  Hunter Biden got a position because of privilege of familial association. This is a glass house you don't want to be throwing rocks in, moron.  #TrumpCrimeFamily
I love when Trump's tweets get everyone in a tizzy.
Can we hear this Trump/Inhofe recording, or not? I don't want to read a description of it. It makes me feel condescended to.
I'd laugh/cry if Trump voted Kanye
Yeah, not sure how that would go. Elections are the responsibility of the states. I don't think most care what Trump thinks at this point.  My governor does. But legislature not as much.
Just because trump says voting by mail isn‚Äôt safe doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs true. He votes by mail himself as do many states.  He is trying to put doubt in people‚Äôs minds if their candidate doesn‚Äôt win.
In all fairness,  is right. It‚Äôs rich to hear you speak on this and also lavish  Trump with praise. Bravo to the staffer that realized it was today and informed  to cut and paste a generic tweet. Maybe speak on how hunters are the worse offenders in SD?
Senator you don‚Äôt have all the Republicans voting on the side of Trump. I gotta ask, why won‚Äôt your Super Pac help elect conservative Republicans?
"Trump must deny the [RFS 'gap year'] waivers to help rural America. The question is whether he is willing to say no to Big Oil before November, or if he is waiting until after the election to give them everything and the kitchen sink."
It was as rapid as could be considering everyone thought the disease was harmless, including Fauchi, until mid March. Trump acted early with the travel ban while the Dems wasted time on a pointless impeachment attempt.
Trump should lose the election, given he's more concerned with himself than anything else.  But good God Democrats.  All they needed to do was pick any sane person.
The Libs do have their priorities? Why didn‚Äôt O deal with this issue, totally convinced Libs are not here to really solve problems! Trump is a problem solver not a politician!
TRUMP IS PART OF PIZZA GATE CONFIRMED
I tried. I can‚Äôt do it. I wanted him to see the world again after Trump is gone.
I feel like in 10 years the CNNs of the world will look back fondly and remember Trump's bold decision-making as the demonize whatever Republican that is in office at the time.
I think neoliberals love Trump and his distractions away from climate change, health care, and stagnant wages for American workers. ANYTHING but real issues, the crazier the better.
This Herman Cain death is very sad. However, it bears mentioning that there's a not insignificant chance he contracted COVID at Trump's Tulsa rally -- the one Cain praised for not requiring masks or distancing. He attended that rally 11 days prior to being hospitalized.
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be "the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history."
That still baffles me. This Trump paradox is getting stranger by the day!
The #COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the construction industry. Tell Congress and President Trump to include significant construction investment for transportation, schools, water, and broadband infrastructure in relief legislation.
Mail-in and absentee voting are the same damn thing, you dolt. Trump supporters: this man thinks you‚Äôre dumb enough to take what he says without an ounce of skepticism. Are you gonna prove him right?
In my very unscientific poll, 62.5% of the respondents said they believe there will be no public debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I have heard the same prediction from folks on the right and left. Time will tell. #Election2020
Herman Cain has died of Covid Which he seems to have picked up at Trump's rally in Oklahoma, supporting trump is killing people.  Lmao mAgAüëãü§™
Equally as disturbing as Donald Trump and Jeffery Epstein‚Äôs pedophile ring.
Probably not a sinister ‚Äúthey all want you dead or vaccine microchipped‚Äù or some such nonsense. More likely a stupid anti Trump thing.
President Donald Trump raised the prospect of delaying the November election because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the president lacks the legal authority to delay elections on his own.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election.
*straps Trump to the Mars rocket launching today*
First he tried to dig up dirt on Biden and they found nothing. Then he tried to say Biden wasn‚Äôt all there and that didn‚Äôt stick. Now this new low. Trump is scared to face off against
Trump, or someone worse.
Will Beijing Biden and the Marxists now in control of the Democrat party bring this tyranny to the US?  They can be seen posting about going after Trump supporters if they win the election.

It's not. Biden and Trump are two sides of the same coin, we need a different coin entirely.
Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
Right, that explains why Biden is up 20 points in the polls.
Rethuglicans should never be trusted or taken seriously. She started her "haymaker" by saying to Joe Biden,  I dont think you're a racist, but....  The fact that rethuglicans think there's something wrong with her answer is laughable.
Both sides are terrible. You're voting for a dirty cop and the architect of mass incarceration and systemic racism. Democrats and Republicans have been terrible for this country. What is Biden's platform? Nobody knows! "He's NoT TrUmP!" is basically it.
Are you describing the last administration of Obama/Biden? Golf in Hawaii all of the time and nothing to show for the 8 years.
Might have something to do with the fact your side pushed to defund the police.  I might add, while the topic is mail-in ballots, the mail carrier union endorsed Biden.  Putting the USPS bias in question.

If anything Kamala is Hillary in blackface.  She's a repellent politician, who wears pant suits and cackles loudly.  Biden might as well be a cardboard cutout.  He's uninspiring and projects no enthusiasm.
Wow Politico..what masterful work discovering that Joe Biden is a real human being who overcame his stutter. I'll bet he was a very hard working little boy. And that is a cheap nugget of info.
Bullock is going to win. Biden is going to win also.
There is literally nothing more important in the world than a Biden win. Having said that, this birther thing is utter bullshit that we are falling for. This same question was raised about McCain. The right knows it‚Äôll drive us crazy and we‚Äôre letting them.
The National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents 300,000 current and retired workers, said Thursday that Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office.
Why is this breaking news?  They endorsed Biden six weeks ago.  Long before this whole narrative was born.
If you like the arrangement, use it. If you don't, don't.  That's true whether you're their customer or vendor.

People aren't excited for Biden at all, and adding Harris on top of that? ARE YOU TRYING TO LOSE? Those two have contributed to a police state and systemic racism more than Trump has, that I know is true. Your candidate is SO BAD that he probably can't even beat Mango Mussolini.
The only way to save our country is to get Dem majorities in the house and senate. They are going to need to impeach him and remove him from office after he steals the election. Joe Biden will probably never see the inside if the Whitehouse as president.
BS....you can peddle that crap to your üêë.....but the rest of American knows its untrue.... sank our economy...Biden in all his years in office has done one damn thing...your ancestors owned slaves and Biden praises Byrd who was the grand poopa of the KKK...so KMA
There's absolutely no way Joe Biden actually came up with the idea of national mask mandates.  That had to come from his handlers.  Joe Biden is basically on autopilot at this point.  He'll say anything that's written down on paper or typed up on the teleprompter.
Biden can‚Äôt put 2 words together.
If Joe Biden said he was going to institute a national mandate to wear ball gags, the brainless flyblow who look forward to voting for Biden, including the media, would clap excitedly.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
MAGA: Biden &amp; Harris wrote laws that ramped up police powers in low income areas and they‚Äôll do it again!  Everyone: so now all of a sudden you care about black and brown people being in jail? ü§î  M: that‚Äôs not the point!  E: then what is?  M: ‚Ä¶ SNOWFLAKE!  E: üôÑ
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate over the next three months.

I agree. I'm not seeing any Biden signs, but I'm very concerned about this election. I constantly pray for President Trump. We will lose our freedom if he isn't reelected.
Biden and Harris, now I'm convinced you're actually trying your hardest to lose to Mango Mussolini.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Jailing people of color for victimless crimes(Harris), and writing the 1994 crime bill which majorly contributes to systemic racism (Biden), are you guys trying to lose to Mango Mussolini?
They're too scared to let #JoJorgensen2020 in on the poll, and if they let her debate Trump and Biden, she would embarrass both of those old racist pedophiles. Enjoy voting for your turd sandwich.
You're not getting M4A out of Biden. When will you guys learn to stay away from the duopoly candidates? How many times do you need to get slapped in the face?
You might want to look into Biden's 1994 crime bill. You know, the one that Trump is abusing today. They're the same person. And Harris the cop/prosecutor who would send innocent people to prison and never admit wrong doing? Terrible choice. Shot yourselves in the foot again.
I know it was a good day for the Trump campaign.  Why?  This was trending top when Biden and Harris spoke.
25th Amendment is invoked within 18 months. If Dems control the senate Obama replaces RBG within 3 months. Courtpacking of 3 additional left wing judges to the bench for a total of 12. A Biden second term may bring it to 15 judges total on the bench.
In all honesty, of all the people Biden could pick from, Gabbard would have been the better pick.  At least she's not polling 2% nationally like #HeelsUpHarris üë†

Tom is Never Trump, so that leaves Biden.  I haven't met a single Biden voter who's happy after yesterday's VP announcement.

Truthfully Biden abandoned his "moderate" stance and chose one of the most divisive running mates to date.
Your retort is a 'she's not as evil as.' Between Biden's Crime Bill and Harris' zealousness in policing, they've left babies without parents for victimless crimes, and with their warhawkishness (especially Biden), abroad left many kids without parents and parents without kids.
I agree with you 100%! I'm very, very concerned about this election. I love my freedom, if Biden wins, our country will become socialist.
Recently moved from CA because it's a soup sandwich. If biden/harris win, the country become california. And yes, I believe those proper nouns don't deserve to be capitalized.
Trump is about to find out the worst part for him about Biden picking Harris: she has sharp elbows and she does swing back
Wow! Biden should have your father's 13 year old accuser in the audience.
Yeah. Something that is truthful. Joe Biden is far from the radical left. As is  Democrats are United.
I actually DID dream last night that Biden picked Harris and today that dream came true. Just like Madonna told me it would as a kid. Hehehe. #BidenHarris2020 My heart is all a flutter!

How can anyone defend Biden‚Äôs mental state.  I have never liked the guy at all but I feel horrible for him right now. This is a form of elder abuse. Democrats are good at elder murdering so I guess they just add this to this list? It‚Äôs cruel

You can see why Joe Biden likes her‚Äîthey are cut from the same cloth. Both dishonest liars/plagerisers.
And we can believe #Biden as he has already done this with Obama.
Lol, no debate needed. Trump is destroying his campaign all by himself. Why would Biden want to get in the way of that?
Biden is just a chair warmer or place marker.
One thing for sure, it will be a woman of color, since Biden has painted himself in to that corner.
It was the Obama/Biden 8yrs that gave us President Donald Trump
Lol you're high. Biden is a walking sacrilege
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.You're actually spot on. MAGA is a social condition of those who had privilege and fear they are losing it. It's why Biden says "Build BACK Better" and Trump "Make America Great AGAIN"
Just wait and see what they do to Biden and Harris after they win the election. These are still republicans. #ImpeachNoem
Rough day with a whole lot of aggressive Biden trolls - at least 3-5 that appear to be professional sockpuppet accounts. So nice to end it with comrades filled with humility and radical openness.  You all are the best. Nite.
Some confused sympathy for Ellen is due too. She was raped by her stepfather as a teen. Like the Blue MAGA Biden worshippers, she fled toward the protection of the Overclass. Now she's a total mess who has been trained to prey upon her kind by bad people. It's complicated.
I respect your answer. Berta would, were she still alive and not murdered by the death squads Hillary enabled. But being totally objective, Barack directed Joe Biden to lead the Latin American plan. Joe has the most kills.
Note 1: Joe Biden has a huge handicap. All he has to do is PLEDGE those items now to execute within first 100 days. Trump actually has to do them to get credit.
Indeed, both Trump and Biden have been all over LGBTQ+ rights but have evolved to tolerance (dragged along by society, no doubt). Both have been all over reproductive rights too. Joe was fiercely for protecting states that wanted to ban and criminalize abortion until he wasn't.
Damn it. So even on COVID it's a wash. Trump and Biden really are both totally incompetent.
They're infuriating. When you push the comparison with Trump they just deny reality on issue after issue. I'll grant that Trump's worse on COVID-19 response than Biden but only because Biden's hiding in his basement while Trump denies, bungles, misleads and flails.
It's fascinating how Joe Biden's sitting there so damn vulnerable that Trump can check-mate him four ways but still doesn't see the move. Susan Rice just gave Trump a fifth way. Who's the worse player?
Painful. Absolutely infuriating. Yet I'll bet you the vast majority of Biden-adoring Blue MAGA would swear those are all Trump things except for the last one which as everybody knows was #Russia. ü§£
Said a just created account with six followers. I'm sure jvgraz is crushed at losing your follow.   Can someone tell Biden this latest batch of socks is completely burnt? Useless. Who's running QC in that listless campaign?
Nice try but no. The Biden Plan for Latin America engineered coups, insurgencies, economic terrorism. Joe actually caused the refugee crisis that elected Trump on his 'Build the Wall' issue. Biden backed Contras terrorists. Funded Pinochet.
Does  realize the campaign victory Susan Rice just gave him? If Trump pardons Snowden, he's drained the Swamp and proved to the world Susan Rice and Joe Biden are Totalitarianists. He can DESTROY Spyin' Biden!
Thank you for helping us feel better about Biden's choice of Kamala.
For those who think the Left can influence Joe Biden, please talk to me about how Obama listened to us on:  Guantanamo Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Domestic surveillance Drone warfare
In that Obama NSA surveillance kind of way, yes. You're probably right. But no, there's no changing Joe Biden's ways after nearly eight years. The only potential is that Kamala would say no to her Overclass benefactors. Given she hacked for Mnuchin, that's unlikely.
You are aware of the methodological problem, splitting the Trump outcome into two categories while lumping 100% of the Biden outcome in a single one?
"Biden &amp; Harris ain't taking away your guns." "Trump ain't taking away your abortion."  Should we take blue and red #MAGA at their words?
Hey #MAGA. Shut up about that #Qanon bullcrap. You want to get your boy  re-elected? Have him actually end all those colonial wars now like he promised. And get real on COVID. He'll destroy Biden.  I'm just telling you to make a liberal cry.
Today we learned that "Biden supporter" and Simp are synonyms.
MAGA only thinks in binaries. So if you're not for war criminal Biden, then you're for acceleration/Trump. Or something. Such tragically simple minds.
This is shameful gaslighting using Eichmann tactics. "Just following orders. Just one of 500." Shame on you for that.  Study "The Biden Plan for Latin America." Joe was the architect under Obama for coups and insurgencies. Refugee crisis caused by Joe's plan got Trump elected.
I'm being direct, blunt and committed to hard facts with you. Not attacking mind you. I won't tolerate anyone gaslighting about just who war criminal Joe Biden is. Not gonna happen. Fair?
Now why did you delete this,  Stand up behind your words. I've given you receipts. Hard facts. Biden demanded Reagan be far more violent against the Nicaraguan people's government. Biden backed Pinochet and CIA funding. Countless coups, insurgencies, colonial wars.
I see you've got a military industrial complex podcast. Have you ever watched that Biden CSPAN video segment? Or read about Biden's support for Pinochet and the Chilean fascists? He's a greater colonialist than Reagan and the Bushes.
You'd think! But then, you'd watch Joe Biden castigating Elliot 'Latino Children's Severed Heads on Plates' Abrams for being too soft on the Sandinistas. Joe had a hard on for the CIA-backed Contra militants.
Isn't it remarkable that in 2020 saying Slavery Bad, even if its outsourced and offshored, would be so controversial? It makes #BlueMAGA Biden supporters very unhappy.  I guess Walmart's gotta get those low prices somehow.
Does it matter that the tasty chicken came by slaughtering thousands of Latin Americans, stealing their land, installing fascist dictators and running American corporate farms there? Biden Plan for Latin America pro-colonialism policies? Maybe we should eat the slavery-free shit.
That'd be a wrong answer. Turns out Joe Biden is worse. He actually castigated Reagan via Elliot Abrams for being too soft on Nicaraguans. Wanted to crush all resistance to American colonialism. And Reagan didn't back Pinochet. Joe did. Here: receipts.
Historically accurate, though I've listened to Blue MAGA shout all day that you can't condemn Bill Clinton and Joe Biden for what they did decades ago. So we probably have to reject that submission ;)
For me Joe Biden is as bad as war criminal Elliott Abrams running for president. A pro  Latin America activist in the 80s, we knew Joe was no different than Reagan and Ollie North. Joe likes to kill anyone who opposes American colonialism. Fights hard for his global corporations.
I actually believe Biden would do a far better job on COVID. Heck, just believing its real is better than Trump, right? Can we get a pledge from Joe now to swear off colonial wars, coups, economic terrorism, etc? I'd vote for him if he did.
Joe Biden got us Clarence Thomas. I'm sure you're gonna go full MAGA on me and say I'm racist for opposing Thomas. Is that right, Thomas? It must be miserable living life through your deranged mind. I actually feel sorry for you.
If only there was some sort of precedent or solid historical fact that would help us understand who Biden would appoint. Then we wouldn't be arguing anymore.
Nothing like #PMCLivesMatter arguments from the Biden Bullies.
Biden won :)
But Marilyn gets great values at Target on all the goodies Joe Biden, Barack Obama, the Bushes helped steal from those "sh*thole countries" in the global south. She just doesn't want tyranny in her own back yard.
Your Blue MAGA perspective is violent and unacceptable. The US imposes totalitarianism globally. Learn about The Biden Plan for Latin America and Joe's role in coups, insurgencies, economic warfare for Empire. It's still slavery when Joe outsources it. You're still a slave owner.
My favorite is that neolibs don't even know that Joe Biden got Trump elected. What single issue propelled Trump to victory? The wall. What made the wall a hot issue? Honduran refugee crisis. Who's colonial policies caused that? Joe Biden.
1. Being marginally less violent globally, curtailing American colonial wars, coups and insurgencies for Empire. 2. Biden's worse than Trump on it.  Sigh...
But hey, I'm sincere when I promise to compromise and vote Biden if he just swears off the colonialism and Empire. That's not too much to ask, right? Why is that hard?
Every single time I raise Biden's record of being a war criminal in Latin America, they flee. The problem is there are no factual arguments other than admitting being a slave owner by proxy gives neoliberals a nice lifestyle.
You know how you shut up a liberal?  Ask them to explain why  slaughtered thousands more black and brown global south folks than Trump. The facts are damning. Sure Trump didn't stop what Bush, Obama, Biden and Hillary built. Toned it down a bit.  Crickets.
We can't seem to get this into liberals heads who shout "Trump is worse!" Based exclusively on hard, objective facts, Trump is less violent in colonial wars than Biden. Dems picked the one guy who is a war criminal and a nasty ghoul. Makes Elliot Abrams look like Mother Teresa.
Substantiation: Joe Biden is the 2000's architect of colonial conquest in Latin America. The plan is actually named after Joe. He led it under Obama. He will resume violence as soon as president for his corporate benefactors.
Sick of this crap by fake leftists. Joe Biden and the DNC do not give a shit about anti-authoritarian, anti-Empire, anti-colonial policies. They're gaslighting you when they claim to care about progressive issues. Vote shaming just reveals you're a Capitalist Toadie.
According to Joe Biden, black and brown bodies in the Global South do not count. Please stop depicting such people as equivalent to Whites in America as Joe has never deemed those subalterns worthy. White American Lives Matter!
THIS IS WHY THEY TAKE A KNEE. THIS IS WHY WE PROTEST. Inequality, injustice, racism.
And about Joe Biden???
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via

What's crazy is that truckers are so predominantly MAGA due to Obama / Biden / Clintons abandoning labor. Remember the Teamsters Union? My immediate family was hard core Democrat Teamsters. Most abandoned the party during Bill Clinton's war on the working class.
Sweet. So is Joe Biden with this misleading tweet. Looks like we both support lying candidates üòï
Really gotta add per my wrath on that shitposter's comments: Their general argument is that 1) Marxism = Tankie Authoritarianism, 2) Biden-Harris is Tankie, 3) Biden-Harris are Marxists, 4) If you disagree you haven't studied Marxism. Swiss cheese has less holes than this arg.
Historically more republicans have voted by mail than Democrats, &amp; that includes the majority of a Trumps current &amp; former cabinet members. Him trying to block people from voting by mail is an bizarre strategy since it likely hurts him more than Biden, also he‚Äôs a fucking moron.
You don't have to be pro-Trump (although I certainly am), in order to have contempt for the Biden/Harris ticket.
Biden should have this privilege also.

This is how I feel about Joe Biden.  Whenever I see he's tending i wonder if this is the time he forgot the layout of his home, trips and fell down the stairs.  (I Don't actually think this)   I responded this way to show you how disgusting wishing someone dead over politics is.

When a nation is on the verge of total revolution, its lower and middle class thrown into the fires of precarity, one doesn't shove forward two overpaid hacks for Capital as the answer. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have always been order takers for the Overclass. #GeneralStrike
"I love my earthly brother Joe Biden for his principled stance on austerity. When Bernie Bros demanded Medicare for All, Free College and no more colonial wars, Joe channeled his inner Adolph and shouted Nine! Nine! Nine!"
I hear ya. I think as a former VP, Biden has lifetime Secret Service protection. And now, as the presumptive Dem nominee, it's likely that the detail has been increased.
Biden - ‚Äúwe need to win the minority and womens vote!‚Äù  *picks the absolute worst Minority and Woman to have as VP.   Starting to wonder if Joe is starting to lose his hearing and eyesite aswell.
I wear a mask. I have no idea how they think they‚Äôd enforce this.  I heard that Biden wants to require it outside too. That‚Äôs just stupid.  I‚Äôm actually more sick of hearing about masks than I am of COVID.
A. Gender based pay inequality has been illegal in this country since 1963.  Is your memory now as bad as Beijing Biden's?  B. Nothing you say will have any value until you condemn the Marxist led insurrection now terrorizing our nation.
BROKEN NEWS: Joe Biden issues statement that after he's elected president and all Americans are forced to wear a mask, that the mask will be required "not to cover up the hair, scalp or any portion thereof of any female person wearing such masks."
I wonder how much Clintons and Biden paid him to write this! He is the actual ConMan!
Watch this video. Joe biden is a straight up creep.
Well Joe Biden does not want you in his god damn party, that's for sure. :)
If Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or any of their staff appear in public without a mask outdoors at any point in the next three months, will they be hypocrites and according to Biden's own standard "unpatriotic?"
Do you agree with Joe Biden that all Americans should be required to wear mask outdoors for at least the next three months?
Surprisingly Joe Biden disagrees with Hillary and DWS on the FBI report that Russia hacked the DNC. So much for #Russiagate!
Surely you must not know Joe Biden. "Come on, man!" But your Disney-esque world fed to you by the marketers and public relations profs must be comfortable and fun. Sorry to bother you with reality. Carry on!
Joe Biden has spent forty years in Congress and as VP as nothing but a walking, talking anger management lawsuit. There isn't an ounce of decency in that nasty grifters being. You're being played like Trump cons his MAGA fools.
He‚Äôll give Biden a piece of chcolate while the crowds orgasms in sync

+7 in WI +6 in PA, +7.5 in MI, +5 in FL. It‚Äôs only August, so it‚Äôs certainly still possible things change (hence Silver‚Äôs 29% chance for Trump). But that‚Äôs such a wide margin to overcome and Biden only has to win like two of those states.
Injecting bleach is #Fakenews, you know it. Hydro has tons of doctors being suppressed that it works. The only one who should be scared of Harris, is Joe Biden. That boy doesn't have four years in him and we all know it. She slept her way to the top. All she has to do now is wait
Joe Biden should not win.
Treat Biden like they treated Reagan!!!!!
I've pinned this to refer back to it. If Joe Biden is progressive, THIS IS THE EASIEST PLEDGE EVER. If he's a fascist, he will say no.  Simple binary test.  Blue MAGA: Don't yell at me to vote Joe. Read this and get Joe to pledge. If he doesn't, then he's a fascist. Easy peasy!
Blue MAGA says I have to name my price for voting Biden. Begrudgingly, here it is: No colonial wars for Empire.  Swear off ALL coups, genocides, invasions, military aid for terrorists. Leave Venezuela and Nicaragua alone. End Yemen genocide. Syria drones.   Do that and I'll vote.
Except Joe Biden is the one guy who always finished second in a one-person race.
The administrators of biden‚Äôs account should fight back.
Hmmmmmmm here you go Rebubs  And you're saying Biden likes little girls? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ nice try!
I'm a huge fan of snark and dark humor. Got my ass ratioed for it last Jan and loved every minute of my public flogging. Posted a dream ticket with President Kamala, Klobuchar AG, Warren Treasury. Etc.   Funny how in six months after a Biden win, I may have been totally right.
If Biden knew how to fix things at all and executed on them he would‚Äôve under Obama, didn‚Äôt seem like he did then so why now
It's not a popular argument. But unlike Blue MAGA and Khive, I deal with lots of non-ideological independents who are undecided. Dems shit the bed bad with Biden. Truly second worst to Bloomberg. Maybe worst on foreign policy.
Nicaragua coup is go the moment Biden is in. It's why Contra war criminal daughter Navarro is tweeting happy thoughts tonight. Contra fascists, Venezuela right wingers, all readying for that green light.
This gives me more pause on Biden in this thought experiment. Biden is the MIC boy. He's always done whatever they ask for. Trump is in constant battles and by no means their puppet. He's a grifter and a con running his own racket. That a valid read?
Hard call. Biden's donors want him to saber rattle China and extract concessions. Depends on if China is still in continuing game or end game on ascendency. Nobody's bothering Russia. They have nothing the Overclass wants to take. Venezuela tho...
Biden team should be making content like this ALL DAMN DAY.  All the platforms. All day long.
And if we want independent votes, we'd better do DAMN BETTER than this. I'll give you Biden video in Senate at war criminal Abrams that we need to be more murderous in supporting the fascist Contras. You want that proof? Or his support for fascist coups? I got 'em. "Aspiring?"
Think of it this way: You just approached an independent voter. They asked you why to vote for Biden. "Because Trump is a Nazi!!!" Okay, they say. You show me hard evidence of this and I'll reconcile it with Biden's 40+ years of propping up fascists and Nazis. I might vote Biden.
Build Backwards Better is literally the Biden campaign theme. Backwards progress apparently?
During the 1970s through 2016, Nicaraguans, Guatamalans, Chileans, etc. were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by colonial neoliberalism. Joe Biden a chief proponent. Under incompetent Trump that has mostly stalled. Is this your "incremental progress"?
NOTICE: This is a devil's advocate thought experiment; I want to push this question objectively. Millions of independents will not respond to "Orange Man Bad" "Trump Nazi" "Trump rapist" and other hyperbole when verifiable facts implicate Biden as much or more. Need better args.
It's critically important we use precision and accuracy in our arguments. If we gaslight "Trump's a Nazi" we only turn even more away who know that's just hyperbole. Worse is when Trump illuminates all the actual fascists Joe Biden has put into power via CIA coups and wars.
This is extensively a devil's argument. Don't misunderstand me. But I want you to objectively substantiate your argument: What solid proof do you have that Donald Trump is a member of the Nazi party? I can prove Biden has backed and empowered ACTUAL Nazis via coups.
Which Nazi? The corporate con man in Orange, or the ghoul who actually used U.S. military, IC and foreign policy to overthrow democracies in Latin America and put in ACTUAL Nazis? Contras. Pinochet. Guatamalan military coup. That's 100% Biden. Biden's the Nazi. Trump's a con.
Trump made Rex SoS and Rex bombed out. What did Rex do to make anything different than Obama/Biden/Hillary? Nothing. These are scary stories for children that corporate neolibs tell us. Joe's backed by the same people. Kamala got rich off of them. Let's not gaslight each other.
Trump boat rally maybe you don‚Äôt know what they are because Biden has never had one.
Seems I need to have a convo with #khive.  If I vote Trump, I keep my guns. No new colonial wars. Nation crashes. Democrats listen to leftists.  If I vote Biden, Kamala takes my guns. New wars. Empire remains strong. Democrats keep us silenced.  Why wouldn't I vote Trump?
I can't wait until Biden/Harris pledge access to a timeshare as a solution for the housing/eviction crisis.
Joe Biden was far right of Reagan and war criminal Elliott Abrams on colonialism, coups, death squads and backing fascists. Loved the Contras. Supported Pinochets efforts. Disasterous Biden Plan for Latin America wrecked Honduras giving Trump winning border wall crisis.
How many successful CEOs ever landed their job by telling the company's board "Damn that last guy you had here sucked. Let me list 100 ways he sucked."  That's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's entire campaign strategy.
You need to find a mirror and a history book and have a very honest conversation before you accuse. Joe Biden backed Contras and Pinochet. Actual Nazis and fascists. Joe is a colonialist and fascist. He just fakes liberal back home while destroying millions of non-Americans.
"Black and Brown girls..."ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Would someone tell Biden it's 2020 not 1920...
Were the Biden/Harris speeches as inspiring as I found them to be or has it just been that long since we‚Äôve heard presidential-level speeches given?   My suspicion is the answer is yes.
I am a life long Republican who wouldnt vote for Trump again if Biden added the skeletol remains of jeffrey epstein as his VP.  Its not a left v right thing. Never has been and never will be. üòé
The event was the first in a rollout that Biden aides say blends the historic nature of Harris‚Äô selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation‚Äôs circumstances.
Go ahead I‚Äôll wait for your facts bro. Google isn‚Äôt a friend of Trump so what do you have!? Nadda. Tell me one thing Biden has done for this country. Nadda. I have a list of things Trump is doing FOR our country not TO our country.
Like Biden is as we speak? Lol ass
Yeah, because Biden‚Äôs gonna lose!
Was Biden‚Äôs screen busted?
I am extremely happy. I think they are quite honestly the perfect pair. With Biden as the nom (not even in my top 5 btw), Warren needs to be Senate Majority Leader, Booker for HUD, Yang for Treasury
biden just trying to find the best smelling shampoo for what little hair he has left
Well it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm not Joe Biden then. I am me. I
I know you are and I appreciate a conversation. We are far more similar than different in ideologies. Biden is a means to an end to the most disgusting chapter of American history since George W. Bush. Lots to do and little time to get it done. The planet needs us all.
Yes, the dead people overwhelmingly support Biden/Harris, perhaps because they have so much in common with Biden.
Well a third party sure is not going to win because the only 3rd party person who had a chance is  and he is supporting Biden/Harris
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.
True. Again, I‚Äôm looking for people that I don‚Äôt have to convince that science is real to work with going forward. If that means voting for Joe Biden, then so be it. Do I wish a more progressive ticket emerged? Absolutely! But it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll make lemonade instead of complain.
Oh, did I mention I interviewed Joe Biden... in Sheldon?  There's always a Sheldon connection.
Of course she will. She hates tRump so we know it will be Vice President Biden. Especially now having Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Additionally, Warren supporters were EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN SANDERS AND BIDEN. Her dropping out wouldn't have made a bit of difference.  I like Sanders' ideas, but the candidate himself ran a bad campaign. How do I know?  BECAUSE BIDEN BEAT HIM FAIR AND SQUARE.

Joe Biden has chosen former rival Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate. That story and more national news on KELOLAND This Morning. WATCH LIVE:
Kamala did great in the Iowa Caucus. Then again, Joe Biden got skunked so bad everyone assumed he was over. Nobody turned out for Joe. His rallies had five people in funeral homes.
I believe it actually hurts Trump. I've visited with dozens of MAGA who encountered those ads and then showed them how Joe Biden was to the right of Trump on issue after issue. They realized Trump's campaign was not honest.
My rule is to vote for the person with the best chance of winning who isn't an authoritarian or fascist or an enabler of the same. It's why, even though I don't love Biden, I will do everything I can to get him elected with a Democratic Senate.
All I know is Biden likes to be inappropriate with children and Harris loves locking us minorities up for life for non violent Weed charges
2000 Lieberman (Jewish) 2004 Kerry (Catholic) 2008 Obama (African-American), Biden (Catholic), Palin (woman) 2012 None of them were. Obama/Biden again, Romney (LDS), Ryan (Catholic) 2016 Clinton (woman), Kaine (Catholic) 2020 Biden (Catholic), Harris (African-American woman)
The ‚Äúradical‚Äù Biden/Harris ticket? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Kamala is Team Clinton's proxy. Bowed to Ma Clinton. Their best chance at retaining influence. That's probably the sole reason. If Biden wanted any backing from Clinton's then he was going to obey and pick their choice for VP.
Joe #Biden names Kamala Harris as running mate.  If you have a disability  and rely on #PlasticStraw to SURVIVE better stock up now! Anyone want to go out to eat with me while #PeopleWithDisabilities are still able to? #DisabledLivesMatter
People are talking about wanting seeing the Harris/Pence debate.  Really? What everyone wants is to see the Trump/Biden debate. Harris was a good pick, but the question still remains, hiw will Biden do in multiple head to heads against Trump, that are live.
He's also pushing the nickname "phony Kamala." If Biden wins, do you think Phony Kamala will end up in a match with the real Kamala? If so, will it be at the SoTU or Survivor Series?
I feel like not picking Elizabeth Warren was a huge mistake for Biden. #Biden's VP #VicePresident
I can‚Äôt vote for Trump. I won‚Äôt vote for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚ÄúnotTrump‚Äù.  Another Presidential election where I have no political home. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I really considered Biden early on. He‚Äôs a likable guy who doesn‚Äôt seem too extreme to me. But his obvious issues with dementia sealed the deal for me. If he is elected, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôll be doing the work of the Presidency.  And that‚Äôs just wrong.
History buffs: Has there ever been a case where the fascists were beaten by an economic elite by asking the people to vote for the fascists to kindly leave? Biden restoring the old capitalist order after Trump's neofascist rise would seem unprecedented.
I wouldn‚Äôt say she was doing a good job but either way, I‚Äôm very concerned if Trump wins again, and if Biden wins. Seems like a lose/lose for the country either way.
Absolutely and worse. Biden brings back the drugs capital got addicted to which gave us Trump. More Underclass destruction. Colonial aggression. Global corporate empowerment. We need rehab not a massive drug-fueled bender.
Say Trump continues to sabotage his campaign and somehow manages to lose to Biden/Harris. Joe rips open the military actions in Yemen, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Syria, agitates China. Inherits wrecked economy and bungles into Carter Malaise x1000.   What fascist do we get in 2024?
I‚Äôll say this as a Bernie guy...neither  Biden or Harris were high on any of my lists of preferred candidates.L, but I will PROUDLY #vote for the #BidenHarris2020 ticket. I‚Äôm voting for the future of this country and not the past of any single candidate. #BidenHarris #VPHarris
Biden doesn‚Äôt even realize he us running for President.  He thinks he is running for the Senate.
It's official: 2020 is Corporate Republican Biden/Harris vs Neofascist Theocratic Trump/Pence.
I understand why Republicans ran losers Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996: they knew anyone was gonna lose to Clinton. But I don't get going with life-long loser Biden and primary loser Harris. Barack and the DNC picked the two least capable. It's a joke ticket. Truly tragic.
I'm confused. I figured you were just another BlueMAGA cheering Cop Lives Matter. Excited about Kamala and right wing Biden. But your wall seems to be defund cops. What's going on?
Joe Biden picked a Biden-like running mate and half my timeline seems pissed. Hope this holds. It might be a nice change from a timeline that's pissed at Noem for doing Noem-like things.
No kidding at all. They were elated. "Kamala's an even bigger loser than Biden and she's a back stabbing ******.". Direct quote from one. They're celebrating Trump's victory already.   We will see. I'm not convinced he wants to win either. Nobody seems to.
#VPPick #VPHarris Prediction: If Biden-Harris wins the election, Harris will become POTUS shortly after Jan. 2022 thru Biden's resignation or his removal under Amendment 25 Section 4.
Does Biden even know this yet?
How many allies responded to the Harris announcement with a shrug? It hit me that I'm so used to Joe Biden ALWAYS making the worst decision that the announcement was comfortably consistent. What was your reaction?
Picking Kamala was a predictably bad move for Biden- no demographic gains, plus he‚Äôs picking a prosecutor in the midst of this political climate. He‚Äôs cemented corporate neoliberalism for the next 8+ years in what‚Äôs the ultimate rebuke to the true left.
The Biden/Harris lineup makes sense. After all, Kamala was so terrible she was the first big name to drop out. And Joe bombed in all the initial primaries and had to be dragged across the SC finish line by Obama. It's the Lose/Lose ticket.
Looking forward to a Biden/Harris ticket. Is it perfect? Of course not.   Is it better than what we got right now? Hell yes.   So suck it up and vote in November like your life depends on it.  Because, well, it probably does.
So where does the assumption come that I support Biden?
His stament isn‚Äôt wrong. The presidential election will end with either end with President Biden or President Trump. Yes you can withhold your vote but that‚Äôs not an outcome of the national election but instead your own personal choice.
Do they really want to start going through who said horrible things about the Presidential pick? I‚Äôm pretty sure every single Republican has said way nastier then she ever did to Biden.
She also believes the 25+ women who have accused your father of sexual assault. Harris said she believed Biden made them uncomfortable. Not literally raped women like your Dad did.
Kamala Harris is a big W for the Biden campaign

Too close to call right now primarily because while Biden theoretically has a huge lead, he has zero turnout intensity.

Or more accurately, we do the dirty to the young in this country. Capitalism enjoys the consumption of its young just as it's ancestral god Baal prescribed. From child groper Biden to Epstein club members Clinton and Trump, devouring the young is the entitlement of the Overclass.
Honestly surprised Biden remembers how to do that! I suppose there are something you never really forget. If only running a country were as simple as riding a bike, we'd be set!
So, the Dems drag POTUS for grammar &amp; spelling in his tweets but he tweets the way he speaks.  Biden on the other has a night &amp; day difference between his public speaking &amp; tweets.  There's no way in Hell he writes his own tweets.
Biden is controlled by no one for he does not have a brain
Biden's V.P. Search: Chris Dodd, a D.C. Insider Helping Pick the Democratic Running Mate - The New York Times - [covering up scandals and silencing witnesses is his forte -  I lived in CT and it was a scary place because of him and people like him.]
Being Joe Biden.
That's a good suggestion. I wonder who else Biden might consider for State.
Apparently John Kasich is as far left as Joe Biden tolerates.
Yes, I saw a Biden ad last night. Here in RED South Dakota!
Trump at briefing: " Biden is now controlled by the Bernie Sanders left wing."
Yes. Both Republicans and Democrats are in strong unity in their colonial projects. Trump has gleefully carried forward the coups and illegal wars initiated under Obama via the Biden Plan for Latin America.
Good for him!!! When their union supports dumb Biden publicly, time to clean house.   Remember he knows more and is much more intelligent then you are..:.
And China wants Biden so they can get back the control they had with gay Obama.....they started this attack and people like you buy into the media control liberal agenda.
You are not making a fair statement here.  See the NSC Press Release which also discusses support for Biden from China, anti Trump efforts from Iran.    Also, what did you and Obama do about foreign interference in the 2016 election during the campaign?
Biden will be our next president. And you‚Äôll still be an irrelevant has-been.
......you did hear what Biden just said right? lol. Oh man.
Love how its fake news when your proven wrong. Of course if you dont vote for Biden you ain't black.
Even better, on the off chance that he doesn't get re-elected, Biden will be forced to rescind this EO.
Given Chomsky's message of "Your feelings don't matter. Suck it up and vote for Biden to get rid of Trump," I'd value his analysis on why the more pro-Empire colonialist candidate is the one the Left must back. Sure, Trump is a mess.
bailout for people not for a stupid remodeling of the west wing. let Joe Biden deal with that when he‚Äôs in office in January
Other than a weak coup in Bolivia and sustaining actions on Obama/Hillary/Biden war projects, what has Empire devoured lately? It's got to be incredibly hungry for new blood. Long list of nations ready for the colonial hammer for a Biden/Rice admin.
I've learned the following from of the new pack: - Biden is 100% for M4A - Biden is anti interventionist. A dove, not a hawk - Biden was a stronger champion for BLM than Bernie because he had friends like John Lewis  Many good new accounts. Some clearly working for Biden effort.
