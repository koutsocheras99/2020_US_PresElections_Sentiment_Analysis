I find all of this deeply depressing.  I guess I just lived in a college-educated bubble that was pro-business and culturally moderate to liberal.  I really just didn’t see the roots of Trumpism in any real way growing up in Elkhart.  Some of these folks are voting for Biden.  🤷‍♂️
Biden saying stupid shit, getting corrected, and publicly talking about the mistake might actually be good for this country.  I’m a strong believer in people working through their imperfections.
I’m hopeful that suburban realignment and Biden’s strength with older voters will soften midterm challenges for Democrats if Biden is elected.  They’re more reliable voters.  Too many Democrats take for granted that you need to keep showing up to pass and protect legislation.

Trump is unraveling. Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. He’s certainly not against God. #TrumpIsUnwell
not if Biden wins
Oh, you don’t know what Biden meant when he said he “knew a guy and every pumpkin stand in North Bergen had his name inside the door?” Guess who does know: Mr. and Mrs. America. They know. And they know they don’t like it when elities scoff at them and their traditions.
Don't be complacent. We have to fucking beat Donald Trump in November, and Biden is our guy! Go Joe, go!
Joe Biden has a stutter; Donald Trump is a moron.
Sigh. To everyone trying to cancel Biden this time: He didn’t say that *every* Irish person was good at baseball. He said that someone “Threw like an Irishman.” There’s a difference.
Another Biden supporter.
Ha.Ha. You so Funny. Ha. Ha. Joe Biden, Republicans, funny funny.
U N H I N G E D &amp; panicking . Biden has more religion in his pinkie than Trump’s extended family.
Biden has already said he’ll immediately restore the CFPB to proper functioning.
We all know this is bullshit but he’s trying to charge up opposition to Biden.
Well, the upside of Biden is he’s cautious like Obama.
I feel like we’ve probably had presidents where almost no one voting for the guy thought he would be making any decisions or exerting any kind of agency in office, but given the way presidents have been lionized in recent decades, I feel like Biden would be the first in a while
She’s close to Biden and Trump trashed her dad.  It’s ridiculous.  She’s just trying to create media intrigue to maximize coverage of her.
Wow.  It's almost like there is an unelected oligarchy with immense wealth and power exploiting this health crisis to enrich themselves even more.  I'm sure voting for Joe Biden will fix all this. #mtpol #mtnews
That’s the point for democrats. They are prepping their future leader knowing full-well he’s going to be replaced soon after. America hopefully understands. Biden is not their guy. He’s being protected to protect Obama.
No, Joe Biden has Alzheimer's disease. It is cruel of the Democrat Party and Jill Biden to keep pushing Biden out like a monkey show.
Hey ⁦ if you’re wondering why you should take a cognitive test just watch the clip embedded in this article, and in case you don’t recognize the guy talking, it’s you. Your attempts to deny the need for a test, proves the test is needed.
The rosiest projections we saw with Warren - who herself rejected “defund the police” - as VP was a two point bump.  It’s not a large group.  And Biden is chasing a far larger bloc of voters, particularly older voters, who would not respond well to this.
Personally, I don’t want Biden to lose but that’s just me.
Has anyone seen joe biden?
Glad to see Joe Biden's team putting all of its energy into winning the crucial Jay Leno vote.
It's possible there is much trash talk in our house from the Delaware native directed at the Milwaukee native over Biden's choice of venue for accepting the nomination.

I’ll feel more at ease voting for Biden if he picks a good woman VP
Hmmm...diverting votes from Biden to a black guy, absolutely nefarious and pustules he stopped. Glad  is on the case.
To everyone that rags on Biden...
That’s ridiculous. We keep schools closed until we have a testing and tracing plan in place and an actual plan to keep them safe. A gradual, common sense plan under President Biden...
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.

It’s so hard to keep track of whether I’m a socialist or a communist. After Biden’s elected, I think I’ll just be an American citizen 😏
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Jason, Warren can exert plenty of influence over a Biden presidency from the Senate and doesn’t *need* to be his Vice President.  In fact, her being VP could result in Biden icing her out and the VP can’t publicly fight with the president.
The data overwhelmingly rejects that progressives are more viable than moderates in swing districts.  When I supported Warren in the primary, I knew this and she consistently underperformed Biden by about 2 points.  I supported her, anyway, because any of them could win.
I mean, you could google “Joe Biden interview”
Dear Mr. Biden: First on the agenda: Undo everything #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace did.
“Socialists Need to ‘Curb Their Enthusiasm’ and Cast a Pragmatic Vote for Biden,” by Alex Press
What a horrible argument that is!  It would be a bad idea to expose Biden’s flawed policy agenda. #trainwreck
Thread by  Thread I didn't know how insane  would drive his opponents. HE did. As I always say, he's only about a billn times smarter than me.  Biden refuses to concede. Alleging voter suppression, he per…
#deadlineWH Right now the issue is that they (DNC? Biden campaign?) stated publicly he would announce his pick today, then a week ago it was "PSYCH!  Just kidding!  We need another 2 weeks".  Doesn't look good for the always forgetful Joe. Not good at all for his credibility.
Well if Biden wins, we are all in deep trouble for a number of reasons.
You’re half a conspiracy away from claiming Biden killed the oil and gas sector by giving them frack when they demanded frack. That he should’ve known they’d frack themselves out of business. Like giving cheap vodka to an alcoholic.
Not voting for Joe Biden is not a cute, alt personality quirk. You’re literally being ignorant of all the people less privileged than you who’s lives could be better under his administration.
Why would Biden supporters go to one of your rallies?
Joe Biden Won’t Save America. Let’s stop pretending that Biden is the moral option.
I fully agree with what you're saying here:  but wtf are our options now?  Basically we're f*d.
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
I feel like people aren’t quite realizing that, for how loyal to the Party past presidents have typically been, Biden IS the Party. He barely even has a real candidacy. He’s like a manifestation summoned by the apparatus itself.
Like, dude, IT’S JOE FUCKING BIDEN.  And the other guy’s a lunatic.
Republicans who voted for Romney, didn’t vote for Hillary or Trump in 2016, and don’t plan to vote for Biden or Trump in 2020 are generally pretty obnoxious people.
Drink enough to get you through 😊 of course with Biden as president, you can actually get some sleep at night 😴
you are so fake lost sleepy joe biden isnt going to be President he doesnt know where or what hes saying Trump did more for Americans in 3 yrs then obama/biden in 8 yrs all they did was fed our enemies billions and are responsible for our soldiers being murdered!👇
What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden
Gonna be funny if Democrats overperform in the 2022 midterms because Biden is doing battle with his left flank, undermining Republicans’ attacks on a “radical” Democratic Party.
Mid-June, “defund the police” becomes a thing.  Biden rejects it.  No indications this has hurt his numbers.  Right now, that little Trump surge is probably a byproduct of Republicans pushing a “Marxist Trojan horse” argument on Biden.
Activists don’t really seem to understand that by appearing to be crazed ideologues, they’re going to make Biden look more reasonable and strengthen his hand while undercutting their own effectiveness.  Which is probably a good thing based on this stuff.
Biden should go film a spot on front of that wall calling Trump a 'yellow-bellied pony soldier' that ends with the line 'When I'm President, this wall is coming down and Pennsylvania Avenue will be returned to the people' or some similar sentiment.
Well, Biden’s strength prior to coronavirus was his bipartisan appeals.  It’s how Buttigieg won or almost won Iowa.  His signs were all over rural, northeastern Iowa.  I even saw one in a deep red county.
I don't really care.  Biden needs to take his time and select a candidate that can handle the office should something incapacitate him.  That's all that matters to me.
So you can’t vote for Trump nor Biden!
I don't think the Biden campaign is very worried about Sanders' preferences when it comes to Vice-President.  I don't think there is any objective data on the preferences of Sanders supporters. If I were to guess, I'd say Warren would be less acceptable than Harris.
I’ll vote against Trump no mattter the situation.  Biden may not have been my first choice but he has my support and admiration.
If they debate, I hope Biden makes some sneering golf jabs.
Does Biden not golf?  He really likes to go after Trump for golfing, which I find amusing after Obama got the same treatment from Republicans.
You ain’t black -Joe Biden
John Nichols is an idiot and I’d like to point out that Bernie didn’t beat Biden in a single county in Wisconsin so the notion that he has his finger on the pulse of Wisconsin politics is absurd.  Progressives need adults leading.
I also have concerns about Warren against a post-Trump Republican.  We can’t be sure who they nominate in 2024.  Which is why I want Biden to punt by picking someone who won’t run.  Who comes next will have to prove they can build a coalition to win.
What Dispicable Kemp Did to Stacey Abrams Is About to Happen to Joe Biden.   via
Biden dominated the Democratic primary and yet these dumb fucks think talking trash to his supporters is somehow going to result in the policy outcomes they want.  Or they just don’t really give a fuck and prefer talking trash to governing.
Like, I’m not going to war with anyone for VP.  It’s Biden’s pick, there’s no value to all this internecine squabbling.  Make the case for your candidate and chill the fuck out on other people unless you have *genuine* concerns.
You get more stupid by the day. Oh and ya, Biden will win on Nov 3 and you’ll deserve the humiliation.
Yeah, Facebook is the most “Middle America” platform, perfect for Biden.
Good thing the US Gov’t changes every 4 or at longest 8 years. I’ll wait to hear what the Biden Administration says.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Same poll that has Biden winning!
i wonder if biden picks harris as vp and they win, would they roll out her famous solution to truancy nationwide?
Yea and Biden would have did better my ass he doesnt even know who or where he is most of time that's why the deadbeat Democrat clown party puts there lost his mind sleepy Joe Puppet in his basement so he doesnt embarrass the socialist democrat clown party which has happened!
So to recap:  -UK insists relationship with EU must be arms-length distant.. -UK-China alignment now out of the question due to C19, Huawei and HK.  -Boris can’t sell U.S. deal to public as long as Trump is POTUS, and Biden appears indifferent to the “special relationship”
joe biden really needs to pick romney as his running mate, but i dont think he wants to lose such s powerful voice in the senate
TBH, Biden would at least work towards restoring US-UK relations back to pre-Trump normals.  But this does kind of throw cold water on Boris’ hopes that Biden can help him sell a U.S. deal with the British public.

I was a big time Warren advocate during the primary and have zero idea who any of these people are.  Warren Twitter definitely talks trash but I haven’t seen anyone (seriously) say they’re not voting for Biden.
My favorite thing about Biden is him being receptive to progressive policy.  My second favorite thing about Biden is he pays zero attention to Twitter.
A lot of people seem confused but Joe Biden won the primary and is going to do what he feels most comfortable doing.  This VP process isn’t a do-over on the primary.
The VP for Joe Biden will be "ascending" on their first day in office. Biden doesn't know where he's even at right now.   "Honey! What state are we in?"
Yeah, Biden was nothing like that as VP.

You’ll never win a “Trump’s less racist than Biden” argument. It’s just too easy. We’ll stick to  what’s important.  160K Americans are dead. Trumps response: “it is what it is”.  If that’s okay with either of you, seek medical attention immediately.
Lying to stoke fear won’t work.  People are not motivated by fear or incompetence or hate.  They want good policies, decency and honesty.  Trump has none of these. Biden has these and much more.   #TrumpKillsAmericans  #Biden2020
That’s a fake photo of Biden. Nice try.
Yeah... It's looking more and more like we're not going to get a debate. Sleepy  and the crew will somehow make it a "hazard" to have the debates. Trump will be made out to be the bad guy for "puting people in danger" all to protect Biden. Very sad actually. #Fairfight
Biden has said dumb shit. Those gaffes are either due to his weak cognitive ability, or he might be a little racist.  His actions speak otherwise.   One of those men suppresses the black vote. One of those men wanted the death penalty for 5 innocent black kids.  Not Biden.
Give me a break. Do you really think people want to live in a Socialist America???Because I don’t! I believe in freedom. None under Biden or who ever is going to tell him what to say.😡
Oh, I didn't realize Biden said the following:  - "kung flu" - "When Mexico sends its people... They're rapists" - "Haiti? Why do we want people from Haiti here?" - "Why do we want these people from all these shithole countries here?"  I got more, let me know.
Let's unpack:  1) "CNN propagandists" - C'mon. That's just dumb to say and you sound like a Trump puppet (who's a serial liar) 2) Biden isn't inherently racist. He may say dumb shit, and he might be a little racist, but if you're comparing him to Trump, there's no comparison.
Lol.  Biden is Catholic.  Trump is desperate. #TrumpDeathToll160K

No way asshole.
Joe Biden on Wednesday excoriated Trump for promoting on Twitter the dubious claims of Dr. Stella Immanuel, the Houston doctor who’s claimed to have effectively treated hundreds of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine.
Biden’s speech getting worse by the day. He’s mostly unintelligible any more.
This isn’t the first report.  By selecting Dodd, Biden basically gave a green light for neoliberals to trash hopefuls they view as too progressive.
To be fair, Biden calls himself The Gaffe Machine. I will be gladly voting for Joe, but the transcript of the debates should be both hilarious and humiliating for all Americans.Biden is buring himself
Stop it! We all know Biden isn’t writing these posts. He’s too far gone.
Super phucked up for the guy who had ☮️ protesters gassed to get a pic holding a Bible upside down in front of a ⛪️ he’ll never attend to say Joe Biden has no religion. And I’m sorry, but when he said Biden will “hurt god” he’s thinking of himself, he’s “god” in this scenario.
Dems will keep Biden in the basement until the mail in ballots start coming in and then when they decide it is a good time, they will let Jim Crow Joe out to have 1 debate. But it will be somewhat rehearsed or online and not in person.
Biden is anti God apparently
I can honestly believe that. I asked a bunch of them “Why are you voting for Biden?” Not a SINGLE ONE would answer me. They have no idea why they are voting for a man that mentally is not there. I PERSONALLY wish he was seen and have some testing done to find out what is wrong..
Biden's team disagrees, or else they wouldn't have had a staffer write an apology for him.

Keep talking about Biden. First was Hillary’s health (non-issue), now Biden. I know you don’t want responsibility, but your brain dead listeners think you are smart and value your opinion. Be better.
Voting for Joe Biden means you have no core beliefs
Also a debate hasn’t really shifter the state of a race since ‘76 w ford’s sphere of influence comment. There have been bad performances but nothing that fundamentally changed the race. Biden did ok against Bernie and I would consider stinky Bernie a better debater than trump.
It is true to some degree. Its the fact that Biden said it! My Lord, if President Trump had said that I shuttered to think what would happen. #Blexit #walkaway #Trump2020
Does it mean Never Trump is a vote for Biden?
trump has cognitively checked out. Does he ever do his homework? Biden is a very devout Catholic and trump has no religion.
Yep, Joe "you ain't black" Biden is planning to take people's firearms
As he simultaneously claims Biden is demented and ineffective. But with the power to destroy God. Impressive.
Why voting for Biden?? What is he going to do to help America that makes you want to vote for a man that is not mentally fit to even run for President?? What does he have to offer???
This is from Biden's own Twitter, so tell us again how "nobody is taking away any guns"
LOOOOOOOOOOOL as if biden gonna be so much better
No, Democrat states who chose to fight the president instead of take care of the residents of the states they are in are responsible. What will Biden do? Nothing!! Stay hidden in the basement!!

Did i miss any big news while i was gone? I presume cops are still being racist bastards, Biden is useless, the US' poor response to a pandemic is killing people,  needs to go fuck himself aaaand... That about it?
Joe Biden: can my Veep be 15 years old and smell like strawberries?  Staff:  for the last time no  Biden: well I don't really care how she smells if that helps.
US "democracy" should be eroded along with the rest of it.  Biden also chastises Trump for some of the few good things he's proposed like reducing troop levels in Asia and Europe.

I don't see much language about lesser evil or greater good among Trump folks. Trump is an absolute good and the Dems an absolute evil. There is no anguish or worrying about doing the less harm, there is enthusiasm on the whole. Hoping Biden picks up folks on the margins
Of course I think Marxism means the textbook definition, not anybody who happens to be left of center from Bernie to Biden.

Every media outlet that covers the “president” live should be on a 5 sec delay - if he starts to attack  Biden/Harris cut the feed. Simple.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Can’t wait for Biden/Harris to win, do absolutely nothing substantive to fix any of the massive structural problems, and then lose 100+ congressional seats in the 2022 midterm and get absolutely demolished by Tom Cotton/Nikki Haley in 2024. Hey, at least Orange Man gone, right?
Did Joe scarbrough just take the Biden story and decide, "f*ck it.. I'll just say this is Trump."????
You know what, Jeannine Piro and this idiotic outrage by liberals just raised an incredible point I hadn't considered... Biden may be solely  attempting to get Kamala elected. He'll drop out.
Biden voted for the illegal Iraq War, which killed thousands and displaced millions. But hey, who cares about Iraqis, right?!
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
The bullshit will continue unabated regardless of who you vote for. For the 40th consecutive year the oligarchy will win BIG.  "Nothing will fundamentally change." -Joe Biden to donors.
Look up “Biden quid pro quo Ukraine”. Or do you choose to ignore that little diddy?
um, your argument was about a Biden presidency, not about governors...
For Biden to choose a VP that doesn’t meet the minimum quals spelled out in Constitution, after long vetting process of 11 candidates, he &amp; team would be totally incompetent (like Trump &amp; his team). And a dude  a 3rd tier law school is the only one to figure it out. Right. 1/2
Yeah! Who cares about all the Iraqis murdered, tortured and displaced by Biden’s Iraq War vote. Those people don’t matter. What matters is liberals feeling comfortable with the war monger in the White House.
Yeah, you Biden people truly have your fingers on the pulse.
BOY do I love to see Trump getting nervous seeing a powerful black woman take the VP spot for Biden. Women are powerful and are going to change the world.
You can’t oppose the oligarchy if you vote for it. Trump and Biden are both part of the ruling class. Stop affirming them.
Joe Biden was a segregationist. That was not a unification movement.
Biden doesn't even care!🤣
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I realize this election is (somehow) not a foregone conclusion despite a perfect storm of generically incumbent-destroying factors, but I want to add, I don’t think Trump’s campaign calling Biden and Harris “horrible” and “mean” is the stuff of champions
I have a whole rant about *how being Attorney General works* when it comes to Harris, but I know she has other troubling history, but the fact that Biden picked her actually gives me a lot of hope. She was one of his harshest critics in the early debates, and he still picked her.
Do Biden and Harris have troubling histories? Absolutely. Do I agree with them on everything? Of course not. Will I vote for them? Of. Fucking. Course. They may not be the best for the job, but they won’t actively joke about wanting me dead or willfully ignore a pandemic.
Ok I see a lot of folks are mad about Biden/Harris being the ticket, and I get it, it’s not my first choice either. I have concerns too. But here’s the biggest thing I feel right now: I don’t want to die. I am a chronically ill queer Jewish person, and I’m terrified.
Trump’s campaign is going to try to make Kamala seem radical so the more they can do stuff like this the better.  That’s how they beat Hillary.  So far, they haven’t been able to do it to Biden.  That’s how a progressive like Tammy Baldwin wins Wisconsin.
Come on man! Come on man? Joe? Joe is that you? Joe, your names NOT Scott Thomas. It's Joe Biden. Now, go back into your basement, take your meds and go sleepy-time....and Joe, try not to say "Come on Man, people will recognize it's you....\Engir enskir, engir rasistar!!!
What do you get when you cross Joe Biden and a Crocodile?  A- A dead Pedophile.
Democrats, especially under Obama/Biden helped build this country into a dictatorship. Obama rampaged throughout the world with extrajudicial killings, extraordinary rendition and dirty wars. It’s ironic that you think Joe will obstruct the march towards dictatorship.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness - Well the Democratic party isn't the party I joined so this will not be a hard choice; do I want to defund the police? Do I like vandalism on the property? Intel moved to Texas -no
At this point, these tweets are just getting tiring. If you truly believed these things, you wouldn't have rolled over to Joe Biden.
Biden has pronounced Kamala at least 3 different ways lol, I feel for her, having a name no one can say or spell correctly.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
That's a forced choice 2 way choice. Standard, non forced, including alternatives is Biden +9 which is right in line with other polls
It’s almost like you should’ve listened when we said we wouldn’t vote for Biden. Congratulations on your racist nominee
Fun fact: If you look at the vote totals in 2010, it was actually a low turnout election for both Democrats and Republicans.  2018 saw almost 10% more of the electorate turn out.  There’s no reason 2022 needs to be like 2010.  And no one thinks Biden’s a savior.
It’s not a coincidence they announced Karine Jean-Pierre as Kamala’s COS before announcing Kamala.  I think Kamala’s fine but Karine was the signal to progressives that Biden’s people are still paying attention.
I actually kind of think this is true.  Lest we forget, Obama had to clean up some of this stuff for Biden when Biden was his VP.  Nominate the Biden, take the ride.
MoveOn will literally be in the White House if Biden wins.
I see they’ve decided to try the failed Biden strategy again.
yeah Biden sucks and so does Harris, but if we work as a nation to hold them accountable we can make sure their policies work for all the people. plus, Trump sucks even more
Biden voted for the Iraq War and got thousands killed and millions displaced. Why are those lives completely ignored? Many Iraqis are dead because of Biden.
First look at my twitter feed this morning and it's basically everything you need to know to vote in 2020...  1) Kamala Harris 2) #Walk2EndAlz (alzheimers) 3) Joe Biden   That about sums it up
A radical job-killing agenda? Take a moment for introspection. Biden/Harris would have to work pretty hard to kill more jobs (and people) than the GOP has since March 2020. #mtpol #mtsen #GOPvirus
A group seeking to place rapper Kanye West's name on the Montana's presidential ballot this fall has spent the past few days gathering signatures from Yellowstone County residents, telling them their signature could help take votes away from Joe Biden.
Nothing  said is wrong and you know it. It was all true even BEFORE Trump got elected. Some of us will suck it up and vote for Biden. Is the goal to go back to the "before" Trump though? Fuck that shit.
4) if Biden loses, don't resign half-way through your term to become a reality TV star. That never ends well.
As a sickening, dangerous, often-bleached deadly virus yourself you should better understand Biden’s attempts to protect his health.

Precisely what both Biden &amp; Harris should do.
And #MAGA2020 say Biden has dementia? Wow.
That’s actually hilarious. That’s just them crying in their beer (or wine) realizing their hopes and dreams have been dashed and crushed - they know Biden/Harris is a formidable team and are going to win in November.
Here are my real thoughts on Kamala Harris: she is a politician.  That’s a good thing and a bad thing.  It will be incumbent on progressives to push Biden and Harris to maximize policy outcomes.  But first we elect them.
Kamala attacked Biden on his record on policy. Policy is what political debate is about. Trump attacked on a personal level, his dad being involved in JFK assassination and insulting his wife. Cruz doesn't deserve any credit.
Warren is talking policy with Biden on a weekly basis and he’s already adopted a number of her policies.  This is literally the dumbest website in the history of the world.
The next step is electing Biden, getting majorities in Congress, and legislating.
Im not gonna vote for Trump nor am I going to vote for Biden. I don’t vote for racists or fascists or war mongers or neoliberals. Lefties screamed this in your faces before the primaries even started. You didn’t listen.
Biden’s vote got tens of thousands killed and displaced millions. Not to mention the torture program and all the psychotic black sites. Democrats spent the whole primaries whining about Bernie and somehow forgot about Iraq. That is a moral failing I will not support. I’m done.
Trump says if Biden wins we will have to learn to speak Chinese. Ni  hao . Already now ola and aloha. Some would consider learning another language intellectual. This country could use some culture after this orangeneck racist retard!
She can play Dr Jill Biden!
How Joe Biden kept his VP pick a secret
Kamala Harris named by Joe Biden as his VP pick #BidenHarris
Biden's mental deterioration is so fucking bad, no way he lasts a full four. I got 20 bucks on him publically calling someone an outdated slur from 30 years before he was born.
Biden legit is running a "supercop" as his vp during a time where theres mass unrest due to police violence. He doesn't want to win. We are doing a presidential election where neither candidate represents the will of the people, or want to actually be president.
Please vote for Joe Biden. Please don’t make America suffer with Trump again.
I genuinely wish Biden and Kamala were the monsters conservatives feared.
If it wasn't clear, I'll be voting for Biden and Harris.  Do I agree with them completely? Nope. Do I think they're the best hope we have to create a government that's on the right track? Yep.
Can’t believe we started with the most diverse set of candidates ever and we ended up with milktoast old establishment Biden and Harris 🙄
Fulfilling a debate promise, Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
MSNBC: Kamala Harris is Biden’s pick as a running mate! Harris is married to a lawyer, has two step children, and her name means “lotus” in Sanskrit!  Women:
I appreciate your pragmatic approach. We will hold her &amp; Biden’s feet to a hot fire.
Honestly, I was hoping Biden would pick Tammy Duckworth but I also understand not many people value her experience coal-founding the GPS Caucus as much as I do. Such is the way politics often goes for a wonk.

I was holding out hope for a classic Biden switcheroo where he announces that he’s stepping down and it’s going to be Bernie and Angela Davis.
I have a tough time believing anyone expected better from a Biden campaign lol
Biden picking Harris is Obama picking Biden.
He was waiting for the Biden Romney ticket, I guess?
Yeah wow Kamala probably shouldn't have done those things that Tulsa called her on. Not her fault that Kamala sucks or that Biden picked her.
Biden/Harris!! I love it! Thank you.
Biden mic dropping his VP pick!
Do you remember when Kamala Harris ripped Joe Biden a new one live on national TV and then later he was like, "OK, but I would like to lead this country with you" because that's the shit I'm here for.
We should have an enthusiastic conversation in the comments about how excited we are for Joe Biden to be president so Twitter will push this higher in the replies!
Biden really just responded to the divest/invest movement by choosing a cop as his running mate
Democratic nominee for president Joe Biden chooses his running mate.

One night in February we went to the local Eagles and saw an oldies band play and at the end of their set they said, "Thank you! See you all in September!" And I think that's what the Biden VP announcement is going to be like.
My first Presidential vote was for McGovern. And you are correct- EVERY TIME Dems have been close to go more Left (which still isn’t “Left,” or more progressive) it gets stopped in it’s tracks. And this year, the same, the Dems and Americans fell back on “the white dad.” Biden👍
I remain confused about all the Kasich complaining.  Kasich is endorsing Joe Biden, not the other way around.  He represents an important bloc of swing voters Democrats are chasing.  It’s actually kind of a big deal he’s speaking at the convention.

Biden’s probably going to get some Kelly coattails in Tucson.
This is exactly the point for me. It’s been very depressing seeing some leftists become laser focused on whether you should or shouldn’t vote for Biden, which is exactly what the establishment wants peoples’ energy focused on.
oh absolutely yes!! he’s a symptom of our society for sure. i do think biden needs to be elected so that we can cut this off at the knees but i think that’s step one, not the end result
The Biden VP farce feels like if you were drowning and the lifeguard came to the edge of the water and shouted, “I’m going to help you! But first...I’ve got someone coming to help me...I think you’ll be really excited about who it is...any guesses???”
It’s awkward when Joe Biden pretends to be a protector of social security. #DemExit #SocialSecurity
I’m with you, Betsy. I’m disappointed in the choice, but I’m in. I don’t feel my vote matters though, but Biden’s got it. My anti-Daines, anti-Gianforte, anti-Rosendale  votes are crucial, though. I hope people don’t get so caught up in Trump that they lose sight of that.
Even if that were true, Milano is fine with millions of Americans having no healthcare, that includes those with mental illness. Biden said he would veto #MedicareForAll. Such a threat doesn’t effect a rich person like Milano.
Wrong. We need WAAAAAAAAAY less privileged, liberals. In fact, Milano is pure toxicity. She supports a racist, war monger like Biden. Democrats have zero moral credibility.
Did Biden remember that you had a great time with your friends and your loved ones?
Biden’s gonna unveil his VP and it’s gonna be a mirror and the announcer will say, “That’s right, America, Joe wants YOU by his side this November!” and then they’ll cut to a commercial for one of those sit down bathtubs.
Irony is the Democrats still want black peoples to do what they told (vote for racist Biden or you not black)
Yea Biden go!!!!!
Yeah, I don’t like Zephyr Teachout anymore.  She’s also the one who pushed a corruption narrative against Biden in the primary that Bernie himself disavowed.  Complete Leftist hack.
Biden was a United States Senator since the ‘70s and Vice President of the United States.  He’s running against a bankruptcy-prone, former reality TV host who is one of the most corrupt, incompetent, hated presidents in history.
A white majority for Trump and a Black VP for Biden

No, the majority of Americans know Trump isn’t perfect but Hillary/ Biden are Evil. I’ll choose an egotistical businessman over Evil any day. Do you like $$$ or would you rather be in hell without $$$?
Science? There’s no science. Just lies scientists learn from other so called scientists. Hitler said make the Lie big, keep the instructions simple, keep telling the population and they’ll believe it. Liberals use this strategy daily. But if you elect Biden it’s same as Hitler

i know im not new but i think you have to do both! not voting isn’t going to help matters at all, as much as I hate biden the more immediate concern is to get trump out of office... and THEN revolution anyways
Well, one reason you go with Biden is that his consistently superior polling against Trump means he has more margin for error than anyone else.  And Republicans just handed Democrats a tricky situation, particularly since the press isn’t talking about the legality.
That would be an interesting podcast.  You should hash out where you guys think Biden could possibly find common ground with Republicans.  Keep in mind, they walked away from market-based solutions to global warming and now call it a hoax.
The GOP may have nominated Romney in 2012 but Obama’s election broke their brains.  Lest you forget, Romney promised to be a hard-liner on immigration.  All the sane Republicans either left the party or are voting for Biden.  This is not your father’s Republican Party.
At least Bernie had policy. Biden just says C’mon Man while pushing bad 90s politics.
Why is everyone sleeping on Big Gretch for VP if that’s the only person we know Biden has had an in-person meeting with?
I’m curious how Biden’s whole plan of doing absolutely nothing will play out.
Imagine trying to impugn Nina Turner on behalf of Joe Biden and thinking you are the one with any amount of decency. Liberals are dangerous racism enablers.
I LOVE my Bernie stan frens. They are extremely valuable to my community. This is absolutely not a fact. He didn't have the intersectional buy-in to beat Joe Biden, a man few people like or trust. Yes, Biden used the system to do it, but GOP/Cambridge would go so much harder.
Biden won't know, it will be the rest of the demonrats!
What I think is insensitive and potentially alienating is speculation that any voter won’t/can’t look at Biden’s overall record and draw their conclusions rather than decide in the moment based on a media driven gaffe narrative.
Lol! Trying to do damage control on Biden’s outdated and idiotic stance on marijuana legalization?
It’s hilarious that democrats nominated Joe Biden. You could not have found a worse candidate. What an absolutely worthless party.

You morons think you are opposing racism by voting for Biden? WRONG!  #VoteOutRacism
I know this has been said before, but if Democrats are concerned about Kanye West siphoning off votes from Biden, isn't that more a reflection of their candidate and platform rather than a reflection of Republican election strategy?
Occurs to me that we are already so used to Russian interference that we almost discount it but this "new" info that China and Iran favor Biden is a Trump head-fake? How will the average mouth-breathing three-toothed MAGAt react to hearing that "Eye-ran wants Biden t' win !" ??
Biden will malfunction with these responses in a debate.
It's ridiculously simple:  add Medicare for All to his platform. 87% of Dems want it &amp; 67% of all registered voters want it. Why not?!
Joe Biden is the nominee, folks.  And he won bigger than Hillary in 2016.  The Democratic electorate is pragmatized.  The Iraq War both radicalized and pragmatized me in the Aughts.  Supported the progressive in the 2004 primary and Kerry in the general.
Dodd, yes.  But I don’t think Rendell is in Biden’s inner circle.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Is he letting them?  Rendell is an idiot who Hillary also had to clean up after in 2016.  Some people are arguing that they themselves are jockeying for relevance.  Didn’t Biden make Rendell and Dodd backtrack?
I don’t like Axelrod but this a good point and one of Biden’s strengths as VP.
I find all of this deeply depressing.  I guess I just lived in a college-educated bubble that was pro-business and culturally moderate to liberal.  I really just didn’t see the roots of Trumpism in any real way growing up in Elkhart.  Some of these folks are voting for Biden.  🤷‍♂️
Biden saying stupid shit, getting corrected, and publicly talking about the mistake might actually be good for this country.  I’m a strong believer in people working through their imperfections.
I’m hopeful that suburban realignment and Biden’s strength with older voters will soften midterm challenges for Democrats if Biden is elected.  They’re more reliable voters.  Too many Democrats take for granted that you need to keep showing up to pass and protect legislation.

Don't be complacent. We have to fucking beat Donald Trump in November, and Biden is our guy! Go Joe, go!

Biden has nads?
And what reason could Biden possibly have for choosing Kamala that makes it so I shouldn’t vote for them? Trump is anti John Lewis so he is literally anti civil rights and a white supremacist. Whether she’s a token candidate or not she is a direct challenge to trump.
Obviously, Biden/Harris is the choice but it’s clear that left and leftleaning voters r not represented or r actively villified by both parties.     need to found own party and run against corporate democrats and rightwing Republicanparty
This is silly. Harris is a moderate like Biden in the classic sense that the founders designed for and radicals hate.
That’s fair. I expect Biden to be a pretty unpopular president so I bet she’ll draw a serious challenge unless she’s already president
Dude you can’t just say that fucking four years out. Biden could end up being immensely unpopular and Harris would face a challenge from the left and moderate wings in the primary. And the left will put up someone against her anyways
So basically your saying instead of Biden/Harris you'll endorse/embrace racism, misogyny, corruption, white supremacism, ignorance, TREASON, Russian election interference, isolationism, authoritarianism and everything anti-American, anti-democracy and anti-Constitution.

Joe Biden tears down himself. He’s a shit human being. I’m done with this bipartisan bs. Wouldn’t it be nice if we were arguing which presidential candidate was the best, rather than fighting over who is worse? What a novel idea!
Let’s keep the momentum even if Biden wins!
Tough call, the animosity is fierce, more than usual.  Yard signs don’t win elections, though they are a cultural signifier.  Wouldn’t do Biden, it makes no difference in Montana.  And riles folks. Bullock needs crossover R votes, it’ll help though marginally. Ask your neighbors
Tonight we're talking Biden's last stand and his unhideable brain rot, Antifa taking on grandmas in Portland and getting beaten in Colorado suburbia, and much more, LIVE at 9 ET!  YouTube:  DLive:
Yesterday Kiki and I went to Walmart just for pickles. A guy walks by us without a mask and yelling: “If you support Biden, you support child sex!” How the fuck did he managed to get into the store without mask? And why is that Walmart security did absolutely nothing?
Biden says US's 5m Covid cases 'breaks the heart' and hits out at Trump's 'lies and excuses' – live
Excited to see what role  will play (hopefully!) in the Biden admin.
Here in Bozeman, Montana, there are several Biden yard signs.  Zero Trump yard signs.  This is a very liberal town.
Biden is a much better person and it’s not even close
#VoteOutRacism Biden made more stricter laws &amp; Increasing the time they spend in time. Might effect those kids too. He also falsely pardoned a kkk member. so let also #VoteHypocritesOut, Like most Democrats, there action r messing up the county, they swore a oath 2 protect, 👇
"We rely on "truth" over facts." -Sleepy Joe Biden
This is a Joe Biden Voter.
The top counterintelligence official in the U.S. government warned Friday of ongoing interference and influence efforts by China, Russia and Iran.
I know you're not serious.  Source:   Bottom line: The less educated you are, the more you support Trump and the right.  How embarrassing for you.
If Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for not being Bush, what will Biden get for not being Trump?
Joe Biden eulogiesed senator bird a former kkk leader saying what a wonderful person and mentor he was.  Don't think trump ever did that
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God...
You’ll never win a “Trump’s less racist than Biden” argument. It’s just too easy. We’ll stick to  what’s important.  160K Americans are dead. Trumps response: “it is what it is”.  If that’s okay with either of you, seek medical attention immediately.
Lying to stoke fear won’t work.  People are not motivated by fear or incompetence or hate.  They want good policies, decency and honesty.  Trump has none of these. Biden has these and much more.   #TrumpKillsAmericans  #Biden2020
That’s a fake photo of Biden. Nice try.
Yeah... It's looking more and more like we're not going to get a debate. Sleepy  and the crew will somehow make it a "hazard" to have the debates. Trump will be made out to be the bad guy for "puting people in danger" all to protect Biden. Very sad actually. #Fairfight
Biden has said dumb shit. Those gaffes are either due to his weak cognitive ability, or he might be a little racist.  His actions speak otherwise.   One of those men suppresses the black vote. One of those men wanted the death penalty for 5 innocent black kids.  Not Biden.
Give me a break. Do you really think people want to live in a Socialist America???Because I don’t! I believe in freedom. None under Biden or who ever is going to tell him what to say.😡
Oh, I didn't realize Biden said the following:  - "kung flu" - "When Mexico sends its people... They're rapists" - "Haiti? Why do we want people from Haiti here?" - "Why do we want these people from all these shithole countries here?"  I got more, let me know.
Let's unpack:  1) "CNN propagandists" - C'mon. That's just dumb to say and you sound like a Trump puppet (who's a serial liar) 2) Biden isn't inherently racist. He may say dumb shit, and he might be a little racist, but if you're comparing him to Trump, there's no comparison.
Lol.  Biden is Catholic.  Trump is desperate. #TrumpDeathToll160K
Why does Donald Trump think Biden hates God?
I am not sabotaging anything , Biden will take office , we will continue to push back against fascism no matter who’s president!Trump answers a hundred questions per day ...  Biden can't answer ONE??  Is he really alsheimer?
Biden is Booster Gold at best
Biden is a one term president to get us back on track! Do everything you can to get trump OUT!!
This is implying Trump wins 2020?  You would think the question would be for 24 or for 28 if Biden wins.
Voted for Bob Barr in 2008, wished I hadn't after.  Was planning to vote for Jo until Biden picked Kamala.
We mandate that Biden be sent to Gitmo for treason and etc.  shut up Biden you’re me leader material OBVIOUSLY

Biden is such a liar.
The day that Rodger Goodell was given the commissioner’s job.  Bigger joke than Biden.

Biden was the best college student ever and had like 9 degrees. #NeverForget
in Biden’s America you can fuck the sand and sniff it all you want. Only if a new, fresh bunker #MAGA2020
From a Newsweek article last month, the potus is presently laying groundwork (tweets, postal policies, creating China chaos,etc) in order to accuse China of printing vast #’s of mail-in ballots if Biden wins, calling a Nat Emergency in order he stay the potus ( for life ?).
Alert Biden has never been able to mandate anything and he still cant and God willing never will.
While I wear a mask when I am inside with other people, requiring me to wear a mask "outside" when I am distanced is simply virtue signaling. Next command: You will all be Vegans! #mtpol || Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia!👎😡🤬  “ in the domain name database  shows the site was registered in the Russian Federation from 2013 ...
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Another mouthful of nothing by Mr. Biden.
Hey Stable genius the spaghetti you are throwing against the wall it’s not cooked yet. #BIDEN/HARRIS 2020...#Damn you are scared.
Biden is a status quo US capitalist Imperialist, I don't think the term "fascist" really applies to him.  Also, I didn't want Bernie.
Our country is collapsing right now thanks to you. Biden can run circles around you, plus he can navigate ramps, drink bottled water and read.
This pretty much sums it up!!   If you vote for Biden you hate America!! #Trump2020LandslideVictory 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden will not be around long enough to see it.  If he is he’ll be incoherent.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Yes, real people are dying out here. That’s why we hate your neoliberal picks. Kamala Harris has tortured people like me. Biden has always been ‘tough on crime’ in ways that hurt poor communities and refuses to save lives by allowing access to free healthcare.
And to be clear I'm not saying I accept the premise of a Biden victory being a marginally good thing, but that even if I did it would be a repugnant thing to me to compromise my beliefs to that extent. I simply will not do it. And I can't understand not having things like that.
Except biden is staunchly against medicare for all.
Progressives for Biden are easily the most infuriating people to argue with. Fuck the democratic party, let it crumble apart.
Alternatively you could stop playing their game and actually fight or even just vote for real change. I for one won't compromise my morality by voting for someone as reprehensible as biden and harris.
There are different reasons to vote for a candidate, I don't think it's so simple as to say someone's left card is revoked because they voted Biden.
Biden: you ain’t Black. *conservatives outrage* Biden: I’m selecting Kamala Harris for VP who is Black.  Conservatives: She isn’t Black. 🙄
50 year Biden “Come On, Man!”
Character is on the ballot. #BidenHarris2020 #Kamala #Biden
Joe Biden never looked at a note for 10+ minutes.
I get the feeling the same email would have been sent out no matter who Biden picked for VP. They just waited to fill in the name.
#BIDEN-HARRIS
VOTING BIDEN-HARRIS!
Weaponizing religion: Trump's attacks on Biden's faith, calling him 'against God'!👎😡🤬  Donald Trump defended questioning the faith of his main political rival, doubling down on calling former Vice President Joe Biden "against God".   Read more:
He is literally the only person to run for President named Joe Biden. Thank you to the Elias sports bureau for that fact
Obama: Hope  Biden: cmon man, this can get better if we really try, or if general conditions improve, now is the time to look at the glass as half full. You know who is full of it? Trump. Full of malarkey.  Harris: kill me please
Yes! More of this please!  Fill up my feed with good soundbites from Biden and Harris
Almost 4 years we have waited for this election. Nearly 4 years of holding on to hope that, americans will wake up and demand real change. settling for Biden and Harris is not real change. idk how much hope there is to hold on to anymore.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I hope that berreta is a revolver, otherwise according to Biden's gun control plans, it will cost you $200 a year in taxes just to keep it. If it holds more than 10 rounds, you'll also pay $300 a year for each magazine that you own. I'm sure that you'll just turn it in though
I can tell you Joe Biden hates Kamala’s guts. You will see it on stage.
You're right!!! It doesn't matter if Joe "you ain't black" Biden is a racist, at least he isn't named Trump.
Joe "you ain't black" Biden will fix all of the country's problems. The 40+ years in politics just hasn't been enough time for him to achieve it yet
I know you don't want us to see how bad it is for your guy Biden. It's easy to see through your malarkey.
But you are against the community if you support Biden and Harris. I say this as someone in the community.
You're still on that? Biden put forth civil forfeiture, legally allowing cops to steal from people. He was pro-segregation. He pushed for harsher treatment of drug users. Yes, Orange Man is indeed bad. So is Biden. I refuse to pick any evil.
Her and Joe "you ain't black" Biden are totally going to win
It's not. You can't seriously believe that, right? We're leftists. We hate Trump as well as Biden and Harris. Because neoliberal capitalism is destroying the world and they all uphold it.
Biden and his son
Lol, Right? I just listened to my boss the other day give me a whole speech on how fucking Biden is a "radical leftist" as I struggled to keep a straight face.
There's no way that Joe "you ain't black" Biden is racist.
We will take your guns so you can't shoot Biden for sniffing your child.
Biden's game in picking Harris was to prove that he isn't actually a leftist to gain centrist voters. Yet, Trump still calls Biden and Harris radical leftists. Trump is literally doing Biden's bidding for him, if I hear about their leftist healthcare plan I might just get excited
Hollowing out of our industrial capacity has hollowed out America's middle class ||Joe Biden represents failed consensus | Opinion
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign  via
This will all build to a crescendo during election week when you head to your local polling place wearing your mask, rubber gloves, goggles and the final mandate-suggestion kicks into place to vote for Joe Biden.
Kamala "you don't have the right to own a gun" Harris is just as bad for the constitution as you tried to be, and Joe "you ain't black" Biden is just as bad.
That's right!!! Joe "you ain't black" Biden will save the world
A group seeking to place rapper Kanye West's name on the Montana's presidential ballot this fall has spent the past few days gathering signatures from Yellowstone County residents, telling them their signature could help take votes away from Joe Biden.
Biden will just veto it, like he promised.
Dude, Biden already said nothing will change. Believe him.
The problem you have is that the more the voters see of Biden and Harris the more they will see 2 normal, rational, very smart and likeable people. People will quickly see through your unhinged narrative for what it is: lies, lies, and more lies.
No one is. Even Biden didn't out-debate Kamala. Let's be honest.
2020 Harris: Biden's running mate VS. 2019: Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Would be way better than Biden or Trump!
Made himself? Yeah, I'm sure the whole democratic establishment suddenly pouring everything they had into Biden right before super Tuesday had nothing to do with his loss...
This link just redirects to the main Biden site now?
I might vote for Biden/Harris, I'm not sure yet.  I live in Montana and my Presidential vote doesn't matter much anyway. The Libertarian Party candidate has decent foreign policy views, but I already donated $40 to her campaign, which probably amounts to more than a vote for her.
And Joe "you ain't black" Biden will continue the great legacy of LBJ
Deep breath everybody!!! . No candidate was going to make everyone happy. If we stick together we can win in November.  And Biden/Harris is infinitely better than Trump/Pence
#KamalaHarris  was supported by less them 5% of the Democratic Party for President and #Biden picks her as his VP. That kind of decision making does not instill a lot of confidence or speak very highly of his cognitive abilities.
I think that Joe "can I smell your daughter" Biden made the right decision with Kamala "you don't have the right to own a gun" Harris.
Here's the thing. The way American government is set up, we don't really have the option to vote for good or bad. We have the option to vote for sucks and sucks less. Biden/Harris is the "sucks less" option we have. Stop being petulant children and let's get this thing won.
On Nov. 3, America gets Her house back that trump has held hostage ... Team Biden/Harris
Kamala is the son Joe Biden always wanted Hunter to be.
Just heard cnn say Kamala is family to Joe, and family is important to the Biden’s.”  Really...They’re going with that talking point, but if fam is important to #HidenBiden then, #WheresHunter ?
Being anti-Biden and pro-trump are totally different things. It's ok to think Trump is an asshat, but also believe that voting for Biden is a very bad idea.
are we sure Biden isn't literally deaf at this point
The debates are so overhyped. A debate hasn’t fundamentally changed the race since 76 and whose mind will it really change. Biden also proved that he can hold his own and trump really is not a good debater
It took two drafts to get Biden to call Harris a servant instead of "the help"
Great strategy. People like you are the biggest threat to Biden winning. Push away the leftists and you lose, that's what happened in 2016 and it will happen again and again until you learn.
Ya know, I wad never going to vote Biden. It was simply never going to happen, but this? This makes me so much more sure in that stance.
Look mate I'm voting Biden, but I'm not going to make things up. Liberals are not progressives. If you are progressive, you are not liberal.
I wanna see  in Biden’s cabinet 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hah, Biden picked the cop, I shouldn't be surprised he's no different to the back the blue shitheads.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Great Pick!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!! #Biden2020  #VPPick  #BidenVP
BIDEN to announce today!!!
In 2008 Obama used a Greeco-Roman motif to impose gravitas. In 2020 Biden will use one because it reminds him of his childhood.  Because he is old
Ugh. If 42 percent of MY supporters couldn't commit to voting for Biden over Trump, it might cause me to choose humility and introspection.
"Old doddering men" is clearly the theme of this election.
Biden’s VP pic is critical to advance to the presidency in 2024 or 2028 - I have no concern with Biden’s age.
How come the exes of male politicians don't write op eds on what the candidate should or should not do.  Just yuck.   Kamala Harris’ ex suggests she ‘politely decline’ if asked to be Biden’s VP
Three of Wyoming’s top elected officials are calling for presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump to hold a debate in Wyoming.
Joe Biden better stay away from Mexico
Biden is going to rip Trump apart at the debate. I just can't wait!!
I say that all the time. But it's for stupid people, not for what Biden says when they call him on the carpet.
Here's the deal...we have binary elections in this country no matter how many candidates are in the mix. You don't like Biden, fine. Whoever else you vote for is a vote for Trump. You can go pout in a corner about it, but that's the way it is.
I will vote Biden even if he picks my dog, Buck for VP.
So Stelter is extremely offended by the “negative partisanship” from the right that Biden is “falling apart” but the left including elected officials calling Trump and his supporters Nazis for 4 years? I don’t remember Seltzer’s show calling out that negative partisanship.
That'd be great, but unfortunately her politics are closer to that of Bernie Sanders so even if she was American, she wouldn't have a chance at getting Biden's pick.
Biden has dementia and is a pedophile. Honestly can’t believe that’s who the Dems picked. I mean if it were Tulsi or Kamala I’d be worried but this will be straight entertainment
Trumps a stable genius. Biden is a kid sniffer.
I absolutely would adore a Trump Biden debate. It would be even more of a schlonging than he gave HRC. ‘Because you’d be in jail’ comment might make a comeback.
Really and in the same week that Biden said black people aren’t diverse? What’s funnier is I bet you didn’t even know Biden said that which proves the fragile bubble your thoughts circle in.
You are a lost soul if you think Biden would even stand against Trump in a debate. Why do the Dems want to cancel the debates then? Biden can’t even remember what state he is in.
1. Who cares so he can ride a bike if this is actually Biden, why the mask? 2. This was tweeted by one the the Krass brothers who have been kicked off of Twitter permanently. 3. Why would a wife not identify her actual husband?
Sealing in gun confiscation  with biden
If elected, will Joe Biden still be unable to travel? How can he do his job?
Well she's not that dumb, but she is planning on being VP if Biden wins. Whoever is picked as Biden's running mate is deep states pick for POTUS.
Based off Biden’s Hispanic comments lately, I would not be surprised if he picks someone like Veronica escobar to try and flip Texas
He would if he knew for sure it would be a net drain on Biden, but that's not assured with you.
Joe Biden will be really excited to find out who he selected.
I think that sentiment was more popular in 2016, a lot of anti-Trump people including myself did not think he had a serious shot at the Presidency. Whereas there was more liberal and left wing support for third parties then, now it's more "Never Trump" Republican support of Biden
The issue would be getting voters at large to think that.  Agree Biden is bad, but the majority of Democratic primary voters apparently thought otherwise.
ALERT ALERT POSTAL UNIONS: DON'T SCREW YOURSELVES!!! VOTE BIDEN!!
The late night comedians should give up their career’s because the Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence comedy show is going to be epic.
Who is Joe Biden going to pick for his VP?  The crazy one or the crazier one?
Oh an Biden hates the Bible and hates god. But Trump carries a bible wherever he goes. But when asked what his favorite passage was, he could only answer with” oh that’s very personal to me, so I can’t talk about it”. What a total ASSBAG!!!
Nope not you at all. See I thought it was just me lol. He’s getting redder and redder each time he speaks. Cuz he knows all his bullshit about Biden ISNT working. “Biden doesn’t believe in the Bible , Biden hates God”. Does he really think we believe this shit.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
From your mouth to G-d’sears... #DumpTrump2020 History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
I think voters would prefer to elect the first female (whatever color) ourselves not Biden's hand me downs.  And that's sister to you.
Biden is buring himself
Stop it! We all know Biden isn’t writing these posts. He’s too far gone.
Super phucked up for the guy who had ☮️ protesters gassed to get a pic holding a Bible upside down in front of a ⛪️ he’ll never attend to say Joe Biden has no religion. And I’m sorry, but when he said Biden will “hurt god” he’s thinking of himself, he’s “god” in this scenario.
Dems will keep Biden in the basement until the mail in ballots start coming in and then when they decide it is a good time, they will let Jim Crow Joe out to have 1 debate. But it will be somewhat rehearsed or online and not in person.
Biden is anti God apparently
Biden's team disagrees, or else they wouldn't have had a staffer write an apology for him.
My fav ZERLINA MAXWELL, BOOK: "END OF WHITE POLITUCS"---- A very great read, puts all in perspective!!! Biden needs to read!!!
I have not seen a Joe Biden yard sign but a did see a yard sign in Hurricane Utah that said “Anybody but Trump!”
Keep talking about Biden. First was Hillary’s health (non-issue), now Biden. I know you don’t want responsibility, but your brain dead listeners think you are smart and value your opinion. Be better.
Voting for Joe Biden means you have no core beliefs
Also a debate hasn’t really shifter the state of a race since ‘76 w ford’s sphere of influence comment. There have been bad performances but nothing that fundamentally changed the race. Biden did ok against Bernie and I would consider stinky Bernie a better debater than trump.
It is true to some degree. Its the fact that Biden said it! My Lord, if President Trump had said that I shuttered to think what would happen. #Blexit #walkaway #Trump2020
Does it mean Never Trump is a vote for Biden?
trump has cognitively checked out. Does he ever do his homework? Biden is a very devout Catholic and trump has no religion.
Yep, Joe "you ain't black" Biden is planning to take people's firearms
As he simultaneously claims Biden is demented and ineffective. But with the power to destroy God. Impressive.
This is from Biden's own Twitter, so tell us again how "nobody is taking away any guns"Wall Street Week Ahead: Biden victory? Disputed election? Wall Street prices in November outcomes
"Print a bunch of Biden bucks"  And then shortly afterwards the dollar will be worth nothing.
Biden what a loser you are. If that was true then why have the numbers gone through the roof on infections since we’ve all had to start wearing masks? Or is that out of your pay grade to answer that question. Personal hygiene and wash your hands that’s it.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
👿👿 Apparently telling lies is routine in politics!! The anti Trumpers throw everything hoping some of it will stick to the walls. Notice you  never  Hear any charge of racism by the MSM toward Biden  even though he has a long history of making racist remarks.
👿👿NO SURPRIZE HERE, BIDEN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF MAKING BAD CHOICES!
Joe Biden really said “they gonna put y’all back in chains”
A vote for Kanye is a vote for Kanye stop with BS. I will never understand niggas dying on a hill for Joe Biden
Coming to a city near you....Vote Biden Harris
That’s your opinion Biden ain’t a hill I’m dying on ever and he has given plenty of reasons for other people of color to feel the same way
Yes and then Trump shred Biden
Montana GOP and Sen. Daines weigh in on Biden's choice of Harris as VP candidate:
You are going down I am a white woman whos not afraid and will defend my self and rights to kick you out of the White house Biden is a better person than you will and have ever been your a joke!! your no president
Pretty rich that he’s calling her nasty while simultaneously calling Warren Pocahontas and Biden Sleepy Joe 🤨
Bubba,  your bravery has defined how I will pursue my Presidency after Biden goes missing in the woods.
Joe Biden for president
Yeah, I don't know if she was up there among my favorites in the primary (I was hoping for that Warren/Castro ticket), but I certainly liked her a lot better than Biden himself, so I'm looking forward to her kicking ass during all this. Fingers crossed and knock wood, etc.
Biden been hiding ?
Why do tRump supporters continue to support the myth that “Joe Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time”? Oh,I know!✋🏻it’s because their M.O. is to project their “God’s” faults onto others. So you can be sure if they’re pointing a finger at Biden, 3 are pointing back  them.
What a racist statement.  Blacks have done a lot for Biden, but, Biden hasn’t done anything for the blacks in 40 years. Maxine Waters: Biden ‘can’t go home without a Black woman being VP’
twitter elected trump in 2016, twitter will elect biden in 2020, get over it
