Trump keeps talking about rigged elections? Does this mean that every Republican who is elected, and I hope it's not many, were elected because the voting was rigged? Does that mean all winning Republicans didn't actually win as some that was done was illegal? I'm just not sure.

What happens if, or when, Trump and Barr don't agree with the Election? Trump brings his Stormtroopers to the White House, and elsewhere, with Barr sanctioning it's legality.  Is Biden willing to call in the military to take back our country? I know people don't believe this!
Sorry, but there are an awful lot of Republicans who think Barr is doing a great job just like Trump, McConnell, Jordan, Munchkin, etc. Their logic escapes me. I have never been that blind!
Trump is evil. However, people need to grasp the fact he is not alone. He has co-conspirators in everything he does. The Congress and the Cabinet are as guilty, if not more so, than he is. As long as they are in office, nothing but the Orange figurehead will change.

Why woukd you risk your life on something that doesn't work? DO you trust Trump, a pathological liar? Or a "Dr" who believes in demon sperm &amp; alien DNA?
But putting that all aside, let‚Äôs say Trump tries to just go full on dictatorship and throw it all out the window. He‚Äôd have to rely on hundreds of thousands of civil servants betraying their oaths to keep him in power. Which again, highly unlikely.
Biden:Mark my words I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow,come up with some rationale why it can‚Äôt be held,the only way Trump thinks he can possibly win  You:Its the incoherent,conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality

This video is so amazing. The problem is Trump supporters are too stupid to grasp the satire.
You absolutely failed us.. you did absolutely nothing for black folks.. It was a lot of killings on your watch and you could've set the precedent by actually punishing cops.. You just as bad as Biden and Trump.. And to think I actually voted for you
There are witness statements saying that the call memo released was accurate and provided a full recounting of the conversation. And nothing about it was incriminating. Trump didn't ask for something to smear Biden with and he didn't condition aid on anything.
There are choices. Why do you think the Gospel is full of those like King (and almost Lewis) who died?  As Pope Francis says, being political means being a human. Donald Trump is contrary to everything that is of Jesus. He does not love the poor, the oppressed. Choices matter.
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on.
But after all this, Trump‚Äôs half baked distraction of a tweet on election postponement is what drove this Federalist guy to jump ship? What‚Äôs really going on?

And while citizens have varying levels of critical thought, the conservative pundits can and will use this as leverage against Biden and co if they can make it look like they‚Äôre winning him votes. The director of the ‚ÄúRepublicans Against Trump‚Äù PAC admitted to this on interview.

1989: Trump took out a full-page ad, arguing for the death penalty for a group of black men (The 'Central Park Five'), effectively putting a bounty on their heads, and plaguing them with a lifetime of death threats. He was sued by the Justice Department for discrimination.
1973: The Nixon administration sued Trump for refusing to rent to black people.  1980s: Trump's casinos were accused of hiding the black staff when Trump visited.

2017 (1): Trump asked a reporter to set up a meeting with the black caucus simply because she was black.  2017 (2): "...some very fine people on both sides" said Trump of a violent Nazi rally.

2016 (1): Trump called for a Mexican judge to recuse himself based on nothing other than his race. Paul Ryan said this was ‚Äúthe textbook definition of a racist comment.‚Äù  2016 (2): Trump regularly retweeted material from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his campaign.
015 (1): Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" who are "bringing crime and drugs" to the U.S.  2015 (2): Trump called for "a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S."
2010: Trump argued in favor of segregating Muslims in Lower Manhattan.  2011: Birtherism. Trump alleged that Obama was Kenyan based on nothing but skin color. He never apologized nor renounced that claim.
2000: Trump ran a series of attack ads against Native American casinos alleging (with no proof) that they were guilty of crimes.  2004: Trump fired a black contestant from 'The Apprentice' for being over-educated.
1992: Trump's casino was fined $200,000 for transferring black dealers off certain tables to appease racist patrons.  1993: Trump said Native American casinos shouldn‚Äôt be allowed because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt look like Indians to me.‚Äù

Daily Reminder: Trump called the Corona virus a Democrat hoax that would miraculously disappear.
We also had a full lockdown that was a total failure. Many EU countries and now China has a second wave. And spare me the Trump/bleach narrative. He said no such thing. He recommended nothing and asked about disinfectant treatment, aka UV light blood irradiation therapy.

Mail in voting is already threatening the legitimacy of the election. Trump might be pointing this out clumsily and even dangerously, but it is worth pointing out all the same.

No, it isn't the catalyst, or we would be seeing far more excess deaths this year compared to previous years. It may be catalyst for already unhealthy people, but not most people. And Trump wasn't making a declaration, he was giving an optimistic outlook. No virus can go to zero.

That's fair, I guess. But there are airplanes that let people jump out of them with parachutes. I choose not to fly on one and jump out. If I did, and died, it's not necessarily the pilot's fault. I know the risk. I despise Trump but people aren't moths drawn to a flame.
Boy, Herman Cain sure is ALL-IN with this Corona Hoax stuff, huh.   On the other hand, at least Trump can finally attend a black man‚Äôs funeral now.
Herman Cain dies after COVID-19 battle. Cain was a Trump surrogate at his recent rally in Tulsa.
But he said COVID-19 was a Hoax and to not Use Mask and He was a great Friend of Trump at Trump's Tulsa Rally?????????

I just don‚Äôt think it does anything and I don‚Äôt think it moves any votes and I think Trump would rather have that conversation about mail-in-votes than the one about him tanking the economy the same week that UI expires for millions of people.
My only question is does Trump's dick taste like cheese or oranges? Asking for a friend.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
What is this then? Trump doesn't just say things for fun.
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
Trump's idiocy will take over headlines today (just like most days) but let's all take a pause and read what Rep. John Lewis left for us during his final days.
if trump is responsible for all usa covid19 deaths then by that logic that means ibama is responsible for the 200,000+ h1n1 deaths including all the kids that died
This fool is not in office.  On April 14, 2020, Jones became the first state elected Democratic official in Georgia to endorse President Donald Trump's re-election bid. Due to backlash from his endorsement of Trump, he announced his resignation on April 22, 2020.

So, Trump wants to open schools (and everything else) immediately, but delay elections until people can "securely and safely vote." As usual, he is predictable and his motives are transparent, but I really don't understand why 30% of Americans will stand by him no matter what.
But the fact that he‚Äôs willing to consider it should be incredibly alarming and a sign for everyone to be vigilant against all the other ways Donald Trump will try to cheat in this election.
Trump is füí©cking insane
You probably thought Obama was a great president. Well, he was in power during the WORST economy since the depression. Trump has overseen the greatest economic recovery in our history. Our economy will recover stronger than ever if he is re-elected. IF Biden wins, it‚Äôs the dumps!
President Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
I‚Äôd rather Biden spend today talking to families about the economy failing. That‚Äôs the story today that will actually move votes‚Äînot Trump‚Äôs tantrum.
Hey  , Just speak the truth: trump was wrong to amplify this doctor‚Äôs opinions.  Then there‚Äôs no struggle at all.  Easy.

I was never a fan of sitcoms so I got to skip that horror, but I remember the press around it  at least Trump isn't yelling TIGERBLOOD while high on coke at press conferences.  though that would make them far more amusing

Trump keeping Birx and Fauci around is one of the only things he's done that might have damaged him with his base. This man was known for telling people "You're Fired" &amp; had no problem doing it even in his own presidential administration until coronavirus appeared, but not them?

The U.S. government dropped its effort to silence Pres. Trump‚Äôs former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying it will no longer demand that Michael Cohen not speak with the media in the weeks before his book is released.
Wonder what this man is man is up to. Trust Trump to always upstage someone.  Just petty.
Honestly, every day since November 2016 I wake up in disbelief that Trump is literally the president. Listening to Obama at John Lewis‚Äôs funeral today just feels like going back in time. It‚Äôs so awful that it‚Äôs now, and he‚Äôs addressing everything that has come undone.
GWB has more bodies on him that Trump. He‚Äôs a legit war criminal.
I want the psychological damage that being called "Impostor President Trump" or "False President Trump" in documents and when addressing him to haunt him to an early grave.  This is my personal curse on him
she really was and she absolutely warned us. But our country and elections are controlled by petty men who are scared of strong women, so here we are.  Trump has killed far more than they say she did.
A world where George W. Bush went to jail for war crimes, rather than eulogizing a civil rights leader and being praised for being unlike Trump, would have been spared a Trump presidency. Bush is responsible for way more deaths than Trump. Not even close.
and they don't yell every thing they say either. And we all know Trump would have made anything he said not about Lewis. but somehow twist it to be self aggrandizing.
Don't you get it Mikel? Democrats are lying about rut virus and plan on cheating to get Trump out of office. Remember Trump is right, you are wrong.
This could be the nail in the coffin for Trump. One of your political supporters dies because he attended his rally. This is wild.

No, it shouldn't have been, particularly since he had no real business in the fist place.  But, as we've seen, they sorta just threw it at everyone but those who really needed it and if fucker bought a Lamborghini, he fit that bill as much as Trump scum of a son in law's family

and planned, I think, this power grab and outright greed, long before Trump got in to office. He's not a pawn, he's in it as deep as the rest of them,  but they put him in place knowing he would do exactly as he's done
is there something like this or a list with examples of the politicians that have made exorbitant profit off the Covid crisis?  It's very obvious the GOP and Trump have partly let it go this long for that very reason.
I give up trying to explain to people who choose to be willfully stupid about HCQ why they're being idiots.  You have stressed me to the point that I no longer care   Have fun with your mass suicide attempt in the Cult of Trump  Just stop trying to take the rest of us with you

this is basically my canned answer but hear me out: even Walter Mondale still managed to get 35% of the vote  If the guy who only won one state can only manage 35% of the vote, Trump can manage 35% of the vote, because there are enough people in this country who lack perspective.

I realize that it started in China, what I was saying that we did not have a complete lockdown of travelers coming from China or EU! Therefore the virus spread worldwide. Trump‚Äôs failure was that he didn‚Äôt have a national response, speaking with one voice not 50 state voices!
The virus that has infected the east coast and southern states came from EUROPE after it traveled there, no shut downs on European travelers or Americans coming from China, Japan or South Korea! So u keep singing the Trump talking points! They have no validity!

Trump and Melania are not sending Barron back to face to face classes, nor is Ivanka sending her children back! So why should American moms send their children back before this virus is under control??? Trump does not give a shit about others children!
I would trust Dr. Fauci over trump any day ! Trump has compromised the CDC! The return to school requirements published by CDC after Trumps Administration wrote them are useless! Trump does not care about the children or if they take Covid home to their family!!!...
Not sure how Trump recovers himself on COVID w/o a mask mandate. A drug or vaccine isn‚Äôt coming that fast, even on accelerated timetables. The reason I bring up a mask mandate is, well, the 70%+ of the country that says we should have one.

Great.  I was in Dallas two weeks ago and saw 2 Biden yard signs in my mother‚Äôs neighborhood.  I saw 2 Trump signs, as well, but Dallas County has become blue since I left in 1994.  Need to turn it red this fall.   I also saw Hillary signs in the ultra wealthy Park Cities in 1996
Why doesn‚Äôt Trump get rid of Fauci?   Sure the media would howl like a pack of hyeanas but they have been doing that for 4 years anyway.  Maybe he wants the people to see the fraudster for who he is.  That‚Äôs all that makes sense to me given Fauci still has public support.
Wow.  God bless you, Regis.  May you Rest In Peace.   Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign:
Some of y'all haven't realized that the Lincoln Project is the GOP's attempt to avoid consequences for electing trump, dismantling healthcare, corporate welfare, blatant racism, stealing Supreme Court seats, and appointing 400+ federal judges and it shows.

The corruption in our government is sickening.  It‚Äôs all about the fact that Hydroxychloroquine is off patent and doesn‚Äôt make anyone money.  Not to mention the fact that Trump supports it.
No.  He is one of two.  President Trump is the other.
They don‚Äôt care.  They are all in on defeating Trump.
I‚Äôm sure John Lewis wouldn‚Äôt want Trump to pay his respects anyway. Fuck him.
Well considering that the Trump Admin China policy is a failure, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs right. It would be Trumps greatest legacy.
Better than Trump
Twitter has asked the president's son to delete a tweet with a video that runs afoul of the company's policies on COVID-19 misinformation.
President Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night.

President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.
I‚Äôm sure Trump cares what the UN has to say. This is a US domestic issue.
In case you all don't know, it's always been this way. It's not Trump's fault. We've allowed it for so long, that this is what it's come to. Don't let her Public Relations sway you into thinking this in our President's fault.
We also won‚Äôt have the 3rd party candidates pulling the votes from Trump they did in 2016.   Gary Johnson received 4 million votes or 3% of the total.   Most of that vote came from Trump.

President Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the border was a major feature of his campaign and he has since attempted to have congress pay US$18 billion for its cost in the short term
Many citizens including Democrats and members of the Republican Party who do not support president Trump argue the necessity of border escalation
Fucking nonsense. Liberals tend to be champions of social safety nets, stimulus to citizens, healthcare, etc. Politics are ALWAYS about power (even for Republicans), but Liberals seek it to bring up the standard of living for EVERYONE. Trump &amp; his circus are definitely a problem.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

And it isn‚Äôt cancel culture. A country taking steps to evolve and change isn‚Äôt cancel culture. Cancel culture is millions of inbred fucks demanding a football player loose his career because he kneels during the national anthem. Mr. Trump should learn the difference.
Well it was voted on and passed by the house and senate, with a truly impressive veto-proof majority. So this tweet is meaningless perfunctory for his mindless worshipers to have something over which to sing his praises. He‚Äôs a literal fucking idiot lol.

Both were bad.  We are still in Iraq and Roberts is still on the Supreme Court.   Need Trump to be reelected so we can replace a couple of more justices.  Granted Thomas and Alito may retire but there is no way Ginsburg lasts 4 more years.  Trump could get 3 more picks.
Not interested in your plan to make this a socialist country and shred the Bill of Rights.  I‚Äôm voting for President Trump.
So I guess Trump sending forces finally got you to acknowledge you have a problem?   You could have insisted on peaceful protests a month ago.  Why didn‚Äôt you?
I hope in 5 years when Trump is out of office that we finally learn who is on the Q team.  It will likely remain a secret but I know we all want to know who it is.
I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall but I instantly get mad anytime I‚Äôm behind a Trump supporter. Like just out and let‚Äôs fight

President Trump has been attacked from day one and he is very defensive because of the way he's been treated. There are some things I would he wouldn't say but I fully understand that animosity over this long-time of contrariness
Our government would run much better with some sincerity. It just can't be possible that everything Trump does is wrong. What's on my mind the Democrats look ridiculous. Unfortunately the media seems to play along.
One of the main problems with the Democrats and the opposition use that they oppose everything can have no credibility in their arguments. They take some really silly positions just because it's contrary to what Trump says.

I think there is this fear of being put in the history books as an enabler for Trump's fascism if Biden loses. He has seen the news for the last four years that has blamed him, and if it happens again, whether deserved or not, he's internalized it.

The attack by the Obama administration on the Trump campaign and then the Trump transition team is one of the biggest and most dangerous scandals in our history. And it is definitely the most covered-up scandal as the media are just the propaganda arm of the Democratic party.

I sincerely hope that after Rep. Lewis is laid to rest that  comes out with an unequivocal and scorching retort to Trump floating the delay of the November election. Trump must go!
He can‚Äôt do this and it should only be talked about or reported on in this way . Congress sets the date of elections and Trump‚Äôs term end Jan. 20, 2021. Period! He must go!

Trump administration took action yesterday to follow-up on his Executive Order from May. Good step in the right direction, IMO.
Another violation of the first amendment! Loved seeing that Trump administration is questioning whether Rule 230 of the CDA still applies to these platforms. Keep fighting and spreading truth.
The extremely obvious difference between Biden and Trump's mental acuity is impossible to deny. Keep in mind that due to Donald Trump's brother dying from alcoholism he vowed to never drink or smoke. Looks to me like clean living pays off later in life.
Just saw this inquiry sent to the FCC about Rule 230 of CDA.
When voting straight party ticket on November 3, the ballot should have three choices: Democrat, Republican, trumplican. trump knew which party he could take over. Which party he would be able to play on their weaknesses.

Narrative changing from COVID-19 to violent crime just like Trump wanted. Stop playing into his hands. People lighting shit on fire don‚Äôt give a damn about BLM . Get rid of their asses!
writes well with absurd premises to create his false narrative. No, Trump didn't aggressively invade these cities experiencing rioting and death. This is not an attempt to impose martial law. Dem mayors and police officials are allowing, even encouraging violence.
Same here in the U.S. Dem governors keeping lock downs in place to hurt Donald Trump's re-election chances. Meanwhile, we have a ventriloquist's dummy of a candidate in #DementiaJoe. Emergency is over. Time to reach herd immunity to get back to work and school!
Are y‚Äôall going to answer the lies of Trump about Joe or simply keep going after Trump?
so you‚Äôre not going to focus on the fact that the increase in crime in under Trump or that it‚Äôs a lie that Jor Biden is for defunding the police? Seriously ? Thought you were a ‚Äújournalist!‚Äù

Still awaiting further details on the outspoken Black Trump supporter in Milwaukee that was also killed. Too bad it's so hard to buy more ammunition these days...

Donald J. Trump:  It's too dangerous for a one time convention, but by all means send YOUR family to a "convention" that meets eight hours a day five days a week.
I believe Trump and his team chose Chicago to get footage of his GI Joe toys beating black people and Albuquerque to get footage of them beating brown people.  This wasn‚Äôt implicit. They must have said it out loud to each other.
Thanks to all for the concerned texts and DMs 45 sending his goons to ABQ. I‚Äôve heard from folks back home. Yes, they‚Äôre worried. Yes, they‚Äôre mad. Yes, they know they‚Äôve been nominated to be props in Trump‚Äôs campaign ads.

Correct. Biden represents Sanders/AOC's socialist government. This is an absurd argument to choose Joe. Trump is the only choice to preserve our constitutional republic and restore our economy from the COVID manipulation by Dems. #DementiaBiden's VP "pick" will make this clearer.
Biden only wants to continue what Obama signed into action. Ben Carson has delayed implementing the 2015 changes.

Mika doesn't even ask a follow-up question about "fumigation" or Trump not leaving after the election. That not leaving thing was made up by the Clinton Cabal and  is dragging that ragged concept out again. Sadly we have no term limits when mental capacity declines.

You can see where Trump‚Äôs world is going #TrumpFailsAmerica
I could give you thousands of examples of media/tech manipulating, obfuscating &amp; flat out lying. Media drives public perception on issues...incredible power abused daily. Trump has two branches of oversight, pretending he is the end all be all couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.
Trump being a petty narcissist doesn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs not ideal, but I can get behind his policies, way more so than I could the dems. Also, The media is entrenched in every part of our daily lives. Believing otherwise is a disservice to yourself  and the power of their reach.
Trump is flawed, this is for sure and says/does plenty I disagree with. However, rewarding MSM for their outright lies &amp; manipulations can not be tolerated. I‚Äôm as middle of the road as they come, but to see the way the MSM has abused their power has only made me back Trump more.
You think Biden has the balls to actually debate Trump....that‚Äôs cute.
And Trump supporters are too stupid to understand this or are the privileged who encourage it
We know. Her interest in in stacking up the bodies of dead children from gun violence, so the puny tyrant can stand on the top and screech about evil Trump.   It‚Äôs amazing how many unqualified broads run cities and support street violence aimed at innocent constituents.

I was motivated and excited to support you in your future campaigns.  Your recent support of Trump has erased that excitement.  I truly dont understand how you can support him, knowing all that you know about him.
Two sides of the same coin. Trump should lift Reagan's welfare Cadillac speech or go have a rally in Philadelphia, Mississippi the way Reagan did.
I think when it comes down to it even the moderates from the GOP will get dragged into the Trump vortex. It may a number of years before rebuilding gains any steam
You are pandering.  What we really want from you Nikki, is leadership. You had a great voice. Although now that it‚Äôs much smaller, it still can be used for good. Start trumping American ideals, not Trump.
Trump insists on a payroll tax cut which would cut one of the main revenues for Social Security and Medicare. He only cares about the corporations who pay 1/2 of this tax for their employees.He doesn't care about the working people or their future! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

18th century technology defeats Trump. Perfect.
It was eye opening for me the night trump selected his first S.C. justice. They literally had 4 signs made up with each prospective nominees name and how they were basically the devil incarnate. Even current day, they asked protestor why he was there and he didn‚Äôt know. Insanity
But was included in a written brief of a lot of different raw intelligence, more of a ‚Äúhey, this is stuff we‚Äôre looking into‚Äù to verify it‚Äôs authenticity. Trump has plenty of flaws, making up scandals does more to damage MSM credibility than Trump‚Äôs. Happens weekly these days.
Debunked in the sense that trump was briefed and did nothing. First, they haven‚Äôt been able to confirm. Senior officer in Middle East said ‚Äúthey saw chatter, nothing actionable yet, but told them to keep digging for confirmation‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt even verbally briefed to trump
The thing that is really sad here, is that she had a stellar chance and a fabulous career. She did everything right and then she did everything wrong. It is really a very sad story. She can thank Trump. But at the end of the day, she is totally responsible for her actions.
Nikki, I don‚Äôt think you can pull this back. Ever. But if you don‚Äôt try now, you will never have a chance. Trump is going down. Biden is going to win. And you are going to be history. And every one is going to remember your unconscionable fealty. Not very smart.
Trump sucks.
People even bringing Trump into sports and situations he has nothing to do with.
NO: Dems ARE destroying our economy in an effort to both make Trump go away and get total $$ and Power over the subjects
Joe---like all politicians, you find fault with everything Trump does.  But, like all politicians, you never say what you would do right now and moving forward to fix what you perceive to be wrong.  So, quit complaining unless you are prepared to do something about it.
As the media focuses on Trump's silly comments on his cognitive test, what is happening at USPS is not getting enough attention. And it's really important for small businesses, seniors, and voters.

Donald Trump isn't a doctor or medical expert. He landed 2 people in the hospital for touting that Hydroxychloroquine cures the virus. He doesn't know shit.
When asked if he spoke to Trump regarding upcoming election and sending "troops" Barr refused to discuss his conversations with the president but then Barr said he would decide which cities. Unless I missed something doesn't this mean he did discuss with Trump?

BS but you're right it's not a game.  The little basement dwelling Pantifa's gonna get their (_]_)'s kicked.  No running home to mommy. At least you've got that right. Oh, and kicking the CCP out of the US ... outstanding move Pres. Trump! Woo hoo!
It‚Äôs safe to go to grocery stores, liquor stores, etc... why in the world wouldn‚Äôt it be safe to vote???  Ridiculous and a perfect oppprtubity for the left to co tongue corruption. Step up Trump!
So trump gets to undermine the integrity of the election with irresponsible threats without any repercussions. Got it
So the nation's economy fell by a record 32.9% and unemployment claims were up again, topping the 1 million mark for the 19th straight week. Oh wait ... what did Trump just tweet?
Sanford ratchets up his criticism of President Trump's suggestion that the November election be delayed. Sanford, a former SC governor, a former congressman and a former 2020 GOP presidential candidate, has now tweeted about this issue twice this am. &gt;&gt;&gt; #scpol
Why woukd you risk your life on something that doesn't work? DO you trust Trump, a pathological liar? Or a "Dr" who believes in demon sperm &amp; alien DNA?
But putting that all aside, let‚Äôs say Trump tries to just go full on dictatorship and throw it all out the window. He‚Äôd have to rely on hundreds of thousands of civil servants betraying their oaths to keep him in power. Which again, highly unlikely.
Biden:Mark my words I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow,come up with some rationale why it can‚Äôt be held,the only way Trump thinks he can possibly win  You:Its the incoherent,conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality

And he would still be alive if he had not attended the Tulsa Trump rally...This is a terrible shame.  Cain was a good soul...A patriot.

Im not celebrating Herman Cain passing away from the Coronavirus, BUT that guy made his bed and he died in it. All because he wanted to follow up Trump and prove a stupid ass point. smh
Cain attended the Tulsa Trump rally where he most likely contracted corona. Wonder if Trump will even bother to acknowledge he knew him? :Herman Cain, 2012 GOP Presidential Candidate And Businessman, Dies At Age 74
Many asking why Trump‚Äôs face is so orange. Let‚Äôs answer a question with a question: What color is the sky in the calm before the storm? Exactly. ORANGE. A STORM IS COMING. Will we evacuate like sheep? Or stay and die? I‚Äôve said too little. Follow the money. #HurricaneSeason
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so  üò≥
Trump can go to hell üôÑ We aint delaying shit! Get yo ass on
Looks like a bunch of idiots celebrating the fact that trump is single handedly responsible for hermain cains death.
Is trump capable of that level of self-awareness?
A Trump supporter talking about other people‚Äôs souls.  Now that‚Äôs funny...
Let me the first to say.  Herman Cain died because Trump insisted on having a rally in Oklahoma.  Trump killed Herman Cain.
You spelled trump virus wrong. #TrumpIsARacist

NIKKI.....Nikki.....Nikki  Gurl you KNOW you're LYING by calling Trump "selfless". There's NOTHING selfless about Trump. He's the most SELFISH person in history. You must really really want a Trump appointment something fierce. Nikki Haley is a prime example of a kissass sellout!
Ah fuhrer Trump giving the people a reminder of why politicians never speak out against him, because he buries y'all who are scared of him.
Wow, your data must show a  landslide victory.    Like a trump casino, you're a complete failure. #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Trump now has 2 options on the table: Martial law and/or delaying the election. Surely the American people are not this gullible.
If Trump tries to distrupt the election, isn‚Äôt that an impeachable offense as well?
Jon Binet Ramsey family was into the Pedophilia as rest of them ...therefore using own daughter to entertain friends...and Natalie Holloway is going to be young woman kidnapped to be sex slave that was rescued that Trump referenced...so two families sacrificed daughters to it
Like Trump attacked people?
I just want to make sure: you're wishing death on people you don't know because we think it's uncouth you throw childish accusations at a professional who provides information about exploited people. Is that the gist of it?
Trump installed a new head of the post office who is intentionally slowing down mail delivery under the auspices of "cost savings." So maybe he could do the opposite, unless he's intentionally sabotaging mail in voting....
So a term ends on Jan 20, and with no result, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. Wouldn't it be the disfunction that our system has become to have Biden as POTUS and Trump as VPOTUS? I mean, 2021 might tell 2020 to hold its beer!

STOP LYING!  If it was REALLY about protecting federal buildings, then they would send people to guard the BUILDINGS instead of ATTACKING the protesters with tear gas, guns and batons. Trump wants to punish those that aren't his supporters.
Don‚Äôt Underestimate Trump‚Äôs Union Appeal
The only poll that counts is the one on election day. Polls can be skewed. Subjective. I suspect many Trump voters are keeping their cards close to their vests...
Trump is not trying to delay the election. He is laying the groundwork for Barr to be able to declare it fraudulent when too many people vote "absentee".

Better lawyer up. If you thought Bush v. Gore was ugly, Supreme Court ruling in Biden v. Trump is going to make that look like child's play. Having said that, Constitution firmly ends one term by Jan 20. If no clear winner, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. #Election2020
President Trump suggested delaying the 2020 election in a tweet Thursday morning.

Even with demonstrations, deaths, incompetence, and corruption, the #1 story trump's absolute submission to putin's master plan of deconstructing NATO as a market and defense force. The most successful post World War II alliance is being dismantled because Putin directed trump.
Yes- Why is the Trump controlled FDA blocking this? Trump needs to fire Hahn and put Dr. Stella Immanuel and Dr. Peter Navarro in charge of the FDA. It‚Äôs all under his control.
