Who writes these tweets for Nadler?  Just like Biden he is  too incompetent.
Fuck 'em... Biden said he would be announcing next week I believe. Personally I hope it is Kamala. All the energy used talking smack about her is kinda nuts considering the goal is to get Trump out and get this country back on track. People need to get their priorities straight.
In my opinion, Joe Biden had a lot to do with the successful run for the Presidency by Obama. Joe was very popular among his colleagues from both parties  &amp; well known. Biden should not pick VP who most Americans don't know buy name or background. You need a strong VP right off.
Fe fe fi fi fo fo fum He's spreadin' Covid lies in the auditorium Donald Trump, He's a grump He's a Ku Klux Klown who's goin' down He's gonna take a beatin'  From Biden out behind the gym why's everybody always pickin' on him?

Biden will not run for a second term if elected &amp; his choice for VP will have to be presidential. He committed to a choice being a female &amp; among those mentioned, there aren't any that will fill the bill. He is having a hard time with that.
but to be fair Biden does shit himself every time he goes on air
I will vote for a Biden/Bozo the Clown if that will rid the White House of the cancer that’s eating us alive
No, no. I was told this is what Biden’s America would look like. Could it be that I was lied to? 😒

wonder who joe biden’s vice president would be..  because if he did somehow win i bet he wouldn’t be in office long. dude literally has dementia..  so basically whoever his VP is, is actually running against trump, not biden.  btw he is announcing who it is August 1st. #staywoke
Biden is going to Hell 👇👇👇
Obama and Biden stopped testing Fauci was in charge then to!! #Plandemic #LiesLiesLies
You need the test!  trump is your 🤮 President! Not joe Biden.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause He is not a pathological liar. He is far more qualified than Dolt 45 ever could be.   45 is a malignant narcissist who wants to be a Dictator. Biden has compassion and decency, tRump has passed a dementia test. Allegedly.. 45 is lower than a snake's belly..Biden could pick Don Jr, and they will still paint him as a socialist. Are you new here?
Fauci wants dems to like him cuz biden said hed hire him if he won.  Fauci just wants tv time n MSM has him on everyday. Time for him to go
Biden fits the bill
Seems unlikely
What did he say about Biden?
Agreed. Not sure Biden can stay awake much longer!

Bryan, I think we’re both on the same team and have same viewpoints.  Biden isn’t running...whomever is his running mate and the entire Demo-crat party will be pulling his puppet strings...he just can’t do it.
Biden can not have a conversation without mixing up information...becoming confused. Let’s start with this one. Ready, set, go...debunk.
Hiden Biden.  Can’t hide forever.
Better do your research regarding Russia. Clinton and Biden are the ones that have received mega millions from that country.
So you’re saying it’s actually Biden that has the silent majority? Good to know. Thanks.
Biden doesn't know what year he is in. How do you expect him to do a full interview
You must be talking about Joe Biden and the democrats the are full of racism starting with kkk  Neo nazis blm black panthers. I can keep going but the list is so long and this racism bullshit is so old and tiring. You clearly don't understand racism America
Sorry, I'm just completely confused about what it is that you're asking me. You made a point about Joe Biden because he offered prayers. Do you think I condemn everyone that prays?

Yep. Elect Joe Biden.
With due respect, we expect the Republicans and many Democrats to oppose to stupid things like this.  We all hope that democrats will stand against Biden if he did crazy stuff like this.  We had hoped GOP did that for Trump but we were abandoned....

Are you now saying that YOU can’t read? Is that why there’s no example of Biden lying about his SATs?
Yes, you brought it up to change the subject from your false claim that Biden lied about his SATs. You changed the subject because you didn’t know what the fuck you were talking about.
We were discussing the clip you posted and how it never even referenced Biden’s SATs. You said I couldn’t comprehend the article. You told me to type the last sentence and you would explain it and I did. You couldn’t explain it. There you go.
I didn’t make any mistake. But you can’t seem to come up with any cohesive argument now that you’ve been exposed as a moron. I’m still waiting for Biden lying about his SATs, which was the errant claim you made hours ago and still haven’t substantiated.
Right there you asked if Biden lied about his SAT scores in response to my statement that Biden didn’t need anyone to take his SATs for him and then went off on some weird unrelated crusade about Biden’s law class rankings. 🤪
Because the subject was Trump’s poor academics (I brought it up regarding him paying someone to take his college entrance exams) and then you went off on tangents like this because you can’t hold an argument. You got busted on the “Didn’t Biden lie about his SATs?” 😁
This is so stupid. You claimed that Biden lied about his SATs when I pointed out Trump paid someone to take his SATs because he couldn’t get into college on his own, then you posted something about his law school class ranking, which has zero to do with SATs. 🤡
TRIPLED. And that was with pandemics. The market always performs better with Democrat Presidents. If Hillary or Biden were President right now the Dow would be at 35K. Instead of staying stagnant at 2K below highs.
Biden didn’t have to pay someone to take his SATs. 😂
Biden isn’t the one bragging about how doctors were “surprised” that he could identify an elephant on a cognitive test. 😂😂😂
LOL, yes, if Biden gets in office the market will continue to rise. Trump’s only talent is bankruptcy.
Biden definitely abused his power as VP to facilitate his son's exploits. Biden can't relate to we common folk and Obummer SURE couldn't. He despised the common man and stuck to celebrities and so-called "intellectuals." Bull!
Heard part of the interview with Biden and Obama where Biden said Trump can't relate to people. Whaaat?!! Biden and his crook son; maybe Biden is so out of touch with the common man that he can't see how corrupt his own son is? No, he's right in the middle of it, aiding his son's
And now, because of Trump’s incompetence and mismanagement, minority unemployment is back up to record highs. That never happened when we had pandemics under Obama/Biden.

Yes, blame Trump. Makes at least as much sense as blaming Biden, if not significantly more so.
LMAO, Trump is so scared of Biden he literally got impeached trying (and failing) to get dirt on him when he wasn’t even the Dem nominee yet. That’s why Trump’s losing so badly to him even in traditionally red states like Arizona and Texas. 😂
Yep, that’s why Trump is flailing and having the flip-flop on medical stances (masks) and having to make up moronic shit like BIDEN WILL DESTROY TBR SUBURBS (😂😂😂) because everyone is hating him now.

Joe Biden will do whatever he’s told
The GOP must grow a set and stand up against this craziness.  This pathetic weak response to the left bullying is embarrasing. Joe  Biden is our named opponent.  He has never gotten more than 1% in a national election.  Why now?
Obama and Biden have done more for this country than your President could ever hope to do. Please take the blinders off and see trump for who and what he truly is, a Cole and corrupt man who doesn't care about anyone but himself.
The knuckleheads on TV would rather argue and go to court for weeks to determine who won the election, rather than allowing congress delay for a few weeks to either vote of take more time to vote. DEMOCRATS Biden and Hillary had already claimed that there will be fraud.
The spiciest take that I've seen is that Biden is actively trying to lose the election so he isn't left holding the bag.
I wonder if a black Biden supporter had been killed for supporting him by a black Trump supporter if the national media would have covered it? Oh you bet they would.  But make it the opposite and not a peep.  Media bias is sickening!

And u live where???  TX??Although Biden is actually beating Trump in every poll out there.  Even in FL. Even FOX NEWS polls have Trump trailing.  Trump is a failure and has not once tried to unite.  Only divide.
Fun fact: both Donald Trump (6/14/46) and Joe Biden (11/20/42) are older than former presidents George W. Bush (7/6/46) and Bill Clinton (8/19/46), who have been out of the oval office for almost 12 and 20 years, respectively.
And who started the war on drugs and mandatory sentencing? The Clintons, Biden, Pelosi, Warren, and the rest of the Democrats in 92. Who has been tearing it down for 3 1/2 years? That big bad orange man y’all love to hate.
Biden is going to be your president
I would not vote for Joe Biden if he were the last man on Earth.
Biden 2020!  Make the office respectable again!!
Him and Biden both.
I’m voting for Biden, because Trump is a Putin-loving, egomaniacal, cowardly, cretinous, dictator wanna-be who disputes science, because it doesn’t serve his self interest.
Who ever Joe Biden chooses as his VP, will absolutely be the best person imaginable.    Brilliant!  Whoever it is.  They are the best choice.    I will be devoted to that person.   AND I PRAY NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING DEROGATORY ABOUT THAT PERSON.  JUST HELP JOE AND HER WIN BIG.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?????   If Biden screws the pooch on this pick, there’s gonna be a lot of slow singin’ and flower bringin’ because, truth be told, I’m actually *expecting* Biden to f*ck this up. Because  ♥️ f*ckin’ up a sure thing.  #ProveMeWrong
Don't worry Germany, the troops will be back when Biden takes office.
nah see, that's Bernie's idea. Biden has a social distance from this policy...
I trust Joe Biden &amp; stand by his vp choice.  “Allies” need to shut it &amp; let the man do his work.  Not helping.
Maybe Biden can reverse it if it will take years....
She supported Obama/Biden who tore this country apart with race and identity politics. That is Oprah’s legacy. She needs to learn to live with it and accept when she passes that is how she will be remembered.
Agree. Biden will prepare his V.P. to be the next President. Given his age and experience, it’s ludicrous to believe that he will feel threatened by the strength of his running mate
Clinton’s and Biden’s have taken corruption and selling their offices to a new level.
98 days, right? Look for LOTS of information to come to light in the next 3 mo.#Biden2020 #Biden #Biden2020Landslide
Have to triage. I think Biden if in swing state. Then work to scare the bejeezus out of him when in power. With a third party that cooperates with progressive Dems.
I don’t think many people really expect biden to be any different, I think that a lot of people are going to vote for him since going nowhere is still better than going backwards
I wish I were joking.  The Democrats and Joe Biden have been practicing a more palatable brand of Fascism than the Republicans lately.

I have to admit the is as close to precipice we have been since Civil War.  When you can’t even have a yard sign supporting Biden in your yard because it gets stolen or destroyed, I would say hostilities are at early stages.
OK - I’ll bite. I’ll play your game. Then the Republicans must keep the spotlight on Biden’s gross incompetence and corruption.
Your goal invited no discourse  You pushed an immature agenda,  made knowingly false claims about Washington, Obama,  and Biden and still seem to push the idea that no one is qualified as president...  There is no discourse with a fraud such as you
That really not the point, Biden’s chances. The point is that K Harris is not being treated like the experienced and intelligent woman she is
I forgive the 2016 Trump voters.   I sure they feel terrible about horrendous things they have helped tRump do to our country.  They can redeem themselves by voting for Biden and Dem’s across the board.  The Republican Party is dead and gone. Trump killed it.

No. Biden has the lead he has because Trump is self-destructing. All Biden has to do to win is stay out of the way while Trump advocates Lysol injections, sends Nazi-like goon squads into cities, promotes white-supremacy and refuses to even wear a mask.

I hope people don't go back to bed if Biden wins.
You're right! I'm totally sure the Biden team and the DNC will see the error of their ways and represent their constituency. They will have a progressive awakening.
And this gem. Plus, he’s a never-Biden guy. And he’s been misleading voters since spring saying he’s on the ballot, when he never has been. I’m planning to cast my first libertarian vote.
We will. Biden 2020!!!
There's no way Biden's handlers will allow him to walk onto a debate stage with Donald Trump. They can't allow it. It will never happen.
I don’t know any Dems or others in the anti-Trump coalition who think we have this in the bag. So any tweets and posts scolding the poll sharers, but no voter I know is taking Biden’s chances for granted. We all have November 2016 PTSD. We’re showing up.

This is just plain wrong.  Allowing this type of thing should prove to all that there is a lot of evil in WH, and in these so called troops.  Biden would not would not countenance this behavior, much less welcome it in.
Yup just plain dumb.  I see the assertion that Biden wants a ‘loyal’ VP, and that’s 1) not Biden’s style and 2) a bad idea, generally, unless you have autocratic inclinations.
for folks that loathe Cotton, support Biden, want the pandemic to br mitigated, don’t want War Memorial Park privitized, and who aren’t purely enthusiastic Libertarians, y’all sure seem easily baited by squirrels chittering. If Dan is as inconsequential as you’ve said, re-focus.

Impeachment was a political ploy, among many other ploys the Democrats have used in their arsenal to remove this Presidential. You seem intelligent, please don't continue to fall for the mainstream media coverage and do your research. Joe Biden's family has become rich.

The needs of the people will come first.  Let the legal system take care of trump.  Trump has broken so many laws Biden will not need to order investigation of Trump.  Prosecutors in Florida and New York have enough evidence to pursue already regarding Trump’s malfeasance.

Let's see, asshole. Obama and Biden had absolutely nothing to do with you getting into office. Obama was term-limited and Biden didn't run! You are where you are due to the corrupt Electoral College, Nazis, White Supremacists and Russia! Ain't gonna happen again!

Ah, but it is. Harris doesn’t bring anything to a Biden ticket. Does take away.
Joe Biden is probably the one who offends the fewest, so his VP pick is where he can pick up voters who are more progressive than he is.

MANY  TV talkers don't think it is a problem when Biden and Hillary says they need to plan for phony election... But they blame you for making warning of what the country might be force to have to endure.
Joe Biden will do whatever he’s told
The GOP must grow a set and stand up against this craziness.  This pathetic weak response to the left bullying is embarrasing. Joe  Biden is our named opponent.  He has never gotten more than 1% in a national election.  Why now?
Obama and Biden have done more for this country than your President could ever hope to do. Please take the blinders off and see trump for who and what he truly is, a Cole and corrupt man who doesn't care about anyone but himself.
The knuckleheads on TV would rather argue and go to court for weeks to determine who won the election, rather than allowing congress delay for a few weeks to either vote of take more time to vote. DEMOCRATS Biden and Hillary had already claimed that there will be fraud.
The spiciest take that I've seen is that Biden is actively trying to lose the election so he isn't left holding the bag.
I wonder if a black Biden supporter had been killed for supporting him by a black Trump supporter if the national media would have covered it? Oh you bet they would.  But make it the opposite and not a peep.  Media bias is sickening!
God, and I thought Trump and Biden were the only 2 bad options
And u live where???  TX??Although Biden is actually beating Trump in every poll out there.  Even in FL. Even FOX NEWS polls have Trump trailing.  Trump is a failure and has not once tried to unite.  Only divide.
Fun fact: both Donald Trump (6/14/46) and Joe Biden (11/20/42) are older than former presidents George W. Bush (7/6/46) and Bill Clinton (8/19/46), who have been out of the oval office for almost 12 and 20 years, respectively.
And who started the war on drugs and mandatory sentencing? The Clintons, Biden, Pelosi, Warren, and the rest of the Democrats in 92. Who has been tearing it down for 3 1/2 years? That big bad orange man y’all love to hate.
Biden is going to be your president
I would not vote for Joe Biden if he were the last man on Earth.
Biden 2020!  Make the office respectable again!!
Him and Biden both.
I’m voting for Biden, because Trump is a Putin-loving, egomaniacal, cowardly, cretinous, dictator wanna-be who disputes science, because it doesn’t serve his self interest.
Who ever Joe Biden chooses as his VP, will absolutely be the best person imaginable.    Brilliant!  Whoever it is.  They are the best choice.    I will be devoted to that person.   AND I PRAY NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING DEROGATORY ABOUT THAT PERSON.  JUST HELP JOE AND HER WIN BIG.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?????   If Biden screws the pooch on this pick, there’s gonna be a lot of slow singin’ and flower bringin’ because, truth be told, I’m actually *expecting* Biden to f*ck this up. Because  ♥️ f*ckin’ up a sure thing.  #ProveMeWrong
Don't worry Germany, the troops will be back when Biden takes office.
nah see, that's Bernie's idea. Biden has a social distance from this policy...

Maybe Biden can reverse it if it will take years....
She supported Obama/Biden who tore this country apart with race and identity politics. That is Oprah’s legacy. She needs to learn to live with it and accept when she passes that is how she will be remembered.
Agree. Biden will prepare his V.P. to be the next President. Given his age and experience, it’s ludicrous to believe that he will feel threatened by the strength of his running mate
Clinton’s and Biden’s have taken corruption and selling their offices to a new level.
98 days, right? Look for LOTS of information to come to light in the next 3 mo.#Biden2020 #Biden #Biden2020Landslide
Have to triage. I think Biden if in swing state. Then work to scare the bejeezus out of him when in power. With a third party that cooperates with progressive Dems.
I don’t think many people really expect biden to be any different, I think that a lot of people are going to vote for him since going nowhere is still better than going backwards

No. Biden has the lead he has because Trump is self-destructing. All Biden has to do to win is stay out of the way while Trump advocates Lysol injections, sends Nazi-like goon squads into cities, promotes white-supremacy and refuses to even wear a mask.

You're right! I'm totally sure the Biden team and the DNC will see the error of their ways and represent their constituency. They will have a progressive awakening.
And this gem. Plus, he’s a never-Biden guy. And he’s been misleading voters since spring saying he’s on the ballot, when he never has been. I’m planning to cast my first libertarian vote.
We will. Biden 2020!!!
There's no way Biden's handlers will allow him to walk onto a debate stage with Donald Trump. They can't allow it. It will never happen.
I don’t know any Dems or others in the anti-Trump coalition who think we have this in the bag. So any tweets and posts scolding the poll sharers, but no voter I know is taking Biden’s chances for granted. We all have November 2016 PTSD. We’re showing up.

Huckabee: Biden is simply not able to get his message across. (Polls suggest something working.)
This is just plain wrong.  Allowing this type of thing should prove to all that there is a lot of evil in WH, and in these so called troops.  Biden would not would not countenance this behavior, much less welcome it in.
Yup just plain dumb.  I see the assertion that Biden wants a ‘loyal’ VP, and that’s 1) not Biden’s style and 2) a bad idea, generally, unless you have autocratic inclinations.
for folks that loathe Cotton, support Biden, want the pandemic to br mitigated, don’t want War Memorial Park privitized, and who aren’t purely enthusiastic Libertarians, y’all sure seem easily baited by squirrels chittering. If Dan is as inconsequential as you’ve said, re-focus.

If Biden wins, no. If Trump wins, yes.
On top of that, Whitfield’s on the record as one of those never-Biden progressives. And he was a proponent of the Seth Rich being murdered by the Clintons plot. He’s got terrible judgment and a penchant for extremism.

Biden has about 222 EVs locked up. Nv and NH are likely, that's 232. He would need 38 more.   He can get that from FL plus MI/Wi/PA (any 1 of them) He can get that from MI/WI/Pa (all of them) AZ/PA/MI (or WI)  Multiple paths. Biden doesn't need FL, Trump does.

Yes I really do. They have started calling Biden a Moderate. He has been know for years as a left of center Liberal. Or very Liberal. Look at how all of a sudden Bernie drops out of race and backs him. Why??  They know they can control him or influenced him
Impeachment was a political ploy, among many other ploys the Democrats have used in their arsenal to remove this Presidential. You seem intelligent, please don't continue to fall for the mainstream media coverage and do your research. Joe Biden's family has become rich.

The needs of the people will come first.  Let the legal system take care of trump.  Trump has broken so many laws Biden will not need to order investigation of Trump.  Prosecutors in Florida and New York have enough evidence to pursue already regarding Trump’s malfeasance.

Biden lost his marbles again...
I agree with Biden. If he were elected, the virus, riots, violence and America shut down would end. I believe that because THE DAMNED DEMOCRATS CREATED ALL OF THEM!!!
Creepy Biden does it again that’s just weird and kind of strange
Biden put out an ad today that said Ebola was one of the deadliest outbreaks in history smh
The 2020 Election Has Been Groundbreaking For Disability Rights — But Now What?
Still waiting for an answer, from Left or Right.  Pelosi, Obama and Biden say President Trump is totally RACIST!!!  So, please I want PROOF or idea as to why he’s being accused of this . He has done more for blacks than anyone.
Let's see, asshole. Obama and Biden had absolutely nothing to do with you getting into office. Obama was term-limited and Biden didn't run! You are where you are due to the corrupt Electoral College, Nazis, White Supremacists and Russia! Ain't gonna happen again!
Oh how convenient, when you go to comment on the lovely article about Biden wanting schools to teach Islam and lift immigration bans from terrorist rich areas this pops up???? I wonder why??
Biden had 19 attend his “web-rally” the other day...still believe the bullshit polls?
Heams about chaos and anarchy to get Biden elected.  Sickening to sacrifice lives and structures to defeat a political foe.  This is treason.
I think a lot of folks don’t remember it. Maybe that’s why Biden wants him at the DNC?
We all know, 🙏for America and Biden.
Another “not my first choice” but Mr. Biden gets my vote. 💙💙💙
Kanye the obvious choice for president. Has trump or Biden ever made even ONE good album? Or ONE good song? Plus trump and Biden combine FOR ZERO GRAMMYS. Ye got 21 alone. Seriously isn’t even a doubt in my mind #Kanye2020
The picture of trump at the bottom, on a tweet that says voting for Biden and you still didn't know it was about trump...  ...yeah, the education system failed you.
Biden is as much a joke as the crap you tweet
I see a lot of lying so called conservatives saying they will vote democratic. If they really are conservatives it’s called hedging your bets. They will really vote Trump but just in case Biden pulls it off they are trying to cover their butts
Old fool; Trump has never been a legitimate president; he is a product of corruption, stupidity, and evil. Joe Biden will be a real president and we can actually sleep at night.
Just to confirm...that’s present time. As in the current timeline. The one where Joe Biden is not President. Got it. ;)
Her injections were from Baby Koreans  Penus foreskin #SandraBullock is a whack job like Biden
Funny thing about Joe Biden. I would of gladly voted from the 1970-2000s version of him had I been alive or old enough to vote.
Trump called her pocahontas in front of an Indian cheif. Hillary's emails are irrelevant. I never heard about Joe Biden's racist comments. You must have heard it on Faux News
Hey  President Joe Biden is the best thing this country could do right now. Well, that and as many Republican defeats as possible. What a better America this would be if all of you were removed from office. But we know you will cheat to stay in power. That’s all you know.

Hate to break it to you, but this is video of Trump’s America, right now. So to discourage us from voting for Biden, you want us to look at how bad Trump has mucked it up. The elevator doesn’t go to the top floor for you guys does it?
Trump Voice makes me sick 😷 it’s all about trump &amp; he think’s that’s he is above the LAW go back to you city NYC and leave the presidency to the real presidential person BIDEN you have know glue what a President does get over ur self
Yes. Plan on Biden 2 having  done homework on how 2 get #orangecalf45 out the door. Liz Cheney has GOP all in a hizy fit now. Falling apart. Maybe there will be  an end that will surprise us
This entire page is Bull Shit. Wont happen. Biden will NOT ever win Texas.
You are wrong! Texas will NOT give up OIL AND GAS. Joe Biden wants to take that away.  TEXAS is all about Oil and Gas.    Democrats will NEVER EVER EVER win Texas.

What the hell does that even mean? Joe Biden said “Trump IS the first racist President” Not WAS. So your premise is already wrong in your chess-y way. Maybe he should’ve included the words “in the modern era”, but the press needs to stop making this something it’s not.
Absurd thing for Biden to say. It’s enough that Trump is, regardless of who else. Let’s move on.
Thank you. Covid is terrorizing the South, Trump is terrorizing the cities, &amp; Jake is on about Biden correctly calling Trump a racist when absolutely no one else WILL call him a racist.
Unfortunately, Biden is wrong about that.
Because when I think of Joe Biden, I think of lawlessness and violence. Lord have mercy. Does he think we’re gonna buy that Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden is The Joker? How about trying a line of attack that’s in the realm of possibility next time, Donald.Joe Biden will surround himself with intelligent people qualified for their jobs. I don't want exciting, I want a good night's sleep.
Funniest tweet of the day.  No one over the age of 12 would confuse Biden with a brilliant person... but thanks for the ROFL
you want to know how to win? simple. biden won't pass Med4ALL so you should do it.
This is fantasy propaganda, No-Show Biden is mentally unfit for any office. The obvious misleading need for perpetrating lies is the campaign the Democrats have chosen. It's pathetic...
Oh I think there’s a good many arguments he could use against Biden.
It’s only really funny if it happens in spite of Biden losing Hispanic voters.
A Democrat controlled Biden presidency...
It's good to have fantasies, that is until you start believing them..🤣🤣🤣 In 99 Days the Democrats lose the House, and lose seats in the Senate. Biden will never be elected... That's reality..😉
They're Biden supporters just like you. This is the Democrats peaceful protesters, that all is Trump people keep hearing. So suck it up and take credit for your own creation.. Progressives own this, quit trying to put the blame elsewhere.
Biden doesn't know what year he is in. How do you expect him to do a full interview
You must be talking about Joe Biden and the democrats the are full of racism starting with kkk  Neo nazis blm black panthers. I can keep going but the list is so long and this racism bullshit is so old and tiring. You clearly don't understand racism America

I don’t know whose worse...Biden or West..in fact I struggle to see why this is news
What if kanye is just doing this bs to steal some votes from biden and trump can get reelected 🤔
Personality and non stop child like behavior from trump aside, do you honestly think things will get better under Biden? In a few years, I think most people will be very disappointed that Biden won. Reminds me of the sentiment when Carter won (and let’s just not go there)
Our second project will be a Joe Biden rally in September. You’ll believe whatever we show you. Just wait.
It's dawning on me that the Biden campaign probably does have a coronavirus policy already planned out, but they're not saying anything because they don't want Trump to steal their good ideas.
Considering that Biden can’t remember a time before Trump was President, it makes sense.  He definitely can’t remember what a flaming racist LBJ was.
I thought Biden was talking about himself in the 3rd person for a second.
This makes no sense at all..but lately what has with Biden
Guess we don’t do Biden. Old Corn Pop has him in a state of dementia.
BREAKING: on Biden’s first day in office, through executive order he will make the Presidency of Andrew Jackson cease to exist.Seeing as you are okay being a rat!! I will try to understand your bs!!

That is the dumbest reason to vote for Biden. Why don't you vote on what the stand for!!! TRUMP 2020!!!

Bro I’m pro life and I’m voting Biden. When Elon Musk starts tweeting trying to support Trump you know he’s in trouble.
They ARE peaceful protestors with paid , probably by you, anarchistic and aggitators there so you will have a reason to send your “troops” to make it look like cities are out of control. It’s all on film and you are transparent. Biden 2020
Joe Biden’s nickname is Uncle Badtouch. If you have to be around him, be sure others are watching or Uncle Joe will touch you and you won’t like it. Pedos need to repent and get right with Jesus.
Who ever runs puppet Biden
Elizabeth Warren. She can get Progressives to not feel bad voting for Biden which will help since the DNC has screwed Bernie twice now.
Biden will in Nov. but better!!!!
So to summarize: Biden paid his respects, Trump doesn’t plan to. Wonder if that changes
Wow the Biden Obama administration really sucked and was a wasted 8 years.
Yes. Biden AOC and Bernie are this. No.
Thank God for that! Biden 2020

Trump's an idiot and Biden is not sleepy Joe, he is creepy Joe. Next?
Oh my gosh  really? You point this out like a child that just took another ones candy...really...the more you tweet, the more we see, how brain dead you are? Are you a relative to Biden?
Basically my point is that I don’t think Section8 is for black people or that Section8 has any implications of being mostly black. I think in a racists mind (Biden) it is, so he’s trying to pander while also furthering his horrible anti middle class policies
From what I’ve seen of the Joe Biden plan it’s to randomly put Section8 in the middle of middle class neighborhoods. I’m saying in reality there’s more whites on it than Black people (as your tweet implied) and what I’m saying is that there is no actual reason to

I think you are right! Biden doesn't even know what feacking is anyway. You can tell when he talks about it!
Biden is as much of a criminal as trump is.
This is why I hope Biden chose her. She is a looney and everybody knows it!
Correct.....listen up people! You do NOT want Joe Biden's Puppet Masters running our country!
Joe Biden has vacant eyes!
Biden is both ...........stupid and demented!
The fact that Biden thinks trump is the first racist person to be elected president is crazy too me 🤔🤦🏽‍♂️
I can't imagine that Biden is ahead. It just doesn't make sense!This is true: “It doesn’t matter who Joe Biden picks as his running mate – somebody will be disappointed.”  BUT THIS IS TRUER: “More so than in past cycles, Democrats across the party say they just want to see Biden beat Trump.”
“People are voting for Joe Biden because he wouldn’t have allowed Putin to slaughter American soldiers the way Big Donnie did.”  While Biden was VP, he allowed Iran to pay bounties for dead Americans &amp; did nothing about it.
Joe Biden’s running mate will be an extremely qualified pick, and the Twittersphere’s dynamic of pitting one woman against another is increasingly frustrating and needs to stop.
Bunker boy? Biden is the one that has been in a basement for the last several months.  Your attacks would be more effective if they included actual facts.
Don’t you have covid? Biden is a better man, father and husband than any person named Trump.
10 yrs in this place called Twitter. The last 4 I have been more active than ever. Resist. Vote. Vote Biden. Vote Blue. In every  local, state and national election vote Democrat. Let’s take our country back and make things right for all of us.
So....is Joe Biden actually running for President?
It's almost as much fun as if Biden picked Hillary just to watch them implode knowing they can't beat him, and if they kill him they'd get president Hillary. They'd break entirely. He'd be able to just lead into every argument with "so I was considering stepping down"
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election #SmartNews #JoeGotThatRight
I think the only way to really know the answer is to put Biden in charge and see what happens.
Trump is now officially pushing to delay the Election. Not because it’s unsafe—he’s sending kids to school. So things, to him, aren’t that bad.  He’s pushing to delay the election because he’s f*cked his presidency up so bad that there is NO way for him to steal it from Biden.
One thing for certain, Biden has no sense, whatsoever!!!!
I think “Modern Sexism” can be overcome. But I think it is ingrained most deeply in white men and white women (particularly southern white women). I don’t even know if it will keep Biden from choosing Harris.
a campaign. I hope he recognizes that. But I think this group around Biden will not make the same accusations against a woman who didn’t run for the WH herself. Someone who looks like they have been called to public service by Biden.
Have you heard Joe Biden try and form a sentence?
I second that - it's a good, therapeutic way of handling it. From the sounds of it it's too late because of the bank's involvement.
In Arkansas I’m going to early vote on Monday October 19th for Joe Biden!
Perhaps shifting gears to 2022?  Saving for blitz this fall? Waiting to allocate to best chances to hold onto Senate? Trump has already lost 65+ (reliable!) vote which he won last time. Other crucial suburban vote now for Biden.
You bet! Biden &amp; the Cabinet could do a great job even working out of an abandoned steelmill.

Can anyone tell me: 1) Why isn't anyone wearing a mask? 2) Why the "nurse" is wearing a long winter coat in July? 3) Why does the "nurse" have to hold his hand like a child?  His VP pick will be POTUS within 18 months, if Biden wins. Medical retirement. #Trump2020
My G !  I hope you have visible resistance on your side. A wall of Biden banners flanked by the  U.S. flags.
I will wait until the Biden administration investigates &amp; pronounces it safe &amp; effective.
"Change takes time" he says to a family that's about to be kicked out of their home because the democrats dont think they need any help. "Be sure to vote Biden in November if you're still alive!"
He said he’s voting for Biden, just not “endorsing” him
I hope those are recyclable materials. You know Biden is going to have those barriers removed first thing.
We’ve got Republican governors and Republican senators supporting the candidacy of Joe Biden, whose platform was largely written by Elizabeth Warren. You love to see it.￼   All that &gt; falling on your sword and dying
I agree 100%. I'm not a Trump supporter and could never vote for him. I'm struggling with finding a way to vote for Biden though. Leaning towards third party.
America definitely needs medicare for all, what we need just as much is to vote democrat all the way down the ballot.  The party is changing, Just because Biden isn't Bernie doesn't mean there is no hope.
All Biden needs to do for the next 100 days is keep posting positive and supportive messages on social media, make on camera appearances to twist the knife into Trump, and remind the entire south that they’d have SEC football if Trump would’ve taken Covid seriously.
Now that Trump’s beautiful and very long border wall has blown over, I’m guessing that we will find out that section was built by Obama and Biden
Meanwhile, Biden gets more free campaign advertising.
I really enjoyed the Biden-Powell car race segment. #CelebrationForChange
Here here sir! So true… Spread the word to friends and family and get them to votethe time to prepare is now. Vote for Joe Biden for a return for a much missed sanity in the White House!
Harris we need justice reform nor foreign policy Biden’s got that covered ~ he can’t do the justice reform by himself he’s too far removed
Biden should do an interview with Wallace. His team should prep him well and he needs to show that he can take the heat. If he can’t handle a lean-right interview, how will he debate Trump?
I’m voting early 10/19/2020 for Joe Biden in Arkansas
I fly the flag and I’m voting for Biden
You mean 8 years of obama Biden did that
This man just openly admitting he’s gonna jack Biden off 😭😭
And it's my hope to vote for a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket!
So he’s campaigning for Biden now.
Biden's AG appt will be more exciting to me than his pick for VP. I might be alone in this but here's why: 1) Housecleaning the DOJ 2) Prosecuting all 45ers for their crimes against the Constitution  3) Restoring SDNY, EDNY, WC, etc. So much more… (Legal)revenge will be sweet.
Would this face break if it smiled with a truly happy smile?  I don't mean one of his smirks.  Smile like Biden does all the time.
Am 💯 looking forward to Biden presidency.
It’d be a shame if Biden’s DOJ starts reviewing previous mergers and antitrust problems in industries like broadcast media.
My views lean left on almost everything expect the mob movement.  Biden will destroy our country and enable the mob movement to proceed. #bluelivesmatter
Trump and Biden are both clowns and I’ve voted democratic past  3 elections. No way in hell I would ever vote Biden, he would sink the country and it would take decades to recover. It only sounds good. Trump won’t let the mob take the country and do as they please
It has to do with your democratic mayors and governors. The criminals will be in control if Biden were president. Americans arnt going to let that happen
If you are rolling with Biden you’re part of the mob burning America to the ground
I’ll have to disagree with you on that. Pres would do the same type of interview with Biden if it was offered.
Biden don't care he is getting a billion from B L M scam!
Ugliness will only convince Trump supporters of their moral superiority. Wish them good health care under Pres Biden!
As much crap as I gave Trump about that stupid test he keeps boasting about, I honestly don’t think Biden can remember “person, woman, man,camera, tv” 🙈🙉  but with that begin said, that’s irrelevant when it comes to actually governoring! Lol

Lol for starters pretty sure it’s feel the *bern. I’m not even going to engage with someone who seriously believes Biden is a “leftist Marxist anarchist” while, I’m sure, simultaneously arguing that Biden has dementia and doesn’t know where he is. You wake up &amp; go home.If you vote for Biden you will lose a lot more than you’re paying out now.  Please do your research on his proposed taxes plans.
So in your mind Joe Biden is the better candidate?  Are you deaf and blind or just flat out crazy?
Get ready to enjoy him for the next four years too.  You are completely contracting if you believe that Biden isn’t a pedo.  There is clear multitude of videos of him smelling young girls.  Dude is brain dead and couldn’t run a lemonade stand if he tried.
Giving eulogies is one of the few things Biden is actually good at, his cognition must be so far gone that he is not even capable of that now.
GBall reporting in!  Navy airman vet! AX!  RIDEN WITH BIDEN!
WTF?!?!? you know all these Biden in the basement references are fucked up, he didn't coward down in a bunker and he wouldn't have built a wall around the white house. Real men aren't orange!
Biden doesn't need GA. He currently is leading in PA, AZ, MI, WI, FL, &amp; NC. With all other blue states staying blue from 2016, He only needs to pick up any three of these states.
Pretty much. I don’t like Biden, but it’s imperative we get Trump out of office.  I appreciate the fact that he seems to understand this is the feeling of a lot of Americans right now.
That’s the power that Biden and Obama gave them. Libertarians have been trying to warn people for DECADES about this but you want to turn a blind eye until it happens to you.
Biden is so full of it!!
Biden is so full of it!
Have you listened to Biden?  He is not all there!
Definitely don't expect those folks to come out for wet toast Biden. Dems couldn't have backed a worse candidate for the times.

Electing Biden is not going to end mass incarceration or systemic racism or for-profit healthcare or working class exploitation. And those problems didn’t begin in 2016

You can always tell when something gets under his thin skin...  Trump slams Obama over Biden new sit-down video
In other words it is a lot closer than what's being depicted because young voters are not motivated to come out for Biden and that will also translate to easily avoidable loses down ballot
The Obama/Biden/Clinton regime used American taxpayers $$ &amp; foreign $$ to fund their own personal criminal enterprise.
Biden was right yesterday when he said we must do more for caregivers!  Hope you can find his speech. Was caregiver for my mom and it was exhausting even though I had some help. Mental/emotional exhaustion much worse than the physical.

This is the main point I keep trying to press to people that are lukewarm about Biden. Female VP!! And possibly President IF Biden isn't capable of holding office, an idea that I have heard repeated by those that are on the fence.
Yep. Elect Joe Biden.
With due respect, we expect the Republicans and many Democrats to oppose to stupid things like this.  We all hope that democrats will stand against Biden if he did crazy stuff like this.  We had hoped GOP did that for Trump but we were abandoned....
Traitors.  The silent majority will rise up and re-elect Donald Trump. If not Trump, our country is lost forever to the likes of Biden and all of you. Sad.
Who represents us? Who are the GOP leaders who make sure our views are represented?  We are the swing vote for Biden....
Biden desperately needs Obama to speak for him.
Biden means mobs.  Trump means jobs.  The choice couldn’t be more clear.  Trump 2020
No idea. It doesn’t change much, just that it’s not likely to happen anytime soon with either trump or Biden. What we need is massive public pressure and support.

We were discussing the clip you posted and how it never even referenced Biden’s SATs. You said I couldn’t comprehend the article. You told me to type the last sentence and you would explain it and I did. You couldn’t explain it. There you go.
I didn’t make any mistake. But you can’t seem to come up with any cohesive argument now that you’ve been exposed as a moron. I’m still waiting for Biden lying about his SATs, which was the errant claim you made hours ago and still haven’t substantiated.
Right there you asked if Biden lied about his SAT scores in response to my statement that Biden didn’t need anyone to take his SATs for him and then went off on some weird unrelated crusade about Biden’s law class rankings. 🤪
Because the subject was Trump’s poor academics (I brought it up regarding him paying someone to take his college entrance exams) and then you went off on tangents like this because you can’t hold an argument. You got busted on the “Didn’t Biden lie about his SATs?” 😁
This is so stupid. You claimed that Biden lied about his SATs when I pointed out Trump paid someone to take his SATs because he couldn’t get into college on his own, then you posted something about his law school class ranking, which has zero to do with SATs. 🤡
TRIPLED. And that was with pandemics. The market always performs better with Democrat Presidents. If Hillary or Biden were President right now the Dow would be at 35K. Instead of staying stagnant at 2K below highs.
Biden didn’t have to pay someone to take his SATs. 😂
Biden isn’t the one bragging about how doctors were “surprised” that he could identify an elephant on a cognitive test. 😂😂😂
LOL, yes, if Biden gets in office the market will continue to rise. Trump’s only talent is bankruptcy.
Drove from Arkansas to Oregon.  Zero Biden anywhere.  Tons of Trump!
Biden definitely abused his power as VP to facilitate his son's exploits. Biden can't relate to we common folk and Obummer SURE couldn't. He despised the common man and stuck to celebrities and so-called "intellectuals." Bull!
Heard part of the interview with Biden and Obama where Biden said Trump can't relate to people. Whaaat?!! Biden and his crook son; maybe Biden is so out of touch with the common man that he can't see how corrupt his own son is? No, he's right in the middle of it, aiding his son's
Becca - You are a breath of fresh air after reading the forgoing statements by vote4biden supporters, you got to scratch your head in confusion as to how so many walking, breathing individuals can be so stupid to believe Joe Biden is capable of managing anything.
And now, because of Trump’s incompetence and mismanagement, minority unemployment is back up to record highs. That never happened when we had pandemics under Obama/Biden.
Team Biden targets Ron Johnson over possible foreign influence scheme  via  Ron Johnson is a jerk, just like TRump.
Biden trailing behind in AZ, TX, GA looks like Dumb Donald is losing his base. His idiocy is losing him the re-election. I thought it was gonna be harder. But he’s doing it to himself. Thanks  for losing the election to  You make it easy to be a Dem!
Trump knew because he is scared shitless of Barack Obama (who laughed him out of the 2012 primaries) and Joe Biden, who lives rent free in his syphillis-riddled brain.
Biden is a perv!
Joe Biden calls Trump the country's 'first' racist president
Yes, blame Trump. Makes at least as much sense as blaming Biden, if not significantly more so.
LMAO, Trump is so scared of Biden he literally got impeached trying (and failing) to get dirt on him when he wasn’t even the Dem nominee yet. That’s why Trump’s losing so badly to him even in traditionally red states like Arizona and Texas. 😂
The way China is acting, we are behind, thanks to Obama and Biden! Time to increase military budget! And fast! I see big problems ahead! Time 5o start hardening our electrical grid! You can start where I live first!
Biden is a perv!
Biden has lost his mind!
Yep, that’s why Trump is flailing and having the flip-flop on medical stances (masks) and having to make up moronic shit like BIDEN WILL DESTROY TBR SUBURBS (😂😂😂) because everyone is hating him now.
I have spent 19 days traveling this beautiful USA from Arkansas to Oregon. Not 1 Biden sign.  Plenty of Trump flags, banners &amp; signs.  Everyone I have talked to is SICK of this crap.  They also think we will never hear of the China Virus after Election Day.  #Trump2020
How many Gays are backing Biden, he wants more Muslims, more Muslims mean more violence towards gays, proof is in the pudding look at muslim countries see what they do, Trump supports the gay communities, not democrats
Weird huh! I'm still voting for my favorite President! Take a good look at what China's been doing this last week, month, year! Sure as hell can't have Biden  at the helm! He's bought off along with most in DC! Especially evil Nasty Nancy!
It's because you and Obama and Biden left empty shelves and a depleted military! Stop lying to the people! Just like you know the Russia Russia thing was bullshit!
Sounds like to the American people he asked to investigate wrong doing by Biden and his Son.  However you want to spin this it doesn’t look good for Biden’s
