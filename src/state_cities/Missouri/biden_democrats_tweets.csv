Yea, USPS union endorsed Biden, but sure. This is all Trump.
I‚Äôve said it once, I‚Äôll say it again for those who haven‚Äôt heard me say it...there are nearly 330 million people in this country and you mean to tell me we can‚Äôt find two people better than Biden and Trump to run the country?
Unfortunately being a bad dancer will not get people to change their minds about Biden
Biden can pull a Trump &amp; not have an actual plan (see Healthcare,  foreign policy, education) but can start w/ an easy one Trump hasn't touched...Infrastructure.   A Biden admin will face tremendous scrutiny,  but will have a VP &amp; cabinet that is far superior to what we have had.
Exactly. The VP choice literally doesn't matter. And also doesn't set someone up to be the next President. Example, Biden would have lost to Hillary in 2016 primary if he ran then.
Nope. You just need to be Joe Biden, apparently.
Can‚Äôt Joe Biden just use his two secret service agents? I‚Äôm sure he still has a few from his time as Vice President
Nothing wrong with Biden. Lindsey Graham thinks he is the best.
I'm not going political but Biden wants a woman for VP.... But not Hillary??  Something about all this doesn't add up...
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP AGREE WITH TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE.  OBAMA  SAYS BIDEN IS NOT HEALTHY.  BIDEN WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE SAID HE WAS IN VERMONT.  HAD ON NO MASK. INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY ON SPYING ON TRUMP.
Honest question for all people who are voting Biden  What line does Biden have to cross to lose your vote? What issue? What tragedy would he have to be a part of that he already isn't?  I ask this in seriousness, because Biden crossed that line a long time ago imo
Trump can‚Äôt do it on his own. But, with how some of the resent Social Media hearings have gone, i bet there would be support from both sides if the app is determined to be so bad that even Biden campaign made every staff member delete from personal and work phones immediately.
Your new poll doesn't state the obvious, how did you do the poll?   deserves better form Fox. #FakeNewsFOX
She is absolutely sane, and her theory of demonic possession is the best explanation ever for what has happened to the former Democrat party.  Just take a look at Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden's recent rants. #HowToExplainDemocrats
Keep dreaming. Biden will never make President of this country. It‚Äôs good you have a dream though.
Do you referring to Biden‚Äôs cervix Agenda?
Black people that weren‚Äôt voting anyway are always looking for a reason to validate it. They were already mad at Biden for the 90s. Kamala would be the icing on the cake. Susan Rice would be attacked for Benghazi. It‚Äôs a Catch 22.

They will hammer Biden and the VP pick. I suspect a turn to "immigrants" again at some point. Also, he will try to make amends to his sliding evangelical base, perhaps antiabortion or LGBTQ+ policy.ü§î
If Trump wins will Biden concede? Probably Not! A National mail in ballot is risky, for those concerned with Covid request an absentee ballot, states can also open for early voting my State does this.
Dude, your profile is all ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù garbage. You‚Äôre not fooling anyone that you are a reasonable person. It‚Äôs ridiculous to pretend that Biden isn‚Äôt better than Trump. You‚Äôre not convincing any rational people with this nonsense.

For the same reason polls show Biden besting Trump. It‚Äôs all BS.

One of the top priorities of the Biden administration should be to expand the Supreme Court.
Im okay with it as long as Dr Biden is consulted on the remodel. She will after all be the one living in it long term
Amen. Our country is an embarrassment. I miss Obama so fucking much. I‚Äôm not quite confident Biden can pull us out of this bullshit but he‚Äôs the only option which is also bullshit but whatever.

I guess Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd aren't thinking about what happens if Biden wins two terms. We need a strong v.p. to be ready in 8 years and  would be that v.p.
It will. They always do. Particularly post Labor Day. Everyone beating off over Biden in July is silly.
Joe Biden or Donald Trump is going to win the election, no one else. It‚Äôs a two-party system and as much as I hate it, there isn‚Äôt anything I can do about it. So in the most important election in recent history, I‚Äôm not wasting my vote on someone who stands no shot at winning.
"Gaffe  wait, don't do it to us, don't choose a #FarLeft candidate to run with you "Gaffe Joe"...the harmful policies like of the "Squad" MUST be rejected especially by you...pick someone moderate...don't sell us out!
Franklin Roosevelt was the best president in our nation's history. The crisis that Joe Biden will inherit, assuming he wins the election, will give him the opportunity to have the same sort of positive impact as FDR.  Here's hoping he takes full advantage of the opportunity.
You know whose name is mentioned as one of the co-sponsors in the Violence Against Women Act wiki entry?  Joe Biden.
It's a shame you didn't win the nomination.  You are data driven and look at things logically.  Instead we are left with Biden and Trump. I'm a Republican so will vote anti-Trump, if you had won the nomination I would have voted for you and not just notTrump.

Of all the heavily rumored Biden VP choices, Karen Bass would be the best
Thank you President Biden
Is anyone else wondering if the current administration will have to be forcibly removed from the WH? And will he skip out on Biden being sworn in? I mean, those things on his level of classlessness. And what will 11/4-1/20 look like? What a shit show this will be.
Probably the biggest nerd herd I have ever seen. Can you imagine being under 30 and supporting Biden in early February?
You can call it shorthand. It‚Äôs not shorthand. It‚Äôs a damn lie. If Biden or any democrat spoke this way you‚Äôd be calling them a liar. But it‚Äôs Trump so it‚Äôs shorthand.
Biden is not an elected official yet. He has zero responsibility to hold Trump accountable. Nowhere in the constitution does it say ‚Äúthe executive branch shall be held in check by the opposing party‚Äôs candidate‚Äù. That is a ridiculous position.
Put a big ass Biden sign in your yard and you‚Äôll realize there‚Äôs a lot of hope right now. People even say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

Biden did a great job creating jobs as part of the Obama administration.    Trump inherited a strong economy.
You should ask all the states and Congress what they think about your ilea and they would all say your nuts! Also only Congress can change the Election Day. I will be so happy when Biden beats you. You are going to be a one term

Oh the Dems have an October surprise planned but it will either be another virus more deadly than the first, or it will be releasing the cops who killed Floyd on a technicality so there will be more rioting and less voting. Then they plan to claim Biden won &amp; fake news will help.
Democrats must realize that foreign policy is just as important as domestic. No way around it. Biden is the right guy for international issues. Domestic is very important. Just do not forget outside our borders.
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt really create the office of Vice Presidency, or the office of Congressman.  Those jobs were kinda there.  Obama‚Äôs admin created more jobs it‚Äôs last three years than have been created under Donald.
You can't delay the election, Biden won't let you.

No, but with Trump trailing Biden by double digits in the polls there aren't a lot of takers for the role.
Yes it is  Obama and Biden trashed it
In this analogy I do, of course, think of Donald Trump as the "platter of shit with bits of broken glass" and I relate "how the chicken is cooked" to whether Biden will actually do anything about the climate crisis, jobs, and health care, or just talk about these critical issues.
Agreed. Your comment reminded me of this article from earlier this year on the eulogies Biden‚Äôs delivered.
Joe Biden finally crawls out of his basement. The Left tested hundreds of COVID vaccines on him to try to keep him alive until Election Day

the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don‚Äôt really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
I‚Äôm sorry, but I won‚Äôt believe _any_ of these people until I see their completed ballots and how much money they donate to Biden‚Äôs campaign. In other words, I will _never_ believe these people. Performative outrage is all this is.
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn‚Äôt inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn‚Äôt enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.
From Obama's mouth to God's ears!! Biden/Warren 2020

Mr. Secretary, you took Con Law at a more prestigious school than I did, but I aced l &amp; ll so apparently I got more out of it than you did. There's no "legal determination" to make. He doesn't have that power. He's just trying to plant seeds illegitimacy when Biden wins.
Practice what you preach Biden
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.

No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
Only way that happens is if he leaves office early. Biden won‚Äôt grant it. He politically can‚Äôt. Already has a tenuous relationship with progressives.

If it weren't for FDR and Lincoln..but he's in that conversation. He's that amazing. And I wish every moment he could run again. I wonder if Biden can pick him as VP
So the last time we saw Biden, he said he was going to prosecute ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù, which is just code word for protestors. They tried this with ‚Äúcannabis smokers‚Äù in the 70s. Nixon literally said you can‚Äôt prosecute being left or black so they just went after pot smokers.

John Lewis said he remembered Hillary Clinton in the Civil Rights movement.  Hillary was a Goldwater girl during the movement, and the Clintons never did a thing for blacks.  Check out the 1994 Crime Act, written by Joe Biden for Bill Clinton.  It has decimated black families.

Most people don't get why he did this. It wasn't to stop or delay the election it was a bluff to get the Democrats from delaying the election. Using an excuse that Covid19 is too bad so they can prop up Biden more or whatever. Trump and Trump voters can't wait to go vote.
Your bizarre attack on Joe Biden in the primaries could have damaged our chances to beat Trump. Based on this, it seems you are not disciplined or dedicated enough to be the VP pick.  You seem more like a selfish opportunist than a future potus.

It‚Äôs in trumps America but it‚Äôs not the America he wants it is Biden‚Äôs America tho those his followers!
I have seen two catergories of people..  I hate Trump (not endorsing Biden ) and those of us who love America and will vote for him again. No middle ground.
Black lives matter. Trans lives matter. Trump is a rapist and a racist. Vote for Biden. #BlackLivesMatter #TransLivesMatter #NobodyLikesTrump #Biden2020
SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN OF RAPE HAD A CREDIBLE CASE.  ALL OF CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OF POOR WOMEN &amp; LITTLE GIRLS. OBAMA &amp; BIDEN LEADERS OF METOO MOVEMENT, THEY DECLINED TARA'S CASE.  OBAMA ENDORSED BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Also you do realize these ppl rioting are Biden supporters üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ so how is it trumps America?
Biden molesting a random female.
Uh go back in every election ever they always talk trash on the other candidates üòÇüòÇ I can tell most Biden supporters are very young and   Have low IQ
I tend to agree. Leadership should come from the top down and Trump has not shown that. Unfortunately, Biden has been in politics a long time and hasn't been that man either, which takes me back to the wish (dare I say prayer) that another option will appear.
Because today is about John Lewis? Not Joe Biden,
I‚Äôm not actually sure anyone is on the Biden train lmao
‚ÄúWe are not aware of any evidence supporting the claims made by President Trump,‚Äù the National Assn. of Secretaries of State said in a statement.
Despite what they claim, Democrats have no desire to return to "norms." Their goals under a Biden presidency will be to impose the most far-reaching liberal policies in history. They will do it by sheer brute force with no regard for "norms."
A lot of us aren't considering Biden as settling but I get your point.
For Biden's allies, his closing argument to people of faith comes down to that: You can't reclaim the soul of a nation without first taking seriously the state of your own.
His suggestion came minutes after the Commerce Department announced that the nation‚Äôs GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced, fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30, the largest quarterly drop on record.
What a joke. We know you're a Trojan for Russia, now you want to project on Biden?  He's working with Americans, not a foreign country. He's far from radical left. You're just bluster.  Can't even organize a pandemic response when a 'pandemic for dummies' manual was there for you
So, Karen?  The Clintons are running this show.  They want Harris.  Jill Biden wants to be First Lady.
Note to Biden - select  as your running mate.
If Joe Biden was behind the story would be the obvious problems with mail in voting.
this is how man and a president speaks... fuck you! #Trump #Biden #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Democrats: provide Logical counter arguments to trumps ideas and potential policies.                  Trumpers: bUt bIdEn Is LoSiNg His bRaIn
‚ÄúLast year [Harris] attacked Biden during a presidential debate for working with segregationist lawmakers to oppose school busing in the 1970s, and her relationship with Biden‚Äôs wife Jill has been questioned ...‚Äù
Maybe you missed this debate, Karen.  Harris did not just ‚Äúmeet with Clinton‚Äù three years ago.  Go back and read the article.
Add in top of this Biden‚Äôs soft ban through taxation of firearms and ‚Äúhigh capacity magazines‚Äù why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can‚Äôt delay the election. This is all talk eck.
So that if Biden wins, he can fan the flames of his base to make it seem like he didn‚Äôt lose legitimately. This won‚Äôt change the results, but it will create a perfect reason why he can leave office while never admitting defeat. It‚Äôs Pride.
Biden, aka,‚Äùdaddy long hugs‚Äù... this guy is the ying to  yang... love it
That Trump is a racist, white supremist, etc are widely-used democrat talking points that I don‚Äôt subscribe to. I wonder if Carol Folt subscribes!? Would she come out and endorse Joe Biden for President? She seems to have a political bent and maybe wants to unburden herself.
Biden must be picking #Oprah for VP. She is Trump‚Äôs biggest enemy. #OprahWinfrey for VP!!!
A Biden supporter
What do you think his denial chances are if it‚Äôs a landslide for Biden? ü§ûüèª
Well Joe 'babble' Biden learned to lead from behind from Obama so now he can lead from behind in the basement.
If nobody voted. Biden would still get 60m+ votes....
I don't know Chris Wallace's bookers and don't work for the Biden campaign. I think what Trump advocates should worry about is his success/failure at communicating a message that isn't seen as weak/addled. Take me off the thread. Thanks.

He wasn't voting for Biden so he wasn't black.  Their racism has been exposed for a while.  Now they will say "He sought safety in the mindless ideology of the right, and he paid the ultimate price for it."
Even after Harris did her solid and withheld her endorsement of Joe Biden until Warren dropped out. Harris respects the sisterhood even if Warren doesn't.
Drinking Biden‚Äôs koolaid !
White electorate in SC grew 112% and went overwhelmingly for biden. Believe what you want about extremely obvious things
South Carolina was a majority white dem primary electorate for the first time in 50 years due to Republicans coming en masse to vote for biden. Personally I think it's great that we're listening to Republicans and pretending it's black voices being heard
This thread with all the people in the Trump Camp who claimed Biden was wrong and Trump would never.....
Clouded judgement all around for sure. The blind loyalty piece seems to be heavier on one side considering every dem will tell you Biden is a dumb fuck. With media maybe our perception is mostly what our friends share rather than actual outlets and friends share their bias
Once Biden is elected we need to teach Mr Putin a lesson he will not forget about meddling in other nations. We need to increase our NATO presence, engage in cyber warfare and put economic sanctions on Russia that will cripple Putin's hold on his enslaved people. Putin must go.
I‚Äôm also noticing a lot more desperation from demoratic socialists as well. Bashing Biden and the DNC while praising Trump...
Calling it now:  will be  VP pick. She‚Äôs the only one who can truly energize their base. Big Mike would then become President after they toss Biden aside and invoke the 25th Amendment. And then this country is officially toast.
So  how are you feeling today? Still think Biden owes an apology?
Make summer a slow news cycle again.   Just floating winning messages for Team Biden.
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke

The Morning Grind With Shay &amp; Shyne FULL SHOW 07.30.20  #HotTrendingTopic - Presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden announced he's picking a running partner next week. Do you have a favorite among the women who are considered front runners?
Joe Biden, April 23: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held."  President Trump, April 27: "I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that?"
Biden predicted in April that Trump would try to delay the election. April Response-Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh dismissed Biden's remarks Friday as "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Really now?
Y'all in denial that Biden is virtually on life support or what?
Let‚Äôs not forget, though, that Biden‚Äôs whole thing is ‚Äúgetting back to normal‚Äù.
This opinion piece didn't age well, now did it? #knownothingparty

isn‚Äôt a real candidate. He is a place holder they are hoping gets in by staying away from interviews and name recognition. The VP selection will be the president within months if Biden wins.
Yes, but Walter‚Äôs eyes look more alive than Biden‚Äôs. Sad that the Dems are using that dementia-ridden man like this. Even sadder that supposedly intelligent people are seriously campaigning and planning to vote for the pathetic shell.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden  via

Biden, another talking point to make.
Trump and Biden tied in Georgia: poll
UR sending kids to school, U can have an election, anything else is Dictatorship! Threatening an election proves (1) U can‚Äôt win this election on your own (just like the first). (2) U know Biden will win. (3) Putin is tired of UR crazy ass &amp; he‚Äôs out! (4)U were never gonna leave!
Biden called it.
And no I ain‚Äôt a fuckin Trump or Biden supporter, all these politicians Corrupt af
I‚Äôm glad he is protected. Everyone will be protected by Trump‚Äôs plan. Today everyone is not. Biden‚Äôs Medicare for all, and that is the plan to keep Bernie supporters on board, will not protect Rocky. Ask anyone in a country who has it.
GDP 33% reduction Donald. On your watch. Worst quarter in American history. God want Joe Biden to win. Biden 2020.
This would be a fairly alienating pick, so there‚Äôs a 100 percent chance Biden does it.
As President Donald Trump's poll numbers continue to decline among people of faith, the Biden campaign is hoping that the authenticity of Biden's personal story, and, in particular, his Catholic faith will offer a stark moral contrast to Trump.
It was good until they showed Biden and I remembered that's the DNC's real plan.
Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Here are the Vegas odds
DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP BIDEN LOCKED AWAY IN HIS BASEMENT SO THE VOTERS CAN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT BIDEN'S DECLINING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.  OBAMA'S PHYSICIAN SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.   RACIST, VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS AGAINST MINORITIES.
And no, of course that's not THE reason the market is doing well right now. Not that simple obviously. Just like saying if Biden wins, the market will crash. Same scare tactics used in every election.
Exactly. Biden supporters are now telling me that in addition to holding my nose and voting for his establishment plans, I just need to wait for his VP in four years. Then things will reallllly change.  ... I don't get it.
So do you think Kamala Harris will get off her knees infront of Willie Brown and get selected for Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 80 YEARS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES.  POLLS EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  CNBC POLL SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM OF TRUMP'S VOTERS  CREATES HEADLINES.  UNDER SAMPLING OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
Reading  much does Biden know about Epstein organization?Records reveal visitors like Obama so Biden had to know location.
Bernie Sanders proposal, which is where Biden is heading is a failed model. People die while their free healthcare is rationed out. I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong. The ACA has been a disaster for my business. Maybe your business faired better.
That‚Äôs a lie on both counts , Harris will drag Biden down with her CJ record She adds nothing to the ticket
This is just not accurate , she couldn‚Äôt run her own campaign well &amp; didn‚Äôt make one Primary   She will drag Biden , the only people that want her are people who blindly follow without Objectively reviewing her record
No Medicare4All no vote for Joe Biden!
Now playing at a theater near you, "Weekend at Biden's."
Nice meme dude, that'll show Trump for sure! Biden totally has my vote now. Radical, man!  Hey, we can be Biden Bros now!
I am spending time during the pandemic promoting Joe Biden. Trump is the biggest threat to America. Go vote. Elect Biden.
a lot of the people complaining about joe biden being the democratic nominee didn‚Äôt bother voting during the primaries but y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt ready for that conversation yet
I‚Äôve seen several tweets like this. Some even suggesting Kamala orchestrated her own attack to trap Biden into picking her. ü§¨Truly cannot comprehend that Kamala doesn‚Äôt need to engineer anything. Her creds stand on their own merit and they cannot stand it.
Silver Alert! #SleepyJoeBiden's mind is missing! Can anyone find it by Nov 2020? Biden can't do interviews without pre scripted questions and the answers on the his teleprompter for #SleepyJoeBiden to try and read.  Vote #GOP
That pretty much sums Biden up.
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins
Also, haven't seen a Biden sign ANYWHERE, anyone else?
Keisha Lance Bottoms is being floated as a possible VP pick for the Democrats. Imagine. Biden Bottoms 2020
Gosh. When did we last have a VP who wasn't ambitious? Pence has ambitions of a cozy life deep in trump's ass. Biden clearly had ambitions. Cheney was a fucking megalomaniac. Gore wanted to be POTUS. So did Quayle. Why, this almost sounds like racist/misogynistic bullshit.
I don't believe it. I feel like it's a ploy to bring Joe Biden poll numbers down. Don't fall for the okie-doke
Gotta be the actual campaign making them. Very disciplined with using all the right colors and fonts, grammar &amp; style is consistent, and seems like they have an encyclopedic library of non-public Biden images to choose from.
I disagree, i have a strong feeling (unfortunately) Trumps gonna get re-elected. Biden isn't a democratic favorite. People just aren't going to vote. But yes AOC is definitely a front runner. Definitely hope Biden wins tho.
This is like a bizzare movie sequal for Weekend at Bernie's. Sadly, old Dead Bernie looked more alive than Biden.
There's no rule that says Michelle Obama couldn't be Biden's running mate, if she wanted the gig but Barack can't do it because he's already served 2 terms as POTUS.
The Clintons anointed Harris in the Hamptons three years ago.  Jill Biden hates Harris.  Who do you think is calling the shots?
And no matter who he choses, vote Biden!
Joe Biden has a interview that you can clearly hear him acknowledging he wants to redirect law enforcement funds wich is another way of saying defund. The commercial is reality Dan Bongino plays the interview and the 911 call... you can trust Mark Levin too.
a libertarian preferring Biden to Trump has completely lost the plot
this is all about frowning on campaigning as a whole so Biden can be justified to stay hidden.
I‚Äôm luvin Biden‚Äôs campaign team right now bc they‚Äôre ostensibly advising him to ‚Äúlay low‚Äù and see just how far Trump can sink himself.üßêüëç

Feel the Bern can GFY and the rioters and looters seeking free masks can SMB.  If you need to know what SMB means, ask any Biden supporter.  They are very skilled at it.

Do you honestly believe that we will be able to push Biden to the left AFTER he gets our votes?
FFS Democrats are stupid and Kamala would make a much better president than Biden so yeah, as a very far left independent- this is exactly what I want.
Biden Gets Confused Again, Doesn't Know What Year it is: "In the 2020 Census, Which is Now Two Censuses Ago" (VIDEO)

I think the idea that Biden was ever going to pick Demmings, Bass, or Abrams is laughable
the ‚ÄúOK FINE, i will vote for joe biden‚Äù is killing me
uh leftists, or as you call them, communists literally hate biden. bernie and aoc supporters literally hate biden and are threatening to vote third party. biden is already quoted as saying nothing will fundamentally changed. he is ideologically closer to republicans than leftists
And passed the law that blacks are bad and need arrested back during the Clinton era, why do t you tell them that Biden has staked he didn‚Äôt want his children going to school with the apes? Why don‚Äôt you tell them why in major cities Planned parenthood is every couple block
His first day in office. Why don‚Äôt you explain why Bill Gates is pushing for the vaccine when he has murdered thousands in S Africa, mainly children with his vaccines. His has the mark of the Beast, to track anything and everything anyone does? Why don‚Äôt you tell them that Biden
When are you going to quit lieing to the people that back you. Go ahead and tell them that the 10% total income tax that Trump has been requesting over and over was declined by the Democrats. Tell them and show them that Biden (proven) keeps promising the take over the suburbs
Man you people are so BRAINWASHED. He pushed for income tax cuts and top to be 10%. Biden is pushing for tax increases. You really do need to get off of the lieing MSM. They are pushing New World Order. Read the book of Revelations in the Bible, it explains it all.
She actually DESERVES to be President, only less so than  . Biden campaign is in NO position to complain.

Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
Joe Biden is a fascist
Every single one of his speeches does nothing but tell us what Biden plans to do and how it won't work. He has NO platform for himself
It's good to read the article first:  "Biden led Trump overall, with support from 44 percent of voters compared to 40 percent who supported Trump" and that's because Biden is winning 21 percent of the group of roughly 6 million ‚Äúswing voters" who voted for Trump in 2016.
Maybe. I still think this narrative really helps Harris. If it pushes him to pick her, great for her. If she doesn't get picked, she can say it's because she was too ambitous for the Biden team, and that's not horrible for her...especially if she's eyeing 2024.
You trippin   This is about to be glorious üòÇ  Can't wait until KHive meltdown or Biden ally meltdown
Oh for sure. Just waiting to see how Biden is going to play this.
I remember eons ago thinking picking Biden was a good but small play.  I actually thought he just needed someone who was able to go on the attack because that was not really his thing.   Seems like a million years ago.
So transparent   Actually shocked Biden people care tbh
I understood why Obama felt the need to pick Biden as his VIP after Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúwell-spoken‚Äù comments in 08. He would have been perceived, within the party, as not playing nice. Because Black people ALWAYS have to forgive repentant white folks

Plot twist: they (the dnc) don't really give a fuck about beating Trump cus they all getting PAID because of his policies. A second term would mean more money.   The ONLY reason why Biden is looking great in polls is because Trump is so damn shitty.
Also ....Joe Biden is a super corporate Democrat. He is the superman of corporate democrats.....   That's why the DNC made sure to make him the democratic nominee.

i want to be clear: any VP Biden picks will be a black woman, &amp; they will use her as damage control to round up the black base and whitewash Biden‚Äôs record, even if they r a progressive (lol)  the democratic party have mastered tokens &amp; identity politics, but its coming 2 a head
Jim wants to make sure Google doesn't do anything to help Joe Biden.  I hope he'll apply that same logic to the companies that his  own campaign and the Trump campaign pay to help market and promote their campaigns.
if Biden picks Kamala, they will put her on a world tour, literally doing every single interview in place of biden and painting her as the face of the ticket.  and it will fail miserably. kamala brings no voters that biden doesn‚Äôt already attract. we know her record  dems r fools

Ready for some "fun" election predictions? I've got a barn burner theory going... 1.  wins 2020 2. Biden picks  as VP 3. Biden runs as a one term president 4. Harris runs for presidency in 2024 &amp; 2028; wins 5. Harris is first female president
2020 polls: Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden - CNNPolitics
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP FOUND AP-NORC POLL STATED TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE OVERALL, CHINA CORONAVIRUS, ECONOMY &amp; RACE.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE BIDEN CAN STAY IN HIS BASEMENT RUN OUT THE CLOCK THE PRESIDENCY IS THEIRS.
There's not a single substantive criticism of Trump that doesn't applies to Biden
You are so sad and scared and pathetic its not even funny. Its amazing your malignant narrassasism wont let you drop out and losing to Biden is going to kill your ego. I cant wait to watch your head explode November 3rd!
It's amazing to me that you have the ability to determine who people vote for without them having told you.  Sounds a whole lot like Biden's "you ain't black" mindset.
Democrats and Joe Biden refuses to support Medicare for All in a pandemic   Vote Blue No Matter Who is the privileged position because you know you will survive 8 years without healthcare
The kind of shortsighted, stupid decision that will be hard for Biden to unravel in six months...
After 20 minutes of Biden telling trump, to his face, that his dad was evil, and raised trump to be the racist, hate filled monster that he is, and trump will explode.  And that will hurt him with suburban white women (who put trump in office in the first place).
Please listen: At ANY debate, DO NOT waste time debating "policy" with idiot trump. Save that for commercials etc. Nothing Trump says means anything. 100% of debates should be Biden quoting Bolton's book, Mary Trump's book, Cohen's book... trigger trump. Talk about his dad.
The headline means it's Trump 60 Biden 20 (3-to-1) but they're not "Obama voters" they're "Obama voters who voted for Trump in 16" which means anything less than 100% shows he's losing voters. And 20% are still undecided. Terrible headline.
I can't stop thinking about how the current Biden situation reminds me of the episode Patterns of Force (Trek TOS)
And he promises to block all action in the senate if he keeps his job and Biden is elected. How the fuck is that him doing his job for his voters?
What if that leaked pre-write up from Politico wasn't unintentional? Sure mistakes happen but that's a fairly big error. Also look at the text. Why would Joe Biden want someone with experience as a prosecutor and debater? Are those all the qualifications for VP he requires?
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
Biden: I gonna blow out Trump!  Trump:
Nope.  Democrats can't afford to put Joe Biden out in public and allow him to answer questions.
I think the first lady needs to debate Jill Biden. This is the most despised woman at this position in history.
Biden is a problem for all
Looking forward to President Biden issuing blanket executive orders combating climate change, gun violence, and racial injustice.
Texas will go to Biden.
When Trump lies, Biden wins.
As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden‚Äôs America
Truth. Biden 2020
president Biden will send them back
Biden investment project funded Chinese company indicted for stealing US secrets: report | Conservative Institute
That would be awful to picture should Biden become president seeing that he has dementia and doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time.  Why do you all like violence and destruction  so much?
Well there's that. üòâ At least as VP she can take a role in directing the DOJ and getting it back on solid ground. And I don't think there's a person in America who thinks Biden completes 4 years.
They really showed how much power they have when they got absolutely obliterated by Biden.
These types (like Ryan Knight) piss me off to a degree that is hard to quantify. Biden is on the same page as him with probably 90% of things, and that 10% the critique is he doesn't go far enough. He'd rather help Trump, whom he disagrees with on 99% of things.
we know Biden and Pelosi are also Catholics and are pro-choice! Fake Christians!
Biden will pardon all of them and blame Trump for going after political opponents. We waited too late.
if Bernie ran with this and actually capitalized on Biden‚Äôs long career of horrid policy decisions and his special interests donors, he prolly would‚Äôve inched out a win  one of a handful of instances in which the campaign failed to capitalize on genuine opportunities, smh
Jill Biden will make a great first lady. Much better than the illegal one we have now.

Didn‚Äôt he close the boarders in January and Biden called him ‚ÄúXenophobic‚Äù for doing so? Get your facts straight!
imagine Biden/Kamala in the year 2020 in which the entire country is protesting against the police lmao
talks to Putin, U.S. to withdraw troops from Germany. So will the ballots in November say: Biden and Putin Puppet? Asking for our constitution?
This is the legacy of Kamala Harris. Yet they want us to be excited about her selection as VP?!? Plus with Biden's non specific proposals for people of color?... minorites?... he or rather his team just rolled out it seems like Harris is the perfect choice. Neither is for us.
now imagine if the Progressive caucus did this as a unified front  imagine the concessions you could get from the candidate  and yet, despite the easiest primary in decades, people attribute any sort of valid criticism towards Biden as helping Trump. a completely ineffectual body
Black ADOS must vote for the candidate who has the best programs &amp; policies that will directly benefit us. Neither has proposed any. Joe Biden has yet to answer for his career long attack on Black ADOS men. Top VP pick Kamala Harris hasn't answered for being anti Black ADOS kids.
This sounds right.  Convention starts Aug. 17, followed the week after by the Republican convention.  Biden should keep it quiet and make a surprise announcement at the convention.    Trump would hate being upstaged from a marketing and ratings perspective.
Not me. Biden 2020
As an informed citizen neither Joe Biden or Donald Trump has proposed anything that will be directly beneficial to me. I have no incentive to vote for either. But I'll will vote down ballot for the city and state candidates who represent policies that align with my values.
I would consider myself liberal leaning moderate politically but from Donnie's point of view I'm probably a part of the radical left.  Therefore he just endorsed Biden.
Why don't we question Trump's foreign policy? It is as much important as domestic issues. Makes no sense. Biden will destroy him in debates.
Biden Impromptu, with lists, earpiece and the Obama teleprompter
VOTE THE MOTHER FUCKER OUT. THE WORLD HATES YOU AND YOUR PIECE OF SHIT FAMILY. TRUMP IS DONE. TOAST. FUCK HIM. BIDEN 2020. MAKE IT HAPPEN. DAM THAT FELT GOOD.
Instead of repeatedly issuing carefully edited sound bites of Biden to make him look bad try issuing clips of Trump explaining what he will do if he wins a second term. It will be a slow day for you because Trump cannot articulate a single good reason to vote for him.
Biden has been talking tough on Russia past couple days.  What a joke.  He is the Obama Biden position.

Vote trump out, he's a crook. Biden 2020
And Biden hasn't done plenty of overtly fascist things that are well documented throughout his career?
Mr President, I wouldn't even worry about Portland or Seattle. You are not going to get their votes anyway. You don't need them for 4 more years. Just let them self-destruct and when Biden comes out of hiding, then we will see how HE is going to handle it! ü§î

Obama/Biden made fun of Romney worrying about Russia.   Why lie?  Biden is a clown.
Biden ain‚Äôt gonna make a difference
Really.  No one would be dead from the results of COVID-19?   Really?    Grow up.   Yes Trump sucks.  So does Biden.  Too bad we have to choose between the two biggest losers.    Pathetic.
4% behind Biden. My ass
Biden gets more endorsements.
Biden will be better, but a return to the complacency that supports a small,  comfortable, upper-middle class that works hard to avoid meaningfully helping others and works harder to convince themselves everyone else is fine is nothing to celebrate. It's what foments fascism.
There'd be no problem getting Biden elected if that were the case lol
Hey guys. Friendly reminder, Joe Biden is not the president of the United States. The orange one, Trump, is. This is under  administration.. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs confusing about that.
Joe Biden believes it's best that we don't wait for a study to tell us what they should do to truly help Black ADOS. Well if they actually did #FixHR40 their study should show this. White households have over $100 trillion in wealth compared to under $5 trillion for Black ADOS.
We don't have that now because our progressive leaders are cowards who don't want to piss off Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden   Hopefully the new, post Bernie progressive movement will fix this mistake
Barack Obama was a great politician (referring  to charisma) and he lost over 1000 seats   Imagine what will happen under broken brain Biden?   Red WAVE in 2022
Joe Biden released a piss poor plan for addressing racial inequity that doesn't include direct cash payments aka ADOS reparations because, according to a senior Biden campaign official, he thinks we don't know what's best for us.  via
The only problem with his theory with all due respect is there is zero chance Karens and liberals will protest Biden   They didn't Obama   So I don't know what people think will change?   Maybe conservatives help? Idk. But Rose Twitter protesting alone isn't enough
My thing is if Trump refuses to leave office, and the Republican party accepts that we have a MUCH bigger problem on our hands than just Trump and we have to deal with that ASAP  The problem isn't going to go away because Joe Biden wins
Since America is screwed anyway we need to find a way to win LONG TERM  The short term was lost on Super Tuesday and I mourned for my family and country then  Biden winning, imo, is worse for the progressive movement in the long term. Biden losing would destroy neoliberalism
I've been voting 3rd party since 2012 but I have to concede this year is different. If this was Biden vs Romney/Bush/McCain etc, I'd got 3rd party but Trump is actually so bad, I have to vote for the person most likely to beat him.
I  understand your concerns but I think we can survive 4 years of this as opposed to 8 or Biden or Harris   Kamala voted against a 10% military budget decrease  Why?  Because she plans to use it  And their administration will have bipartisan support and Media and Karen complicity
Rumor has it that Biden‚Äôs running mate will be Al Zimer, his invisible basement twin who he says has the same father but a different mother.
Joe Biden isn't running for president, his name is!
I personally think the only way Biden has a shot is if he put Obama as his V.P. with Americans it seems more comfortable to have the devil that you know.
I can‚Äôt wait to hear what the biden loving negroes have to say
As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden's America
Mass incarceration of several generations of black men for non-violent crimes ‚Äî as mandated in Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Act ‚Äî has not helped racial inequality.  In fact it has decimated black families for a quarter of a century.   800,000 Medicaid home healthcare jobs are not the cure
BIDEN lawn sign
And people say Biden is nuts, not all there. Well Trump world, your boy just took the cake. Well done. First prize.
I'll vote for Biden.
He's always critical of Biden, more than most in media.  Just doesn't think we can handle 4 more years of trump.
Once Biden is sworn in anyone remaining in the WH is a trespasser. The Secret Service will clear them out.
democrats : we directly contributed &amp; enabled the trump administration both before his tenure and after  me : damn that‚Äôs wild  democrats : if you don‚Äôt vote for us, it‚Äôs your fault if trump wins. just like last time.   me : damn that‚Äôs wild   democrats : i wish biden was a woman
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS RACIST.  THOUGHT OF BLACKS AS INFERIOR RACE.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  BIDEN WROTE CRIME BILL, RESULTED IN MASS INCARCERATION OF BLACKS.

BARR WAS EXCEPTIONAL DEMOCRATS ARE CRIMINALS, THEY ARE KILLING PEOPLE, DESTROYING BUSINESSES, PROPERTY, AND ARSON IN SOME CASES WITH PEOPLE IN THE BUILDINGS, TO GET BIDEN ELECTED.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IF JOE BIDEN CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK THE PRESIDENCY IS THEIR.
Karens are Biden‚Äôs base.
I hope it is because they sick of Democrats but might be because only 50 people will attend to listen to Biden and company
MORNING CONSULT SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRES VOTERS.  THEY WANT TO CREATE HEADLINES BY UNDER SAMPLING REPUBLICANS.  HILLARY CLINTON WAS THEIR FAVORITE IN 2016.  TRUMP WON.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE BIDEN CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK JUST FOOLING VOTERS.
I'll vote for Joe Biden but I don't have to like it
I was planning on sitting this election out but this pandemic has convinced me to vote for Biden. Joe still sucks ass but there are dead people who would be alive right now if Trump did even the bare minimum to coordinate a response which I think Joe will at least do

Are you arguing that there aren‚Äôt different level of stupidity? Biden has some dumb quotes, but he hasn‚Äôt encouraged people to inject Clorox as a remedy to Covid-19.
I feel like Joe Biden and the Democratic Party is SHOCKED at how easy it was to win over Bernie supporters  So they are trying to see how much they can get away with now  Testing the resolve of progressives. And once again they are pleasantly surprised that we are so easy to tame
Will Biden remember his choice?
Someone forgot to tell Joe Biden that he is supposed to pivot to full blown fascist AFTER he wins the elections and already progressives voted for him
TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE OVERALL. THE FAKE POLLS SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM  OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VOTERS. THEY ARE UNDER SAMPLING OF THE REPUBLICANS.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE JOE BIDEN CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK IN HIS BASEMENT.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
So they don't even back their own supposed candidate, they are all backing Biden. So the stimulus bill by GOP is attacking good decent Americans &amp; all of USA that Trump supposedly was protecting.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a mess‚Äô: Republican senators deride key proposals in GOP virus package   GOP, Republicans have lost lot of seat Biden is up in the polls, you are going to lose so don't pass any more bills. Good bye hate mongers. Now I know who you are, deadly enemies
Vote for environment protection, and those who protect the poor and older people, not rich gang stalkers &amp; hate mongers &amp; killers which is basically who these devils are. So I guess we must vote for Biden &amp; Democrats now. No other choice. At least they won't try to kill us all.
I have given you my money and my allegiance, for what it's worth. All I ask is the   doesn't write a column in November guaranteeing that my guy Biden is going to win in a landslide.

Everyone in the media should read this. You‚Äôre the reason Joe Biden is the democratic nominee and virtually no one is excited about it.
I‚Äôd like to see more representation as well, but we‚Äôre not going to see that happening under this regime. I don‚Äôt think  is perfect but he‚Äôs not a fascist or a wannabe dictator.
joe biden openly has dementia, as anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can tell. The best you can say about him is it probably isn't as bad as trump's
Gonna ride this wave all the way!! Riden with Biden 2020!
Y'all responding like he made this tweet himself üòÇ maybe "joe Biden's husband. Joe Biden" has been doing his tweets lately. Or maybe his "sister wife".
Biden is a joke
Can‚Äôt remember who but someone tweeteda video of the Portland protests and called it ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù when he‚Äôs not even the President. What do you call the video above?
If you really needed healthcare you was willing to fight Biden and the Democratic Party until election day and withhold your vote if neccessary   The progressive movement low key have no solidarity
Yes, VP Biden, I strongly agree! Voters living in KCMO, Blue Spring, Independence LSMO, contact Election Board to get application for mail-in ballot if you can‚Äôt come out to vote! KC Election Board is in Union Station 8168424820 ext 227 or the other MO residence call 8163254600!
I try my best not to voter shame, I really do   I'm just taken aback by progressives who folded to Biden 3-6 months before the election   WTF
And he and his lobotomized minions harp that Biden has mental issues?

"...some of the coverage appeared to denigrate Trump‚Äôs Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and does call to mind Russian efforts from 2016 to exacerbate race relations in America and drive corruption allegations against U.S. political figures."

Movie pitch: Biden wins, Trump barricaded in the White House; Nicholas Cage &amp; his team of historians race against time to find and blow up the ancient tunnels through which Trump‚Äôs KKK pals are smuggling him quarter pounders, large fries, vanilla shakes &amp; fresh iPhone batteries
Reasons Joe Biden is disqualified  Crime Bill Iraq War Vote Tara Reade  Supporting Trump on Venezuela Refuse to support M4A in a pandemic Tried to cut SS multiple times Supports the new Jim Crow Using his dead son to attack M4A Paid shill of credit card companies
So Twitter is desperately trying to end free spreech and THEY along with DEMOCRATS are the ones spreading lies and disinformation about Corona virus. They MUST keep you hiding in fear or they may not be successful in helping Joe Biden win. #NoCensorship
Jesus dude. I've made my position perfectly clear but you just live in an entirely invented reality all your own.  I don't want insider interests governing national politics. The moment Biden won, that became a foregone conclusion.
Biden set to announce VP pick next week, and I can't wait to find out that Warren lied and knifed Bernie at the Iowa debate for nothing.
BIDEN HAS RUN FOR PRES THREE TIMES &amp; TRUMP DID NOT RUN THE PREVIOUS TWO TIMES, SO WHY DID HE RUN THEN?  HE LOST TWO PRES CAMPAIGNS FOR HABITUAL LYING &amp; DECADES OF PLAGIARISM.  OBAMA'S PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.
No I'm not. Unelected insiders making the platform in direct opposition to the wishes of Dem voters on a whole host of issues including M4A IS REALITY.   Who the candidate is doesn't matter, especially so for Biden. He's a vessel for insider interests and always has been.
Ummmm, NO:  Joe Biden Says Women Need His Help to Succeed in America
its nonsense, VP Biden has wanted to be POTUS for decades.
She‚Äôs a smart woman and might be a good President some day but if she tries to sneak in over the body of Biden,  she‚Äôs just an opportunist.
Liberals shout "Black Lives Matters" and put it in their bio meanwhile supports a guy that did more harm to the black community than almost any US politician in the modern era  That would be one thing, but they arent even pushing Biden to adopt pro black policies  They are frauds
The problem is a dog is better than Biden too
Fox News will assuredly make a bogeyman out of anyone Biden chooses.
Given that Obama and Biden literally laid the framework for this kind of federal escalation, with tear gas, abductions, and insane panopticon tracking of protestors back during Ferguson and Standing Rock?
Like. You're out right now supporting BLM and the protests, right? Do you think anything about the federal response is going to change under a Biden administration? Given what he's literally said? Given how the insane police responses came in uniparty controlled blue cities?
Equal. Trump makes just as many verbal errors as Biden does.He struggles to walk upright, and I think we all know it isn‚Äôt bone spurs (another lie BTW), and struggles to hold a glass one handed and drink.
They‚Äôre both equal. I hope pinning your hopes on Trump having the upper hand in cognitive function wasn‚Äôt your only hope. If there were a formidable libertarian candidate who had a chance at winning neither would get my vote. But to answer directly, Trump and Biden are pretty
What you think about that particular scenario doesn't matter because it is divorced from reality.  Biden is a vessel for the preferences of insiders (consultants and lobbyists) who don't want single payer. They in fact DID make the platform against the will of majority of voters.
I watched Vice President Biden today and he was eloquent, attentive and answered questions with intelligence and leadership. He has a plan! He has organized thoughts! I will be proud to call him my president! #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
Biden and the Democrats not even pretending they support M4A and Legal Weed speaks volumes  Dems always OVER promise and back down from campaign promises  The fact that Biden can't even lie about those things, is proof he has no plans on doing the FEW decent stuff he proposed.
How big was Biden‚Äôs crowd size, sean?  Was it the biggest you‚Äôve ever seen? #liar #Biden2020
Excellent point. How are Marxists going to empower Big Brother and launch their omnipotent State if police forces across the nation are abolished? Or maybe #BLMmarxists and #AntifaDomesticTerrorists  will constitute the #Biden/Sanders/Squad militia army?
Except the voters did overwhelmingly favor single payer, despite voting for Biden in greater numbers.   The voters want it. It's the insiders who don't. Joe Biden personally doesn't probably care.
I can get behind a Biden/Harris ticket. Not so sure about anyone else.
If you need "a Biden moment" to justify saying things that are clearly reprehensible, then you should definitely not be president or in any position of authority.
Remember if Biden wins she becomes president and you know how well she was when she was a prosecutor
Biden might be president in 6 months. So... yes.
So should we be picturing that ‚Äúsunny‚Äù day in January 2025 because it ain‚Äôt going to happen for Biden in 2020. How old will Biden be then?

What ad are you talking about? I'm not familiar with the Trump ad where someone breaks into a senior citizen's home and murders them. To the extent it exists, I'd like to think that the ppl who could be persuaded to vote for Biden would find such an ad cartoonish and pathetic.

Either way I‚Äôm gonna be mad bc we really got the two evils. Still going for Biden bc Trump makes me wanna die
ANTIFA for Biden.
No, they said that even in strong Biden-voting districts, single payer healthcare was massively favored. They explicitly disprove your claims here.
Joe Biden is a racist.  People that vote for him are racists.
Personally, knowing I'll piss off cretins like that just solidifies my already made decision not to vote for the hateful wretch joe biden
Pay attention: August 1 announcement with a Biden quote.  Today is July 28.
A plurality of Dem primary voters, especially among Biden voters, don't vote on policy and are absolutely not aware of the policy differences between candidates.
Joe Biden can no longer remember what he had for lunch anymore
"Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted."  Uhh.  Arson is a crime, yes.  Does Biden also believe being an anarchist is a crime and can be prosecuted, now?
The problem is not just him but all member of the Senate Narcotics Caucus. like Joe Biden, Dianne Feinstein, Jeff Sessions, just to name a few. They have fully taken enough  "Donations" from lobbyist to ensure while in office they will never look at the data with a open mind.
I don't agree. I think a lot of people are deeply concerned with Biden's mental faculties among other things. He has a lot less locked up than the polls show, imho.
The irritating thing about all this talk about Biden's running mate is that everyone that is mentioned would be a more impressive candidate then him.  Most of them are Black women and I guess the Democrats don't want to risk losing the racist vote by putting a Black woman
We won't be safe until January. I have no doubt that Trump will do as much damage as possible between the election and Biden's inauguration.  Does anyone doubt that if an SC seat opened before Jan.  that Trump/McConnell will try to put a conservative on the bench?  Pray for RBG!
I think he didn‚Äôt want to run long messing up tv coverage of Biden jumping out of his basement for speech
This is what progressive Biden voters never explain.  Their long term plan  Alot of progressives don't realize you are NOT anti establishment if you blindly vote Democrat every 2 years

Biden is an idiot. Btw, that's not what happened. The Media has been lying about it, because they don't want to admit a Church was burned down, mere yards from the White House. Joe can't do two things at once.
More proof, Joe can't do two things at once. #GruberFools
Real Fact: Trump said he would enact Defense Production Act but didn‚Äôt until AFTER Biden pressed him multiple times. Trump says a lot of things that don‚Äôt actually happen until after he is forced to act.
POLLS SHOW BIDEN AHEAD, WRONG &amp; RIGGED.  THEY SUPPRESS  PRESIDENT'S VOTERS.  THEY CREATE HEADLINES, SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM OF TRUMP'S VOTERS.  THEY UNDERSAMPLE REPUBLICANS.  THEY DID THE SAME THING IN 2016, HE WON.  TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR MINORITIES.
Joe Biden Delivers Remarks on Combating Systemic Racism in U.S. Economy ...  via
The constitution says it's the only way.   As far as Biden winning, I doubt he'd support a UBI and I doubt there'd be support for even drafting the (very long and complex) legislation and getting it to a committee without it being a top priority of a sitting president.
I‚Äôll fix it: Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign will pick Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate next week.
I would much rather watch bar getting his ass handed to him. Biden's a lock. This is pointless to broadcast. #BarrHearing #BillBarr

He doesn't even know he's Joe Biden, and running for POTUS, not Senate.  #GruberLibs
Biden wants to put Gov. Money into repairing cracks in the sidewalks..... pitiful Joe.
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where the Marlins play.
Biden deserves to be elected if he makes the announcement then simply because the other guy *might* say that, but it would never happen and so after that date, we‚Äôd hear ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù followed shortly by ‚Äúin a few weeks,‚Äù and we‚Äôre tired of promises that really aren‚Äôt - aren‚Äôt we?
On top of that he uses no expression in his statements or answers, expression is a sign of comprehension. I don‚Äôt think Biden knows what the hell he is saying. #puppet

they had eight years to do anything and did not, and beyond that the roots of what happened can be traced beyond the bush years; intentional choices from the clinton era, and legislation written by literally joe biden in the mid 2000s with republicans, deserve the credit.
Republicans love to ask Black people what have Democrats done for Blacks.  Joe Biden tweeted about a proposal to help Black businesses and here's this fool.
And I don‚Äôt even understand what Biden is saying slurs words
Just to clarify, this IS Donald Trump's America. This is what he will be leaving Joe Biden Jan 21, 2021.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  NOW, IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  NO RALLIES. NO IN PERSON CAMPAIGNING.  AVOIDING CONSTANT GAFFES.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IF JOE BIDEN CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK &amp; THE PRESIDENCY IS THEIRS.
Live: Biden discusses 'Build Back Better' economic recovery plan  via    First he says John couldn‚Äôt talk but wanted to and in same breath says he says john said ??? Which is it Biden
If you go into those articles I believe you‚Äôll find that Biden was in hot water for voicing support for marriage equality ahead of others in the Obama administration‚Äîagain no prize being awarded for doing this in 2012.
Also Hillary had a decades long history of being demonized by the GOP, to such an extent that many who didn‚Äôt want to vote for Trump simply couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to vote for her.  Biden doesn‚Äôt really have that kind of baggage and Trump is hated a lot more than he was in 2016
Personally, I think an inanimate plank of knotty pine is both more qualified and more electable than Trump.  I‚Äôm no fan of Biden, and am sick of voting for the lesser of two evils, but he‚Äôs WAY the lesser.  AOC isn‚Äôt old enough to run, but when she does, gonna be a game changer.
RASHIDA TLAID PROGRESSIVE REFUSES TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN.   LATINOS ARE QUESTIONING  BIDEN'S SYSTEMATIC RACISM.  CENTRIST ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM GOING TO FAR LEFT.  SANDERS &amp; DELEGATES STATED BIDEN SHOULD SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL IF HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT.
He should point out examples. Show receipts. Bc I follow a lot of khive and I haven't seen anyone hoping Biden dies or becomes incapacitated. Closest I've seen is hoping he *voluntarily* decides not to run in 2024.
ah yes, how could i forget Bidens famous 1994 crime bill - shining example of the stellar legislation Biden was behind, &amp; just the type of bill he would continue to attach his name to throughout his tragic career üò¢ Feinstein is  the top of that list, give me a fucking break üòÇ
Joe 'babble' Biden.
I‚Äôm not suggesting Biden,or any national political figures in the last 40 yrs are trailblazers on LGBTQIA issues. 2012 Biden publically voiced support of marriage equality. No one gets aüèÖfor that, but when the VP made that statement in 2012,I can tell you it was monumental to me
Kansas City Missouri. This includes all of my family here so add two more from MO.  Add two from Kansas for Biden who won't be posting on Twitter. All are out doing political walking and literature dropping for Democrats running in a primary on August 4. We will all work to Nov.
Exactly. Wanting a VP who is ready Day One isn't wishing ill on Biden. I hope he has a long fulfilling life.   But no one knows the future. Better to be prepared for the worst and not need to.
Why Biden üò£ my dude Andrew yang was GONNA DO GREAT THINGS
maybe jill biden knows. I'm pretty sure joe biden doesn't know what he had for breakfast, much less who his proxy president will be
TRUMP IS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHINA COVIC-19.  BIDEN IS HIDING IN HIS BASEMENT COPYING OFF OF TRUMP.  OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES, POLLS EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.
we got to get biden in man.....we really do.
This election is not about Biden. It‚Äôs a referendum on Trump.
As she said, she wants Trump to lose. She doesn't want Biden to win. She just wants Trump to lose. She doesn't care for Biden. If Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or Paul Ryan was running against Trump she'd vote for them. But only because she despises Trump.
Tell that to HRC. If 99% of that 40% votes and only 69% of the 56% Biden support votes. Guess who wins? That doesn‚Äôt even include vote suppression measures enacted in many GOP controlled states.
is a disrespectful bias #Democrat. You just asked Barr if it's wrong to get help from a foriegn govt for a Presidential Campaign. That's exactly what Biden is doing. Through ActBlue foreign money is going to Democrats and BIDEN! Money Laundering is a crime!
Trump is definitely NOT the answer, he is the disease and Biden is the cure.
BIDEN ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES, &amp; POLLS EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IF BIDEN CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK &amp; NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR MISTAKES THE PRESIDENCY IS THEIRS.
Bernie Sanders co-chair: Voting for Joe Biden like eating 'half a bowl of s--t'  via
Love that baby!  He‚Äôs a BIDEN fan!
I am so happy for Tuesday‚Äôs primary here in the Midwest where I will go mark my paper ballot for BIDEN!  My brother-in- law is having trouble getting registered in Arkansas so I only have to cancel out my sisters vote!
We can not allow trumps attack on social security and Medicare. Biden 2020
You mean Biden, right
He is in hiding because he doesn‚Äôt know who Joe Biden is or why people calling him that.
Hell, I'd vote for Biden if he were dead.   I mean, look at me, I'm doing fine, mostly.
BIDEN HAS ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE AII DISCRIMINATING AGAINST MINORITIES.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS.  DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP BIDEN LOCKED AWAY IN HIS BASEMENT SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT BIDEN'S DECLINING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.
Trump would have to drop out for me to vote against Biden.
So, I take it that you are against busing? Then why do the Trumpsters criticize Biden for being against it?
Is anybody else just brimming with excitement over finding out Biden‚Äôs pick for VP? I don‚Äôt think I can wait much longer.
Joe Biden knows he can't win and the media and DEMS know it too.  They are so desperate
So, Joe 'babble' Biden gives the Chinese Communist Party a pass on attacking our Nation and the world with a biological WMD and killing 150,000 Americans. How pathetic is that?
Been seeing liberals beta testing the talking point that BLM unrest is being fueled by Russia and couldn't believe they would stoop that low  You know for a fact that the liberal class will use Russian meddling to discredit all social unrest under Biden
Read the tweet. Stop blindly firing. He‚Äôs taking Trump‚Äôs side and bashing Biden once again.
So you like Trump more than Biden just like your daddy?
Black Boomers sold out black people to the police state in the 1990s when they supported the crime bill  You would think that would be enough right?  They just had to screw us ONE LAST time by supporting Joe Biden who supports massive police budgets and the New Jim Crow
If the brutalization of the Standing Rock protesters happened under a Republican president there would have been massive outcries from liberals  This dynamic is exactly why I'm terrified of a Joe Biden administration
Biden is a great candidate and boy he‚Äôs got some smart policy folks. This is good stuff.
If Biden refuses to debate, it's over.
They‚Äôve both moved to the extreme edges. Kind of weeding out the crazies, we will hope, as the middles just hope it‚Äôs enough. But I don‚Äôt think any true moderate would, in good conscious, keep Trump in. He‚Äôs losing his shit more and more everyday. Joe Biden is not our answer. But
Joe Biden is a right wing extremist
Biden campaign tells staff to delete TikTok from their phones
Seriously I‚Äôd hate to see what you or Biden would do to our military budget.
I don't know much about Karen Bass but he could name literally ANYONE as his VP and I'd still vote for Joe Biden.  Better dead than RED Voting BLUE no matter who  #RememberInNovember
They elected biden over sanders what did you expect dude? If you still going either republican or Democrat than you clearly haven't paid attention in the last 80 years.
"To be honest", Trump is one of the very few who have not enriched himself by his office.   Can't say that about Biden, Obama, nor Clinton...
Biden "We need to expand healthcare coverage! Trump can't even throw a baseball"  Trump spends 2 weeks with stories about his professional pitcher days.
Biden "My proposal is for big business to pay more taxes and Trump can barely pass a dementia test."  Trump "Those last 5 questions are HARD, but here's a 45 minute story about me taking that test!"
Biden needs to have one completely petty, high-school level insult about Trump in every speech. Trump will go ballistic about that and campaign for weeks about how it's wrong.
Check with your county Democratic committee or buy online:
Oh my flipping Lord.  First not a Moderate second I doubt Joe can even color a coloring book.
If Biden is elected POTUS in 2020 he will be POTUS and Trump can cry crocodile tears all the way to Riker's Island
Does anyone remember the Democrats pushing the Republicans about Trump being to slow picking a VP?? What's Biden waiting for a Miracle???
Jfc. I'm over the Dems. I'll vote Biden to rid us of Trump, but that's it. These politicians need to start earning their votes.
Links from   Supreme Court decides limit of parishioners during Mass; Biden's Catholic faith; Latino voters and abortion; a Democratic tsunami in November?
Their spelling out all the corruption there in Ukraine with Joe Biden to come to their court system for testimony and everybody‚Äôs just ignoring the fact that Ukraine is really pretty irritated that they‚Äôve been set up by the Bidens.
Before your eyes. Additionally, he is trying to stay within constitutional responses because he can‚Äôt complain that they are being and doing illegal, if he just follows their same tactics. Which they try to do. WAtch OAN They are giving an entire series on Joe Biden and Ukraine
with  our team has polled over 1k questions over the last 2 years. many of the policies (or something similar) we polled are in the biden-sanders task force memo. we do a deep dive into our archives &amp; find voters support the recommendations.Why is BARR already saying he won‚Äôt prosecute Obama or Biden?
If Biden only wins the electoral votes, do you think he will accept the win? After all, the left wants to eliminate the Electoral College.
You are right. We need ICE officers that follow the guidelines President Biden gives them after he cleans house in January
Same way Biden is ahead of Trump; fake polls!
I mean, I‚Äôm still voting for him. Still better than Biden in my opinion lolü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
All of these need to be taken down. The top two are essential. If Moscow Mitch is still in office, Biden will have a more demanding task. No one should have to put up with a jerk like McConnell. #DitchMitch #votebiden #voteblue
Mr Biden,  WHAT is YOUR EFFECTIVE PLAN to STOP the SPREAD of this CHINESE CORONAVIRUS which  President Trump has ALREADY been doing, HE has been WEARING a MASK, HE has been SOCIALLY DISTANCING, HE is being TESTED EVERYDAY, as are MILLIONS of American Citizens = HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE
Wouldn't that stop all this BS dragging out lock downs! If he could delay it , they would have to change their strategy to cheat  and lie to get Biden elected üôÑ  #bidendementia
Trump has destroyed the checks. Restoring them has to be a Biden priority. He won't abuse them but the laws need to be clearer so it won't happen in the future. Trump should have been impeached. Majority leaders should not have so much power as Moscow Mitch used to save Trump.
We really need to ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE... This is why the left won't vote for Biden! We need to push him further Ieft!
I didn't think Dan Rather was still alive!  I guess we have to classify him in the generic Joe Biden classification.  Dementia is a terrible disease.
In the scenario where Biden wins the election, he would also still be under protection from the Secret Service at that point in time. So would the Secret Service be put up against its own team? Who has the authority in that situation?
Biden is just the Democratic puppet
Ok then, vote for Biden. He's your man!
Mom's for Biden? They want their children molested?
What about high risk people? I mean I‚Äôll be voting for Biden in person regardless. You should probably no show up. You‚Äôll see soon that the *impeached bunker bitch is going to try to get you to stay home. He wants it to look like it wasn‚Äôt a fair election when you don‚Äôt show up.
Why can‚Äôt Biden just laugh at him and move on? He can use the police and military against his supporters if they try anything, since they like type of thing that so much.
And so, you will now vote for Joe Biden who can't complete two sentences?
GOP members up fo re-election are signing their death warrants as elected officials. When the election is over if Biden wins if the US and UN don‚Äôt hold all members that did not impeach Trump, Pence, and Trump should be charged mass murder Nuremberg II. Then he shot 150000
Is there now? And before you scream ‚Äú2016‚Äù, you should know margin of error was in effect because polls were close at the end. Biden is up 20% in NJ. That is a deep blue state.
I‚Äôm not a young woman and NOTHING will stop me from voting on November 3. I‚Äôll stand in rain, snow, amid a pandemic surrounded by idiots without masks to vote for Biden.  Trump will do anything to steal this election.
So how many years joe Biden been in congress and hasn‚Äôt done anything!? That‚Äôs the changes that needs to happen
Joe Biden. He picks himself for VP.
So I guess yur for socialism which you will get if Biden gets elected
I want Trump gone. He‚Äôs been an embarrassment and has brought turmoil and hatred long enough. Biden will bring dignity back to the presidency.
Not to mention that Obama and Biden put together a pandemic response team and listened to medical experts. Trump dismantled the pandemic response team and ignores medical experts. #Biden2020
Warren would denounce all of them on this, so do they really support her? She will have a position in the Biden administration
The less I hear Biden talk, the more confident I am in his chances.
I am a shamed to say I‚Äôm an American citizen . The Democrats are so far left, they‚Äôve been after pres. Trump before he even got elected. If Biden wins I can see a civil war in the US.he will attack the second amendment an try to take our guns
Right people like joe Biden need to be out of congress time for change get these politicians in Congress for 30-60 out of there!
He exposed his allegiance in his summation of Mueller's report. Opening salvo of corruption. I hope he's the first one fired when Biden is voted in, then tried for his corruption. He stinks every bit as bad as trump.
I want to thank Jerry Nadler and the other democrats questioning Bill Barr for your assistance In ruining Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign.
Plus what will the 'Resistance' keyboard warriors on Twitter do if Biden wins? Maybe actually get a life outside social media
Yet another Trumper who doesn‚Äôt understand margin of error in polls in 2016. Polls were close in 2016, and margin of error was in play. Biden has double digit leads. Margin of error not in play in 2020
are you in the running as a VP pick for the Biden campaign?
No Democrat with a brain is voting for Biden to be President. They know if he's elected, within months he'll step down (for personal or health reasons) and the VP will govern.
Like Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reid? Is that what you're talking about?
To black Democrats. Watch Biden &amp; Hillary praise Robert Byrd of the KKK. The jokes on you
You have destroyed this country already. We need Biden to fix your mess
Didn't Biden mess up Chris's name the last time he interviewed him? LOL!
Yes, get rid of all R senators that are up for election. Can't trust them - remember how they blocked everything Obama tried to do? They will do the same in a Biden administration.   We need a D majority to fix what the R's f'ed up again.
Report: Photo of Hunter Biden With Accused Pedophile Has Resurfaced
I hope you realize that the 1619 Project and all the other bull shit you believe in won't matter if Biden is elected President.  None of us will matter, not even you.
Everyone follow Joe Biden please
Biden seeking someone to blow in his nostrils.
When they announce Biden the winner, everyone who voted for him should stop and toast him, and play a celebratory song, cranked up. What should it be? Seriously, everyone...GO.
You sure you want to make fun of verbal gaffes, President person man woman camera tv? Biden has a stutter,  which you seem to think equals mental deficiency. But no one‚Äôs buying it while Americans are dying by the 1000s from your botched response.
I expect many of you have seen this video. If you haven't, its worth it. Our system is bad broken and needs fixing. Let's get Biden into office but not let up on fixing the system that allows people like Trump and McConnell to prosper #voteblue #votebiden
It‚Äôs funny to think of Biden running on his record. The only thing he has apparently done is getting his family rich from backroom deals and extortion.
Good one ...Joe Biden is lucky if he knows where he actually is
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Guess who is now receiving daily intelligence reports? Joe Biden.
To be fair, Trump is only a year younger and sounds like he's going just as senile as Biden
I had this exact argument the other day. Coming from my own morals I am not choosing between two pedophiles. It is not my fault for one or the other getting put in, the rest of America failed you. And just because things will be different with Biden doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be better
As soon as we elect Joe Biden President we will
It makes no difference whether Trump or Biden win America is so fucked either way #EndThe2PartySystem #VoteThirdParty
There's two choices for November: build America or burn it. Trump vs Biden.
Democrats like Biden have had 47 years! What a fool you are! Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏ #CancelDemocrats
We could go tit for tat on racist shit Trump has said and done vs racist shit Biden has said and done, sweetie.
Wanna offend both the Left AND Right? Then retweet THIS Trump is Hitler and Biden is Stalin
After spending quality time with the President, can you really see yourself voting for Mr. Biden?
Biden and Bill Clinton
Proud? Selfless? Trump? Obviously you‚Äôre confusing him with someone else. Vice President Biden perhaps?
Biden ahead by 13 in Florida to be first one to check into a nursing home among politicians his age.....Starting to look cruel to let him run
The Democrats in Washington and the media don‚Äôt misunderstand what is happening, they are deliberately lying about it to forward their agenda. Nothing matters to them but a Biden win in November
He America get your rug at Walmart.  If your saying this won‚Äôt happen then vote for Biden and prove me wrong
I watched the Nabu video about Biden and Ukraine. In it is stated that the US Democrats have been calling the shots in the UKRAINE! Why isn't anyone talking about this?
I have  a gut feeling that  VP Biden will choose at least a Republican in his cabinet. I could not wait to see some signs of unity in our country after #Vote2020.  Then that will #MAGA .
Now comes the tweet, ‚ÄúDid you see how well I threw that baseball? Biden could never throw a baseball like that. Not in a million years. I had many MLB players call me and tell me they‚Äôve never seen anyone throw a baseball that good.‚Äù
Your anecdotal story doesn‚Äôt override literally all of the polls that show Biden ahead in every state. Including PA. And if you think people are flocking to vote for President man woman person camera tv, I have some beachfront property in Nebraska that may interest you
Trump and Biden
Tell you what- you lost this little debate and outed yourself as a racist. The sane people among us will cheer to watch Biden win and oust Trump. I bet you‚Äôll be crying, though
Michael Moore what a joke looked like Palin. Joy Reid asked 2 words who should Biden pick as VP? The no it all deer in the headlights mumbled no answer.
I‚Äôd like to see more interaction with the actual policy, what has changed, what is now required, and HAVE there been problems w/the Clinton/Obama era policies? That would be much more informative.  As for Trump, vote him out. It‚Äôs time. But Biden?? C‚Äômon, maaaaan. #politics #fail
How does it feel knowing that none of your pathetic attempts to smear Biden are going over like a lead balloon?
I'm all aboard the "anyone but him" train but the DNC certainly didn't do us any favors marching out Biden. I really hope his VP pick eases my nerves a bit. I would also like to see more candidates like Andrew Yang going forward. #sadyanggang
Margin of error in close races, as it was in 2016, matters more than it does in races with a double digit lead like Biden has. Or does basic math elude you just like reading comprehension?
He thinks it‚Äôs okay to specialize his own adult daughter. That‚Äôs creepy and disturbing. If you think that‚Äôs okay, I sincerely hope you don‚Äôt have daughters. You can‚Äôt attack Biden and defend Trump for the same thing. Own Trump‚Äôs creepy obsession with Ivanka, buddy.
Whataboutism is not a defense. Face facts- Trump‚Äôs actions towards his own daughter are creepy as fuck. You want to slander Biden, pick a way that doesn‚Äôt boomerang back to Dear Leader
I dislike Biden but I despise Trump so I‚Äôm gonna have to vote Biden. Bernie, how I miss you üò≠
In a perfect world, I would love to vote for third-party candidates, but until we live in that world, it is a choice between the lesser of two evils. I'm hardly a fan of Biden, but he would be miles better than the nightmare we're living through right now.
Please convince Biden to spend money there! It will guarantee trump victory
this is why Texas is not in play! No one goes in and votes for cornyn and Biden
I truly expect that state voting machines will be hacked by Republicans to eliminate Biden votes.  With Putin‚Äôs help, Trump and his smug Republicans will be employing every illegal, underhanded thing possible to rig or derail the November vote.  Count on it.
Bernie Sanders doesn‚Äôt agree with anyone. We don‚Äôt need to be reminded that he doesn‚Äôt agree with Biden on r things How about shut up help Biden get elected, or show the same tepid support you showed for Clinton. Stay out of the press, media is covering Trump don‚Äôt need U 2!
Hey Chris. I'm a Trump supporter--and I thought your interview with the President went well for both of you. I only hope you can get Biden to do an interview--but I doubt you will.
Listening to Obama &amp; Biden is like listening to the peaceful waves of the ocean. The feeling is that everything is going to be ok.
Folks, this Video is 6 seconds short of being 17 minutes but worth every minute of Your time, especially to those asking, What is Obama doing to help Joe Biden get Elected....
You let me know hoe much Biden campaign is spending and that will tell you if they think it‚Äôs competitive at all. They have zero ground game which is not factored into polls as well
What in the d*mn liberal dementia hell did Joe "Creepy" Biden just say???You can't understand how corporate corruption doesn't hamstring a party that's supposed to represent the interests of everyday working people? Just wait until 2022 when a spineless Biden loses his majority in Congress because they did nothing to rein in corporate malfeasance.
I love that you did this. The #DNCisCorrupt and needs to be pushed to reform itself. Biden should no honeymoon, so I propose we start pushing #AOC2024 starting November 4th. #NoHoneymoonForBiden
Biden may have dementia...but he didn‚Äôt comment about a pandemic in October for no reason...he knew what was coming...
Look at the dates...Biden and Wapo knew what was coming...
Yes, wouldn't be surprised if there were ulterior motives.  Harris would be formidable in 2024, assuming Biden picks her and they win.  But our country could do far, far worse - Harris is a pro
If I‚Äôm reading this correctly, if Biden announced today it would be second earliest since 1968, in relation to the convention.
Pretty sure the first thing Biden will do is fire all of the inspector generals, reach out to our enemies for support and try to push back the elections. Frightening!
I'm still thinking about how I saw a campaign yard sign for Biden this week. I wonder who lives in that house, and what the process of ordering that sign was like for them.
For the most disliked he outshined in 2016. Maybe his tweets are not liked, but this president has the stamina and keeping his promises. He is exposing the swamp.  This man is for the people!  Check everything he has done so far. Be careful of a cognitively impaired Biden
#WeWillVote I will vote for Joe Biden!
The very first thing the Biden Administration should do is to disband DHS and send all those agencies back to where they were pre-9/11.
Ok then, vote for Biden. He's your man!
I'm waiting for a proper answer. There just isn't one. There's no sense in this lesser evil shit anymore. The people didn't want Biden just like they didn't want Trump. DNC/GOP are the same.
Bahahahaaha clone a movement twist it to divide us. No one supports Biden. Be gone
And so, you will now vote for Joe Biden who can't complete two sentences?
what say you now hack?
I thought that was only supposed to happen in Biden‚Äôs America?!
While I think Biden is a shit candidate. I believe this video is pretty old. Like 2019 old. No one in the video has a mask on. If this was recorded in the last few months that would not be a think. Posting falseish info doesn‚Äôt help the cause.
This is the first time I feel acknowledged &amp; targeted as a Berniecrat. I'm just out here settling for Biden
Kinda like what Biden did.
And isn‚Äôt Biden a former VP.....who is now running........for...........president???? Folks say some goofy ass shit
Yes, Biden needs to stop saying that. He will need to string some of these things out over the entire first week.
Ohhh! So when you said Biden was going to destroy the suburbs, you were just projecting again? Man. Wish I could have seen that coming. When we finally get your tax returns, and you going to start calling Biden a tax evader and a money launderer?
Craazy.. she is about the most talented on Biden's list
My point is, i don‚Äôt think Beto helps Biden win Texas. If anything, he hurts his chances... I appreciate your Bernie reference though. Reminds me of why we have trump now, because the most corrupt modern day politician lost.
Biden just isn't strong or able to run this country as President. He really needs to retire this whole thing. I di find it sad to watch him even if he is  an asshole at times. He's not well.
Desperately trying to make Joe Biden a radical. Don't think it'll work.
Biden won‚Äôt endorse this position because democrats want to lose.
Really because the platform of Joe Biden was going to allow for no one to charge us more than what the other countries pay.
Joe Biden and Maxine Waters in the 60s
B#All Biden has to do is sit back and let tRump bury himself with his idiotic tweets‚Äî-he‚Äôs doing a damn good job of it.
i thought i heard biden accidentally slip Bass‚Äôs name today during his presser, but i could be wrong...
hate to sound like a democrat but any vote but for....b..biden is a vote for trump ü§¢
This all Biden fault...
You need a plan for 2024 and joe biden isnt cutting it cause they will run someone worse than trump
Bill Cosby serving drinks. Hillary Clinton updating my e-mail encryption. Michael Vick running a dog kennel. Joe Biden verbalizing a coherent thought.
Not surprised one bit   Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
I know that Trumpers like to ignore that there is a pandemic...but you guys. There is a pandemic that has killed 150k Americans. Hence the reason Biden isn't having a rally. The last time Trump had a rally how many people were infected? Secret service, Hermain Cane, Jrs gf.......
I have gained so much respect for you. I tweeted all who I thought had influence with the Biden Campaign.  I could not understand why your name wasn‚Äôt under VP consideration.  I believe they missed an opportunity.  Blessings!
They‚Äôre going to do anything they can to create a disaster that Joe Biden will be responsible for cleaning up (just like every other Dem President has has to do when they follow a Republican into office). Vote every single one of these monster Republicans out of office.
Joe Biden will NOT DEFUND THE POLICE!
Oh, is this the reason for his tweet for suburban women, warning us that Biden would destroy our communities?
Trump is the cancer. Biden is the chemo.  Not a perfect treatment but way better than letting this fascist thuggery continue.
Joe Biden and the Legacy of White Liberals Exploiting the Black Vote | Black Agenda Report
Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign is putting the following policies on display: universal pre-school, child care, and in-home health care funding. I haven‚Äôt read into the details yet, but at face value that seems pretty damn good
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
If Trump was doing a good job with Corona I would give him credit. I don‚Äôt want either Biden or Trump to be president they‚Äôre both garbage.
She never was leading by 9 points like Biden is. On election day she lead by 2 points which was the same percentage that she won the popular vote.
Biden has nothing and he‚Äôs still destroying in the polls. Therefore, it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership that‚Äôs denying him the easy victory
A lot of Bernie supporters don‚Äôt have a lot of extra money to donate to Biden even if for some stupid reason they fucking wanted to
Why the fuck would any of us donate to Biden? Is he strapped for cash? What does he need money for? Doesn‚Äôt he have a billion dollar check from Mike Bloomberg he can cash? Doesn‚Äôt he have Republican PAC money? Big Pharma? Am I missing something?
He did over 40 rallies 4 hillary üôÑThere are a ton of people that could be doing a lot more to make sure Biden is elected, including fucking Biden himself. Ppl wanna hate bernie yet expect him to do all the work?? ü•± he has endorsed and stated over &amp; over we gotta get trump out
You mean the Democratic party  them cages were put in use under Obama/Biden administration 2014
you‚Äôre gonna beat off biden? k dude whatever you want man
Hey  Help me make this go viral.  Joe Hiden Biden's boat parade!!
Biden isn‚Äôt just someone who misspeaks... he spearheaded mass incarceration &amp; destroyed our communities. I‚Äôm not sure why black people are expected to overlook that. Why not look at options like  ?? Oh that‚Äôs right because white people....  Blacks/Latinos = pawns
He doesn't care about race on any meaningful level. He was just dunking Biden.
There's two choices for November: build America or burn it. Trump vs Biden.
Matty is right. there's no reason to be paranoid about The Lincoln Project trying to exert influence over Biden. they dont support him because they want to influence him, but because he's already a pro-military, corporate right winger who will benefit them all
There is absolutely no evidence that Biden would do anything of the sort.  There is ample evidence that Trump is and will continue to.  Biden may not be your first choice, but 30 years in govt (including VP) and no use of paramilitary inside our borders to speak of.
Biden is a pedophile
He had the best economy in 50 years at 3.6 until the virus came along, social unrest by Democrats all to hurt Trump, it's going to back fire , you would have to be totally stupid to vote for Biden he's senile.
Biden is non-ideal, but only one of the two would ever sick their personal military on US citizens.  This implied parity between the two has to end; one is MUCH worse than the other... much like the 2 dominant political parties.
Socialism and empathy get put back in the penalty box for another 50 years if Biden wins.

At this point they are desperately trying to keep Biden looking viable to keep money coming in. Nobody will donate to a Biden that is down 10%(probably more?) in the polls. They are already getting creative with all the BLM donations being filtered to Biden via ActBlue.
At first I found Biden‚Äôs antics amusing, now it‚Äôs just sad. The Democrat party is engaging in elder abuse by making him continue this campaign. He‚Äôs not up for it.
I dislike Biden but I despise Trump so I‚Äôm gonna have to vote Biden. Bernie, how I miss you üò≠
Hey Chris. I'm a Trump supporter--and I thought your interview with the President went well for both of you. I only hope you can get Biden to do an interview--but I doubt you will.
It‚Äôs sad at this point. I like none of what he has stood for but I almost feel sorry for him, what the party and likely Mrs. Biden is doing to him is elder abuse. We normal per know he isn‚Äôt up for this.Re: Biden‚Äôs upcoming VP pick.  I don‚Äôt know what it says about me that I remember exactly where I was when I heard Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate, but do with that information what you will.
The sooner Biden announces his #BidensDreamTeam cabinet, the better!!
If Biden chooses Kamala as VP I will so dissapointed.

Thought of that POV, but a U.S. Rep with cultish beliefs just isn‚Äôt a story. If she‚Äôs potentially a Joe Biden heartbeat from the Presidency, it is.
Same can be said for Biden but he lost a daughter, a son and a spouse.
More favorites have lost games and contests by being over-confident. Votes are earned. So far Biden has not earned very many votes. Being better than Trump is not a policy. Biden has promised to veto #MedicareForAll  Why should I retweet his BS?
James and his wife donated to Biden and believe in climate change. You can deduce his motivation from those actions.
We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive.
Not so keen on Rice myself, but she and Biden have a good working relationship and she's strong on foreign policy. The downside - link to Benghazi.
Biden i swear to fucking god
Team Biden should stop looking for someone with "no baggage." Everyone has baggage. We want  Just pull the fvcking trigger already.
Did you see the video of Karen Bass as the opening of a Scientology "church?" Do you think she's done after that? Team Biden should get over the idea they're going to find someone better than Kamala.
i will take that challenge!  hey biden, steer clear of scientologists please
They float trial balloons to get reaction from the public. It‚Äôs part of the typical Dem process of testing things out. Soon enough, he‚Äôll pick one and people will rally behind him. Those not chosen will be dropped from the ongoing critical conversation and will support Biden.
I think that the main problem is that the primary Harris alternatives are mainly senior house members, many of whom are too old.  If Maxine waters was two decades younger I think she'd be the favorite (if Biden was going in with the idea of setting up a clean slate in 2024).
Biden hijacks the phrase ‚Äúhealthcare is a human right‚Äù (without meaning it, of course) and now the Republican operatives at The Lincoln Project are stealing this from progressives ü§£ Just kill me now, I‚Äôm ready
Why do you liked this tweet? I thought that U supported Biden.
You can't understand how corporate corruption doesn't hamstring a party that's supposed to represent the interests of everyday working people? Just wait until 2022 when a spineless Biden loses his majority in Congress because they did nothing to rein in corporate malfeasance.
Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are live now in their Grassroots Fundraiser! Love seeing him live and sounding so ON POINT!! HELL YES JOE! WE ARE WITH YOU!
I love that you did this. The #DNCisCorrupt and needs to be pushed to reform itself. Biden should no honeymoon, so I propose we start pushing #AOC2024 starting November 4th. #NoHoneymoonForBiden
&amp;they say this, 'any woman, but not THAT woman' mess now, but we all know that's a lie. If Karen Bass is picked, they magically won't like her, either. The Biden enemies can just stop the bull now.
Biden's people have done everything they can to make the Dem platform Wall Street and billionaire friendly. Nobody in the working class should give him a dime.
Twitter feed is filled with trending distractions like #Biden, #riots &amp; #Hydroxychloroquine. Yet, MSM is not sharing anything about how elites are about to be exposed for their perversions. Prosecute #GhislaineMaxwell and ALL involved.   #freethechildren
Ambassador, do you really think Biden should raid the Congress of its most capable leaders and important voices?
He's going to have his hands full at home. Rice is the perfect face for America to turn toward the world (though I'm equally for Kamala). What matters more is Biden's cabinet, which I hope he won't raid the Congress to fill. FEC Chair Stacey Abrams.

October Suprise?  Republicans are planning a mass attack against Biden using information from pro-Russian agents
I agree. Probably a better spot for her than VP. Biden already has plenty of foreign policy experience, so he doesn't need to balance his ticket with a heavy-duty foreign policy hand like Rice.
If you haven't seen all the pictures of Creepy Uncle Joe Biden sexually touching underage girls in public or making out with his granddaughter then I forgive you. If you have seen it then I'm forced to assume that you too are a pedophile.

I predict that, if Biden is elected, anti-Trump protests will disappear overnight. Magically.
So, an orchestrated pre-emptive strike? If so, it could indicate she's already the pick and Biden's associates are playing along.  Only a week or so and we should know.
Yes it really does! This is life in trump America. He‚Äôs brought us from the top to a 3rd world country. Our grocery store shelves are still empty of many items we always took for granted. Thanks for making America it‚Äôs worst. We will restore the greatness as soon as Biden leads!

We just got 50% in Rasmussen, and much higher in our internal polls. We are doing a new ad campaign on Sleepy Joe Biden that will be out on Monday. He has been brought even further LEFT than Crazy Bernie Sanders ever thought possible. By the way, Bernie‚Äôs people love me on Trade!
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSeniors for Biden Kickoff Meeting‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Don't disagree, but in polling those voters showed up as disaffected Republicans. Now, the undecideds lean liberal if anything. Not sure Biden's added a bunch of Bernie/green party non-voters yet, but has cut in big time to Trump's WWC gains in 2016. If anything, Biden's (1/2)
The old (very old) white men in Biden's inner circle who keep coming up with new ways to say she's uppity aren't reflecting well on the campaign.
I think that‚Äôs giving Biden too much credit...
A teenager in Tampa was arrested and charged Friday for his alleged involvement in a massive  hack earlier this month that took over the accounts of prominent users like Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Elon Musk and used them to promote a bitcoin scam. #CNN
That was rubbing worthy of a Joe Biden rub.
Kamala will surely have a position in the Biden administration, whether VP or not. Bet she won‚Äôt waste a minute pondering the disgraceful state of the Chris Dodd types.
First of all, 80+% of Bernie's voters will vote for Biden . Hillary got 75%, but four years of Trump has pushed it up.  Of the rest, over half are probably unreachable, and the young are unreliable at best. Targeting them may not be worth the effort, vs the suburban swing voters.
No actually it's about as lame as a Joe Biden Ad
Work with me to advance upholding human rights for Palestinians with the DNC and I will mobilize behind Biden. Give me something tangible to work with or please get out of my face. Nothing comes for free in life.
Never in history has someone pursuing the presidency spoke and appeared so seldom! Let alone the presumptive favorite. They hid FDR‚Äôs wheelchair from camera view but the man spoke and communicated around the clock. Problem for Biden, can‚Äôt simply pan away from someone‚Äôs dementia!
You know it‚Äôs funny that the same people asking me to stand behind Biden and mobilize within the Muslim and Palestinian community are the same people that leave me on read when I ask them if they‚Äôll help me advance human rights for Palestinians with the DNC.  How about noüëàüèΩ
Holy shit. A must read on a Biden VP candidate.
Just saw a Joe Biden ad here in Missouri! #Biden2020 üó≥üá∫üá∏
The Berners thinking they have the leverage to make demands will be disappointed, but I suspect many (I know a few personally) are looking for an excuse not to vote for the nominee just like last time. If it isn't the VP nominee, it'll be Biden's choice not to endorse M4A or GND.
I'm going to vote for Biden regardless of the running mate. I'm sure he'll make a good choice, whoever it is.
Biden may have dementia...but he didn‚Äôt comment about a pandemic in October for no reason...he knew what was coming...
Brie Brie and her ilk will continue to actively work against Biden regardless of who the running mate is.
the last sitting US President *not* to come from an Ivy League university was Ronald Reagan-  but more interestingly if Biden wins he will actually break this streak
Look at the dates...Biden and Wapo knew what was coming...
‚ÄúJoe Biden forgets he names Karen Bass‚Äù the headline should read
Hey everone praising Romney because he hates trump ... you like cuts to social security? Quit propping up Republicans, and their number one friend Joe Biden
Anything besides trump is a step in the right direction..people who think he‚Äôs no better in ANY way are just dense. Put Biden in office and we can pick out the policies we don‚Äôt like about him and gradually push things in the right direction.
Anybody that says well Is Biden any better.... I automatically get turned off and already knowing you not going to vote .... making excuses already . Your natural answer shoukd only be yeah I‚Äôm voting dumbass out .I don‚Äôt like bruh ass either but we still have racist shithead ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs not a paradox. The country is filled with different people; including many morons. Here‚Äôs a better question. How do DEMOCRATS go from nominating Obama, to Biden who is 1000% in serious mental decline and everyone knows it. Anyone but Bernie I guess.
Yes, wouldn't be surprised if there were ulterior motives.  Harris would be formidable in 2024, assuming Biden picks her and they win.  But our country could do far, far worse - Harris is a pro
She doesn‚Äôt have any lol everyone spends all of their energy going against the lesser of 2 evils until the worst one is our president. She can be woke all over Twitter 24/7 but at the end of the day we‚Äôre going to end up with trump bc Biden isn‚Äôt woke enough for us smh
If I‚Äôm reading this correctly, if Biden announced today it would be second earliest since 1968, in relation to the convention.
Obama didn‚Äôt select Biden until August 28th. Biden said he‚Äôll announce next week, so he‚Äôs actually ahead of schedule.
Pretty sure the first thing Biden will do is fire all of the inspector generals, reach out to our enemies for support and try to push back the elections. Frightening!
Biden's gonna win? You think so?
I'm still thinking about how I saw a campaign yard sign for Biden this week. I wonder who lives in that house, and what the process of ordering that sign was like for them.

Who could imagine that the new American hero would be an ex con home invader pulling a gun on a pregnant female and doing 7 years in state prison with 8 other felony arrests. Floyd was called by Biden "A great American life" GMAFB
For the most disliked he outshined in 2016. Maybe his tweets are not liked, but this president has the stamina and keeping his promises. He is exposing the swamp.  This man is for the people!  Check everything he has done so far. Be careful of a cognitively impaired Biden
Yes but if Biden is elected and the dems take congress we can all go to hell!
Remember, Joe Biden told his donors that "nothing will fundamentally change". Until politicians actually listen and work for the voters we will only get incremental changes which amount to bread crumbs.

tbf theres not a single biden supporter that could beat me up. but a mob is pretty terrifying ngl
Often overlooked that Floyd did 7 years in a Texas state prison for attacking a black pregnant woman, had 6 felony arrests and was a violent thug. Yet Joe Biden declared his life "noteworthy" and compared him to the late MLK in his impact on our society. What an unjust joke!
They created an Island called it:   Fantasy-Island  staring all your favorites From previous to present all members could be on the cover, and very soon! You can kill the Author but you forgot the evidence, Hum! Nancy-Schumer-Biden- Hillary- and your favorites too. Coming soon!
At this point, after Biden has adopted the most progressive platform in history, still opposing him on ideological grounds means you are actively working for Trump.
Biden is looking exclusively at women for his VP pick.  At the debates, will Pence require a chaperone onstage?
Hey Biden needs to get the memo. He said where did it go, it's a big Island?   LOL
There is so much more. There has to be! That's why he died in The Joint because there is. This could bring a lot of skeletons out of- The closet's--- This pic Priceless; Swingers free love at the top of the food chains. Biden &amp; Trump both are involved all politicians can't wait.
I just saw a clip of you saying how bizarre joe Biden was for saying that trump would try to delay the election. You were emphatic at how out of the realm this was. Curious as to wants your response is now.
Debates are gonna be a mess, lol. 45 is going to constantly interrupt and throw a temper tantrums when Biden says something negative about him. Think of 2 children trying to debate.

Why is Biden telling everyone you have no plan to solve this Pandemic. Could you call him and get to his remote frontal- lobe. Cognitively speaking, the only part that seems to be working is sexual behaviors. Emotional, Memory, Problem-Solving, Judgment have all took a left.
More than ready!! I‚Äôm also more than ready to see some arrests of the libs involved in all the crap they have been caught doing. Do you think that Biden‚Äòs clan plans on adding votes for him in November?

There never was a time under Obama and Biden's watch that 15,000 Americans died to a singular event let alone 150,000.  Swine flu 12,000 deaths. COVID 155,000 deaths and counting.  The  doesn't care about you.
And a certain number of sheep will vote for Biden, just to avoid the conflict...
Ok? I don't give a damn if you insult Biden. Go ahead.
Democrats were trying to impeach Trump back in December/January. So they were not talking about the coronavirus in Back then. But if you go back and look you can find where Trump stops travel from China.  Biden and a lot of other left wingers were calling him xenophobe for it.
Where the hell are you getting your info from??? We don‚Äôt support KKK. But regardless those people are Americans and they have a right to vote just like the Black Panthers. Do you see Republicans priding themselves on the support of the KKK? But does Joe Biden?

Remember when Obama won republicans said the dems were gonna take all the guns? Guess what? Didnt happen. A Biden win wont take cops off the streets, but maybe they will at least stop beating the shit out of innocent protesters and change how they police their citizens.
That‚Äôs for sure!  And let‚Äôs not forget about Biden.  He has a lot to deal with.
Could they be anticipating Biden win? and everything falling America going Bust? or what's your thoughts?
We will and it will be a landslide! Biden 2020!
That‚Äôs for sure.   I miss him so much. I can‚Äôt wait for Biden.  But you know Trump is not going to go away quietly.  We may have to put him in prison and he can learn about Law &amp; Order.
Biden has been a politician for 47 years and has done nothing but make things worse.  Get your facts straight before trying to talk about things you pretend to know about.
Joe Biden's America...

You‚Äôre blaming Biden for all the violence happening under Trump? Amazing.  Put some big boy pants on and take responsibility for the horrible Trump/Pence administration.
Yeah stop talking for Joe Biden.. whoever you are
Hillary abandoned the Rust Belt, a move by her campaign I‚Äôll forever question. Overconfidence in the Dem Party did her in too, as did her public perception. Biden, for the most part, is well-liked within the Dem Party too. All that I‚Äôm still scared.
I fear trump has no chance. Seems like Biden‚Äôs lead is almost insurmountable at this stage.
What Messanging strategy??? Biden bad? Because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen so far
Jon, The answer is obvious, Biden's not "greasey."
Yeah of course parents wish schools could open but Want their kids safe!  Big difference.  Trump has no plan, strategy to help anyone with anything Covid related, unemployment related, rights related, immigration related...got it.  Biden is our leader
I'd pick her over Biden any day.
Definately not a pro trump meme. I don‚Äôt have to support trump to not support Biden. Don‚Äôt get it twisted

I can‚Äôt wait to have a boring president again! Someone who just does the work, quietly and without constant scandal and drama. Trump calls him #SleepyJoe. That‚Äôs a compliment. We‚Äôll all sleep better when Joe Biden is President.
The very first thing the Biden Administration should do is to disband DHS and send all those agencies back to where they were pre-9/11.

Today, former President Obama eulogized John Lewis and pushed for Congress to pass a new Voting Rights Act in his honor. Joe Biden, the current Democratic Presidential nominee said the same.   Today, Donald Trump attacked voting rights and free and fair elections.   Choose.
So it‚Äôs over? Only question is how big Biden‚Äôs margins are and how many Dem senate seats there are?
And Biden thinks that the staffer is his nephew. Greets him warmly every time he enters the room.
I also happen to have secondhand knowledge that this is completely BS, and that a leading environmental lawyer with close ties to Biden advisers reached out to the campaign 3 or so months ago, and was completely rejected
Should Biden win, November to January is going to be stressful and perhaps terrifying   I hope we're all prepared for that
At the start of the year I would've said Trump, but after the whole pandemic debacle I can see Biden winning.
Thank you for being a leader in the midst of this s*** show currently in the White House. Thank you for your continued service. Forever my president but I‚Äôll share that title gladly between you and Biden! #BlueWaveComing
Biden?? I get not voting for Trump, but do you seriously think the Dems wouldn't try this if they thought they could get away with it? They already want to get rid of the EC.
Of course Biden is a fool and voters know that!
???? I can see not voting, but voting for Biden isn't an option.
Imagine thinking that replacing Donald Trump with Joe Biden is some variety of liberation? It‚Äôs changing out buffoonery for the more traditional method of calculated oppression. Catch 22.
You seem very afraid. Maybe you should stay inside and lock all of your doors for as long as possible. Do your best Joe Biden impersonation!
Or this is the theatrical number they‚Äôre putting on to bog down a Biden admin a la ‚Äò09? If the race was tighter or Trump was winning, the money spigot would be open. They did tax cuts and judges. Governing is hard. Time to go back to obstructing from the minority.
Tom, stay inside and be afraid! Be very afraid! and hope Joe Biden won‚Äôt have to do any debates too! CornPop!
The only message Biden needs to put out there now is: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm elected president, if for some reason I fuck things up irredeemably in my first four years, I will face the consequences of that and not threaten to illegally delay an election like a scared little bitch.‚Äù
China is responsible.Biden opposed shutting off China.Those with TDS conveniently forget that.
Any conservative that says Trump should be impeached just thinks Pence won't get blamed for the 150+k deaths and can beat unpopular Biden.
If by ‚Äúwe‚Äù you mean Biden and the American people, then I agree
I think Biden will be announced the winner before California, Arizona, Washington, Nevada, Oregon, New Mexico and Colorado close. Oh, those states and probably Texas too all go Biden.
Are you asking how many murderers broke the law? How many murderers committed murder? I don't think anyone has been killed in the name of antifa or anarchy or for biden

Instead of running from the reality that nobody really wanted Biden to begin with, they're trying to own it.
Didn‚Äôt Donald put his buddy to post master general to straighten them out but he is screwing with the people‚Äôs mail. Why wouldn‚Äôt he trust the voters with his buddy in charge to deliver the votes for him and delay the votes for Biden.and the post office workers voted for him
We waited for Bush fir months. We can wait for Biden too.
Absolutely. There are 3 paths forward - a national mask mandate with teeth, a real lockdown with consequences or we continue to see thousands die a day and hope to God Biden can get it controlled after he‚Äôs inaugurated in January.
Please stop quoting other people without their permission.  Biden hasn‚Äôt said anything about football.  You‚Äôre off your rocker!
I think they realize they're going to lose the senate now and won't be able to block Biden / dems so their useful idiot is no longer so useful and are looking to dump him asap to try and save it.
This is an hour full blown campaign speech. Biden should request equal time.
Was Biden was "unavailable" for this campaign event?
Vote for Biden!  And you still don't know who the vp will be hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah fuck vlad hahahahahahah
I'm waiting for a proper answer. There just isn't one. There's no sense in this lesser evil shit anymore. The people didn't want Biden just like they didn't want Trump. DNC/GOP are the same.
Yes! Long story but a guy me and my wife know lives on a street with one trump flag outside one house, all the other houses on the street have blm yard signs and 3 have Biden signs and the house directly across the street has a coexist flag, its awesome!
Biden is going to try to set up virtual debates with Trump. I give him a high probability of getting it done. Democrats are always leading and Republicans are sleays responding.
It's as if Biden and others in this country owe something to China.  I guess when they pay your son billions of dollars for nothing they eventually expect something in return.  Unheard of, right?
Florida is usually fast with results, and they get a ton of absentee ballots normally.  If Biden is looking like he's getting a win there, then we know its over.
By we, are you including yourself in the #Biden2020 landslide.  Glad to see you join Melania on the Biden Bonanza!

Like vote Biden into office.
The whole country was better off than four years ago until the coronavirus hit. Look at it economic data. Joe Biden was part of the slowest economic recovery since World War II. We don't need that again.
It also depends on inner city turnout amongst black voters, and weather those few wwc precints in north county swing back. Although I could def see something like Biden + 70 happening lol.
I live in MO-1. The margin with probably be Biden +50 or something crazy like that.
I actually think Biden might carry MO-2. That poll showing him only down single digits in MO has me thinking he must be leading there. Galloway was also very competitive statewide so we'll have to see.

It's not even a contest. It's undeniable that Biden has slowed down over the last few years, but he doesn't suggest "hitting the body" with bleach injections, and he doesn't endorse doctors who believe in aliens and demons.  There's no contest.
I checked both candidates websites and as far as policy proposals available to the public, Biden has far more and it's not even close.  And there's no reason that the pandemic should have been allowed to do this much damage in the first place. No other country was this bad.
Bahahahaaha clone a movement twist it to divide us. No one supports Biden. Be gone

Love Elizabeth for any leadership position. At the same time, Biden could pick anybody as VP and I will vote for him!
Sounds like a plan to embrace the inevitable future, rather than a dying past. #Biden
I don't think they will because it's not what has been pushed. The push has been change by intimidating force after the legit non-violent protesting tapered off. I think Trump will lose bc of GOP apathy &amp; those who voted Obama then Trump will vote Biden this time.
Both sides do that so I assume you don‚Äôt mind it from Biden and the DNC. But your children‚Äôs teachers and profs will feed them hate America propaganda and separate them from your beliefs. Don‚Äôt you trust them to decide for themselves?
Did Joe Biden not get invited to the Lewis funeral? Or is his health too compromised to expose him to a large gathering?
And so, you will now vote for Joe Biden who can't complete two sentences?
Who wants to vote in the General Election without even seeing a single debate between the candidates? That's kind of unamerican. I bet ol Biden won't debate the President once. Any takers?
Pretty sure President-Elect Biden is at Rep. Lewis‚Äô funeral with all the other actual presidents.

The majority of Trump‚Äôs offenses are based on the fact that most Presidents stuck closely to and followed basic norms for the office. There is no scenario in which he can manipulate election results or call them void. Especially if Biden wins in a landslide. So just fucking vote.
I thought that was only supposed to happen in Biden‚Äôs America?!
No I am not voting for Donald Trump Now give me a reason to vote for Joe Biden other than he is better than Trump. A vote against Trump is not a vote for Biden.
Hopefully, no.  I don't talk politics to my nephew, who's a couple hours away.  I prefer to think he's seen the light and is voting Biden.
If he ran as a democrat he would have been removed after impeachment.
won't delay the election cos he can't. But watching the #GOP call  insane in April for predicting this, and now having to eat bags of shit cos Biden was right, is genuinely satisfying. Not unusual--GOP is wrong about everything. But satisfying
Biden's only policy is that "nothing will fundamentally change" and he will veto "Medicare For All".  Everything else he claims to support is a lie unless it benefits his wealthy donors.

If Biden wants to lose, he should pick Susan Rice as his VP. She‚Äôs detested too much by the right. He‚Äôs run the risk of losing conservatives leaning towards him, but afraid of a 3rd Obama-ish admin. Of course it‚Äôs racism and misogyny. Kamala Harris is by far the better choice.
OK, to be honest, she says she wants to help Biden win, but won't endorse him.  She's playing word games. Why? Because the Bernie Bros don't want her to actually endorse? What's the point of this game?
All I know is when Biden resigns or the Dems impeach him, Hillary is gonna be PISSED that Kamala Harris got to be Pres and she did not.

I also think the platform matters. Biden/Democrats are now running an antiTrump platform, rather than one actually about policy. Trump meanwhile fulfilled many of his promises, and is still trying to run his administration. Hate for one man shouldn't win an election
You're pretending like I didn't link you an article with over 40 accomplishments of Biden's time in congress and as VP again.
For one thing, this relies on polls. In 2018, suburban women did vote, but Donald Trump wasn't on that ticket and Biden doesn't have as much enthusiasm. Biden ran on a promise to stay moderate, yet gave in to numerous radical policies. Now he's as extreme as any candidate.
I can‚Äôt even handle this level of ignorance...please help vote him out, Biden would never reverse policies that help miniorities living in poverty access affordable housing outside of city limits, this shit is EVIL &amp; exactly what we mean when talking about SYSTEMATIC INEQUALITY.
Trump is all of those things and worse. I mean Trump got sued by the  Nixon administration for his racist practices.   The Obama administration did a bunch of things for LGBTQ individuals and Biden was a part of that.  Trump has been credibly accused of sexual assault 25 times.
Your point of picking a better human over policies doesn‚Äôt fully register with me, but I can respect it. However Biden is unbelievably racist as well. He has used his office to threaten people &amp; get his son jobs/payouts. What makes him more qualified or deserving of office?

Not really. It's to support the president. Biden didn't spend 8 years campaigning, he spent his time as Obama's greatest ally. Not that I think there's actually much to worry about with Harris. I also think she'd make a good president!

Let them, mentally sound people have enough of a heads up to stay clear. It will give the rest of the country a great window into what a Biden win, defunded law enforcement, leftist/liberal/marxist world would look like. Install 10,000 cameras and make mass arrests in September.
Biden can't wait to find out who has already been chosen
She has Joe Biden disease
I feel very sure now that Biden is picking Harris. And I think she is probably the right choice.
You offer Trump, the person with dozens of sexual assault allegations and case settlements all the charity in the world, but assume that Biden, for whom there is ZERO evidence of him being a pedophile, is actually a secret child rapist.  You're not being objective.
I'm not a Biden supporter...but this isn't recent. Look at the winter coats. It's probably from before masks were a thing...still scary to see him led like that.
Do you not acknowledge the mental gymnastics you're performing here? You're saying that because Joe Biden has done some creepy things (that i dont deny), that makes him a child rapist.  But Trump who was *actually friends* with a child rapist, is just a "secret agent" ahahahahaha
Did you see Biden yesterday? He forgot where he was then said he was joking when he forgot

It's really cute how you make all of these implications of Biden being a pedophile with ZERO evidence to support such a thing, but you're totally okay with Trump posing in dozens of photos with Epstein and Maxwell. Why are you pretending that this is something you care about?
Desperately trying to make Joe Biden a radical. Don't think it'll work.
Do I like Trump? Not at all, but I would never vote for Biden. Your organization can‚Äôt even be bothered to respond to questions via email. It‚Äôs just a front to support Biden. What clowns
You don't have to remember something that's written down.  I'm not a Biden fan lol I plan to spend the next 4 years fighting him for the progress that I want to see, but that fight is winnable. Trump is never going to give us any progress and it's pointless to fight him for it.
Not under Trump; I agree. There's no reason Biden wouldn't. He's going to have both halves of congress and has an exhaustively detailed policy proposal on what he would do. Check it out:
Biden didn‚Äôt even know where he was yesterday. He literally didn‚Äôt know. And I‚Äôve seen polls that he‚Äôs winning 55 to 40. There is no way on earth that poll is correct.
Biden is simply a proxy for Soros and the Deep State. Biden takes his marching orders from Sharpton, Holder and Bernie Sanders.  No patriotic G-d fearing American will be able to live in a socialist state run by these immorals.
The difference is; she's just repeating a conclusion that she hasn't come to on her own.  I went out of my way to check both of their policies. Biden has a very detailed one, Trump has zilch. You can check for yourself lol I'm right.
They are convinced that a President Biden, like Obama,will throw them the lifeline so badly needed for their survival, their hold on power, and their ability to advance their nuclear and other imperialist plans around the globe.
Biden won‚Äôt endorse this position because democrats want to lose.

Are you sure. Joe Biden didnt even know where he was yesterday. Literally, he didn‚Äôt know where he was. It was kinda sad.
Biden is attacking Trump from the right &amp; calling for the wholesale persecution of anarchists. Also minimizing Trump's fascism &amp; favoring a narrow conception of "law and order" over ending systemic police violence &amp; racial capitalism. I understand what he meant: it's terrifying.
1. Biden/Harris win. 2. Warren becomes Senate MjLdr 3. Filibuster removed. 4. Fix the country
Biden's echoing Trump's framing to support the wholesale repression of anarchists AND uplifting a narrow conception of "law and order" over ending police violence and racial capitalism. Also attacking Trump from the right &amp; minimizing his fascism as merely a campaign/PR ploy.
You must be watching Creepy Joe Biden!!
Creative little genius. Very cool kicks to rock.
Trump's shortcomings make weak opponent Biden look strong
Really because the platform of Joe Biden was going to allow for no one to charge us more than what the other countries pay.
Is this the growing face of the DEM party? To destroy Israel and endorse one state only? That is what Rashida Tlaib supports and my guess is, she isn't the only one.
It meant Sanders got his ass handed to him by black people, who voted overwhelmingly for Biden.

No one is saying you can't vote by mail. There shouldn't be a federal mandate to hold elections by mail. Biden would tread on every right, every law, every institution to "rebuild" America into a globalist, elitist, communist nation. He's admitted to it, even wants to pack courts
Obama &amp; Biden are also trash. Read through the whole thread.
Biden can‚Äôt remember 7 minutes ago much less 7 months ago.

That was the Obama/Biden strategy for H1N1...they stopped testing &amp; media stopped that deadly virus...shhhhhh says the Liberal Democrat Media Party!!!
I‚Äôd honestly do anything to bring back Ross Perot back to life and have him as a third-party candidate at this point. His 1992 platform is literally more left-wing than both Trump and Biden COMBINED...
Did George H. W. Bush tell Reagan he was sorry for his "voodoo economics" line or Johnson apologize to JFK for trying to out him for Addisons Disease  - but Obama and BIden owe Susan Rice after throwing under the bus following Benghazi
Our best shot at ending mass incarceration is someone convincing Trump after the election that the libs would be so owned if he commuted the sentence of everyone in federal prison.  "It would unleash a crime wave upon the country! Biden would be a one-term president for sure!"

Yea. Trump says prosecute the antifa ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù Biden says prosecute the arsonist ‚Äúanarchists.‚Äù In their minds they are clearly talking the same thing and the same people here. Biden has been silent on Portland because he has nothing to offer that Trump hasn‚Äôt already.
Trump is going to win and this is why. Save this video for when Democrats blame anyone but the DNC and Biden.
Biden said anarchists and arsonists were bad though so he and Trump are basically the same.
We have to resist.  Vote. Help 5 other people vote. Talk to your friends and family who might be on the cusp.  Majority 54 podcast has ideas about what arguments connect with centrists/ lean right who voted for Trump but can be convinced to support Biden
I would still vote for her over Biden
I don‚Äôt know who the VP is going to be but people seem to be spending way too much time deliberating on an office whose power is expressly defined by the President they serve with. (Also, no matter what you believe Biden probably isn‚Äôt dying or losing his mental acuity.)
Well in less than 98 days when the Election is held &amp; BIDEN wins the Election, that IMBECILE William Barr's days are numbered after Biden is sworn into Office as the POTUS. Then we won't have to worry what f**ked up legal action he's taking or more likely NOT taking with Trump

Yeah Biden would totally do that because it happened to anarchists in America in (checks notes) THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. Just the most disingenuous strawman anyone could ever assemble. People pay this person to write about modern politics. Can the anarchists burn the blogs down?
Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic agenda
‚ÄúPeaceful protestors should be protected.‚Äù It‚Äôs right there in the statement. Just because Joe Biden (like the majority of Americans) doesn‚Äôt think of anarchy as some hip ideology all the cool kids on white socialist twitter are into doesn‚Äôt make your interpretation true.

The fact that you don't even know Trumps affect on incarceration rates and aren't bothered by what he's currently doing in several cities is proof that you don't actually give a damn about incarcerations.  So again; why are you pretending to care about incarcerations under Biden?
Hotline Josh only has one column and he writes it over and over and over....some variation of ‚ÄúWhy Biden will win 44 states and Republicans will lose every seat in the house and senate‚Äù

Anyway, all of this is avoidable bullshit if people stop willfully reinterpreting words to fit their perceived narrative. If you don‚Äôt do that, you can see that in the same statement Biden supports peaceful protestors.
More original ideas from Biden. üòÜ
Seriously sick of people on twitter (especially journalists) imagining every bit of language is in regards to an ideological debate about liberal democracy. Biden never said ‚Äúbeing an anarchist is illegal.‚Äù
There are some thoughts floating out there. Some more out there than others. You‚Äôve got the doodles that think they‚Äôre going to pull the 25th. You‚Äôve got ones clinging to Biden being 1 term. You‚Äôve got those thinking he just might die cuz he‚Äôs old or get COVID. Some just waiting.
Every single conservative comment is the same.  1. Make fun of Joe Biden's memory 2. Say the 50 years meme 3. Say he's actually losing even tho every single poll suggests the contrary  You're so unoriginal and it's obvious that you're just reciting what McEnany tells you.
And voting Green this year means they will die too. But we do have a chance to save the lives of Black and Brown people imprisoned in immigration detention or in camps along the US-Mexico border. Biden will end MPP and extend TPS. That will save lives. Real human beings.
The idea that Joe Biden has done absolutely nothing is just wrong, and not one anyone should agree with. It's just not true:
Sorry I forgot to link the article:
Sounds like a win for Biden
You have to consider those are the same people that think Joe Biden is mentally competent and still believe the ‚ÄúHands up don‚Äôt shoot‚Äù lie even after Eric Holder couldn‚Äôt find anything.

It won‚Äôt surprise me that she will be picked as VP candidate. But, I‚Äôll always remember that she didn‚Äôt give any support to Biden until after the California primary.

he has pages and pages of plans on his website what are you talking about?  do you really wanna start comparing records? are there any pictures of biden with jeff epstein?
all you're doing is proving how little you know about the subject matter and how unequipped for this conversation you are.  Biden *is* leading in every single recent poll, and the polling was correct in 2016. I can demonstrate as much if you actually care.

what a dumb point lol  it's not like I chose to make our choices Trump or Biden.   It's pretty simple. One has plans, one doesn't. I'm going with the guy who at least bothers to pretend to have a plan.

Biden is a corrupt disaster; Even his sentences are corrupt to the point that they make no sense.  President Trump had a good run and I supported him for quite awhile, but he just can't get it done...just too much arguing between him and the false media and others alike.
Chris Wallace is as childish &amp; immature as Chris Cuomo &amp; Brian Stelter. Unless u identify as  Chris is as dumb as Biden minus the stuttering.

You sure you want to make fun of verbal gaffes, President person man woman camera tv? Biden has a stutter,  which you seem to think equals mental deficiency. But no one‚Äôs buying it while Americans are dying by the 1000s from your botched response.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Pollak: If Joe Biden Wins, There Will Be More Riots, Not Fewer  South Africans took the wrong lesson. Left-wing ideologues believed it was violence that had forced the end of the
Pollak: If Joe Biden Wins, There Will Be More Riots, Not Fewer  Apartheid regime. Partly as a result, violence is a permanent feature of South Africa today, in petty crime and in politics.
Pollak: If Joe Biden Wins, There Will Be More Riots, Not Fewer  The opposite is true: if the left can achieve their political goals through the use of violence, they will do so again.
Pollak: If Joe Biden Wins, There Will Be More Riots, Not Fewer  The United States is¬†not, contrary to what Biden told the nation on Independence Day, a systemically racist country.

Trump and Biden
Tell you what- you lost this little debate and outed yourself as a racist. The sane people among us will cheer to watch Biden win and oust Trump. I bet you‚Äôll be crying, though
I‚Äôd like to see more interaction with the actual policy, what has changed, what is now required, and HAVE there been problems w/the Clinton/Obama era policies? That would be much more informative.  As for Trump, vote him out. It‚Äôs time. But Biden?? C‚Äômon, maaaaan. #politics #fail
How does it feel knowing that none of your pathetic attempts to smear Biden are going over like a lead balloon?
Margin of error in close races, as it was in 2016, matters more than it does in races with a double digit lead like Biden has. Or does basic math elude you just like reading comprehension?
He thinks it‚Äôs okay to specialize his own adult daughter. That‚Äôs creepy and disturbing. If you think that‚Äôs okay, I sincerely hope you don‚Äôt have daughters. You can‚Äôt attack Biden and defend Trump for the same thing. Own Trump‚Äôs creepy obsession with Ivanka, buddy.
Whataboutism is not a defense. Face facts- Trump‚Äôs actions towards his own daughter are creepy as fuck. You want to slander Biden, pick a way that doesn‚Äôt boomerang back to Dear Leader

In a perfect world, I would love to vote for third-party candidates, but until we live in that world, it is a choice between the lesser of two evils. I'm hardly a fan of Biden, but he would be miles better than the nightmare we're living through right now.
Please convince Biden to spend money there! It will guarantee trump victory
this is why Texas is not in play! No one goes in and votes for cornyn and Biden
Biden has apparently forgotten about that time FDR imprisoned thousands of American citizens without trial due to their ancestry.  Not to mention all the Presidents that literally owned slaves.  But insensitive orange man is worse somehow?
I truly expect that state voting machines will be hacked by Republicans to eliminate Biden votes.  With Putin‚Äôs help, Trump and his smug Republicans will be employing every illegal, underhanded thing possible to rig or derail the November vote.  Count on it.
Listening to Obama &amp; Biden is like listening to the peaceful waves of the ocean. The feeling is that everything is going to be ok.
Folks, this Video is 6 seconds short of being 17 minutes but worth every minute of Your time, especially to those asking, What is Obama doing to help Joe Biden get Elected....

This seems right. If Biden doesn't win this election, it won't be because of his VP choice, so why not pick the one whose proven herself capable of vision ~and~ execution? Pile on her name recognition and fervent fan base I don't see the down side.
Biden is pretty orange himself...
Where‚Äôs Biden plan?
It is the 11th anniversary of the "beer summit" between then President Obama, Prof. Gates, Officer Crowley, and VP Biden. It is also the 11th anniversary of Obama losing white American voters over claims that the police disproportionately target Black and Lantinx men. 1/15
Yes, I did it this morning watching a commercial of him with Biden.
Well, regardless of our racial background we still have to make the right choice on November 3rd.  I just think that the crowd of people ready to jump ship from team Biden if he doesn‚Äôt make the perfect VP choice is loud &amp; cranky but miniscule.
Ask Joe Biden.. you may have to ask him Over and Over and over..
Nothing too complicated: Trump, Biden, President, Republicans, Democrats, GOP, etc....

I think Ryan is right: no one in Biden‚Äôs sphere cares two cents about working folks. Sure Biden seems like a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù guy compared with a monster. I remind everyone that Obama, that Clinton didn‚Äôt create the DNC.  If we have to tear it down, then where‚Äôs the harm.

People on here saying that Trump is worse than Biden obviously don't know what a good president looks like. Biden has done way scummier shit than Trump being racist, sexist, etc. Besides, Trump took the fight to ISIS, and the DPRK, and made Iran sit down, when they threatened war
Actively working against putting strong, ambitious women in positions of power.
"She'll only focus on becoming president if she becomes VP?" I thought Biden himself said at some point that this is a one-term deal. I'm really not a fan of Harris, but isn't planning to be the president, like, the thing vice presidents are supposed to do?
The Democrats say releasing the Durham report before the election will interfere in the election. But isn‚Äôt not releasing the report interference as well to keep the American people from knowing the involvement of the Obama/Biden Administration in FBI/DOJ corruption?

If Biden named Marianne as his runningmate I would actually vote for him, but given recent events it‚Äôs safe to say party leadership would consider her compassion and willingness to engage with our greatest failures as a society deficiencies rather than obvious strengths üò£
There are always some sort of mental gymnastics around it. 2016 was Supreme Court picks. Now it‚Äôs probably Biden = the Left = socialism = we don‚Äôt want to end up like Venezuela, do we?
SAME. Different reasons üòã (you know my parents, they're pretty chill), but still - I feel for you when I see some of these tweets. It seems you have a deadly serious mission here, which is to get two more TX votes for Biden. Think you can do it?
That's exactly what President Biden will do!
It doesn't matter what comes out about  I will still be voting against Trumpty Dumpty and for Biden!
He wont until October when Durham comes out with his fake dirt on Biden and it doesn't work.. hahahahaha!
Barr wont commit to NOT releasing the Durham report. Too funny, it's like they really think it's going to stop us from voting for Biden.
What's funny is you think the upcoming Durham report will influence us not to vote Biden Bahahahaha!!!
Biden just said that during the Obama Administration they used local police to protect Federal Buildings. Guess Biden isn‚Äôt aware that Portland and Wheeler won‚Äôt do that.
And Biden has a vaccine he‚Äôs been hiding from us?
I wonder if Biden is watching and thinks that will work in a debate with Trump?
Glad to see Dems already working as if Biden was President!

look at his profile.  it says "Ridin' w/Biden, #MasksNow" there are logical minds &amp; then there is emotional thinking.  i am finding that many Dems  are emotional thinkers.
welp, this aged poorly considered she endorsed biden. wtf made u think she was gonna run third party. she said she wouldn‚Äôt SOOOO many times.
Kerth Barker (author of "Cannibalism, Blood-Drinking &amp; High Adept Satanism") says that Biden and others are blood- drinking (adrenochrome) addicts who have lost their fix.  Kerth used to work in a rehab program for blood-drinking addicts.  He still shudders to think of it.

According to the polls.....110% of Independents are voting for Biden.....
Book it.....there WILL be no debates...... The Democrats will think there chances of Biden winning is greater with a media covering up for his not appearing in one rather than America seeing him in ‚Äòaction‚Äô against Trump.

What happened to  stumping for Biden?! We always thought of him as a Patriot? Not a shill!!
If Biden doesn't hold the debate incident against Harris, why should the rest of us hold it against her. Also, it would be fun to see Kamala wipe up the floor with Pence or Haley in a VP debate.
50/50 the Democrats roll the dice and avoid the debates thinking they have a better shot to win that way rather than Biden be exposed 3 times on a debate stage.

she has said that there is nothing wrong with voting for biden cause she believes his policies are better. in her video for how bernie bros can cope with losing, she linked a video as to y u should vote for biden. also, look at her political compas. she‚Äôs very left wing.

This is a completely subjective, spidey sense but I think Biden his going to win very big because people seem to want a return to basic decency.  They are sick of virulence.
#nodebates Biden shouldn't dignify the same stage with that disgusting moron.

I think Harris is personally my top choice, but I'd be very happy with Warren. I think both would do well in the job and could step up to the presidency if needed. I also think there are several other excellent people being considered. Eager to see who Biden selects.
Biden should just say he'll be happy to debate any political opponent who isn't a mentally ill, compulsive liar and sexual predator.  Never wrestle with a pig. You just get dirty and the pig enjoys it
He'll pull the trigger just in time...or he's leveraging a role in the Biden admin?
i literally sourced 2 studies showing that black people still face heavy discrimination in JUST ONE of the institutions i listed. reagan's war on drugs and biden's crime bill are from the past 40 years, and have had DETRIMENTAL impacts on african-americans in the u.s
absolutely false. while no one is surviving who was outright enslaved, the impacts of having no family wealth, jim crow laws, the war on drugs, joe biden's crime bill, segregation, redlining, and many more racist systems have kept blacks poor and disenfranchised for centuries.

If Biden wins, and the Democrats keep the House and take the Senate within 2 years this is what will happen: Amnesty for 25 million illegal aliens. Then citizenship for them within 2 years to solidify their voter base insuring a one party system. A Republican would never win

Uh Obama has been with Biden for a very long time....nice try bucko
Hey 232 follower liberal troll......people don‚Äôt have 95,000 followers only tagging 1/3 of that by being stupid. Sara‚Äôs just making the point we all see. Biden‚Äôs cognitive ability is suspect. If it wasn‚Äôt, his handlers would let him do real interviews.
I guess everyone in #ImVoting4BidenBecause just forgot the substantial and credible allegations of sexual assault against Biden based on how they're talking about what a "great man" he is. I don't mind if you vote for him simply to get Trump out of office, but don't lie.

Biden‚Äôs downfall is the debates. If he dodges them he‚Äôs toast. If he engages Trump, he‚Äôs toast.
Are you THAT clueless to actually believe that? Remember.....there are Democrats that think Biden doesn‚Äôt have cognitive issues! I know a local contractor, a painter, that out of 28 employees, only 13 came back when called. Reason? ‚ÄòI make more $ on unemployment.‚Äô

2/ will be a productive member of society.     You are correct Trump is an idiot and is dangerous as our president.  We have to work to elect Joe Biden because we cannot be sure that Trump will not manipulate the vote as he did in 2016.
No Democrat with a brain is voting for Biden to be President. They know if he's elected, within months he'll step down (for personal or health reasons) and the VP will govern.

Great political plan.   Trump keeps nuking his own campaign.   Why would Biden take a chance of actually influencing voters, with his lack of mental acuity.  Trump better wake up soon, he is bleeding voters.  If Biden won‚Äôt compete, Trump needs to find a new foil, and quickly.
It‚Äôll all change once Biden‚Äôs running mate is announced.

On his promise to her now.  It makes sense that Biden has claimed that his VP candidate would be a woman, but to announce Hilary as the VP now would derail the process.  By waiting until the convention, it would be too late to make a change in the ticket and
I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory (it does to me also). But, what if:   George Soros has manipulated the virus panic and the riots to get Biden elected only to have him step down for his VP to assume the office.   The VP?
Margin of error in close races, as it was in 2016, matters more than it does in races with a double digit lead like Biden has. Or does basic math elude you just like reading comprehension?

I hate Biden, but I hate Trump‚Äôs reign of terror more
It‚Äôs not like Bernie or the Green Party and all aren‚Äôt significantly better than Biden and Trump, but it‚Äôs taking more votes away from Biden and essentially just handing them to Trump. Exactly what happened at the last election 4 years ago.
And unfortunately I think we are going to end up with 4 more years of Obama if Biden wins. I really believe Biden is gonna pick barrack or Michelle as his running mate.
Only way Joe Biden is gonna win in November is if he picks Barack or Michelle Obama as his running mate. I honestly think either one of those is a strong possibility.

If Biden is the law and order candidate, then my name is Hezekiah 'jumpin' Jehosaphat.  His crime bill caused generations worth of socioeconomic damage to the black community, unapologetically. Both he and Trump would or will functionally change nothing, thus the problem proceeds
Ok, so you're gonna ignore the full context? He said he legitimately believes Joe Biden is unwell, and he thinks the guy is being taken advantage of. Its weird you think voters should toe the line instead of political establishments running better candidates.
With Biden's age, one would have to assume he will be a one-term Pres. So, the VP choice should be his best choice to run in 2024. Harris, maybe. Warren, maybe. Duckworth? Rice? There are several who might fit the bill. Who knows? It's his choice.

Joe Biden should pick wounded warrior Tammy Duckworth for VP.  She is tough, resilient and would be ready to roll day one.  She has already proved her worth on the battlefield and Congress!!#TedSpeaksTheTruth
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden  via
No Medicare4All no vote for Joe Biden!
Keisha Lance Bottoms is being floated as a possible VP pick for the Democrats. Imagine. Biden Bottoms 2020
If you call Biden a thief what do you call Trump? Mitch McConnell? Rudy Giuliani? Lindsey Graham? üí©ü§°üí©ü§°üí©ü§°üí©ü§°üí©ü§°üí©ü§°üí©ü§°
It‚Äôs time for her to retire she‚Äôs trying to hold off retiring to make sure that if Biden wins she can retire after he wins, right? She has no plans to retire or die as long as Trump is president and that‚Äôs a big concern.
He‚Äôs not very nice, is he. Anyone who thinks this disease would magically go away if Biden was elected is crazy
No Medicare4All no vote for Biden!
You are so sad and scared and pathetic its not even funny. Its amazing your malignant narrassasism wont let you drop out and losing to Biden is going to kill your ego. I cant wait to watch your head explode November 3rd!
It's amazing to me that you have the ability to determine who people vote for without them having told you.  Sounds a whole lot like Biden's "you ain't black" mindset.
Nope.  Democrats can't afford to put Joe Biden out in public and allow him to answer questions.
Biden is a problem for all
That would be awful to picture should Biden become president seeing that he has dementia and doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time.  Why do you all like violence and destruction  so much?
Hey guys. Friendly reminder, Joe Biden is not the president of the United States. The orange one, Trump, is. This is under  administration.. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs confusing about that.
I personally think the only way Biden has a shot is if he put Obama as his V.P. with Americans it seems more comfortable to have the devil that you know.
I can‚Äôt wait to hear what the biden loving negroes have to say
He's always critical of Biden, more than most in media.  Just doesn't think we can handle 4 more years of trump.
Once Biden is sworn in anyone remaining in the WH is a trespasser. The Secret Service will clear them out.
She‚Äôs a smart woman and might be a good President some day but if she tries to sneak in over the body of Biden,  she‚Äôs just an opportunist.
The problem is a dog is better than Biden too
Excellent point. How are Marxists going to empower Big Brother and launch their omnipotent State if police forces across the nation are abolished? Or maybe #BLMmarxists and #AntifaDomesticTerrorists  will constitute the #Biden/Sanders/Squad militia army?
Remember if Biden wins she becomes president and you know how well she was when she was a prosecutor
I look at Biden and I haven‚Äôt been able to describe what I see when I look at his eyes. But today I figured it out! It‚Äôs frailness.
On top of that he uses no expression in his statements or answers, expression is a sign of comprehension. I don‚Äôt think Biden knows what the hell he is saying. #puppet
And I don‚Äôt even understand what Biden is saying slurs words
If you go into those articles I believe you‚Äôll find that Biden was in hot water for voicing support for marriage equality ahead of others in the Obama administration‚Äîagain no prize being awarded for doing this in 2012.
I‚Äôm not suggesting Biden,or any national political figures in the last 40 yrs are trailblazers on LGBTQIA issues. 2012 Biden publically voiced support of marriage equality. No one gets aüèÖfor that, but when the VP made that statement in 2012,I can tell you it was monumental to me
is a disrespectful bias #Democrat. You just asked Barr if it's wrong to get help from a foriegn govt for a Presidential Campaign. That's exactly what Biden is doing. Through ActBlue foreign money is going to Democrats and BIDEN! Money Laundering is a crime!
Hell, I'd vote for Biden if he were dead.   I mean, look at me, I'm doing fine, mostly.
That is YOUR America you are describing....its happening NOW because of YOU! Telling people you're gonna fix the problems you created if they vote for you has to be one of the stupidest campaign strategies ever. Start packing you already lost to BIDEN!
Whoever he chooses will be fine with me. I will be voting the Biden ticket. Whoever he picks, we better coalesece around them or we end up with 4 more years of Trump.
Fortunately, Joe Biden is a hell of a lot smarter than Dodd is.
Biden is smart. He understands science. Trump? He's and idiot who doesn't understand anything.
Yes! Biden has nothing to gain by letting #hasbeenTrump strut around and spew hate
Can't wait for Biden to be President. Then Ivanka will be gone!
Biden is the only democratic candidate that  type Republicans would consider voting for IMO.
It will be just another trump mess that Biden will have to clean up.
She isn‚Äôt Biden or Trump, more importantly she agrees that taxation is theft
The Biden team needs to watch Chris Wallace‚Äôs show one Sunday morning and they would realize he‚Äôs on their side. Wallace may happily supply the answers to Uncle Joe. He may even answer the tough ones for him.
If someone has an emotional investment in determining if others are Trump or Biden supporters, s/he is not worthy of friendship. Love them from a distance. Life is not a pathetic joke. Walk away.
He didn't say he wanted warren over anyone else.  Just her over any other person Biden could realistically pick
He can't buy my vote,  but Biden sucks so bad that he can buy my willingness not to vote lol
Lol. Having contacts in Russia is not a crime. Having certain contacts is. Like Clinton, Obama, Biden, Pelosi, etc. Investigating is one thing. Spying is another. And then knowingly putting out false information is another. Don't sugar coat the truth. Obama was corrupt!
Was Joe Biden suddenly President?
He didn't say stay uneducated.  Actually the problem is that most people that vote are uneducated.  That's how we get Biden and not Bernie
I know the primary results are still a few weeks away from being official but Biden was 7pts better in Jones district than statewide
We're living the disaster, and it sure ain't Biden at the helm right now.
I am registered and this white women will be happy to vote for the next president of the U.S. ‚Äî Joe Biden
You poor thing! That look of utter surprise is their astonishment of your naivety. When they ask "who is running against him..." it's because they figure that if Trump has even a snowball's, then Biden must have left the race. Their news is far more accurate than Fox, by the way.
Our Charter says the "National Convention shall nominate our candidate for Vice President." Joe Biden could add some much-needed excitement to the upcoming virtual convention by letting delegates to the convention elect our Vice Presidential candidate using ranked-choice voting.
I just don‚Äôt understand. If it were any Democrat. Anyone at all. Biden, Hillary, whoever. They would be vilified for doing what he does. But he is allowed to grift. Just like he has done for 40 years.
And those things are far from rape now arent they? Didnt Biden also say he didnt realize he was making thise woman uncomfortable and will work on how he interacts with women? Or do you not want to talk about that?
How is Biden guilty of pedophila when he has never once been accused of having sex with a child? He's been accused of being "creepy" with children in pictures taken out of context. Trump has actually been accused of raping children and his lawyer confirmed it with reciepts.
So you're going to avoid answering what i asked? Got it. The election is quite literally Biden vs trump. Have a great evening.
He can do both at the same time because Biden isnt a petulant child
If you agreed with me you wouldnt have brought it up since you'd know Biden has already addressed it publicly and there is no reason to bring it up. You on the other hand have yet to answer the original question i asked you which is also very telling of where you stand
You think thats maybe because i brought up what you failed to bring up? I also addressed Biden's "accusations" as well or did you not read that part? Or is it just convienent for you to ignore that?
The post was about voting for Biden. If you're all about equal justice you would have brought up both candidates and inquired about both and yet you didnt. Very telling of your true intentions.
I wish all 60K of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I find very telling that you only asked about Biden when he's already addressed these issues publicly and trump has way more credible accusations against him and he hasnt addressed them at all other than to delay court cases and threaten those making the accusations.
If the only reason to vote for Biden is because Trump is horrible then there really isn‚Äôt a reason to vote for the man. What is he offering? Other than he‚Äôs not trump.
Its on Biden to excite his voter base so they aren't tempted to vote for this clown.  Biden stands for nothing,  this is his fault.  No one would leave Bernie for kanye,  as people loved Bernie for his policies
Ya‚Äôll realize Biden is a sexual predator and rapist? BIDEN WOULD BE #AmericasGreatestMistake , NOT TRUMP. HAVE WE FORGOTTEN NIXON and all the otther CORRUPT shit? 9/11 WAS INSIDE JOB. BUSH COOPERATED. IT WAS ALL TO START A WAR. STOP BEING BLIND SHEEP. THINK FOR YOURSELF.
Those protestors have nothing to do with Biden.

Of course Biden is better,  but I don't agree that calling out his flaws is a bad thing.  Him saying he would veto Medicare for all,  especially during these times is inexcusable
Yes really.  Why, because Biden?  I‚Äôll stick with the devil I know.
I Live In Missouri Practically All We Are Seeing in Our Ads Is Pro Trump Bullshit! None of It Is Pro Choice, None of It Is Pro Biden It‚Äôs All HORSE SHIT!!!

Why?  , so Biden can remain in his basement and try to win!
Harry Truman attended KKK meetings and used racial slurs but Biden and the folks on the left keep covering that up. Read McCulloms' book Truman to see Truman's connection to the Klan in Independence Mo. It was a vital part of his getting ahead in politics.

Good luck with that üôÑ.  So you are voting for Biden?  Lord help us.
Well there is another call added to the top secret code word server. They must have like 60 of those servers by now. Biden's gonna have alot of tapes to release come Feburary 2021

Bradbury's #Fahrenheit451 is nearly unavailable on Amazon.We see our statues and monuments being burned as we speak. Our movies and TV are censored (remember "COPS" and "Gone With The Wind"?). And Biden hasn't even been elected yet.  Be afraid, Christian America. Be very afraid.
Tune into Mark Levin and get the truth about Joe Biden!

Face it Biden ain't the brightest bulb in the pack!
I hope Biden gets rid of those garish gold drapes tacky Trump put into the Oval Office. The drapes aren‚Äôt even a good choice for Trump given how badly they clash with his hair. #Biden2020ToSaveAmericaHot takes: The email lady was right Trump was a Russian puppet.   Mary Trump was accurate to describe Donald as a sociopath.  And Biden was right to say Trump probably looking at postponing the election.   Maybe start taking everyone but Trump seriously.
Joe Biden: Illegal Aliens ‚ÄòEnrich‚Äô America
Exactly! They know trump is tanking so they‚Äôre starting to revive their debt talk for when Biden wins. They are all spineless hypocrites.
Yes.. and I‚Äôm saying Biden not wanting his kids to grow up in a racial jungle was about tensions being high, he didn‚Äôt want integration to happen just in the school and not in the community as well. He wanted to make affordable housing in white neighborhoods for minority... 1/2
Have u read anything that Joe Biden‚Äôs about? Jk. Of course u haven‚Äôt. U let trump tell you what he‚Äôs about. How do I know? U mentioned stagnant wages

Does Politico have a fucking axe to grind on Biden‚Äôs VP choice? First the constant shit takes on Sen Harris, now pushing Amb Rice.
The best reason to vote for Joe Biden is we will get rid of trump and those squatters in the Whitehouse as well it will save lives $

So they don't even back their own supposed candidate, they are all backing Biden. So the stimulus bill by GOP is attacking good decent Americans &amp; all of USA that Trump supposedly was protecting.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a mess‚Äô: Republican senators deride key proposals in GOP virus package   GOP, Republicans have lost lot of seat Biden is up in the polls, you are going to lose so don't pass any more bills. Good bye hate mongers. Now I know who you are, deadly enemies
Vote for environment protection, and those who protect the poor and older people, not rich gang stalkers &amp; hate mongers &amp; killers which is basically who these devils are. So I guess we must vote for Biden &amp; Democrats now. No other choice. At least they won't try to kill us all.

Nancy Pelosi is a thief a bitch a slut &amp; a dancing whore caste woman &amp; Biden is a slut son -catholic but non believer son of a whore, both want to steal from the treasury &amp; distribute to everyone for free, give unemployment checks for bastards bitches who won't work for a living.
Roman Catholic Slut slum whores &amp; slum whore sons Biden - they keep on trying to cheat us, cheated us in 2008, now they are trying again, moved from Kansas into Missouri where I moved in 2015, as they spent all the money they took from me in 2008, they are coming back for more.
School girls in India discover Earth-bound asteroid   These are the types of bad girls who are pretending to be scientists, cheat everyone, make refrigerator noises, make me a 62 year old Indian lady out to be crazy, attack Trump want to elect Biden.
CDC, WHO, Democrats all joined with big pharma from abroad to try to deseat Trump and force Biden to win an election by fraudulent means. They want to push drugs with high prices to make money, they rob my job, steal my sanity, by making fridge noises - Roman Catholic slum bums.
They are not letting us sleep at night. They also make us sick with runny nose so we cannot be healthy, active, work, study be ourselves. Its how this bum Biden is hoping to win the fake election he is running for on behalf of the most violent criminals in the world,  Democrats
You don't see me spending my time on here complaining like a baby. I'm not rocking with Trump or Biden either
Can‚Äôt they just fade into the background for the next 99 days and then the 2+ months after Biden wins?
Biden would like it to be immediate family, staying close to home
If you have any sense of self respect don't vote for Biden or any of the traitors.
Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden   Aha.  Here is who doing all the stuff in US to get Biden elected against Trump, attacking us -  workplace mobbing, keeping us jobless, useless, psycho terror
They want to get rid of police, do everything online so they can do hacking, stealing, discrimination, sex abuse, violence, say I am not as good as them when I really am, all for their benefits, not for anyone else's. Police should not be defunded, Biden should not be elected.
Kamala is always saying I should be with some old man &amp; a baby &amp;  with some servant - Molly. I want to keep my job that I was doing, get rid of these bad black brahmin from Florida, his influence keeping us under his control &amp; that of this Kamala, Biden, Democrats &amp; molly maids.
Want the whole fraud of Biden, Democrats, Black Lives Matter, Stronger Together, Every Night, Be tight - all that sex promotion, domestic violence, staying home, staying safe, all of that whole farce to be removed as the virus &amp; BLM &amp; Biden is all about discrimination of folks.
Because of this I do not want Biden &amp; Democrats &amp; the protesters to win in any way. I was working peacefully earning a small amount of money, living within my means, doing ok, keeping healthy in mind &amp; body. Now I am sick with a constant nose block, all in the name of BLM &amp; fuck.
Since then the riots in Portland, Oregon now Richmond, Virginia is going on saying Fuck police, fuck Trump, fuck DHS &amp; attacking federal buildings &amp; Biden has suddenly started leading in the polls. So they are behind the sabotaging of any job I do &amp; then create havoc everywhere
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.

Yes I truly agreed VP Biden!
All speculation. His vision is to  get a big crane and pull this country out of the big ditch your dad put us in. It will take awhile but like in 2009/10 Biden will get people back to work and the economy will grow. Make America livable again.
Obama/Biden went big uniting FBI,CIA, Australia, Italy and British Spy Orgs to frame Trump, they‚Äôre so afraid of what‚Äôs coming they‚Äôve  turned their Riot Base loose.
So he‚Äôs not on the Biden train?  Was it because the Democrats kicked god out of the party?
What is this? The Joe Biden presidential inauguration celebration?
Biden has nothing to lose. Trump is on the hot seat. He is the Potus for the moment. You saw Trump yesterday cancel Repugs convention. Don't fool yourself Biden wants the opportunity to show his vision. He already has it up on his web site.
Debat if it happen it happens. If it don't no big deal. We the American people know the character of both men. One has shown10 years of tax returns.Trump hides his. Biden said he will release his medical records if Trump will. Trump won't. He won't release either. He hiding shit.
It was Trump Dr. Who suggested he take the Cognitive test. That's scary. Walk down a ramp will you. Try holding on to the rail. Don't worry about Biden showing up. Worry about Trump showing up. Can't wait for Biden to challenge Trump to a push-up test. Bets ?.Hit me on Nov 5th.
Wait for the Big surprise. Character against a big mouth. Hope they have live fact check. Biden 3-0.
Just wondering how many times Trump played catch or played any sport with his sons, daughters, grandchildren instead of playing golf by himself or with others. We know Biden played &amp; coach his kids.
My point was have the debate. Nothing is going to change. Biden not hiding in his basement. He speaks on TV almost everyday. What more do you think Biden should do?  No reason for Biden to do anything. He is the challenger. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
No I hope there is debates it won't change anything.Trump will call names, talk about Biden son, Obama, &amp; how bad they were with no facts. Biden will present facts &amp; his vision for the country. If anyone drops it will be Trump.Biden as VP has a record to run on-Trump not much.
This IS Trumps America. Isnt it ironic you are using actual footage of Trumps America to try and make Biden look bad? Do you not realize what an idiot you are? Wait, that‚Äôs an unfair question to ask someone if your obvious intellectual level. Want a cookie?
Maybe. I wonder if he even took one, or he was just trying to make himself look sane and Biden mentally declining.
Biden can tie his shoes.Trump can't. Biden knows the difference between North America and South America Trump don't.
That should tell you how bad Trump is. I don't need to watch Biden or Trump. My mind is already made up, as is 67 Percent of this country.
Obama/Biden created over 12 million jobs while in office. Trump/Pence loss 22 million jobs and climbing.

They are NOT there for their favorite candidate; they are to find THE best candidate. If they can't do that over PETTY reasons, well resign. It isn't for YOUR comfort, it's for what Biden wants &amp; needs.
needs to pick up the phone and tell them to shut up about who they prefer. They gather info. Give your opinion to HIM, not the effing paper.  BIDEN picks. End of story.

Yep.  The fact that the polls are as close as they are should be EXTREMELY concerning for Biden supporters.
