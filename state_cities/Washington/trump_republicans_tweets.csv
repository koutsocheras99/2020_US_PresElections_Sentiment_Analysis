Persuade me. Name one thing good to Trump has accomplished. Calling himself a genius does not count.
And the point of bring up Trump was to understand why you believe not wearing a mask was any better when even he has changed course on the matter lol
Because Trump has been the main one against masks until he realized they actually help. Proving that the mayors suggestions were ‚Äúnot a bad look‚Äù considering the top guy in the country agrees. Lol and since were FACTS considered excuses???
How does he plan to be re-elected with a 32% approval rating and dropping fast?  Biden's ahead 16 points in the polls. And that gap is widening.  It's going to be a wipe out for both Trump and the GOP this November.
Here‚Äôs your problem. You can‚Äôt criticize Trump businesses without giving him credit for his business successes at the same time. That‚Äôs why this line of attack doesn‚Äôt work. It cuts your position down at the same time.
I was upset with my 15 yr old Granddaughter's language. I thought I was being clever when I asked.....what is the difference between "trump is an asshole" and "trump is  a fucking asshole"?  She answered ‚Ä¶."Emphasis, Grampa"  I admit it, I was proud of her.
That‚Äôs great advice, Jay... you either need to help save companies or step down. Like i said, I‚Äôve had your back, but you are just trying to piss Trump off, now. This is really childish. Show Washington you actually have something to say, someway to help.‚úåüèº
mr trump......what is your real position on mail in voting?
Well in WWE wrestlers practice with their buddies all week and then the night of the Big show pretend to be enemies Maybe ALL of "our" "politicians" should take acting lessons at the WWE like Trump because to me that phony impeachment wasn't even entertaining at all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Well trump is thinking ahead, the lackey donor he gave the post office to, has managed to disrupt service now to make delivery and return of ballots a problem.  It‚Äôs already hurting home retailers.  Trump doesn‚Äôt give a shit though.

Can Trump postpone or delay the election in November?
Not if it harms trump.
Donald Trump was a fascist in 1989 when he congratulated the Chinese government for crushing the democracy movement with the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Trump has always been a fascist. You have been blinkered by Republican fanaticism.
Ah, the curious mind of donald trump...‚Ä¶.  I'm going to read this statement that makes it sound like I am a bit humbled by the challenges of the pandemic.  And then, unbowed, I will revert to the completely clueless and dangerous asshole I really am.

He wasn't invited to McCain's Funeral but he showed up. If you can look back at some the video's from the event, you will see Trump was very uncomfortable.

Okay.  NOW I have to hope he dies. Otherwise, thousands of others will die when Trump insists that's the only "treatment" needed and uses him as "proof."

Mike Rogers is the guy that informed Trump about the Obama administration spying.

Meet Mike Rogers.
Experts are saying that we need to reset our response to the pandemic.  I imagine that trump, when asked to comment will say.. I couldn't agree more, so let's go back to "I take no responsibility at all" and start from there.

mr trump.....here's the thing....if you had said "hadn't gone into Portland" instead of "didn't go into Portland" it would be clearer that you weren't admitting to yourself how badly you fucked this all up.
Trump's talking about single-family zoning. The problem isn't that property values would fall. It's that they won't artificially inflate at insane percentages and price out younger buyers.  Why have a 1% appreciation when you can have 5% YOY and let someone be homeless?
How do WH staffers who follow trump around stay sane?  An insider friend told me that many of them wear "I'm with stupid" t-shirts under their dress clothes.

We know Trump is not a fan of our governor here in WA state. But he probably doesn‚Äôt like that we vote by mail. In fact I‚Äôve only ever voted by mail. I‚Äôve never gone to a voting station. Until recently I honestly thought everyone voted by mail. Just makes sense.
And, you feel like you can speak for mothers because why? Moms are desperately looking for quality, reliable sources if info before sending their kids to public school. The Trump admin. is not known for credible, reliable, scientific info. Is your son going to public school?

Of course if the Florida electors are insufficient to rescue Trump anyway, Chief Justice Roberts could swear in Biden.  Either way, the current President ceases to be POTUS on Jan 21, &amp; only Roberts can swear in the successor.  Grassley Sen Pro Temp would be in line then.
Yeh, I'm an old Reagan voter, and I get "triggered" by ignorance and bullying stupidity, which Donald Trump manifests in abundance.

Just because the misogynistic members of your party bullied you for standing up to Trump doesn‚Äôt mean you have to cave. You know there is zero evidence of Dem ballot harvesting. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Trump puts himself first, America's families on the hotplate (unemployment, evictions, immigration restrictions separating families) and workers in the non-union subordinate role.  He has a record, you know, which all the lectern platitudes cannot erase.

But lies are Donald Trump's stock in trade, Sally.  He's been #RoyCohn bullshitting so long now that he cannot spot the truth if it bit him in the arse (not that he doesn't have a big spot for that, either).
Yes, the Presidency is for Trump an entry level position.  Before that, he was a business huckster &amp; cheat.  Trump was also never an employee before, but he's ours now, &amp; his poor job performance (lethally so in the case of Covid-19) warrants a thumbs down on him this November.
It‚Äôs the pivot now that it looks like he‚Äôs gonna loose badly. Can‚Äôt let them disown him. Guys like this and the gop in general own Trump.
Yes, but as one who is 67 and knows quite a few teachers, and can observe our Plague President's behavioral history, don't depend on Donald Trump to get this any better than he has running casinos.
Nothing but more lies from donnyboy who continues to travel around spreading his TRUMP VIRUS even as he's lies through his teeth during your press briefing.
The government made sure we all got our stimulus by mail or electronic transfer. Its rigged for mail in ballot. This is fucking insanity. I WILL BE VOTING AND I dont care if I get COVID19 I will make sure you will not be president trump. Trump killed more than 150,000 civilians.

Oh, wow! You know, the thought of that being a deep fake crossed my mind. But given his candidacy and presidency, those exact words don‚Äôt seem that far fetched. It‚Äôs the type of things the real Trump would say.

I'm shocked mainstream media haven't blamed Trump for actually making and personally disseminating COVID 19 by injecting people one at a time with a Russian-provided needle.  Because they've easily said crazier things over the last... entirety of their existence.

Or, maybe trump's suggestion to delay the election was calculated.   It has NO chance of happening (amendment much?), but is OUTRAGEOUS enough to draw ALL attention away from terrible economy AND his spineless meeting with putin.  Hell, putin might've suggested idea on the phone.
That doesn't even make sense. Why would Trumps buddy Putin help her? There are so many holes in these Alt right conspiracy theories. But you choose to believe them and ignore the Trump administrations own comments admitting corruption.

The president has no authority to delay an election, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the date for voting.
But "they don't think that way." They think trump is doing an amazing job and it would be much worse with Hillary.   They also mistakenly think that the media is lying and it's not that bad.  Idiots!
I feel like making the mistake of thinking Trump is to the left of just about anyone should be punishable by a year in jail.
Trump is hemorrhaging support from the elderly, likely because he fucked up response to the COVID situation and then started talking like their lives were expendable to reopen the economy. That puts Florida in play at least.

President Trump floats idea of delaying the election
I wish I could say I'm surprised how many of Trump's MAGAts want to delay the election.
Could they be radical-left anarchists? No, they‚Äôve imposed order on the anarchy of the street by establishing qualifications for field medics and a hierarchy among them, so that any badly injured protester will immediately get the right kind of care.
If that‚Äôs really true, then you should be able to see my position. If Biden can keep his mouth shut until Election Day, he‚Äôs got it in the bag. If they have a chance to have a televised debate, Trump is absolutely winning.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
What are you talking about? Lol. Trump was bragging about how well he did on his test. Biden has a lot of scandals, and Trump will tear him apart. The Ukraine scandal originally started off with Biden‚Äôs son (not Trump like the media was trying to push)
I don't think I know. "Russia if you are listening..." "Ukraine scandal" Bountygate.   When you realize he works for Putin and not the US.  All his decisions come into sharp focus.  Donald Trump is a Russian installed mole, to dismantle democracy and he has a party willing to...
Trump won due to his snappy responses against Hillary, which is something Biden won‚Äôt be able to handle. Also, people believe that Biden has dementia of some sort. In a televised debate, Biden loses easily.
You wish.  Trump is getting reelected.  Ill be waiting with my popcorn to watch an epic liberal meltdown.

I think Donald Trump has some serious bruises on his knees for all the time he's spend in front of Vladimir Putin.
Trump is the most bankrupted President ever, the most to use lawyers to bully &amp; browbeat his opponents, the most unfaithful to his spouses (2/3 of presidential ex-wives are his), most compulsive exaggerator of any President, &amp; hands down the biggest #RoyCohn liar of all.
People who don't like Trump are just under-informed. Name 1 policy of his you do like?
The anger comes from folks not wearing masks not due to any health reason but because they have decided their perceived  rights trump the well-being of whole classes of people who are vulnerable. individualism with no acknowledgment of a collective good borders on sociopathy.

In most cases I tend to agree- But Gomer is a special case.  I do think he really is a very dim bulb.  Now he is also a malignant Trump sycophant so he certainly doesn't deserve a pass though.

You go President Trump! I‚Äôm proud of you!
that is the trump/gop train if i ever seen it
No, this is not a racist tweet.  It is however a slap in the face of a huge portion of America. It's Trump's way of saying "Hey, we'll gentrify your neighborhoods so those dirty poor people don't come near you."  It is a disgusting tweet even without a racial element.
Here's another reason against trump, mail is being used as a political weapon.
Oh. I thought he did that already. Must have dreamt it.   Either way, completely unsurprising. I worry for my German Sinti kin. Trump is handing everything to Putin.

Biden In Solidarity With Antifa--Accuses Trump of "Egregious Tactics"
At the end of the impeachment trials, I tried to get away from everything Donald Trump for the rest of the day. So I decided; watching the TV series, 'Ancient Aliens', was a safe bet.  Got my coffee, settled on the couch. The episode that followed, "Trumps Spaceforce" üòí Ugh!
Terrifying state of affairs we are in! I am so proud to be a Democrat! Trump and his administration are criminal! They are corrupt! His supporters are GOüê∑s!
I love how anyone who doesn't vote your way is either fake, a grifter, or a Trump supporter to you guys. Your fragile egos can't accept that there are people who believe in police and not your political sports team mentality.

I guess that's the difference between you and I. I don't believe the poles I don't believe President Trump is behind. He has great forces working against him but the American citizens that are not wishy-washy will overwhelmingly put him in office again.
I agree with this gentleman. Low-income Americans are a large part of Donald Trump‚Äôs base. He doesn‚Äôt care about them AT ALL.

You and your cohorts are responsible. President Trump in the beginning told us that Hydroxychloroquine with zinc works among many other countries and doctors who say the same thing. President Trump was the first to act, get your facts straight!
The Kodak deal reeks of crony capitalism. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, the Trump administration gave them $765m to produce hydroxychloroquine. We have plenty of generic drug manufacturers in the US with the ability to produce this particular drug. So why Kodak? 1/

Jonathan Swan did a phenomenal job in this interview...and showed what a complete dummy our president is. Trump tries to pull his usual long run on sentences of bullshit but Swan shut that down. You can tell Trump doesn‚Äôt know ANYTHING. He needs to GO. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
And yet Trump himself took the drug combo with zinc. Are you‚Äôre telling me a WH Doctor would let the President take a drug that would harm him.   I‚Äôm a pharmacist. I‚Äôd take it.

Americans first... America second... trump last! This should be the chant. He put corporate before lives! He wants you to be sick and he wants you to not show to the ballot box. If you are sick, how will you vote? If you are dead, how will you vote? #VoteTrumpOut
The more folks die, the less the government has to pay out in Medicare and social security, thus saving money for them, off the lives of you! Trump does not care how many die or are sickened by this pandemic, he only cares about one thing..
Why did the administration try to put FBI building funds into the cares package? Just trying to line those pockets again huh! Highly doubt a new building would cost billions! Trump game at it again, take a loan for far more than it's worth and pocket the rest!?
Black people are being murdered by our police. America is too individualistic to take precautions during a pandemic. And Trump is worried that people don‚Äôt like him. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The Democrats have tried everything the last 4 years and failed, they haven't learned and they won't quit. They are now pushing that Trump will not accept the election. Don't be surprised if they use this as an excuse to try and overthrow the government they are that stupid.
And Donald Trump is over 67, right?
And more. The ten most common words that respondents gave were: "incompetent," "arrogant," "strong," "idiot," "egotistical," "ignorant," "great," "racist," "asshole" and "narcissistic."  I believe this "strong" and "great" referred to #Trump's body odor.

IF ANYBODY IS A BULLY, IT'S trump!
Before one can discuss ideas, one needs to specify them. Also, including the epistemology of those ideas are helpful. As much as I hate to admit it, the Democratic party has become far more dangerous than Trump.
Does Trump know, because he was saying something else this morning.
Protesters take a break go home and show Trump and Barr that Federal troops was not the right way.
Trump's Cult member!
Oh please tell me he had a meeting with Trump yesterday.
The virus is not the problem! The democraps are the problem! If the economy doesn't start up soon it won't matter if you're alive or not! You'll be just as dead! And so will  your family's! That's why trump wants to get all the blue states open!
. to visit the heart of the Texas oil industry - also a #COVID19 hotspot
Trump is the worst, Barr is his clone. Both disgusting and despicable. Vile!
Trump and Putin is what is happening to America.
I despise SpongeBob Squarepants, but would rather watch it then watch a Trump speech.
So he was at a Trump rally.
Your ignorance is only exceeded by your tangential acceleration, and I don't even like Trump.
But trillions have already been given to all the already rich Republican donors... and other Trump supporters.

Ayo they snapped ya fuck Donald trump
Poor baby. Nobody likes trump? The list is so freaking long why he's not liked. . . . . .sigh
He left office as Attorney General under George H W Bush apparently on the right side of the law. Was he always this corrupt? It just took trump to expose it. "Will the real William Barr, please stand up?"  I believe he has.
This was already revealed two months ago! The media is suppressing information! Because  trump was behind  this drug! And they don't want things to get better until November 2!
Barr represents the Trump Administration, not the American people.
I swear to lie for Trump.
local law enforcement needs to step in. People are dying because of these riots and that‚Äôs what they are. Liberals don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs Trump bad, me-‚Äúprotester‚Äù- good. Portland PD , Seattle PD, the mayors in both cities need to regain control of their cities.
President Trump is pushing claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment for coronavirus and challenging the credibility of Dr. Fauci.
You‚Äôre such a trump puppet. Even after he craps on you. I just don‚Äôt get it
and others like him are among the heroes of this revolution. Then there are those trying to sabotage protests in order to distort their meaning and help create Trump's alternate reality. They are #WhiteSupremacists #AltRightProvocateurs and other #TrumpSupporters.
Trump deploys DHS and mercs as stormtroopers against US citizens in the streets protesting for #BlackLivesMatter.  Trump is grifting the #CovidVaccineScam  White supremacy and mass-murder are de rigeur for Trump's administration.  And you, Chuck, report that the sky is blue. smh
#ImpeachBarr is nothing but a mouthpiece for Trump's white supremacist crime syndicate.
Drugmakers refuse to attend White House meeting after Trump issues executive orders on costs  via  public is tired of the multi billion drugs companies getting away with murder! It's time to shut them down! Yes! Some people will suffer so what!
#Canada can no longer turn a blind eye to the reality that the United States denies decent and dignified treatment to #asylum seekers. Under Trump, the U.S. is not only a $hithole country, it's a $hitty place in which to seek asylum.

No Way by Donald Trump was the song we all needed in 2020
Harsh, but true.  is complicit in Trump‚Äôs destruction of American institutions, norms and principles.
Trump is #KillingAmerica, not just #Texas
But, but, but‚Äîhis tone has changed, right?üôÑ  Shame on every journalist and pundit who praised Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúchange of tone.‚Äù We knew it wouldn‚Äôt last because he is void of morality, ethics, compassion, and selflessness.
The Trump Train will roll right over that stop sign of yours.
Trump would do himself and the country a great service by regulating himself, and turning over the reins of the Executive branch to a semi rational Republican.
Not buying it! Trump is the only scam I see right now!
Hey Trump did you see this? Guess people really do trust and like the doc.
Barr only has to answer to Trump that will be the out come .
Doesn't matter Barr, Republicans and Trump have full control.
Nothing The Trump Administration and Barr do matters because  no one is going to stop them! WAKE UP AMERICANS!
Thank you Mr. Trump for sending people in. These are beautiful cities that I have always loved visiting and working in despite their political views. And now it is so sad and scary to see what‚Äôs happening here.
I am the future and all is true!  trump is found on Epstein's island cavorting with McConnell, Tillis, Graham, &amp; several others who lost elections. All were taken into custody for crimes against the US,  including #StealingAirForceOne  üòéüé∂ü•≥ #Humor #Hope #Pray #NoVoterApathy2020
Dude, you do know he's freaking pocketing campaign donations right into his personal bank accounts? Last weeks breaking news. Then there's trump's golf courses, trump's Hotels, Mar A Largo. Salary? He's getting rich off tax payer dollars. #AnotherTrumpConspiracy
I can't unsee the video of the Veteran standing alone, proud, &amp; tall when trump's thugs began violently beating him. He stood his ground until they teargased him at close range.  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie  #tRumpsGestapo  #GetInTheWayInGoodTrouble #BLM #VOTE #BlueTsunamiNov03
And mothers who went to protect peaceful protesters.  Everyone can see what he's doing except for those who pigged out on his koolaid. He's pushing the videos as Biden's America. Except IT IS tRUMP'S America.  Biden will return peace, unity, intregrity and honesty to America!
"Pure evil" is the perfect oxymoron. It also is the best description of trump. He has practiced his brand of corruption for 74 years. Born with no conscience in the definition of a sociopath.
Protests were beginning to calm when trump sent his "Feds" in.  It caused a dramatic surge in tension. They weren't needed nor invited! He only did this to look good for his base, not to help BLM.   He's pure evil!   What if the violent rioters are trump's men too? At all sites?
And these paid thugs are from Trump who is a Russian asset.  Next argument???
Facebook‚Äôs ads use OUR user data to let Trump spread lies and suppress voting. We need oversight bodies to investigate #Facebook and act.
It puts the Biden on its skin Or else it gets the Trump again
The Trump shirt is a nice touch
Because trump and Jesus have so much in common. They create problems that could easily have been solved before they started so you can beg for help, praise him if he helps you and blame others if he doesn‚Äôt bother. #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Dream team of has been nobodies! Trump is such an incredible loser
I really believe Trump is an idiot.
It seems worse because those who should hold Trump accountable are not.
Trump said he won't throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium, saying he has "strong focus" on the coronavirus, vaccines &amp; the economy.
Once again news ppl pushing their fake agenda. Only truth here is that Trump will win.
Some of us did, while Florida‚Äôs beaches at spring brk were at capacity w the blessing of their gov &amp; w other govs declaring local mask mandates invalid, etc. It will never be accomplished that way. They all believed in Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòhoax‚Äô theory &amp; now the rest of us pay with our lives

Trump always says the opposite of what is true!
"#Trump_Discretion" is an #Oxymoron
It was a black swan event. The WHO originally stated it didn't transmit human&gt;human. 'Wear no masks,' was the initial advice. NY politicians &amp; others supported a variety of crowd based celebrations. It was an overall "what we worry" from most politicians. It wasn't just Trump.
I this makes my skin crawl. It us such a vile piece of propaganda by Trump.
Trump must be stopped. &lt;&lt;Thousands of Americans in one city are openly rebelling against the government. And it's parents and nurses and Teamsters and line cooks and teachers and students. They get it. Trump's fascism needs to be crushed by the people.&gt;&gt;
I read an article recently that stated, 1. Trump will likely lose the election,  2. Democrats will retain the house, and 3. the GOP will likely stay in control of the Senate. I agree with 1 and 2.  Let's prove them wrong on 3! #ShowUpAndVOTE #LifeDependsOnIt #Vote2020
Carlson is wrong, of course. It will still exist. Biden is good, but he is not superhuman. A superhuman effort would result in convincing Trump‚Äôs America that they have been misguided and that it‚Äôs time to latch onto what America should be. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen.
I love the way Trump drives you people insane üòÇüòÇ
No, we're going to use taxpayer money, $137,000,000 [so far] to pay  Trump to play golf.

That‚Äôs the entire point. Believe me we hated Obama just as much as you hate trump the difference is you losers can‚Äôt handle an L. We spoke our mind at the voting box, you cry and riot
Trump goons spurred violence?!?!?? The left has been rioting in every major city in the country for almost a month!! And you are dumb enough to say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs Trumps fault the people that oppose him are destroying stuff‚Äù
This whole idea that anyone should be able to own a 500k home. Trump HAS NOT reversed regulations on the housing market.
Trump undid ALL of Obama‚Äôs regulations. You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Either Obama was responsible for growth when he was in office and Trump undoing those policies should have flipped the growth, or Obama wasn‚Äôt responsible and Trump undoing his policies didn‚Äôt have an effect
The only thing that changed was who wasn‚Äôt getting their way. Dudes wanna blame Trump for the left rioting and looting and burning down cities. That‚Äôs how insane y‚Äôall are.
I‚Äôm Mexican/American... these Democratic cities allowing these riots and keeping us closed, steered me away from them.. I‚Äôm Voting for you Mr.Trump
To be comparing Trump at 50 vs Fauci at 79 makes someone look really stupidü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Completely agree.  They need to change the narrative that is being told by the right wing nutters.  They need to take the leverage away from Trump and his Goons.  They do that and everything crumbles.
Yeah, there's no way those are Trump supporters. Lots of Trump supporters in my area of WA, and I've never seen a mask with a swastika on it. Only a true #idiot would think those are actually Trump supporters, but Twitterverse is full of actual idiots.
I haven't slept without  fear for almost 4 years.  I swear we are all, the entire nation, is going to have some level of PTSD and need some forms of therapy after Trump leaves office.  I hope there is  a plan for mental health when Biden takes office.
Yes HE does and your savior Trump couldn‚Äôt quote the Christ to save his own life without a cheat sheet, and then it‚Äôs still a iffy.
The REAL citizens of Washington, those of us who pay taxes and care more about keeping businesses and people afloat than your political name calling welcome Trump and his soldiers into our state to clean up your disgusting mess with open arms! You are the virus killing Washington
I love #Portland and it makes me sick to see it being used and abused for #Trump's media spectacle. #FedsOutOfPortland #StandWithPortland
Free?  The American people have paid with their lives and their taxes for the privilege of having Trump and his minions kill off 140,000+ Americans, kill off 30 million + jobs, give tax handouts to the 1%, etc etc etc.  Time to give back to those who do the real work
Trump and his clowns want us to suffer. We are in this for the long haul. Be smart, Be safe, Be vigilante, there is no super man,
Help if you can! Elect Kim Mangone and defeat the enabler McCarthy.  He doesn‚Äôt stand for Californians, only for Trump.
Nothing.  You  are still working under the assumption that the President would care for it's citizens.  Yeah, No, Trump doesn't give a shit about any of us.
On Trump's lawyers and CRIME FAMILY?
Yes, but because there are so many issues, the protests are BLM, ending police brutality, free speech, standing up to Trump.
Thank you President Trump! Biden wants to start a program where prescriptions are mail ordered to your home.  Lol
They know, the ones that don't care, are Trump supporters.
It's time to change it up.  Trump is seeking confrontation, switch the narrative.  Do all the singing, dancing drumming, peaceful protest, but then walk away about 9 p.m.  Get off the streets before it gets dark.  They want those confrontations at night. Don't play their game.
true enough, but democrats need to quit being republican lite. I am not a trump fan, but I need m4a more than I need anything
Yes Mr. Trump, you‚Äôve done an awesome job on Portland!  That crowd is positively glorious!!!  Isn‚Äôt the First Amendment a beautiful thing?  #BlackLivesMatter #WallOfVets #FreeTheFirst

He stole a winning issue. If he goes all-in on Medicare for all, he will piss both Republicans and Democrats off, and win in a landslide. Medicare for all is more likely under Trump than Biden. He's to the left of the Dems on trade, he's to the left of the Dems on health-care.
Obama killed re-importation and medicare for all. Don't let partisanship blind you. If Trump goes all-in on Medicare for All, he will win in a landslide
is afraid to go up against #VladimirPutin; probably b/c Donald has those #BoneSpurs or maybe b/c Putin has #kompromat on Trump, or b/c Trump hopes for asylum in Russian after he‚Äôs booted from office.
Live with it.  Trump 2020
Doesn‚Äôt a dem run Portland? Trump isn‚Äôt the cause, whiny little bitches are the cause. They‚Äôre not fighting for #BLM, they‚Äôre burning shit down because they don‚Äôt get their way. This is failed Dem leadership.

Trump 2020!
It's been reported that the majority of the "protesters" in Portland are white. Do we know whether these are even BLM people or if they are right wing infiltrators sent in to make the real protesters look bad? Something really stinks about this! trump &amp; Barr is behind it all.
When red states began surging trump finally shows an interest in Covid.   As long as it was blue states and people of color dying, his attitude was fuck'em.    He has all ages, races, genders and Republicans dying now, and it's TOO LATE TO STOP IT!  You are a murderer, trump!
Cult leader? But the ‚Äúcult leader‚Äù is telling us to vote for him. Which I might do but undecided, I‚Äôm not in a swing state so it doesn‚Äôt really matter. He‚Äôs fucking horrible whose only and I mean ONLY selling point is he‚Äôs not Trump.
üò¢ sad reality in NOT SO GREAT TRUMP DISASTER.
Someone else called it off. Trump ALWAYS says the opposite of what is true.
So by saying you love everyone you just acknowledge do you love Trump I think Trump would say thank you bitch here here I'll have to rig up a couple of space
IFBAP Followed and R/Td
Trump wants violence? I think you're confused.
No. They aren't that smart. I still wouldn't be suprised if Trump resigns because" no one likes him and he isn't appreciated". He's as vindictive as hell, he would wait until October to toss the entire GOP under the bus.

White House Clarifies That Trump Was Just Sending General Well Wishes To All Sex Traffickers
I didn't vote Trump--he's a fool; however, be specific concerning the laws he thumbed his nose at. Obama thumbed his nose at the legal basis of the Dreamers Act (in 2012 he essentially stated such things were unconstitutional). Drone attacks in foreign countries, etc.
I think you missed the point. Rule of law is independent of the egregious personality of Trump, any president, or the opinion of a mob. Destroying or damaging the peoples federal structures is not legitimized by a popular vote, which didn't even happen.Is trump there?
Trump is a child rapist according to Maxwell.
I bet you miss a Republican Party that doesn‚Äôt suck. I respect the never Trump GOP and believe that there is a better Republican Party. I have always been a Democrat but I have voted for Republicans at times.
But with a strong president and fair congress on the other side, we can secure voting rights and start to work harder for equality. It‚Äôs going to be nasty but the nasty Trump minority will stay the minority if we educate and lift up the least among us.
Today, trump was promoting a pizza parlor.  I'm sure that was driving the QAnons nuts.
Trends would be considered evidence for the likelihood of certain events happening. For example, I see a trend toward Trump trying to disrupt the election, or there will be a significant reduction in the total area of rain forest... trends...

You don't fire your campaign manager and halt advertising when you are winning. Biden is going to be President in less than 6 months.

I want to evict Donald Trump for violating the Constitution, for doing nothing to stop the pandemic with the loss of so many lives, for his corrupt, racist, criminal actions.#EvictTrump
For some reason Google adsense on my site thinks I might want to know about how to get involved in Trump's campaign... weird... talk about artificial stupidity.
Tried watching it once but it was literally one of the most boring things I've ever seen on TV and dumb‚Äîeven by reality show standards. Found Trump to be unwatchable and annoying. Made it through half an episode and moved on.
Trading one white fascist for another white fascist is not wining.  is the same as Trump! If the DNC doesnt want to lose this election, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO NEED TO EARN OUR VOTE!  If Dtrump wins, that's on the DNC, NOT THE VOTERS!
This guy fell so far. He was a respected US Army officer now a trump suck up
Trump has no legal or constitutional power to delay the election. What if he "orders" a delay anyhow? Will some state and local election officials obey him? That could create chaos, which is the only goal he seems to pursue consistently.

I'm glad "Trump Republican" is showing up on ballots now. It makes things clearer.
Hahaha this what happens when you offend old white trump supporters üòÇ
Only in your dreams, your the worst person and president.                                                                       VOTE NO TO THE RACIST, LIER AND IDIOT TRUMP!!!  Things will get worse with him running our country, look what he‚Äôs done already ‚Äúnothing‚Äù
Evil, mellow, cool, and effective? Or evil, bombastic, hot tempered, and nothing which will last? Which is better? In other words, Bush or Trump?
How is using his first amendment right to free speech to ask a question to the public possibly an impeachable offense, let alone an abuse of power or criminal conduct? Trump‚Äôs tweet was politically stupid, but the response from the elites is both stupid and hysterical!
Is this what happens to your brain once you are inducted into the trump death cult?
It's okay. Van Jones is on standby ready to proclaim trump "presidential" as soon as he "pivots" again.
Trump never said or suggested he had the power to do it. So she  was answering a question that his tweet never raised. He asked if the election should be delayed, he never stated that HE could delay it. But reading comprehension seems in short supply nowadays!
Trump, the GOP, Congress, CBP, it all has me fired up today. I get tired of the talk back and forth. I want some action.
Ya know... as president of da US Trump can dissolve the United States so hey if he really REALLY wanted to suspend the election... Permanently üëÄüëÄüëÄü§ûü§ûü§û
Why would a commissioner say this to Trump since he never suggested he did have that power?
You guys? I'm just me here.  And yes I can have a respectful conversation, of course. I'm just finding it harder and harder to have discourse with people who either enable or support Trump. I never like him, but I have always looked to be able to identify...
I have the sneaking suspicion that I‚Äôm the Trump! Sad. But I speak in much shorter sentences than David, so....
Furthermore on bias. I see a lot better treatment and respect given to Trump by supposedly left wing media than he deserves, and if you can't see that it‚Äôs most likely because you have the same bias as every other member of the Trump death cult.
Trump is going to get very sick also
good
Contin: Then the young and healthy can work without endangering the old and infirm, who keep out of harm‚Äôs way. The only downside; no destruction of the Trump economy before Election Day, the apparent goal of present policy.
Lucky for the trump campaign, Herman Cain signed the COVID death waiver to attend the Tulsa rally.  Now his family cannot sue trump.
What an absolutely shit day: Herman Cain dies. Flynn is screwed by biased judges again GDP nosedives as expected  Trump writes stupid tweet Dow down Obama opens his vile mouth, politicizing a funeral.  Fuck July 30, 2020
How much time would it take to tell a department "go spy on Trump"? Also, if he did direct them to do so, it would have been for national security. I don't know if you pay attention, but the US has been bleeding power and leverage since Trump.
trump is encouraging people to eat pizza.  Isn't this going to drive the QAnonsense cultists into a frenzy?
Trump is the antithesis of Obama.  He couldn‚Äôt fit Obama‚Äôs shoes, even if he tried. Obama‚Äôs eulogy of Lewis was phenomenal.  I noticed that Trump had  not been invited.  ‚ÄúWhat a blessing‚Äù

Dear    Donald Trump is using your platform to try to seed doubt in the efficacy of mail in voting, and attempting to stop a fair and just election from occurring in the United States come Nov 3rd.   Please address his misleading tweets immediately.
The military swore their oath to the constitution. If Trump refuses to leave office, the military has an obligation to force him out.
When will the GOP stand up to this asshole? Trump suggests delaying election amid fraud claims, but has no power to do so
It seems like we may be able to map out Trump's playbook by simply looking to what other fascist dictators have done to get to where they are.
Alright. If Trump tries to delay the election what are we gonna do? #Election2020
How many of trump fake companies bought stock in Kodak at $2.00 I wonder, as well as his staff?
We knew this was coming from trump..he does not play fairly..he is the worst president we‚Äôve had. His bitter, angry tweets against dems...Now his attempt to move elections until his horrible numbers change: economy, Covid, unemployment, riots.. fight this!!! We vote Nov. 3üí™ü§õüò∑

Antimalarial drug touted by President Trump is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus ... Will you be dropping dead anytime soon?
Truth about Trump‚Äôs diploma:  Trump attended Fordham University for his freshman and sophomore years, and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he received a bachelor of science degree in finance. He frequently boasts about "graduating from Wharton¬†¬ª. BIG LIE!
That is what Trump deserves after 150,000 dead americans on his hands.

It's just crazy that so many trump supporters are fine with that as well. Did they all forget the cold war or something?
He's propping up the stock market with $1 Trillion dollars/month corporate bond purchases, and committing insider trading with his "friends." While the Obama years saw our deficit increase by $10T in 8 years, the trump era has added $7T in 3.5 years. This Depression will be ugly.
Trump. Without him, Covid might not be raging thru the country like it is.
Well that scares the shit out of me. I always thought in the end if trump goes full dictatorship, the military would side with the citizens. Guess they will just go to war with us no problem now.

Canadian Opinion: The U.S. is burning ‚Äì and Donald Trump is the gleeful arsonist-in-chief /via
Many Top White House Aides have gotten the virus and the fact that trump is regularly tested pretty much proves there‚Äôs no secret cure there either.
I agree, I think it‚Äôs best he doesn‚Äôt, because he is bound to flub some key facts or figures and Trump will pounce all over that.
That would explain Trump's DNA.

We live a post-reality America, thanks to trump and his Q minions.
I think this is CNN's way of showing trump's advancing physical decline, while pretending it's just showing him touring a laboratory.
If the susceptible get sick while sequestered, then lockdowns for all is useless too. The susceptible must be sequestered from healthy carriers, or PPE must be used when in close proximity to them. No destruction of the Trump economy just before the election needed.
trump is running on fumes. Nothing sticks to Biden. Is he "sleepy"? Is he a "Radical"? Nobody cares where Hunter is. Two years of opposition research into Biden, and they came up empty.  If trump is complaining that "no one likes him" now, just wait until 11.3.20...

That's no surprise given that you probably had no problem with the rudeness shown to Democrats by Republicans. If anyone is pushing the dialog into rudeness it has been from Newt Gingrich's congress to Trump's antagonism and name calling.

The country was imploding prior to Trump. It was thriving since his inaugeration. Our dysfunctional Covid response is a Democrat construct.
I figure as long as President Trump wishes to see his name trending in Twitter, the least we could do is accommodate him. I mean, it isn't as if he asked for us to do anything illegal.
Maybe now is a good time for you to actually use the words ‚ÄúTrump is lying.‚Äù Idk, might save lives, but whatevs, priorities right?
There is something to that. Perhaps leftists organizations are receiving record funding while Trump is in office. If Biden takes over that could be the end of the gravy.

It seems like no matter what Trump is concocting in his little brain to get reelected, he always has to ruin everything by using racial slurs! He just can‚Äôt win for losing.
Biden has my vote no matter what at this point. Trump is a threat to liberal democracy on par with Viktor Orb√°n or the Law and Justice Party, albeit less competent.
.....he also said Trump can't just do everything by Executive Order. Obama signed 276 EOs &amp; 1186 Presidential proclamations.  I guess   Biden didn't know how Obama worked. What else doesn't he know.?
Biden actually said it was irresponsible Govt. leadership that sent Corporations overseas but  should be here in America. He &amp;  Obama placed such regs on Corps they did just that. It took Pres.  Trump to bring businesses back to build factories Obama said never would.
Ok Patriots, help a Vet out with his business, r/t this. I am getting more gray hair here with everything going on, trying to keep a roof over our head, but I am still going to try and make some sales to help my family. Here is another bad boy to get.

Bro, you allowed people to terrorize your actual tax-paying citizens for 50 days straight; Trump has shown immense restraint.   We understand optics too, Jay. If he struck the first week, it would seem heavy-handed. This is long overdue and righteous.
Trump and AG Barr set them up you can bet on itThe Republicans who can't put their country before their party are idiots. Trump destroying our country is one thing. Sitting back and supporting it because you don't want the other party to succeed is idiotic.
Yes, but some Republicans are so FOR their party that they're blinding supporting Trump. So in some cases, they're both idiots.

Across the latter half of the 20th century the military has done this in countries across the developing worlds, and feds have done versions of it to protesters and activists. We need to, as a country, keep fighting this. And if we make it to November,  vote Trump out.
This is what is fucking happening in Portland. The city governments have been gassing and beating their people, and now the feds are abducting them. This seems designed to spread terror. The Trump administration wants to intimidate us all into shutting the fuck up.

And this ladies and gentleman is why there will be no debates. Imagine, Trump just leading this guy on a path of nonsense.  Oh, yeah Joe. Go on...
President Trump once sad that he‚Äôs  the countries chief  or top law-enforcement officer will he also can hold top title for being the countries top people executioner by allowing the coronavirus to go rampant.
President Trump said that testing for coronavirus makes us look bad and it‚Äôs overrated of course it makes us look bad because a lot of red states listen to him when it came to reopening states economy , now it‚Äôs devastating !
people can keep ~7 items in short term memory. so cognitive acuity tests use a 5 item list b/c its easy. it reveals cognitive deficit bettter when someone struggles w/ a simple task. Trump's boast about how hard remembering  "person man woman camera tv" is reveals his impairment.
Welcome to Trump‚Äôs existential threat to American democracy.   He must be removed.
Mary Trump on her Uncle Donald: ‚ÄòI used to feel compassion for him. That became impossible‚Äô
So, at what point during his 4-year regime did Trump‚Äôs America stop being Obama‚Äôs fault and start becoming Biden‚Äôs fault?
But um... it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs America.
Yet a teacher is fired fir just saying Trump is the president
Trump doesn‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù, that the word even exists,much less ask to take a test. Puhlease.
Trump is abusing his power, using tactics from dictators. We are a democracy.
this has nothing to do with normal policing, this has everything to do with Trump or any president for that matter sending in federal forces that are above the rule of law and are acting with impunity
Trump must go
Accuse your opponent of exactly what it is that you‚Äôre doing; that‚Äôs you bobby rush!  You, pelosi and pedo joe are using fear and bullying to take control.  IMO, you‚Äôre evil, bobby; remember though, evil NEVER wins! MAGA 2020 - vote Trump!
Trump‚Äôs America sucks!
Why??? Because CNN coined it and used it until Trump started using it, then ALL of the sudden it was racist??? How about these, shall we change their monikers also?
The moniker ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù was attached to it LONG before COVID-19. Those that say you can‚Äôt call it the China Virus are just covering for China hiding this. Remember CNN are the first ones that used China Virus, THEY coined it. Then when Trump used it, claimed it was racist!!!
That‚Äôs how I woke up the day after Trump got elected.
Posse comitatus ??  Look it up trump
More trump BS
But even with the evidence of curruptuon by Trump and his allies being public, you guys are still munching Donald‚Äôs tate. Quit being a phony.
But has more balls then Trump the puppet üòñ
I just wrote to my senators with  Stop Trump's efforts to rig the 2020 Census. Write to yours here:
Trump using Nazi tactics in cities for political gain and endangering citizens and the fabric of America.
those people that say they wont wear a mask because its tryanny yet are ok with what Trump is doing with these federal forces are bootlickers.
Sign TYT's Petition: If Trump loses but won't leave... I'll remove him myself.
And now POTUS is pushing him to get the British Open at his Trump Course.
Trump Reportedly Asked U.S. Ambassador To Help Move British Open To His Resort
Trump Health Secretary Says US Healthcare Workers 'Don't Get Infected' With Covid-19 (94,000 Have Contracted the Virus) -  viaCan we just admit that Trump doesn't want the job anymore?  Its obvious that he's sabotaging the GOP chances of winning.
Yea I agree.  I love that some of them wanna talk about it and then vote for trump. That‚Äôs a special kind of stupid.
It's reassuring to see that there's still a Trump supporter out there. He needs at least one shoulder to lean on.
Trump rectum uvlight with bleach flush suits U üëå
If Trump needs to postpone the election it's because he's too inept to fix any problems in the next 3 months. If he's screwed it up beyond what he can fix, too bad.
Take trump rectum uvlight with bleach flush ICU in 2 weeks üëå
Also, $760M is the tax equivalent of a drop in the ocean (around $2 per American citizen). It‚Äôs fine to hate Trump, but do it for a good reason.
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
Normally I'd say the incumbent almost always wins but boy everyone really really hates trump. And he hasn't won any new voters but lost a ton. So idk
After Clinton and Obama, truly GREAT public speakers, Trump and his 35-word vocabulary would have would have lost him the election for certain.
I am SO glad that Trump didn't go to the Lewis funeral. Between his 35-word vocabulary and need to make everything about him, it would have been difficult.
You know it‚Äôs Sean Hannity when he won‚Äôt cover the biggest news story of the day (Trump suggesting delaying the election). Grow a pair, Sean. It‚Äôs okay to disagree with him.
Unlike he did for Rep. Lewis, Trump WILL make time to honor Mr. Cain.
Screw Bob Ferguson..  he and inslee put Washington citizens in danger daily with their radical leftist propaganda..  and they cry about Trump instead of fixing the GANG violence raging through king county
MADNESS! Illegal, unprecedented.  Leaders who delay elections, 'suspend' their constitutions, abridge the rights of their citizens, and send armed thugs to accost citizens are called many things:  Strongman, Despot, Dictator, Tyrant, and now: Trump. #GeneralissimoTrump
The Trump is who wants you out of the country. You just voted for your own export.
The only thing I have to add to that is Trump is what republicans wanted to be once out of the closet. I mean.... with 96% plus approval rating amongst the Republican Party.
Have you seen trump walk down a Fucking ramp?
We are approaching the most dangerous moment this country has faced since 1864. We must be ready for anything.
I also think - from the hours of video via social media - that America as more dangerous under Trump than it has been in decades
Hold it!!! You must be protected UNLESS you are speaking??? As a RN in the OR since 1987, I never ONCE had to take my mask off to speak nor did ANYONE!! Such MISGUIDED INFORMATION!!! AND YOU DARE TO TALK ABOUT TRUMP!! PELOSI we are onto YOU!! FAILURE
Wow!!! What a leader!!! That has always been the recommendation! Did you really think because you are a high and mighty Representative that that made you exempt??? It is now almost AUG and you are finally getting on board!! How DARE you talk about TRUMP!!!
He must be one of the biggest liars in the world, along with  Trump and Putin, quite an achievement
Again, if the people run government poorly maybe we will all just get rid of it. Seems to be the tRump Admin motto. Jan 2021 better have some definitive election results.
Election delay.  Hey - I've got an idea. Those 150,000 dead people? Let's assume they would vote for Biden and just hand over those votes over to Joe. After all, if it weren't for Trump, they might still be alive.
What a joke.  This isn‚Äôt an accolade.  It‚Äôs no different than Trump telling u he‚Äôs leading in a lot of polls.  GTFOH
Maybe he was a Russian "sleeper" agent, planted decades ago, helped up the ladder of what has passed for success? Let's face it, Trump will sleep with anyone... Maybe Trump's handler was always Putin, from the earliest days in the KGB? #ConspiracyTheoriesRus
She is part of the Trump 2020 campaign! ü§£ü§£ü§£
Trump and American PATRIOTS has Canada PATRIOTS backs. You guys need to lock and load.
They're not all pedos. But they all have full blown AIDS! Aides are full of mischief. Lol. They will be becoming whistleblowers, or going to prison, or even both. Trump, Durham, Lindsay, an army of Inspector Generals, their auditors and grand juries, ain't gonna be messing around
We wondered when you were going to roll out the the old Fred Trump racist dog whistle.... now we know
Matt. Use your common sense, buddy. The corrupted swamp has fucked us all, for decades! Of course it's going to fight back. Look at all they've been doing! Just that should open your eyes! Trump PROMISED he would drain the swamp, helping us all. Get behind him. And your friends!!
And it's GLOBAL baby! The swamp is GLOBAL! No worries. Trump doesn't do anything half ass. It really is going to be Biblical. His plan is 6 months long, just in case he loses. And, what's in place can't be stopped if he wins! Durham and Lindsay Graham's fireworks begin in October
Trump has inspector generals following every penny. Remember? Pelosi insisted on it. Be very careful what you wish for. Yes, the swamp is that deep! From a credible source. Grand juries are formed all over the country! Armies of auditors, under inspector generals! Drain the swamp
it is SOOOOO good to see not everyone is getting duped by Trump's bullshit! You've got a new follower! Thank you for telling the REAL truth!!
F the states. They're full of corruption! It's sickening! "Blow 50 Avenues!" Song by Rolling Stones. You can't always git what you want! They are the swamp. Trump's played that song at end of Every rally!
I will b glad to see the truth get out and see some accountability of all those involved. But my guess is that those who r filled with hate 4 Trump will close a blind eye 2 this and continue their rhetoric. They won‚Äôt see the truth if it hit them in the face
Now Trump is going to hate Ohio.
Donald Trump
Not peaceful at all. U must b listening to MSM, that only show the peaceful protesters. But they leave out the rest of the story, just like they always do, cause they love to blame Trump for everything. It‚Äôs hell in Portland and the mayor doesn‚Äôt do anything
Why do think the so called Russian collusion happened? Everything is coming out, u just won‚Äôt hear about it from MSM cause they r bias against trump Didn‚Äôt Schiff say he had full evidence against Trump. Didn‚Äôt happen. Then there was a impeachment. Zero again
If you had to pick one thing about Trump that pisses you off the most, what would it be?
You can post many videos of black people who support trump. Are you saying these are the good blacks you know like oh there‚Äôs some good ones btw most Americans most blacks don‚Äôt support this trashy treasonous President

WOW.  No wonder the Trump campaign has pulled their ads in Michigan
I assure you, Portland would still be there, Trump
Speed doesn‚Äôt mean safe !Trump only cares about being first.Personally I wouldn‚Äôt take anything that isn‚Äôt proven to be safe for everyone.
Don't say trump lol
Trump propaganda trump lies
Trump propaganda lies
decades, highlighting the absurdity of President Trump‚Äôs claim that millions of non-citizens voted in the 2016 election alone. A vast majority of fraud ‚Äúexamples‚Äù cited by the Heritage Foundation would not be addressed by the voter suppression laws its staff supports, including
I just rushed a donation to help Nancy Pelosi hold the House and make sure Trump is always held accountable. Join me and chip in, too!
Anyone: says anything Trump: no one likes meeeeeee
is right. There was a long struggle for the soul of the GOP. The Dark Side began to take control around 2010 and Trump sealed the deal. Only massive losses will get their attention now.
When the burn down Republican Party group of never Trump finish their suicide pact. They will be relegated to obscurity. They have grandios beliefs in themselves,no one else does. If their followers had backing they would  be in power now not Trump.
How much did it take for you to sell your soul to Trump?  Distancing from him was wise - opening your mouth now - not so much
The drug has been used for many yrs. and they have found that it has been affective in treating the early stages of covid. This isn‚Äôt really about the drug, it‚Äôs about those who hate Trump and will down play anything he says even if he found a cure
Trump is not the blame for a virus that originated in China. Plus they hid information to the outside world and allowed ppl to come and go not knowing they had it. Our state received the 1st case of covid from China.
Barr was stellar. He's a very patient man. Perfect because the swamp just keeps getting deeper and deeper. Trump doesn't do anything half ass. By the way. The swamp is GLOBAL. It really is going to be Biblical.
It's pretty stupid to piss off the Attorney General when he's about to help Trump drain the swamp! Every one of those Dems are now in his cross hairs!
!!!!!!! They censored Trump for basically saying the following.
GRAHAM and MCCONNELL  You guys are running out of time. When Trump crashes and burns he's going to be pissed. You two know that when Trump fails he ALWAYS finds someone to blame. You two will be the headliners. Ditch Trump now while you have the chance.  #blameshifterTrump
You guys are running out of time. When Trump crashes and burns he's going to be pissed and he's going to take as many as possible down with him.  You know this - he ALWAYS finds someone to blame for his failures. You two will be the headliners.
The virus travelled to  Europe first then US so why then didn‚Äôt Trump shut entries from Europe as well as China.He had plenty notice.Not too  he has to take the responsibility as president.He doesn‚Äôt seem to do that unless it suits him
Keep trying to convince yourself about Trump being the best president ever.After November you will be a nobody and you will be known as someone NOT to trust.Cant wait.
Kaitlin Collins is the best .Not scared to ask difficult questions and stands her ground.Trump has no way of dealing with a powerful woman,so he walks away like the coward he is.
The swamp is GLOBAL baby! Be ready! Lock and load! Get organized! Trump has a plan! He needs citizen militias as a tool! Get ready people! It's a going to be Biblical. And we are all going to be involved! Be part of the team! Lock load and get organized!!!
DNA from aliens and Trump didn‚Äôt argue with that.Of course he is a bumbling fool and then he runs away because he can‚Äôt answer the question.He is a fool and if you can‚Äôt see that then you are one too.
Well, big pharma or Donald Trump?  Since Trump lies all the time I think Big Pharma is probably telling the truth! #LoserTrump #CorruptTrump
Peaceful protests?  Lol You mean riots.  Dinslee didn't do anything, if Trump wants them back they'll return.
What is the 8 billion for F-35 fail And tRump said 2.5 trillion spent on the military so no!
If only AG Barr had a concious! But he is a Trump puppet who is ready and willing to stomp all over the peoples rights to appease the narcissistic president.
Read the story and click on the poll.  These are the worst numbers I have ever seen for Rs in WA.
Of course Trump is going to lose WA, but these are the worst numbers I have ever seen for Republicans here.
#WhyIDontLikeTrump rape:    racism:   homophobia and transphobia:
Really?  Then maybe you should talk to Trump about fixing the Covid problem rather than supressing testing results.
Beautiful creature but don‚Äôt tell the Trump boys.They love killing.
Of course not.  He will say anything but it won't help him.  Just remember everyone tRump lies, lies and lies some more. Get out and VOTE
I, for one, want the report to come out. I‚Äôm curious. It ain‚Äôt gonna save Trump anyways.
Michelle Obama!! Wouldn‚Äôt that be sweet! Double BOOM on that POS trump!
I don't have a problem with this man being Trump's doctor. What is the problem?
Yes! Then there's kiss-ass JJ "LikesToWatch" Jordan &amp; his propagandist video montage of only violent opportunists during protests against the lynching of George Floyd. 1Repugnant disgusting Jordan. What a liar. Barr is trump's go-to guy for sidestepping the Constitution.
Why Trump's invasion of Portland is textbook fascism
Losing the stress such a narcissistic asshat has laid on this country. Voting out- FIRING- McConnell, JORDAN, Graham, the whole cadre of trump apologists. Fascism has NO place in a Democratic society. If we want Democracy writ large, our freedoms must be protected.
JJ "LikestoWatch", trump's favorite conspiracy theorist is such an idiot. Hearing him defend Barr as a martyr is vomit inducing.
Trump is tanking the whole brand. If this continues a lot of Republicans are going go down with the Donald in November.
Can we just get a break from political commentary!!!  Signed, not a Trump Supporter!
I can't stand Trump, but this is a fun post, so posting yet one more political comment where it doesn't belong is out of line.
Twitter is fucking with me every way you can imagine. They took down another Trump tweet. I think Barr is going to be making an announcement about it, starting at 10 am eastern time on CSpan.
This tweet is more than a veiled threat against Trump's life. Everybody report it. Even to the FBI, or secret service if you know how!
guys stop making fun of trump!!! it's illegal!!!! anyways.. #TrumpIsALoser
What's going to trend is Lindsay Graham's October surprise! Durham's investigation is also coinciding with Lindsay's. Grand juries are convened all over the place! From a US Attorney source. Trump had inspector generals following every penny of stimulus $. It's gonna be Biblical.
Where's all the replies? I can only get to just a few! Twitter is doing a lot more than just messing with Trump. A bunch of my followers disappeared and I can't follow but one per day. Twitter banned 200,000 conservative accounts because they had Q in them. Biden must be behind!
All Trump cares about is being first whether it be safe or not.This has to be a vaccine for the world and should never be about the money.Everyone should be able to get it. Can‚Äôt see Trump agreeing to that .
Whatever she did doesn‚Äôt condone 3 big stormtroopers using that much brutality.I can just see Trump sitting in his big chair grinning from ear to ear watching this thinking ‚ÄúWhat a great guy I am‚Äù..Sorry little man you are a dictator.
Story of Seattle denial: First just assert that they are ‚Äúpeaceful protestors‚Äù and it‚Äôs the ‚Äúsummer of love.‚Äù Second blame Trump. 3rd watch the rioters come and destroy where you live.
Still haven‚Äôt reduced the size of protesting and riots. OH YEAH, that‚Äôs because the left sees potential political gain in letting all of that continue. Logic: let‚Äôs trash our own cities while virtue signaling coronavirus responses, blame it all on Trump and maybe win in November
This says it has 9 replies. Yet I can only get to 3 of them. This is another way Twitter is throttling us. Also it keeps taking me to the top of the threads away from what I was working on! Trump needs to nationalize Twitter. I think Barr can find him the authority.
So far in the conversation I don‚Äôt see any examples to backup her claim.  In fact I can get no one to give examples.  They just spout out that Trump is racist and sexist.  Nothing to follow it up with.
Where have u been? Trump stopped flights coming from China at the end of Jan. Of course he was called a racist and xenophobic by the democrats and MSM. Covid would b worse if democrats ran this country. Look at N.Y. city putting covid pat. In nursing homes
It wouldn't be a Trump Tweet without UNFAIR in it somewhere. The guy is such a whiner.
Mr Lewis was the wrong complexion for Trump.
They were pretending to support Bernie because that is who Trump wanted to run against. He wanted Bernie because of the ‚Äúsocialism factor‚Äù believing Bernie would lose on his platform.
Just a campaign rally for trump
Trump attending the funeral of a Black person? Hahahahaha!!!
I don't trust tRump he lies and that vaccine could be water or something a whole lot worse. DON'T TRUST HIM, NEVER WILL
can someone explain to me why we hate on people‚Äôs personal design preferences?? my feeling is tht as long as it isn‚Äôt appropriation or centered around hate (like having ur room decorated w/ trump flags ü§¢) then dont shame them for having a different aesthetic
No its actually perfect for Trump.. Love seeing the f listers
My favorite thing about trump is his neck pussy
And I love that you admit you live a cult life. Obsessed with Donald trump and Q must be amazing to blindly follow a criminal and conspiracy theories.
Propaganda by trump so yes Dump Trump
You have no clue old man your so dated on your outlook of the Americans of today your the reason for all these protest‚Äôs black lives do matter not just to the black, brown, people but to all the people We will show you in November with the Dump Trump movements
thinking about doing some political comedy. maybe  ‚Äòing trump in this/maybe the GOP
If you defeat Trump, but leave the rest of them in office, you get four years of gridlock, and then Cruz, Cotton, Carlson or Ivanka as the nominee in 2024. I don‚Äôt think the GOP is coming back; but I KNOW it won‚Äôt come back unless the current structure is obliterated. 3/3
I am firmly in the Burn it All Down camp because the GOP was sick and wrong BEFORE Trump came along. 1/3
If you're talking to me, no, I don't agree slavery was necessary. Only pointing out that Rep Cotton said what was quoted. He came out later and tried to BACKTRACK it, saying something like; I didn't say that, I said this. But, multiple sources refute it. This is what Trump does.
Blaming the federal government and Trump for riots and destruction in Seattle is absurd. There have been riots and looting in Seattle for months, and for years before recent events. You can‚Äôt blame Trump for your failure to protect communities in Seattle.
It's amazing to watch these morons getting there heads kicked in, trump troops are amazing
See what the Dems and fake news has us thinking about each other. We need to rebuke them loudly! And the loudest thing we can do is reelect President Trump in a huge landslide! And flip the house. And gain some Senate seats. And elect more republican governors!
Most notable take-away from this clip? Trump is SO easily played. They say the easiest person to sell is a salesman. Apparently, the easiest person to con is a conman.
This is all you have!......the entire hopes of Donald Trump's reelection and this is all you have. Y'all are in serious trouble.....down in FL, TX, AZ NC.......and this is all you have. I'd be upset if I was going to vote Trump and saw all the I'll work that isn't being done.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump is a Russian asset.
Tha fact that we need to say that Nazis are bad shows how much damage Trump has done to America.
Outdoor and asymptomatic spread is EXTREMELY RARE! According to the WHO and Fauci bitch! This is all only to take down Trump! Easy research gets you the facts that back up my statement. Also BLM/ANTIFA! It's time for America to stand up to all this crap!
Actually. The revolution IS habbening! We were patiently gathering intelligence on their global and local supporters. We have it. Feds are a pre-placement of assets for mass arrests of the swamp! Trump's administration are geniousses. Even mayor's are getting out of the way!
Trump is going to win with huge landslide.  Bigger than last time.
Exactly.  The base loves Trump and AGREES with Trump
Trump is talking healthcare.  You need to remind people -  4 years ago Trump promised the "best healthcare" 3 years ago he STOPPED talking about it With an election 100 days away, guess what?  Remind people - TRUMP HAS DONE NOTHING FOR THEM FOR 3-1/2 years.
The democrats r the ones who have failed the ppl. I was one who lost my insurance plan due to ACA. I‚Äôm a cancer survivor and I ended up paying more out of pocket expenses. U need to look at yourselves before judging trump
Yeah, but the first sentence of that story would be, Trump has to crawl out of the west wing TV room and do some work, so it‚Äôd be pure speculative fiction!
The remaining GOP followers of Trump are stupid, brainwashed, and/or desperately afraid of the menace.
I blindly voted for Trump four years ago and am disgusted with myself for doing so. I do know that there are many who did the same and are now working to correct that mistake and vote him out in November. Btw, my eyes were opened about the guy long before covid.
Trump is an American Virus. Spreading his disease nation wide. Symptoms are calling people snowflakes while having a meltdown. Listening to politicians before scientists and disguising their nationalism/racism with patriotism.
And by the way it's now known as "THE TRUMP VIRUS".
Exactly looks like a bad cast for Dancing With The Stars
Exactly what Trump did!
A win win..   #LawAndOrder
Stacy Dash, Kristy Swanson, Vince McMahon, Kurt Suzuki,Aubrey Huff,The Cast of Duck Dynasty..
Trump propaganda.  Can‚Äôt even write without being unbiased.
Good..   we thank them and president Trump for defending Seattle..   #Trump2020Landslide
My question is why does Trump say he and Xi have a great relationhip?  Why does he allow Russia to get away with everything and assist them by ignoring the threat to kill our soldiers? We have yet to see an answer to those questions.
It has already been determined by the DOJ, under Trump, they did so legally.  He just is not accepting those results ad is using it as propaganda.
You mean if you don‚Äôt agree with a Trump you‚Äôre not a patriot?What a stupid stupid statement but then we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised.Out of the mouths of idiots ....
He sounds like Trump!

The Reagan Family nor the Foundation wants anything to do with Trump - lol! I don‚Äôt blame them one bit!
trump got his wall
My credit still sucks, didn't get my stimulus check thanks to tRump's "tax cut" (I owe several thousand) and I can't get any sort of loan. It's 2009 all over again.
I don‚Äôt blame them one bit. Who in the hell wants to have their name associated with Donald Trump? I would think only those that worship him and everything he does and says.

They awarded him because of the money he donated to those organizations. They weren‚Äôt dumb.. they wanted to keep that cash flowing. Trump still mad about no positive time magazine cover and the Noble peace prize. Obama receiving both cuts him deep.
Let‚Äôs wait and see i, not you in particularly you NicküòÇ, when Trump wears a tan suit or uses a selfie stick. We might see some concern. Because republicans said tan suits and selfie sticks aren‚Äôt ‚Äú dignified‚Äù &amp; beneath the officeüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Don‚Äôt care what you think of the man. Black folks have gotten over what conservatives think about Obama. You asked for an example of Trump‚Äôs racism that I perceive and I gave you one.... ‚Äú birtherism‚Äù. Stay in the context of you‚Äôre own question.
Nick.. why do you take statements personally as if we are speaking specifically of you? Let‚Äôs clear the air.. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre racist because I don‚Äôt know you. I don‚Äôt think you support Trump because he‚Äôs racist becasue I don‚Äôt know you. Although, I think he is. We good now?
I did pretty damn well before Trump Nick... the atmosphere Trump has NOT created... but cultivated... has me worried for my black sons and sometimes, even myself. Minorities will let you know when ‚Äúthings‚Äù are going in the right direction with all sure respect.This image alone will re-elect Trump if used correctly!
tRump only surrounds himself with fellow pedo/child rapists/traffickers &amp; white supremacists.   They say you are the company you keep. #GhislaineMaxwell  #AlanDershowitz #EpsteinCoverup
If you truly support Biden, then vote Biden, not because he isn‚Äôt Trump. If you support Trump, vote Trump. If you support third party, vote third party. But don‚Äôt infringe upon Democracy, the right to make your own vote. And don‚Äôt stop others trying to inform the public.
If all the Biden supporters who can‚Äôt tell me how he is a better candidate other than ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt Trump‚Äù realized that they could choose a different option, like 3rd party.... The 3rd party would win. Don‚Äôt contribute to the cycle.

You aren‚Äôt looking then, every president has drama and scandals. both Trump and Obama, and Bush etc. Don‚Äôt pretend either is perfect
U.S. Economy Drops 32.9% In Worst GDP Report Ever  4,577,000 infected, 154,000 Dead  Not once has trump stood up to putin, even when putin pays to kill our troops  And trump has been the most divisive president in modern history.
Except protesters are wearing maks (at least until the cops tear them off their faces) and passing out hand sanitizer. Not going to a trump rally saying "masks dumb."
Trump‚Äôs hard hitting and unapologetic candor about putting America first is absolutely refreshing.
I think she‚Äôs grand but not for VP against Trump.
Trump kills 150k Americans now qualifies as worst leader the world has ever seen, but 4 deaths, better flip out, tons of investigations that found no wrong doing was done, but never to mention any of Trumps other crimes? Wait, What? No Tan Suit Scandal Marker? Sad, Low Energy.
God love her, I admire her for getting out there and doing her thing.
I know, that's what I was thinking
Right?!!!
Inspired by Trump?
If Trump was president at that time it would not have worked...
I am AMAZED that a majority of people think Trump and Republicans are better on economy.  We have a lot of STUPID people out there.  Obama and Dems got us out of the Bush recession. Biden and Dems can get us out of #TrumpRecession #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
You are grasping at straws. You're trying to find anything that will destroy the Republicans  and you are failing miserably.  The Democrats attempt to mess up the election of trump is ridiculous.  No matter what you do, he is going to fight you.  Be stronger and fuck him
Yet all of your posts are political.   How much is Trump paying you to suck his dick??
It‚Äôs a moral obligation to *oppose* evil, to not tolerate the intolerant.  Hate is entirely optional, although Trump does make that especially easy.
It‚Äôs only Thursday what the hell are they doing leaving for the weekend? Right so Trump can go golfing again on taxpayer money.
The riots are starting to backfire on the Democrats. They have to move the goalposts again.
When a Republican loses the Federalist Society then they may as well resign. Besides The Federlist Society has no more need of Trump because #MoscowMitch pushed through their list of judges to the federal bench. Now it‚Äôs time they flush the turd.
Obama reminds everybody why Trump won.
God. Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He‚Äôs mistaken; it was the Trump virus.
#WeWillVote....If I had to take my last breath turning in my vote against Trump, it would be worth it!  For our salvation. For America. üá∫üá∏
Can you imagine..he had to lay there in regret, guilt, &amp; humility. My concern is that trump supporters are going to disregard his death because he is a black man.
Although he was against trump from the beginning, his party created the vacuum and the processes for a trump to win.  This has been happening for years, before the theft of the election in 2000, the hostages in Iran, and more.  He said on tv, he is only "loitering" on our side
tRump &amp; his CULT call THIS ......... .....winning.
We all know this isn't how it works. Only Congress can make that call.  But the Trump administration doesn't care about norms or law.  You know they will do this, law be damned. The house will object, but their objection has to get past the Senate (completely committed to Trump).
Trump supporters should protest by not voting, then use the hashtag #savingmyvoteforlater on social media.
If you think Trump is trying to ‚Äúinstall a dictatorship‚Äù then you don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs happening. You literally can‚Äôt see past what‚Äôs right in front of your face. Open your eyes or get some glasses.
We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party‚Äôs Soul Long Ago
So here in Washington our ballots have 2 be post marked by election day. Why is that not the case everywhere else? I hope postal workers ignore this request. I mean trump is trying 2 dismantle the institution u work 4. U want 2 keep ur job, get those ballots where they need 2 go!
He never used the hospital ship COMFORT - he hates Trump so much he killed the seniors.
Trump killed Cain!!
Trump is trolling the left so hard Jerry Nadler actually woke up!  "The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States."
For sure! Me too! Counting down the months, the days, the hours, the minutes, the seconds....Until I drop my mail in ballot to the mailbox. Did you hear me tRump? MAIL IN BALLOT! ü§£
Did trump really just support another pizza place immediately after Herman Cain died?
No, you don't. Trump is trolling, nothing more.
I live in a vote-by-mail state. Trump votes by mail.
Conservatives, too! His trolling will be cited by every Trump-hater in the world, and is hard to defend. He‚Äôs gotta get some discipline and stop these unforced errors!
The same way that some black people support trump.
"The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." Rest In Peace Herman Cain #COVID19

There needs to be a Donald Trump thesaurus.   Fucking piece of shit that needs to be stepped on, drawn and quartered and flushed to the center of the earth to burn for eternity   Does not seem strong enough

When a man betrays their country he will do anything to keep from being caught. Does anyone honestly believe #TraitorTrump and the #TraitorGOP are going allow a fair election or accept the results if they lose? Benedict Arnold fled to England his betrayal. Trump has nowhere to go
How could they test him when his head is up Trump‚Äôs ass? Barr is so far up there he has first taste of whatever Trump eats.
Trump talking about anything related to the medical field, sounds like a seven year old when they hear part of an adult conversation and go tell all the other kids.
Oh, and here's me thinking that was Trump's newest press secretary. Nope. My bad. That's Mac-a-ninny.
Trump opened that door a long time ago. Now the door is wide open with a giant osmium door stopper.
Hmm there are a lot of variables.   Pros and Cons to each. If Biden wins liberals will turn on us and embrace modern Republican values.  If Trump wins we-- more or less-- stay united in opposition. Lots of dissatisfied citizens marching in the streets sounds like the cure to me.
You lost me :-/. What's Trump have to do with this??
Gee, if their republicans would have forced better oversight of the ppp then the small businesses the programs were meant for would have access to money to make it through the shutdown. No, Trump and Mnuchin hooked up themselves and their cronies to cash.

I see Facebook is letting the Trump agenda run wild on Instagram now too.  My discover tab is full of pro-Trump bullshit.  Where would they ever get the idea I would vote for that asshole?  Don‚Äôt ruin Instagram too.  #Instagram #Facebook
Yep, Trump is a straight up trader.
Agreed.  Trump was sent from God to save the world.   Everything he says is absolutely true
President Trump ought to stay in his own area..doctors are doctors..they are more intelligent in medicine science than our President..please think about what is the best to do..stop the virus..believe authorities...
Is t that how we ended  up the one person more widely regarded as more repulsive than Trump last time?
Yes. I let some Trumpers (they were in full Trump gear) show my dog love yesterday in Total Wine. My dog is a therapy dog in training. He doesn't care about politics. So I just stayed quiet.
Of everyone I know, I think two, like Trump, and both are lost in lala land, once a conspiracy nut. So...odd how all the people I know who I always thought smart &amp; rational can't stand Trump.
Rhetorically questioning, how is the market growing at a time when the unemployment is so high, the virus is spreading and the economy is being boosted by unemployment benefits about to be cut?  You can be the propping up will end when trump loses.  Market does not equal economy.
What preceded Trump's rise to power?  Obama/Biden. They promised #Change but didn't deliver, so when they left the American public was still THIRSTY for change.   In comes Mr. Fake Populous, Trump.

Today I shared on FB that they shouldn‚Äôt open up the Highschool cuz of the corona virus. A trump supporter tried to argue with me, but I shut her down, telling her she couldn‚Äôt change my views. I literally attended the school for 4 years. I wasn‚Äôt gonna tolerate someone who...
Other than, ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt trump.‚Äù Is there any actual reasons to vote for Biden? Because I‚Äôm seriously confused why so many have gotten behind him. Rather than the Majority choosing third party, the Majority is yet again siding with America Incorporated. Please, someone explain.
And if we bring in Biden they'll all say the problems with his presidency is that Trump dug us into a big hole and Saint Biden is working with Wall Street to get the country back on it's feet!
Trump comes off as a tad more extreme but honestly we could flip a coin and come to a satisfactory conclusion.
Ok, but like, there‚Äôs NO WAY he doesn‚Äôt understand how racist and classist this is, right? I know trump is a moron, but he understands what he just tweeted, RIGHT?!??

Can the mask just come off? Im tired of the trump administration trying to act like the good guy. They already proved there untouchable untill nov 4 possibly.
It's disgusting and shameful that the  has lowered their aspirations to the point of offering nothing more than "not Trump". It follows that if there were a candidate slightly worse than Trump, they'd lower themselves to Trump level to match.
Why I said that is the that Donald Trump wished that lady well when she is found to be trafficking sexual misconduct of little girl and his father was Klu Klux Klan member..sad day for republicans when they are being excused daily for these type of exploits..

Trump missed a real opportunity. Think of how much his base would have bragged about how presidential he is if this had been him. But NOPE! Instead, this is a photo of a REAL president and First Lady.

Just because we bash Biden on a regular basis doesn't mean we are Pro Trump.  He's our defacto leader. Are we not allowed to question or harass those individuals who want to be president?  Both deserve intense scrutiny, period.
America and Americans do need to be taught a lesson: the lesser of two evils is no longer palatable.   Millennials/Independents don't show up for anything less than inspirational.   Status Quo politics/politicians are toxic. They produce a byproduct called: Trump.
Trump's plan: Start World War Three and tell the American public that it's not the "right time" for an election.   That because of mail-in votes the whole thing is more rigged than usual and cannot be trusted.  Pepper in enough half truths and leaps in logic and presto!
This image is a little terrifying. Any chance your show can look into exactly how much the Trump administration is cooking the numbers?
We're working on it, Mr. Ambassador! Please keep using your platform to expose  crass politicization of the COVID hysteria. He wants to hurt as many people as possible as a means of hurting Trump, and for no other reason.  It's not about a virus! It's about November!
Trump won because DC was nose blind to Clinton
I just separate what someone does on the track vs off the track. Trump is 100% a racist.  No denying that.  Just I don‚Äôt let who someone supports politically sway my opinion in deciding who my favorite driver is.
#ClimateBarbie admits he‚Äôs driven by popularity polls, not science!   It‚Äôs not about a virus, it‚Äôs about Trump in November!
Brad Pitt about Trump.
Why the hell?
Trump has falsely blamed his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, for the policy that saw thousands of children separated from their parents.   Meanwhile, at least six migrant children have died in US custody since September 2018.
After widespread backlash, Trump issued an executive order in June 2018 to halt the family separations, and a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite all those it had separated. But the fallout from the separations is ongoing.
The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy on illegal border crossings led to the separations of at least 5,500 families and saw children placed in cages.
Even if Trump is not reelected in 2020, his presidency will continue to have an impact on the direction of the US due to the sheer number of conservative federal judges he's installed.
The president, for example, has taken full credit for steady economic growth that began under the Obama administration. Trump has also repeatedly and wrongly claimed that he's fostered the "greatest economy" in US history.
Donald Trump began his term as one of the most unpopular presidents in the modern era and he remains so.  His approval rating is just 37%, according to Gallup . Presidents Barack Obama (50%), George W Bush (58%) and Bill Clinton (54%) were all higher at this point.
The newly leaked schedules show that Trump typically starts his day with three hours of ‚Äúexecutive time‚Äù between 8-11 a.m. and doesn‚Äôt tend to have any professional engagement lasting more than an hour.
He‚Äôs visited a Trump Organization property on 278 days as president, about twice a week on average. 159 of those days were weekends ‚Äî meaning that 119 were weekdays. And no weekday was more common for a Trump visit than Friday.
there has been no week that Trump has been president in which his official schedule began at or before 9 a.m. on Monday and ended at or after 5 p.m. on Friday
I will vote because trump is evil. Is not enthusiasm sorry. Its necessary.
Of course they are. These liberal ultra-progressive governors don't want the Trump administration doing their jobs for them and showing their constituents how feckless Democrats are at managing large cities. True leadership comes in the form of conservatism. Period.

Maybe more big businesses seeing their shipping overhead going up, lots of packages and mail delayed, will get them pushing the Trump admin to stop this sabotage.
Donald Trump claims to be "concerned" about mail-in voting fraud and a rigged election. Reality is that the GOP has been rigging elections for years by stripping away voting rights such as by closing polling places in predominantly Democratic areas.
Can we please not allow acknowledgement of how uniquely terrible Trump is to transition into reverence for past presidents that were still awful
That's a good list... Trump's numbers are "better" than Obama's. He always win. He is better. This competition means the world to him. Thank you for that. But again, how does it make someone support tyranny? We forget why trump got impeached already? Obama was not perfect, who is
Its really hard to restrain myself from jumping to the reply thread under any trump tweet. Theres so many white boys that are just trying to pwn sjws, so many racist vitriolic grammas, and people who decided "brain in the trash for today"
I have a question. What are all you Trump haters going to do when he's reelected?
I will fucking riot if this is allowed. And I‚Äôm a pacifist.  Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility

Id say trump, because the inner circle using him to achieve their laundry list of greed will do everything to keep him in "power" for them
So trump‚Äôs plan is to hold this country hostage. So we now know what his plans are. How do we stop him? How do we stop him from declaring martial law and suspending the election? This sounds like free campaign time for trump. How do we stop this?
Trump sounds like he is suffering from delusions. What he is saying is not true. He‚Äôs telling how he is going to try to steal the election, steal our country. We want evidence, not just #BULLSHIT. Evidence.
Even For just admitted that. Trump can't even get the lipstick near the pig.
This moron is way too late with way too little. No trust in trump. Make a deal with Barr, save your family. Do time instead of them. Will never happen. Come on, B-actor, snarl and growl for us.     #BULLSHIT
The old conman is floundering, in a panic, realizing how little he really knows. Trump is responsible for thousands of deaths. We have to elect  in 2020.  has a heart, has a soul,  has my trust. Vote
I've tweeted twice and have a copy on my hard drive.  Carlin knew how this country works. He would have done a 2 hour standup doing nothing but ranting about Trump well before the end of his first year in office.
Let's get something straight here...  The poor The elderly Minorities People with pre-existing health conditions  These are the people who are #dyingforTrump.  They didn't choose to die, Trump and his mentally impaired cult helped to spread #COVID19.  #TrumpGenocide
Unbelievable that this tweet from Pelosi only got 49,000 likes and Trump‚Äôs tweet got 183,000 likes. I think he‚Äôs got a bunch of bots liking his tweets. I sure hope so.
Yet, we should take his tweets seriously. Have you been around the last 3 1/2 years? People just need to do their homework and know that Trump cannot do anything about when this election happens.
You‚Äôve got my vote. WA voting has never been better-run, easier, or more universal than it is now, with global mail-in. From Trump‚Äôs POV the problem has to be that it‚Äôs too easy for his deniers - he can‚Äôt stand that it minimizes the pain associated with voting him off the island.
Trump won‚Äôt step in, he hasn‚Äôt stepped in for soldiers with bounties on their heads. He kisses Putin‚Äòs ass. He doesn‚Äôt care about Americans.
And one person of color, at the very end of the line. The line sums up the Trump voter
That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I would love Trump to be thrown in jail, he deserves to be thrown in jail. And Trump is not far left. You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre talking about.
Good job,     Now if you could just do this to all of Trump's tweets, that'd be great.  Thanks!
It seems that when you are a member of the  team, you are not immune to the "prevarication pandemic" that is part &amp; parcel of the Trump regime.    "Truth" is whatever they say it is.  You only need to remember  offering "alternative facts" in 2017!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha omg trump is a misogynist, a homophobe, a rapist, a bully, an islamophobe, an idiot the one thing he is NOT is a leader
His term ends in January.  If no election, Pelosi becomes temp POTUS.  Trump has never read the Constitution.  But you can bet it all that he has read the first REAL internal polling info released, and he knows his numbers are worse than he has been told.

Are there still people pretending Trump is not a fascist?   I'm not being hysterical or dramatic whatsoever, and I'm not saying we live under a fascist system, but Trump's political ideology is, clearly, fascism.
WHY is it I rarely see President Trump's tweets directly? I see a retweet, or I hear about one on the news and have to go to his page to find them! Today's joke about the accusations he would postpone the elections is an example.
When Trump stole the presidency.
I feel you, but I sure af don't want 4-8 years of Pence. I'd like to be able to enjoy Trump's suffering properly lol
I have a theory about this. I think if Trump goes down, Pence is the candidate of the GOP, and I don't think Biden beats Pence. Pence isn't "Trumpy" enough to push away Never Trumpers. Trump dying right now may actually not be better.
Being Black for Trump literally killed Herman Cain.

Hey, America voted during the Civil War, so we can do this. I understand your fear and confess that I‚Äôm feeling horrible anxiety, but if we give in to fear, Trump wins. No fracking way.
No, he shouldn‚Äôt b/c that would give the GOP time to offer up a more legit candidate who could potentially beat Biden.  Plus, I wanna see trump get his fat ass kicked. üò¨ #WeWillVote
It really is wild to see Trump doubling down on racism. Also wild: 1/3 of the country is hardcore into it, which doesn't overlap the plurality that will still vote for him and his racist actions because "being racist isn't as bad as being pro-choice" as much as you'd think.
In another unsurprising excuse to install himself as America‚Äôs first dictator, F√ºrer Trumpery is considering delaying the election AND not accepting results if he loses.
I distinctly recall a number of people voting for Trump because ‚Äúhe says what he means‚Äù. I agree   When someone tells you who they are, believe them.   #TrumpIsAFascist
"But he can't do that," they say, not acknowledging the many other things Trump "can't" do that he's already done.
Yesterday Barr declared that Congress had delegated census responsibilities to the commerce secretary, so he was free to define individuals as citizens. What's to stop Trump/Barr from claiming Congress delegated some part of elections to a cabinet secretary, and declare a move?
Is this the template for delaying the election? Everyone is now saying "Trump can't move the election, only Congress can", but what if Barr decides that Congress has delegated some election responsibilities to a cabinet secretary, and thus they can change it?
A Trump appointed ambassador mourinig dead Nazis. If someone had wrote this in a story we'd all thing it was way too heavy-handed.  But here we are, in reality.
No delay in the election. This idiot is going down. We must elect a new president. Our country can‚Äôt stand anymore disaster from trump. Vote  in 2020, vote blue, vote pro USA.

Trump is basically daring Dems to impeach him again while he actively dismantles systems of democracy.
So, the Republicans are in power. Look at the death around you. Realize how you feel, people. This is straight up propaganda. Donald Trump Jr. defines the term idiocy. Pathetic, traitor.
Depends what your view of America is but I am game for a conversation about when Trump did something for someone else. I have never thought to research that but would be nice to set things straight. Again, this is a biased topic to start, it's based upon a biased view.
Zero accountability for all of the beatings and illegal activity of the secret Trump police because this country won't protect its citizens rights for shit.
She also managed to be divisive and blame trump, as always.
Nope. Trump made all #blacklivesmatter protesters antifa so he could deem them domestic terrorists. Then as people starting thinking he speaks truth, they come out with aggression towards people peacefully protesting racial injustice. Trump propaganda to convince the uneducated

GOOD NEWS,  supporters!   Trump says he's leading in all the right places, based on his own polls.   So this means you DON'T NEED TO VOTE in November!  He already has all the votes he will need to win and, everything is under control! :-)

GOOD STUFF! 07/29/20: President Trump Delivers Remarks Upon Departure  via
The really scary part is that you don't have to look very hard to see the parallels. 5 years ago, if I had told you that Donald Trump's secret police would be abducting American citizens, you probably would have laughed. The normalization of evil doesn't happen overnight.
how does Trump's cum taste.
Trump threatens an all out invasion of #Portland by his #GOPGestapo. Who is still laboring under the delusion that this is about protecting federal buildings from graffiti?  America is about to pay a very high price for ignoring experts' warnings.
Fuck Trump 2020
kill me now.
Trump will gaslight his base with the riot delusion while he continues to push the envelope with his #GOPGestapo.  This is why our enemies wanted him installed. We ignored experts and now #Fascism has the high ground. Things are going to get much worse.
The kind of shit the police should doing to prevent unwanted violence. We still have to do their job because reform hasn't worked. We were confronted with aggression because trump makes every protest a riot
Sociopaths see people as objects. You will never see Trump express true empathy for another human being because he's simply incapable of it. In fact, he enjoys the suffering he causes. Remember this one?
In 2016,  wrote quite well about the likelihood that Trump would dismantle the Executive Branch of the Federal government. Today we once again hear direct evidence of what we have been witnessing with our own eyes.
Love your tweets but to say that Trump "is not a good man" is a vast understatement. His mind is broken in such a way that he's a danger to every living thing on this planet. The longer he remains in office, the worse things will get.
1) Barr is the biggest stooge of them all. He stands for Trump, not democracy and certainly not justice. He lied under oath yesterday.  2) Your account is a fake.  3) Bye, bot.
I'm not saying Biden will save America. He may well do very little of value and we get more Trumpism in 2024.  I'm saying that Trump winning in 2020 is effectively a gunshot to Uncle Sam's temple. It's the end of America. You won't get a say in this country ever again.
Susan Collins is as corrupt as her orange master.  *however*  The "Trump stooge" shoe fits every single #Republicon in the senate. They had a chance to convict him and they (except for Romney) chose an oligarchy over democracy.  They've *all* got to go.
You REALLY think that Biden will appoint a ultra-right justice, so we see Roe v. Wade overturned, Obergefell v. Hodges overturned, Lawrence v. Texas overturned? That he'll continue Trump's turning the gov't into loyalist lackeys gutting democracy?  THAT is what's ridiculous.
Shorter: "Trump wishes a return to segregation."
Trump gets a hard question and he acts like he can‚Äôt hear. Looks like trump is in a panick, constantly talking about his re-election campaign. This is trump projecting. Panick, trump, panick. You have a jail cell waiting for you. Gheslaine Maxwell.
What an idiot trump is, and the #GOP follows this idiot. Obviously, the #GOP is full, of cowards or fools. This pro Russian president is letting this country die. The tougher trump tries to be, the more his voice becomes a growl. Maybe that‚Äôs how he handles Putin.
Good ol' rose Twitter is like "sure, Trump is bad, but Biden is worse and we're willing to sacrifice minorities and let America become an authoritarian theocratic state as long as Biden doesn't win."
What a #BULLSHITTER trump is. He is the weakest. Love to see trump flounder, sputter. The strongest Russian president we‚Äôve ever had. This is more #BS from trump. This would leave an lot to compete with trump‚Äôs hotel.

AG Ferguson to Trump Administration: Coronavirus data must be reported to CDC

Thank God, President Trump stopped all the terrorism. Just think of what would happen with one bomb vest, in that crowd that protest. Talk to your counselor about that. It would be pretty scary and a disaster. Control the situation already
The bad part I see, Trump did such a good job of getting rid of terrorists. We don‚Äôt have a person in the middle of that crowd detonating a bomb vest. Think above it
No one will understand any of the debates. Trump will lie as completely and incoherently as usual and Biden isn't sharp enough to go toe-to-toe with him, so he too will be incoherent. It's just going to be a bunch of name calling and tired rhetoric.

He is so cute. Too bad Trump didn't hire him sooner, so much like him!
That would be a nice outcome.  However, the ONLY thing that matters is first getting rid of Trump.  A nice bonus would be an Attorney General that would prosecute him.
Trump has nothing. Trump feels the noose tightening. Trump has the best chance to make a deal for him and his family with B Barr. Make a deal, save your family.
Sounds like Trump is taking another "new tone" in his administration!

Everyone needs to keep up with the protests, stay out in the streets, make sure Biden feels the pressure from the people. Similarly House Reps and Senators hearing from people.   I'm not happy with Biden either, I don't expect much from him. But I'm TERRIFIED about more Trump.
I doubt trump will have anything to do with the drunken  Trump brags about his brother dying from alcoholism. How can trump buddy up with
That's still 4 more years than we get if Trump gets re-elected. 4 more years to *do something* than we get otherwise.
tRump is a #RacistPig!
You know who else doesn't have vulnerable populations in mind? People who are willing to let Trump get re-elected.  I don't think well of people willing to let Trump kill me and my community to "teach the Democrats a lesson".
Not sure why the House Judiciary Committee even asked AG Barr to come testify. They won‚Äôt let him talk. They could have just as well invited in the TV cameras and said every horrible thing they wanted about AG Barr and the whole Trump administrtarion. Would have saved them time.
If Trump wants one, he'll get one. The 2nd Amendment works both ways. Donnie hasn't a clue about the amount of people united against him. He'll lose not only 100s of followers, but at long last, even the GOP will drop him.

What? Restore the rule of law? Explain Roger Stone, explain Michael Flynn. Total #BULLSHIT from Barr. How did Johnson vote during the impeachment hearing? He gave trump a pass. Look, Barr is acting. Barr as a defense attorney, not the AG.
All we want is evidence for all your statements, Barr. Barr is cooperating with trump to scare our population because of the upcoming election. Trump is his boss, Barr works for trump, Barr is working for trump‚Äôs re-election.
This is #BS from Barr. We‚Äôve seen no evidence. This is provocation by the federal government. It‚Äôs obvious from his testimony that Barr is trump‚Äôs lawyer, not lawyer that he took a oath to be. Barr is working to get trump re-elected.

You're right, it was wrong of Trump to politicize a drug he didn't understand in order to create a talking point for his base. The media is looking to the science. And the science doesn't back up these claims:
I imagine Roy Cooper standing on the tarmac at CLT airport.  As they exit the plane, he just says, "You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me."
Hillary was wrong to run knowing how high her disapproval was. DNC should not have thwarted Bernie in 16 he was doing better than Hillary in polls vs Trump. I'll hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden to end the madness but I want better in 2024 or back to 3rd party for me

Uh, yeah, none of that was happening before Trump's goons showed up and none of it is happening now. The rioting has been directed at the federal troops, not private property. Protests were almost gone before Trump incited them back to thousands per night.

You MUST be joking. No protests/riots caused Covid? Really?! But magically, where I'm sure everyone was tested (and had to be NEGATIVE to continue), in TULSA, THAT killed Herman Cain? And furthermore, you blame President Trump? What is WRONG with you? TDS is real.

At this point, I see no reason that Joe Biden should debate Trump. That being said, I'm a political consultant &amp; debate prep is one of my strong areas... if Biden were to debate Trump I would have him stick to simple responses, and let Trump ramble on like the unhinged man he is.

When the Fed. stops propping markets up, when or before trump gets voted out, it should succumb to the force of gravity and plummet. It will probably be a long hard slog getting the economy back with obstruction by any remaining GOP miscreants. Economy may be fine, not s. market.
Thank trump
It is this simple - Trump doesn't really like elections &amp; he certainly doesn't like letting everyone vote. Democracy doesn't really work for the Republicans. With Putin as a mentor it's no wonder he would like to remain in office indefinitely

Trump's right. He has no chance of winning. Time to end American democracy. #MAGA
I don't think that particular reference is to Trump. His hotel chain isn't that large, and I don't think he has one in France.
With all going on in the US...   3mos out from the election, Trump makes clear his entire job is getting re-elected.   Nothing else is being allowed on his desk, by his order.  All strategists are at work, not attend to crises, but to find ways to convince voters to back him.
Trump hats are? Totally agree
I'd hate to do something that Trump thinks is "ridiculous and possibly illegal"! #TrumpHatesScience
As a candidate, Trump had me catfished, blacklisted, and my email hacked.  His people were then trafficking in my personal information.   This is who he is.  This is what he does.

Nixon was crazy paranoid but was extremely adept with foreign policy. Trump is crazy paranoid and soooooo sadly incompetent. #25thAmendment
If a gov postpones the vote, how would that impact that state's electoral votes?  If no vote, no slate of electors chosen, its votes aren't sent to Congress, and not considered in Electoral College?  Seems Trump-friendly govs would increase value of blue states electoral votes.
I do believe they blame Trump for everything. No, seriously.

My mail came at nearly 10pm last night. I felt so bad. Trump and his lap dogs are ruing what was an effective and efficient system.  They needed  funds. Instead of funsing them,he is doing is doing what he knows to do destroy them.That man deserves misery.

The draft Democratic Party platform condemns the Trump administration's policy towards Venezuela and disavows "regime change" as U.S. policy, in a victory for the party's progressive wing.
Worth recalling: In 2015 Scarborough asked Trump why he admired Putin, a leader who ‚Äúkills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries.‚Äù Trump responses that the US was in no position to criticize Putin‚Äôs behavior bwcause ‚Äúour country does plenty of killing also.‚Äù
I‚Äôll never forget interviewing Herman Cain in Nevada in 2015 with  He was very excited about how the primary was going; especially excited about Trump. Never would have imagined this is how things would have gone.
Not many countries will allow you do to what Trump does as well. China also was not build on the same principal and how it was found was not the same revolution in the US. China went from a democracy to communist/dictatorship to capitalistic communism.

Again, how can someone with immense privilege say we should forgo our surest chance of defeating Trump, in favor of a principle that is purportedly in the interest of Black people, but which polls show Black people don't agree with?  We have to beat Trump; Warren's the best shot.
Not just pick Warren for VP, but give her substantial duties in office.  We can't fail to meet this moment. If Biden doesn't get this right, the country will fall apart. Trump did all of this with a good economy; just imagine what can happen if Biden can't handle these crises.
Our country is in an existential crisis. The fascist threat growing under Trump won't end when he's gone. He's given a taste to millions of supporters. The GOP is rife with fascists like Bill Barr &amp; Chad Wolf. It'll only get worse in an economic collapse. Biden must pick Warren.

Trump said this evening that he does not want a date change but objects that challenges could go on for months or years -- delaying the results. We actually have gone through such challenges in Bush v. Gore. However, there is no uncertainty as to the President after Jan. 20th...
Trump wants to build walls in our society. Biden will build bridges to opportunities.   Trump wants to rule by fear and oppression.  Biden will rule by compassion and possibilities.
what‚Äôs the trump angle on this shark attack though?  collusion? y/n
Could Trump bomb his own citizens in order to avoid losing the election?  I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. He has no moral code and an extreme amount of power at his command.  But that‚Äôs what it would take to prevent the election.  He should be removed just for the suggestion.
So for Trump to prevent the election he‚Äôd have to seize through force basically every Secretary of State and Board of Elections in the entire country all at once.  I‚Äôm not sure he could do that even if he had full military support unless he used air strikes.
It‚Äôs been talked about a lot and yes Trump really doesn‚Äôt have the power to stop the election.  Primarily because whichever states hold their elections and certify the results, that‚Äôs the election.  Texas and Florida says they won‚Äôt?   Doesn‚Äôt matter.

You have done NOTHING for MONTHS, then you roll out a crap bill at the last minute which doesn't really help people with $20bil for military and $1.75 bil to stop Trump Tower competition, and now try to blame Dems?  We are NOT buying what you're selling
What the hell are you talking about? Seattle and Portland to mention two cities are democrat controlled and have nothing to do with Trump. The only thing that stopped the burning of federal properties had been because of Trump.
Vote Trump 2020, that's the right thing. I voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him again!
You need to educate yourself! Obama administration spied on Trump's campaign, this can be proven. Trump's campaign plane was bugged at the direction of Obama. How many provable scandals was Obama involved in? How many provable scandals has Trump been involved in?
And it is only going to get worse. Trump has been a train wreck his entire life. He will always make the wrong decision. Always.
A criminal , like Trump
So Trump is pulling his strings again, yay.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The US system of checks and balances will prevent Trump from putting off the election which he thinks he will lose. There is no such system in the UK. Johnson/Cummings could force through a Bill extending the life of Parliament, unless scores of Tory MPs blocked it. Worrying.
Trump talked to Putin recently. Didn't raise the Russian bounties, because they were talking about "different things".  How much you wanna bet this is what they were ginning up?
Hey    why haven‚Äôt you ran this story as much as you pushed the George Floyd story? Sickening how you all are puppets and no longer journalists. Where‚Äôs the outrage from #BLM?
Trump in the bedroom with gonorrhea.
interesting perspective on what's happening on the ground in Portland:
Great. THERE GOES TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP OUR GREAT COUNTRY SAFE FROM LAWLESSNESS AND MAINTAIN OUR HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING. What‚Äôs disgusting Chuck is you and NANCY. You‚Äôre both a national disgrace.
He's going into full 'Trump mode', if I say it, it must be true.  Can this man not say on honest thing, answer one question truthfully or get one thing right?  What a disgrace.  Boris Johnson claims 'massive success' in getting coronavirus deaths down
Trump proposes to delay federal elections until it's 'safe' NO. WAY!!!
Seems to me  needs to apologize to AG Ferguson. This shows how local GOP is willing to dismiss anything Trump says/does as long as it fits his agenda.
It will be harder for Trump to do that, than it would be for Johnson to force through an extension of the parliamentary term, or to cancel the next local elections as they were (rightly) cancelled this year. The US has checks and balances, the UK doesn‚Äôt.
So, Herman Cain died of COVID-19.  I believe he caught that at Trump's rally.
That's not how are would work Cynthia trump dies pence gets in appoints another vice president pence dies that vice president gets in appoints another vice president they would have to die simultaneously for ugly ass lying ass Pelosi to get in
Anyone who has concerns about Trump delaying the election, is not crazy, stupid, or fear mongering. No other laws has stopped Trump from pretty much doing anything he wanted. I am scared to death Trump is going to cancel the election with the help of Republicans and the SC.

Serious question, I have always been curious about. I think your mom is a smart women, but she has been going along with Trump since 2016. Does she actually believe the things Trump is saying? I can't believe she does all of it.
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
Maybe my memory is playing tricks on me,.....but,....I seem to remember tRUMP's son-in-law buying up Casket Companies early on in the Pandemic....Could be that that is incorrect...sure seems I read that somewhere Long time ago NOW.
Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election Guess his absolutely horrific poll numbers, &amp; the positively gruesome economic numbers combined with the devastating death toll due to his complete mishandling of the Covid crisis have finally driven him insane!!!
Suggesting that the Presidential election should be delayed is just the latest episode in this. I'm sure Trump wouldn't be saying these things if he were ahead in the polls...
Where does China go to get cheap labor to keep manufacturing prices low for your cheaper products? Well, if you can‚Äôt ‚Äúre-educate‚Äù a minority, just put them in forced labor! Volkswagen can‚Äôt judge and wasn‚Äôt aware. And Trump says it‚Äôs the right thing to do!
Holy shit!!!!! To all MAGA fans, NO this isn‚Äôt fake news. YES the virus is real. NO it isn‚Äôt being blown out of proportion. YES you should wear a mask. NO it isn‚Äôt part of a media or dem plot to harm Trump. YES it is shit timing but civil unrest happens in times like these.
In deed neither have I. Are you a ware tha a 60 yr old black man was murdered in cold blood for supporting President Trump. Another black man shot him. Hate crime and no one is talking about it on the left or great media. Please look into it Mark
‚ÄúI reclaim my Time-O-crats‚Äù sealed their fate. Drain Baby Drain! Trump 2020!
And who is up set about the 60 year old black man who was murdered because he supported President Trump. He needs a proper funeral like Floyd got. His desth is a hate crime and no one is talking about it. This needs to be in public tv media it‚Äôs a hate crime because hating Trump
Yep. Not by choice. tRump fueled insomnia. Almost 2 am in Auburn, WA.
This is an Important message. Verify this allegation and end drone usage in Somalia with immediate effect. Trump policy in Africa is the same as Obama.
That‚Äôs so fucking stupid.  No Trump supporter is putting up a Biden sign. They just wouldn‚Äôt put a sign up at all if that‚Äôs a case. Maybe they don‚Äôt all love Biden, but it definitely means they hate Trump.  Insanely naive and gullible.
"Britain Trump..." Same affliction.
Folks like you probably need to buy a new bookcase because of the Trump era.
It's not rehearsal, it's already effectively causing unrest, which is the overall goal. Trump coordinated with Putin so it's both bottom-up and top-down.
Trump's tweet about suburbs getting ruined by low income housing isn't a dog whistle, it's a racist bullhorn. Even an old white suburban chick like me knows what he's saying. And I know he does not know anything about what old white suburban chicks think and want.
I know now that tRump has given these bottom feeders a voice again! We must do everything within our own power to send them back under the rock they crawled out from under! #VoteForOurLives and the lives and freedoms of our fellow citizens as well! #TrumpIsARacist AND A CONMAN
So let me get this straight - the same day Trump talks to his lord &amp; master Putin, he does 2 things.   1. Makes sure to NOT discuss Russia paying Taliban forces to kill our troops;   2. Pulls 11,900 of our troops out of Germany.   What the actual fuck?

Trump's decision to move troops from Germany slammed as 'a gift to Putin'
Lmaof!
True, but real life is not Twitter. People set up sock puppet accounts all the time. It's one way to paint your opponent as "too unreasonable" so that you just say "well Trump can't be that bad." He is.
Based on the insane biased by Barr under testimony.   The only way  America will be safe from Trump's insanity is when we vote it out in November .  Barr Repeats Trump Falsehoods in Congressional Testimony

How can you support someone like Trump? I just don't get it. He's a terrible person
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
HE WANTS TO EXCLUDE POORER INCOMES FROM COMMUNITIES AND KEEP THEM EXCLUDED. I put that in capitals because I think you're just not getting it. In any case, you obviously are a Trump supporter and will not listen at all. So, I suggest we simply agree to disagree and part ways :)
I could say the same for the other side. Trump is very far removed from the Republican Party I know and respected.
Actually I am quite bright. I just had to process it because I couldn't believe Trump would actually just come out as a racist bigot like that. Please tell me how as a slightly privileged white woman I can be racist because I don't like Trump? That makes little sense.

Bro, Trump started this with his rhetoric.

China‚Äôs WeChat App is aligned with MSM against HCQ. I‚Äôm glad I live outside China‚Äôs firewall so I have greater access to info. There is clearly a commercial and political campaign against a potentially effective therapy that costs pennies,  not $1000s, and that Trump supports.

After trump's blundering efforts to appear to be doing something about COVID-19 failed, he expected to ride to glory on the success of "his" cure.  Sixty-three million doses going bad in the Strategic Nat'l Stockpile leaves him wondering "what now?".

A lot of claims about voter fraud in states like California and Michigan ended up being false statements, Trump just keeps collecting fake news and spewing it on Twitter. Mail in is safer &amp; easier; some people don't want to wait in line for hours just to vote, I know I wouldn't.
Trump Mega Depression
Why does Trump creepily make everything about himself?  "Especially by me," like Trump even has the capacity to adore someone more than Cain's own family. He is so weird.
I don‚Äôt know Ifeellike the Trump supporters are eager to go to the polls for him
Trump is gonna go nuts John Lewis
Shove it Trump, the President is taking
Hey Trump shut up, Obama is taking  #JohnLewisfuneral
IF Trump dropped out and Romney ran he would be hard to beat
Remember when leftists were derided as conspiracy theorists when we even suggested Trump wouldn't give up power in November?
Trump literally killed #HermanCain
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on
Trump is having a horrible, terrible, no good very bad day.
Yep in 1845 but Trump wouldn‚Äôt know this either
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are now a total of 152.2 million jobs in the U.S. That‚Äôs an increase of 6.8 million since Trump took office
Black Lives Matter unless you‚Äôre a Trump supporter. So in reality it‚Äôs just some Black Lives Matter more than other black lives. It works the same way for Planned Parenthood, as to when and if a black life matters at all. #AllLivesMatter #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica #KAG #Trump2020
Trump is done in November  #WeWillVote
How does PBS work for you? A little left leaning..
Trump is president the end
Thanks Trump
Plus all the looting, rioting, angry mobs pulling down statues will push people towards Trump
One of Trump‚Äôs super powers as a pol is that his support does not poll accurately
Is that Donald Trump or Mike Pence who believes in sex demons?
Trump forever? You lose ALL credibility and any moral authority when you defend AND SUPPORT a disgusting human like trump.  No surprise, tho.  People like you protected the priests who molested my sister and my friends. Hypocrite!
Don‚Äôt worry Trump will be golfing this weekend
97 days and your Trump loving life is gonna suck.
Everything good trump did during his presidency: The wall Lowering prescription drug costs Allowing drugs in from Canada Criminal reform Improving NAFTA Supreme Court nominees  Everything he did wrong during his presidency: Everything else
Good thing Trump is running against a black man
Maybe I‚Äôm a bit too libertarian, but trump removing troops from Germany is a serious stopped clocked moment and a great one, too
So people moved into the abandon unlivable house on the property I rent. Well within one conversation with them I learned that they hate trump so me being me wants to get a trump 2020 flag and hang it on my front porch facing their house.

Must be why Trump just stopped all advertising in Michigan as he knows he is toast there
Trump is lying in the middle of no where Texas.
Is "Suburban Lifestyle Dream" some new Barbie house but just... extra racism on top of where low income Barbie can't live next door or... what here?  Why is Trump so WEIRD??
Oh, FFS.  Does it ever end????  Trump: Suburban voters will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
can you please not block me from following people I'm trying to get messages out there true people #Ihavecancer üò• and you just make it where I cannot follow other people but you let Trump put fake news on here wow
Good luck with that with Trump and the GOP in charge
Trump energizing Bernie's
Trump has all the footage he needs for his campaign ads. They've served their purpose
So Trump and Barr saw the polling that no one was buying their BS
Sorry MARXIST Supporter.. Your Buddies were still screaming Impeach when Trump started COVID 19 meetings...They were screaming "RACIST!" when   initiated Travel restrictions and Quarantines. Pelosi was inviting everyone to come to China Town. Propaganda swallower
gee look states trump will lose, but Barr is not complicit
I am a Native with a degree. and I am a Trump supporter. You have something to say now big mouth?
I don't watch/listen to Trump often.   So, I still freak my shit out when I hear the words coming out of his mouth.  Is this really our president?  Fuck.
It is beyond sad, how much Trump craves attention and praise and "ratings" and popularity, like he's still on a reality show.
No. But it sure would've helped encourage people to wear masks if Trump wore one, and if Trump hadn't called taking safety precautions a hoax, or said he thinks people only wear masks to make him look bad.
Yes, it does. And I blame all of them. Republican Congress members got a special briefing on the threat - instead of telling us, they sold their stocks, then bought new stocks in things like Zoom meetings. They knew, and lied. Trump knew too, and was in charge.
We are blaming Trump for his own words and actions in protecting the country from the virus. Yes, you can blame a person.  Also, Trump was in the media blaming Obama for Ebola so...
Up next: Trump Racist, water wet and pizza delicious at 11

My nieces 12th birthday was yesterday.   She had not seen her best friend since March when school was shut down. They had a parade and I am still crying.   Trump can go to hell
Trump is done and it‚Äôs glorious
And sex with Trump makes you even sicker.
Really? Dems have the perfect comeback of Trump saying or doing nothing while Putin is paying for dead American soldiers
The fact you don't need to know what year it is to still be widely less destructive than trump should not go unnoticed. Good call out my dude.
Me when a truck w a trump flag passes by
Sucks to know Trump is about to get his ass kicked huh?
Ha ha no one protests at the federal building in Seattle, Trump got played like a fool.    It‚Äôs not near anything

I really wish I had been taught what taking the lords name in vain really was and what Graven images actually means. Garbage take from a guy who thinks Trump is closer to Bonhoeffer than the cheap Grace Bonhoeffer warned us about.
That crowd is why we are going to destroy Trump in Nov.
That‚Äôs is America right there, Trump is so done in Nov.
I have some Trump faced toilet paper that that is 4 ply if you are having trouble
Insanity.  Balance the threat of a deadly disease pandemic, by giving businesses INCENTIVES to create more pandemic disease spread.   Trump logic, I guess.
I‚Äôm so done with Trump.
Yet another reason that proves Trump is so done
I‚Äôm so tired of journalists asking the question, what if Trump doesn‚Äôt accept election results- IT‚ÄôS NOT UP TO HIM! If Biden is elected he will become POTUS January 20, 2021 at noon
Nope Trump and his lying ass kisser are 99 days from finding new jobs
Sure thing Trump can‚Äôt read or spell
Trump‚Äôs cooked, just look at the line to view John Lewis, that is America and that is the America we are taking back

Trump doesn't but Russia does
That photo being taken of those kids, pretty much sums up why Trump is going down in November
Not a chance Trump dug this grave all by himself
Social media is allowed to censor stuff.  Trump has the ability to speak directly to the American people through official channels, like every other pre-Twitter president throughout American history.
150,000 Americans Trump has help kill, would give you the finger if they could.  They can‚Äôt so I willüñï

"We should just build a wall around Trump"  Ladies and gentlemen...
To be honest I thought the bird's majestic flight was gonna get stopped short by one of Trump's sons shooting it.
Tell them Trump just told John Lewis to F off and won‚Äôt go the Capitol
And Trump basically just told him and his family to F off.
Trump is done
How do you think they failed us?  The major problems are because Trump muzzled them. He was uninterested in briefings, ignored warnings, setting the tone. Everyone else followed.  Then escalated to misinformation, to downplay the growing threat, because he didn't want to fit it.
Washington = established the constitution Lincoln = frees the slaves Reagan = ended the Cold War Trump = person, Woman, man, camera, tv
Trump coming right?
great 2 game season, at least trump can't toss oiut any pitches
5 words, say it in unison: Trump is an absolute lunatic
nope Trump spent 6 months lying and covering this up,  He is toast
That's the Trump brand, why are people surprised
Guessing he was never there so trump is good right?
don't worry trump will still lie if it doesn't
trump is going 0-3 on that list
never was invited, this was said the day Fauchi was doing his and Trump was having a tantrum
Hardly. Like "Brown Shirt" ANTIFA Trump doesn't control CITY POLICE!
Like Trump has security briefings, guy could stay working from home when it passes
And Trump won‚Äôt go and he is there
Trump is getting his ass kicked all over the country, book it
yeah because trump is an idiot, man,  woman, person, camera, TV.   Vote
Being vocal about his opinions is the only skill Trump has.  It'd be better if he shut up - a little less talk and a lot more action. ;)
Lol we're not safe in Trump's America - Fox News reminds us daily of how awful everything is, and all the things to live in fear of. So what's the difference?
think about how much we can re direct after kicking out trump and his family of crooks
Thanks Trump
Lol.. Oh Look! The Marxist is trying to pretend Trump is the Marxist.. Idiot.

The reason we aren't leaving is that we are unwilling to evacuate our collaborators to America.  The right thing to do would be to open our doors to them, but they are a) brown, b) Muslim so that's not going to happen while Trump is in office
You think Trump is winning PA let alone Bucks County?  There must be hallucinagins in the Kool Aid.

I am so tired of hearing if you don‚Äôt support Biden you‚Äôre for Trump or helping re-elect him. I refuse to be vote shamed bc I don‚Äôt want to cast a ballot for an uninspiring person with no interest in uniting the party w/ progressive positions that most Americans support.
But yeah, "socialism" where everyone gets healthcare is scary.   Weird how you worry about spending our own tax dollars to gove us back "free" stuff. But don't care if Trump uses our own tax dollars to murder us in our city streets.  Cool. All cool and normal.
But, that needs the context of - things were on the exact.same.arc. of rising growth that started under Obama. Under Trump it didn't stop, but it didn't rise faster. Trump wasn't responsible for those good conditions. He *is* responsible for the crash now tho.
I know for a fact they‚Äôre trump supporters, no one else acts like that
Here is the aftermath of Trump‚Äôs rally in New Jersey earlier this year, were you there?

Yeah he did. Obama did all that too-( except for Epstein thing) Obama just made the presidency look classy- which Trump hasn‚Äôt. I am not arguing that he didn‚Äôt do shitty things- just pointing out he has done good too Like all presidents. I am not dem or rep so I can see the truth
Honest tho: can you think of a moment of real emotion that Trump has shown with another human? A belly laugh that wasn't a mean jab at someone, but just... joy? Any legit connection? He thumbs upped an orphaned baby, for hecks sake.
Where did you get the GIF Stephen Miller when he had hair?  Enjoy Trump getting his ass kicked Nov 3rd this nation is sick of his racist lying corrupt ass #PortlandProtests
I keep thinking this. But also... I'm nervous that if we do have an unprecedented, resounding win, that Trump will use the record breaking numbers as "proof" that they cant possibly be real, that Biden clearly cheated. How can we handle that?
The news has had to print more cuss words and profanity, sexual content, unneccesary death, and disappointment during this Trump White House, than a season of Game of Thrones, man.
Trump is absolutely done, He is absolutely done.  The country is sick of his ass
The best selling point for Biden came from Trump himself when he said that if Biden is elected, the tv ratings will go way down.  That sounds lovely. A president quietly getting things accomplished. Vs the current #PersonWomanManCameraTv.
And yet Trump is seen with Epstein high giving in front of young girls?  Did you miss that numbnuts?

THE VIDEO IS A LIE. Trump did't say the neo-nazis or white supremacist are "very fine people." They took him out of context. He explicitly said he was NOT talking about them.  Trump is the worst president ever, but that does not justify LYING about him.

Mask mandates ARE for preventing disease spread. That's literally their purpose.   It'd be better if Trump enacted policy to start production of higher quality masks for all Americans, and if we'd listen to experts on proper usage.  But, we have to work with what we've got.
It's always the right wing Trump supporters in the stories about violence.
I'm sure this sums up far too many spiteful Trump voters.Persuade me. Name one thing good to Trump has accomplished. Calling himself a genius does not count.
And the point of bring up Trump was to understand why you believe not wearing a mask was any better when even he has changed course on the matter lol
Because Trump has been the main one against masks until he realized they actually help. Proving that the mayors suggestions were ‚Äúnot a bad look‚Äù considering the top guy in the country agrees. Lol and since were FACTS considered excuses???
How does he plan to be re-elected with a 32% approval rating and dropping fast?  Biden's ahead 16 points in the polls. And that gap is widening.  It's going to be a wipe out for both Trump and the GOP this November.
Here‚Äôs your problem. You can‚Äôt criticize Trump businesses without giving him credit for his business successes at the same time. That‚Äôs why this line of attack doesn‚Äôt work. It cuts your position down at the same time.

Can Trump postpone or delay the election in November?
Not if it harms trump.
Donald Trump was a fascist in 1989 when he congratulated the Chinese government for crushing the democracy movement with the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Trump has always been a fascist. You have been blinkered by Republican fanaticism.

Trump appointed Postmaster DeJoy has decreed no more overtime.  Overtime gets all the mail delivered every day.  You're asking the rank and file to do unpaid labor, cover up sabotage in the process.  The only unpaid labor any of us should be doing is calling our reps to complain
Since . is a Trump supporting democrat, he should introduce legislation to stop Trump from meddling with USPS which he‚Äôs doing to impact Amazons shipping costs. Perhaps FTC should investigate?
DeJoy, the new trump-appointed postmaster general, has decreed no more overtime, which means massive delivery slowdowns.  Cash flow shortages are caused by a Clinton-era sabotage law requiring them to pre-fund benefits 70 years.  You want to blame someone, keep that in mind.

mr trump.....here's the thing....if you had said "hadn't gone into Portland" instead of "didn't go into Portland" it would be clearer that you weren't admitting to yourself how badly you fucked this all up.
Trump's talking about single-family zoning. The problem isn't that property values would fall. It's that they won't artificially inflate at insane percentages and price out younger buyers.  Why have a 1% appreciation when you can have 5% YOY and let someone be homeless?
How do WH staffers who follow trump around stay sane?  An insider friend told me that many of them wear "I'm with stupid" t-shirts under their dress clothes.

Trump is screaming "LAW AND ORDER!" on his Twitter page again. I guess his plan to invade US cities with his stormtroopers didn't have the desired effect as he thought it would.
Based on what evidence? Red states have more crime than blue states. You don't see Trump and his Gestapo army invading Houston Texas to stamp out crime. He's doing this deliberately to blue cities because he wants to be an asshole about it.  Because he's losing.

Solid point mate.  Trump's party despises handout and people who ask for handouts, yet here you are.  Walking contradiction.  I'm sure he doesn't understand his hypocrisy.  Poor fellow
Violent protests in Portland. trump and his pathological delusional lies!!!
He will come out on top The Trump Putin Cabal is going down
Stop and think about this fact. About 40 million Americans may lose their homes in the worst economic downturn since the #GreatDepression, brought on by our failed response to #COVID19 (it could have been less sever if we had a real leader). Trump must go.
Facebook and Twitter fail to fact-check Trump‚Äôs latest claims about mail-in voting in the 2020 elections.   I live in Oregon for 13 years &amp; don't trust 100% mail-in voting! Only 4 states allow it! That says all anyone needs to know!
yeah, trump's been up to his neck in this story from the very beginning, and the coverage of it has been extremely bad.
Calabresi's gonna vote for Trump, he just really wants to do it on November 3rd. Probably has a trip planned for later in the month.
Thank goodness. He would have dishonored Congressman Lewis. I'm glad he wasn't there.  Whenever trump shows up at a solemn event like this I always say, "Can't we have anything nice? Why does he have to ruin everything for us?"  Nope. It's a good thing he wasn't there.
since. He has no chance of winning. Which does not make things better! It makes things a lot worse. What we do not know is what happens when a rising autocrat has no chance of winning an American election. That is what we will find out. Again, Trump has zero chance of winning.
Again, almost everyone seems to do the historical thing and fight the next war as if it was the last war. I know, I‚Äôm a broken record, but please. 2020 is not 2016. Trump barely eeked out 2016 when everything was on his side and has done nothing to increase his viability
Federalist Society conservative day Trump crossed the line into fascism and says he should be removed from office as a result.
But don't you remember when the world was a rose garden before Trump was elected? Don't you? Don't you remember?  [music swells, pixies fly up into the night air, sprinkling glimmering dust on the houses below.]
Damn, this low-life fuckwad sounds desperate. So this is how you treat a former President, huh? But trump, the serial cheater, liar, and fraud is the good man? Fuck you dude. You‚Äôre hatred is showing.
I think trump it's afraid to debate Joe. He already alluded to his concern that any debate wouldn't be fair because the media is against him. He said it months ago in passing, but I noticed. I bet he'll refuse to debate Joe with some wild accusation that it won't be fair to him.
Speaker outside Justice Center says President Trump has ‚Äòimposed terrorism‚Äô on the citizens
Here's the Narrative: he went to Trump's rally (where multiple people in charge of the event were tested positive), sans mask; after that he was positive for COVID-19; and now he's dead. How do you think he got it?
Dude he's making fun of Trump who said "many people don't know this, but Lincoln was a Republican". Trump is idiot in chief and there's a village out there somewhere that sorely misses him.
Given Republican put obstructing Obama before the country‚Äôs wellbeing for 8 years, and then gave us Trump - I would be stunned if the Chinese are the only ones who concluded that we‚Äôre in decline. Why else would Putin take such an unimaginable risk in 2016 if he didn‚Äôt see it too

It may get ugly but I can't imagine Speaker Pelosi pissing away a single nanosecond on Trump with depression-level unemployment. An audit of the RNC would force Trump to resign.
You better not cave once again to your Donny. Finally STAND UP and make sure this never happens. He WILL be the first POTUS to not transition out peacefully. You MUST prepare for that  Clearly you KNOW this is his plan.
It's entirely possible that he's attempting to orchestrate a campaign to delagitimize the election &amp; steal a second term. However there's a maxim a friend told me he has about any Trump story: Whatever is initially reported, the truth is almost always considerably dumber.
We should impeach Trump again immediately. He's unfit for office. He's a danger to America and our Allies. He's robbing the country blind.
I am sure you are right. Trump seems ready to have someone killed before his tax returns or his name in the Epstein-Maxwell affair are released, and Barr seems ready to make it happen.
Charlie is so racist that he might as well be a Trump.

When you pull the same bullshit for 3+ years eventually people will point and say ‚Äúbullshit!‚Äù Trump has 1 playbook- protect trump at all costs, no price is too high, no low is too low.

Remember when Trump said only he could fix it?
It's the thing happening in the quiet, while creating arguments about masks, and moving elections that will never happen, and kook doctors who believe in alien DNA. The actual change always happens quietly. Trump has had it out for the post office since he was campaigning.

i don't want to yell at my friend on fb but, "obama made trump possible" is the same logic as "black voters passed prop 8", obama's not-that-progressive policies were definitely a factor, but let's lay the majority of the blame for trump where it belongs: mitch mcconnell
Just drove by the federal courthouse the police already gave up the 2 parks they cleared today. The feds will be back out in force tonight. The National Guard will be federalized.
Trump never keeps any promises he makes to others. He's always only been interested in getting away with his grifts. GOP obliged and proved they're as greedy as he.
The eventual film about Trump as president
Tell Trump supporters that Trump wanted to postpone the election and he succeeded. The election is suspended for the benefit of Trumpers. They don't have to be inconvenienced to vote so they don't need fear getting Trump's fake virus. Pass it on.
The great pandemic of 2016... oh wait 2020? Who left them so carelessly empty for four years? Funny how you believe ‚Äúfake‚Äù news has been planted for years as a plan. If they had the resources to do that do you honestly believe they‚Äôd not have a better way?
But, you should ignore these doctors and trust Trump and his hunches. Besides, the crazy demon sex, alien DNA lady endorsed him, so you know he's gotta be correct. Amirite??? I mean what do the FDA, CDC and NIH know? They're only the best medical professionals in the world.
And obviously you will add Trump to the list as soon as he's "free!"
Yes like DONALD TRUMP

Rarely has one man been so profoundly, loudly and consistently wrong in a time when people of real moral courage and intellect are needed.   should be ashamed of his conduct during the time of Trump. Truly the worst type of enabler.
this is like inverse qanon, where you recognize that donald trump and the people he knows have been the ones responsible for so many horrifying and disgusting crimes and root for him to be arrested and rat them all out.
an interesting thing that just dawned on me is that if donald trump were ever indicted, you know that he'd be giddy to narc on every single rich and powerful person he's ever met, for everything they've ever done, if only to bring them down, too.  that's... a lot of people.
you forgot about all the people Trump has fired. THEY DONT GET A FUCKING PASS just because bunker baby turned on them.
Donald Trump will always put Donald Trump first. Narcissism is ugly.
Correct they are white people and college students run, educated, and led by local and non local college professors who profess terrorist views. Defund liberal public school systems.
They'll never get the point. That's the problem with this country. These people actually believe that trump and his posse care about them. It's pathetic.
well, that would be nice, if tRump would actually quit blaming someone and take responsibility. We will wait forever for that. Let's not.

Wow.. so your attempt to have validity to your words is to create a narrative of me being a liar. Poor thing.  Your anger and deflection of responsibility to Trump shows your inability to allow another's voice. It's a instant attack to damage someone elses view.
Funny they said the same about Clinton in 2016 and Trump won. The silent majority always wins and nobody wants Sleepy Joe that has a brain.

Trump may not technically have the power to delay the election but he's itching to have a reason to declare martial law, &amp; the fact that he even suggested postponing the national election for the first time in American history should alarm everyone regardless of party line.
Trump has outperformed only in his cruelty, ineptitude and ability to embarrass the nation.  The day he is rejected by the electorate will be a fine day.
Trump was never a Conservative. Trump was never a Republican, not a Democrat. Trump is only, always and ever, an opportunist.

Hint: 2-1/2 weeks ago Trump said he would be releasing the bold new health care plan he has been promising for 4 years.  I'm sure he'll have an idea about boosting UI benefits right after he finishes off his health care insurance plan.
Hey there #StevenCalabresi of   I could have saved you years of misplaced obeisance and avoided you this humiliation: Trump is, and always has been, a really bad guy. Since the 80's, man. You would have seen it, if you had only looked. Or, you could have just asked me.
hosted by former president, donald trump
He‚Äôs flailing.  Differently but not dissimilar from Trump‚Äîthey both realize they are likely to lose election and now ‚Äúall in.‚Äù
Trump says he'll help with funeral costs for slain soldier, Spc. Vanessa Guillen:
Trump is really bad at Twitter.
I #StandwithSteven #STEVENCALABRESI let‚Äôs end Trump‚Äôs term early. #ForwardHisMailtoSingSing
Those are the black guys that kinda are pro trump and pro white?   It's kinda hard to explain.   Hoteps are black dudes that call out the black crime in Chicago for example.  Or they mention that whites actually get shot more by police.   Loved by conservatives.. highly monitized
Hint: 2-1/2 weeks ago Trump said he would be releasing the bold new health care plan he has been promising for 4 years.  How about never? Does never work for you?  Pretty sure that's what he meant.
i'm fine with this. and if i die from covid, please hurtle my rotting corpse at trump and his entire administration.
I'm a Republican who didn't want either of the main 2016 candidates and think that the EC needs to be re-evaluated with 65.8 million Hillary to 62.9 m Trump. Granted Trump had 30 states to Hillary's 20, but the EC should have been a little closer than 227 -304. EC has problems.
Hey centrists: if Trump even hints that he might support #MedicareForAll, its over for Biden.
There‚Äôs something about fruit that is antagonizing to trump. Notice the pineapple?
A song for Donald #Trump, Criminal and Cheat  To the tune of "You're So Vain"  Title:  "You're Insane"    #TrumpFailedAmerica  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe  #GOPBetrayedAmerica  #GOP  #GOPComplicitTraitors
Trump's Fascist Guide: Contradict yourself to test followers faith. Tell big lie to draw attention from basic realities. Manufacture crisis. Designate enemies. Make appeal to pride &amp; humiliation. Express hostility. Cast doubt on democratic systems. Aim for personal power. üëç
Condemning Donald Trump‚Äôs racism should occur across platforms. What I share on Facebook, I share on Twitter.
And the getaway driver didn't have a gun, only the Bank robber did.  lol. You all have no functioning sense of logic. You would see that the establishment is using you all as pawns, to bait Trump to use military action. Your asses are saved.  Same bootlicker retort I keep hearing
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying ‚Äì and will fail ‚Äì to step on John Lewis funeral service. Trump is a whiny toddler. Has no compassion or empathy‚Äù
Nothing Donald Trump has ever done in his whole existence is for anyone‚Äôs benefit other than himself
What a slime ball.  And Dems have the temerity to say Trump has no class.
Auto-text correction is the worst. I know you meant to type Donald Trump
Strange how many, "jokes" that Trump has acted on.  It's almost like he trials asinine ideas as jokes so that when he does them, no one is surprised and they don't get as much press as they otherwise might.  Also, they deflect from things like the horrible numbers released today.
Open the polling stations back up, now. Get mail in ballots out now. Time for trump to be held accountable for his crimes. Thank you Liz!!
Typical idiotic and childish comment from some of the Trump lovers. Some Trump supports I respect, others like you...judging by this comment is the small percentage of the lunatics!
Did you notice something?  The last time Trump bailed on a female reporter like that, his supporters were all over Twitter, bragging about how he'd 'owned the lamestream media' and even posting cartoons about it.  This time...practically NOTHING!  Why was that?
Chris Ruddy.... here's another Trump fucking idiot talking about how Trump's done such a great job with the pandemic. What a dumb "saving his job" piece of shit!
Ghislaine Maxwell  Donald Trump  Lonely is the Night
Trump, to Herman Cain in Tulsa, OK "Hermie Baby, it will be good to show the people that you don't need to wear that dopey mask. Now go on out there and have a good time!"
Haha. "Heated." Good line, ya discount-trump-son. Fox is a terrible source of info &amp; all media does not say that. In fact, most media is saying president doofus is abusing power, and has for fucking ever. Lol. Glad I cancelled my netflix subscription: you're free entertainment.
I'm smug,authoritarian and don't give a shit about anyone but myself and my Lord and Master,Trump.
Thank you for your political analysis, person who thinks Trump has secretly arrested Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for child trafficking.
Republicans need to stop playing politics and actually take nationwide action against Trump's legacy:  the Covid19 pandemic!
You're right. I have "Boycott The Apprentice-Donald Trump" group in FB  back in 2011.   I don't have "Boycott Who's Line Is It Anyway-Ryan Stiles"   So you need to run.
America is VOTING Trump 2020!!
May be the one truth Trump's ever told. I actually believe him.
Thank you President Trump!!!
WHY did Trump wait month, after month, saying" it will go away in a couple of days," or it's "A Hoax perpetrated by the Democrats?"  Republicans loyal to Trump are dying right along with Democrats!
Also, where is the New Heath care plan? Trump said two weeks,  new plan.
Prolly a trump supporter stroking his ego that he's a good person
No wonder trump wasnt there He cant stand love
Trump 2020
America is VOTING Trump 2020!!!
to rephrase; ‚Äútolerated‚Äù.  I personally don‚Äôt recall any welcoming parades, fanfare or (ahem) ‚Äúemperor rallies‚Äù portrayed. see where I‚Äôm going here?  if we‚Äôre comparing Palps to Trump, there had to be straight up supporters somewhere rocking MUGA hats and ratting out Jedi.
Looks like the Republican/Federalist Society love-affair with Trump is almost over.
Must be nice to live such a privileged existence. I didn't have healthcare under Obama, I don't have healthcare under Trump, and I won't have healthcare under Biden but enjoy your future brunches, bro. Just remember the people serving you won't have that luxury.
before it was finding which businesses supported trump, now it‚Äôs finding which businesses support cops
Steam is rolling out my ears. This man is the BIGGEST embarrassment of this country. And if you are PROUD to fucking be apart of it; you are also an embarrassment. Fuck racist, fuck the white separatists, FUCK trump. IF U SUPPORT THIS BASTARD U R THE PROBLEM OF THIS COUNTRY.
democrats approved Trump's military budget.  (incidentally, this is happening after he sent the feds to terrorize MY city)
Laugh at trump
McConnell, your man Trump is the cause of all of our pain, and you are his enabler. You are evil, and we will finally destroy you.
We have your back President Trump!!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Thank prez trump .. 0 star ratings incoming
Trump feared that more testing would only lead to higher case counts &amp;more bad publicity. Meanwhile, Dr. Deb Birx, WH coronavirus response coordinatorwas reportedly sharing models w/sr staff that optimistically&amp; erroneously, it would turn out predicted virus would soon fade away.
Interesting.... Trump has been carpet bombing us with his inane whining for 4 long years.  Then Obama speaks for an hour and they have the nerve to say something about it?   Fuck all the way off!
BTW, You‚Äôre confusing me with Trump, who has actually destroyed millions of lives with his narcissistic incompetence.  Agent Orange, I call him.
It made me sick to my stomach. I just waited 10 days for #COVID19 test results. I am fortunate to have been negative &amp; able to have stayed home while waiting for results. Meanwhile, Trump has instant testing at the WH.
I was thinking the same thing... Ignore Trump tweets...
as easily digestible as it would be to believe that everything when to sh!t because of Trump...
VERIFY: Video purports to show Trump on hot mic criticizing supporters over masks
Tell me why I tweeted abt disliking Trump and literal secret services called my PARENTS and showed up at my old house and scared the shit out my old landlords
Way more likely that Trump doesn‚Äôt know how any of this works and pulled that out of his keester to gin up his base.
By the amount of jubberish and lies that Trump talks......he wouldn‚Äôt either!
Trump has an evil 3-step plan to get re-elected ü§¨  #TrumpsEvilPlan  Brutal new film from
Trump taught his kids to dehumanize their opponents and treat them accordingly. It makes sense that his prized daughter would marry a hateful, weaselly man who does the same.
#EvictTrump Trump &amp; GOP have treated a health emergency as a political tool. "United States?" Because I am in Dem. state, my life doesn't count to POTUS' son-in-law. We shd flood the streets of DC TODAY &amp; demand his removal-- but the virus prevents us.
Not just Trump. States, Cities, and Counties. All levels of Government in both Democrat and Republican areas need to do more. For example; City and State Police need to enforce mask laws. Resturants and Bars need to close. Stores need curb side ONLY.
Who in the hell cares whether Trump accepts the outcome of the Election.He has no power over it.
Says the guy that shits in golden toilets and hasn‚Äôt worked a day in his life. Unless you consider getting a golf ball out of a sand trap work. FUCK DONALD TRUMP!!!!
Kim Jong un also said we're in for a surprise in October  , makes me think Kim's going to bomb us and trump knows it and will go to Russia to watch .  Don't put nothing past a man with a Hitler mantality .
Exactly. Trump will never get my vote. #DumpTrump2020!
Did you see Trump's 'Trojan Horse' ad on Joe Biden?  Neither did anyone else.  Meanwhile, whenever a new anti-Trump ad from The Lincoln Project or MeidasTouch hits the net, it goes instantly viral.  Trump's minions can 'review and fine-tune' all they want; it won't do any good.
Ah, the heroes trying to take down America. Again, I ask that you please miss the sarcasm in the way I said that.
Me:üëâüòØ Re: AGREEING üíØüíØüíØ with  twice in less than 5 days üò¨. But, he's absolutely SPOT ON! Also, good for him calling out #Trump for his dumbass tweet this AM!! #Portland #PortlandRiots #Leftists = #Anarchy ‚¨áÔ∏è #riots2020
You know damn well Speaker Pelosi isn't going to piss away a nanosecond on another impeachment when we have depression-level unemployment and a pandemic. If these "federalists" really want Trump out of there, they'll have to force an audit of the RNC.
Trump respects nothing, he's a monster, he's our Hitler, he's human garbage.  American's don't respect the authority of monsters.
The irony to me about the kneeling issue is that if the right/Trump had adopted kneeling for the anthem in the name of the "military" or "2a" rights all these losers saying they're done with sports would be slobbering all over the idea.
-Ivanka  -Jared -Don Jr -Eric -Kimberly Guilfoyle -Lara Trump  -Hannity -Fox news
Despite trump, not because of him.  Epstein, Trump's buddy &amp; partner in sex crimes, was arrested *despite * trump being president.
Sorry. I'm trying to remind everyone that this is a standard Trump tactic, and I've been overzealous with which posts get my copy-pasted message.
This is the guy who makes the list of judges that trump picks from!
You're absolutely right. The protests were starting to mellow out until Trump sent in the Feds. Since then the hype is raised the stakes are raised and the tactics are being learned and adapted every single day.
If tRUmp has lost the Federalist Society, he is in VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE!
Buh bye Trump. Start packing!
we wil be here waiting...we aint leaving #DefendPDX  #fuck12
neither is trump, your conspiracy theory was debunked.
Oh how dare Donald Trump‚Äôs administration health experts bother to protect us by advising us to wear a mask blame the Dems but Republicans want to govern what a woman can do with her own body? Afraid of the declining birth rate of the white race.
How‚Äôs that economy? -33% GDP - HISTORY!  So why you voting for Trump now. Not the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù. You‚Äôre racist!  He took your job, your healthcare, your home, your right to protest, now he‚Äôs taking your right to vote &amp; FINALLY he‚Äôll take your guns. Dictators don‚Äôt allow guns stupid.
MSM includes Fox ya know
Do not contribute in any way, shape, or form to trump's campaign to convince Americans there is a threat to Portland from #BlackLivesMatter protests. Portland is not under threat from its own people &amp; we do not deserve brutal police violence from state, local, or federal cops.
Today, 10 miles north of #Portland on I-5, the primary West Coast interstate.  It's been there for as much of the 15 years I have lived in the PDX area as I can remember.  Not a post Trump problem re: white supremacy in our community, or their connection w/
Currently on r/Portland: "Trump just called Portlanders "beehive of terrorists"....." #Portland
Top story: Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.  see more
Follow me if you hate Donald Trump as much as I
96 days left of Trump and that‚Äôs all, 96 more days of Trump, Take him down, that disgrace of a noun, 96 days left of Trump and that‚Äôs all
I get that a lot of people don‚Äôt want ‚Äúa revolution*‚Äù but I‚Äôm also fully convinced that our failing systems and ideologies will continue to fail and that a return to the status quo before trump will solve none of our pressing problems beyond trump himself.
Trump treats protesters here the same way. You‚Äôre asking for help from the wrong man. Especially since these are not white protesters.
Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November. IMO, this is a Koch/Trump plan to try and delay the 2020 Presidential election. If Barr &amp; Republicans allow this to happen? They can tie it up for years in the courts.
"If you want to call one side ‚Äúrioters‚Äù or ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù working to create tumult in Portland, it‚Äôs the uninvited feds who qualify."  from Portland
Every single female in the running is "polarizing" to R's . Actually, every single Democrat, make or female, is polarizing to R's , &amp; would have some human flaw that trump would prey on. So..... Might as, well ignore them, since they won't vote Dem.
Please don't act as if the GOP cares about the constitution, they threw away their constitutional oversight to fall in line with a corrupt criminal pres. The GOP couldn't care less that Trump subverts the constitution to put tax dollars in his back pocket.
In my rural Oregon community, a neighbor had installed a hand-painted, wooden BLM sign which was subsequently vandalized with ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in **orange** paint. Later it was destroyed.   Today they installed a BLM flag, attached to a tree, 25 feet up üí™.
Trump doesn't need to win the election if he can steal it. #TrumpsEvilPlan
Most recent TRUMP FAILURE
Thank you President Trump!!! #FakeNews doesn't control the narrative üëèüá∫üá∏
Litterally. They do nothing to satisfy their constituents, they just tell Trump to stay out of it, while they leave police on the front lines. At some point though the police have to realize their being used to protect injustice.
As usual, the crook only makes deals to reneg. Feel free to continue getting your ass handed to you in Portland.
Love to see him debate Trump.
You repeated lies of AG Barr &amp;Sen. Graham when they falsely claimed FBI investigation began w/ Steele dossier. You kept repeating this idiotic defense even after it became painfully evident Trump team welcomed Russia‚Äôs interference in American democracy and tried to cover it up.
there‚Äôs so much double speak going on between Kate talking out of both side of her mouth then chads declaration and Trump with the national guard threat
Not gonna lie it would make my fucking day if I got blocked by 45 because of all the hate tweets I send trumpy trump‚Äôs way.
From a human who reads and is on the ground in Portland ... prepare yourself for tRump getting 4 more years. Don't get mad at me. If üí© don't radically change in 95 days prepare yourself for a shock.  And I'd lay my life down to get Biden into office &amp; I'm not a fan.
based on what information?? Name another global pandemic virus that relied upon HERD IMMUNITY to slow down the rate of death.
Why hasn't Trump's  tweet been taken down by Twitter?
We can postpone the election. Trump's term, and that of Pence, is four years. Then it's done. Come next January, it's President Pelosi until we can have an election. #PresidentPelosi
1,113 dead from covid today so far only 5:46 in the west . Record death all because Trump's an idiot .
Gotta admit, if I could round up every GOP member of congress along with the entire Trump administration, send them all out to see on a cargo ship and sink it, I would do it in a heartbeat.
I think they‚Äôd prefer it. Puts Trump completely out of their minds even more quickly
The Chinese government isn't responsible for safeguarding American lives, Trump is, and he's failed horribly.
did tucker carlson start making himself orange to appeal to trump? every photo i see of him he is more and more orange
I can‚Äôt retweet because I can‚Äôt stand looking at this guy, he‚Äôs such a pussy for Trump...
Trump is responsible for all the deaths on his watch
No Pardon for Trump
No but Trump &amp; the GOP made a contribution. However,  Cain was an educated adult who had access to information on the virus, he knew he was in a high risk category and no one forced him to go to the rally. Personal responsibility is a real thing.
He's busy protecting confederate statues.  Personally I hold Chief Justice John Roberts responsible for all of Trump's actions since the trial. He allowed the GOP to exonerate him when he should have been removed.
The LP is funny while killing Trump in the latest.
You are doing a fantastic job. Ignore Trump‚Äôs mouth-breathing base.
Nixon did shit like that and we forced him to resign. Why does Trump get a free pass?
This is what we are in for from now through election day.... The Trump administration is suing in Pennsylvania to NOT ALLOW people to drop off their ballots into a ballot box. This is insanity! Here in Portland many, many drop their ballots into ballot boxes.
We basically already have thanks to Pres. Trump
It is Trump's time that is almost up there sunshine.  You guys have been manipulated to that he is saving our country, when in reality he is actively destroying it.
Trump keeps his enemies close. Fauci is likely not a friend. These letters suggest Fauci workships Hillary, like the dark priestess she is...
I am sorry for your loss and he sounds like an intelligent and amazing man.  But he made a huge mistake and it cost him his life.  He listened to Donald Trump.
Yep, but it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwe chosen to let this orange bastard almost sink us.‚Äù It is ‚ÄúCongressional Republicans &amp; Trumpers chose to let this orange bastard sink us.‚Äù It‚Äôs going to take decades(if ever) to fix Trump‚Äôs &amp; Republican damage to our Economy, DOS, FDA, USPS, Elections, etc.I‚Äôm at peace, take me now Trump!
Talking about being safe looks like more people is dying under President Trump‚Äôs Tenured then any president ever !
To be fair only 56.9% of the voters actually showed up to the polls in 2016 and he didn‚Äôt win the popular vote, so technically only about 26% of the voting population wanted him. That said, that many people supporting Trump is terrifying.
Third, don't allow yourself to fall prey to the propaganda about voter fraud via mailed ballots. There's no evidence of fraud of this kind in our history. Remember, a cornered animal lashes out... Trump will use every dirty trick in his arsenal to keep from losing.
The rule that Trump struck from the Fair Housing Act was not just in terms of low-income housing. It's specifically about requiring non-discrimination in housing, primarily along racial lines.  "Whites Only" signs are banned but redlining still exists. That's bad for America.
I agree the tweet is not impeachable itself. Maybe they're picking this because they really secretly want trump to lose, and it's pretty clear you can't just move your own election so you don't lose. You'd think Republicans could easily condemn Russian bounties also.
Holy shit, thank goodness indeed. It hadn't even occurred to me that, had we not flipped the house, a GOP house might have backed trump up on this.
So true. These people are so annoying. I should be playing video games, but instead I am reading their none sense about Gizlane and Trump. HAHA
Now, it all makes sense. He was the called in assist attorney in the impeachment trial for Donald and this attorney being in friendship with Epstein and Trump. Wow!! It's one big gang of a circle of whoremongers, thieves and liars.
They'll get my new album (a 3 LP, triple gatefold concept album of thoughts in my head about the Trump regime) whenever I'm damn good and ready.
Expose them all! #JeanLucBrunel, #PrinceAndrew, #AlanDershowitz must (a) Asset forfeiture of all their assets. Then, (b) all rot in jail. Who else was pals w #JeffreyEpstein, rode on #LolitaExpress, visited #pedophile island?  #BillClinton ? #Trump?
Just how "long" is he? Maybe Trump felt threatened.
Dumb divisive disgraceful dishonest disingenuous degrading dangerous deadly devilish Donald J.Trump he‚Äôs unfit to be call president .
Look in the Trump mirror.
An old piece (2016) from white nationalist Tucker Carlson. It is useful to read in that it gives a view into the mind of a MAGAt. Explains why Trump still holds a 30% base.
I thought you were a trump supporter or that was just a fake!!!!
#JeanLucBrunel, #PrinceAndrew, #AlanDershowitz must (a) Asset forfeiture of all their assets. Then, (b) all rot in jail. Who else was pals w #JeffreyEpstein, rode on #LolitaExpress, visited #pedophile island?  Bill Clinton? #Trump? Expose them all!
Don't  ever recall having to wait 8 f'n HOURS on line at the grocery store. Trump &amp; his cronies VOTE BY MAIL. Why can't the rest of us????
Great job calling Trump‚Äôs home where children were sex trafficked the ‚ÄúWinter White House‚Äù dumb reporters everywhere.
Trump pulling out of Germany, and reining in the NATO budget is a start.    NATO = Iron Curtain defense  USSR = defunct   Time to pull the money home and reconfigure.   CCP / Iran / N.Korea / Russia are all present threats NOT explicitly provisioned for NATO.   RECONFIGURE TIME
Trump is going to make America safe again? Did he finally come up with a plan to get the coronavirus pandemic under control? 155,000 American deaths &amp; counting. Regardless, I have to wonder why Trump let America get so dangerous in the first place? It was much safer 4 years ago.
#AlanDershowitz, #JeanLucBrunel , #PrinceAndrew, must (a) Asset forfeiture of all their assets. Then, (b) all rot in jail. Who else was pals w #JeffreyEpstein, rode on #LolitaExpress, visited #pedophile island?  Bill Clinton? #Trump? Expose them all
After listening to this  interview with retiring Rep.  I think the Democrats are going to win Texas. (I'm pretty sure that's not what Will Hurd wanted me to take away from this.)
Literally every tweet from you is "I'm not trump" that's great and all.... but is that all ya got? Like how tf you going to fix shit? Oh thats right .... "nothing will fundamentally change"  well shits pretty f'd so nothing changing is a bunch of malarkey!
#JeanLucBrunel , #PrinceAndrew, #AlanDershowitz must (a) Asset forfeiture of all their assets. Then, (b) all rot in jail. Who else was pals w #JeffreyEpstein, rode on #LolitaExpress, visited #pedophile island?  Bill Clinton? #Trump? Expose them all
Co-founder Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi, says Trump's idea delaying election is grounds for impeachment
What about the states (like mine) that have had mail in voting almost universally for YEARS?! Are our 13 electoral votes going to come into question just because of trump‚Äôs lies?
Ok so what do you do when those kids carry it back home to you and you get sick and die? That Herman Cain dude thought it was a hoax too and now he‚Äôs dead as fuck because he listened to Trump. But yeah go ahead and continue to think you‚Äôre smarter than scientists üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Right-wing media work to spin Trump's "Delay the Election" tweet
Okay, did anyone else notice the weird cheap ads that ran during the  hour? It just occurred to me that Trump ads were suspended today, and that last minute swap in would explain it. What do you think?
Tape shows Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein discussing women at 1992 party  via  #EvictTrump for #TrumpsEvilPlan
Expect another Trump diversion tweet akin to the election delay one he used today
By the way, when Donald Trump tweeted about making suburban neighborhoods "secure" by ensuring they wouldn't be bothered by low income housing... he alienated most of his own base. üòÇ That IS who his vote is MADE up of: low-income, non-college educated people.
There‚Äôs a good article in the current Vanity Fair about trump supporters and their conspiracy theories.
Hold your breath because it iant Bernie and when you wake up from your fit it will be Trump again
Trump only received 8% of the vote from people of color. That is 8 out of 100%. üòÇ That you think he will get more this year is fucking comedy. The difference was that in 2016 he had promises. In 2020, he has a track record.
trump is dangerous delusional slobbering moronic and just nuts.
Can't be nearly as bad as Trump's America
Exactly!  Way too clever to be tRump. While I believe he would say disparaging things on this level even about his base, it just doesn‚Äôt sound like his speech cadence and it‚Äôs too lucid to be him.

Oh give me a break. Election fraud isn‚Äôt committed where ballots are cast. Not worth the risk. In NV the only individual voter fraud in 16 was a trump voter who voted twice to try to prove it cd be done. She failed.  That‚Äôs typical. Not worth the effort v risk for individuals.
Maybe he just wants a replacement ticket. Not because he objects to Trump's fascism, but rather because he objects to his poll numbers.

An influential conservative who argued against Trump's impeachment now calls for it after the president's 'fascistic' suggestion to delay the November election
Too bad that Trump didn‚Äôt realize that the country has two coasts unto which planes can land.... then there was his well planned out return of Americans overseas resulting in crowds stuck for hours in NYC airport. Donald is just one big genius..
Doesn‚Äôt trump have to be charged with something to get pardoned? If he isn‚Äôt charged until after Jan 20 there is nothing Pence could do.
Something must be done. BLM and their Goons are planning on attacking all Trump supporters at the ballot box on November 3. Saw it on the Internet today. I‚Äôm not joking this is serious! They want Biden in there so they can pull his strings. Joe is a puppet that they can control.
Why do you lie to the American people about mail in voting by saying it is much different from absentee voting?  There is no distinction between the two an in fact the Trump administration in their own brief in court, said the two things (terms) are interchangeable
Yes.  Have to agree.  Mulligan's performance certainly fits Trump and 90% of the Trump-GOP Party !  I have no idea where they are coming from or what they are talking about.  All I know is there are thousands of indians down there waiting for us.  Time to sing the death song !
Yeah...that Trump is a genius mastermind üôÑ

‚ÄúBut there are many ways to cancel elections, and not all of them involve literally failing to hold the balloting.‚Äù
Diversion? Distraction? Serious threat? How should we take Trump‚Äôs blabber about postponing the election? Susan B Glasser has me worried. Again.  ‚Äú This is the kind of statement that should haunt your dreams. It is wannabe-dictator talk....
Sure, if everyone but Trump agrees he actually lost the election.   Red states have to hold elections, split gov/leg states have to agree on electors, the Senate has to certify results, SCOTUS has to rule on any challenges. Even one breakdown and we're in deep shit.
Poor little fear monger Trump-frighteningly Finding finding followers  vastly fleeing
I just made up my mind. I‚Äôm voting for trump. And I‚Äôll give you one good reason better than any of yours. He has a mind of his own, unlike Biden. So block me already or have something constructive to say
American parent here, Kim. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about our kids. He only cares about himself. Schools will reopen when it‚Äôs safe. That‚Äôs when kids will go back. Just like Baron! Sit this one out!
nice, not social distancing, and all crowded together!  Way to keep the trump fans safe, you DA!!!
Too bad this isn't true, the health insurance companies own your heart and soul. You are every bit as complicit in these deaths as Trump and Obama. Sadly, other people are paying the consequences of corruption that you, Trump, and Obama deserve to suffer.
With all due respect,  killed Herman Cain. Herman Cain trusted Trump to keep him safe - he was betrayed by Trump.
They are the same.  You‚Äôre only sent a mail in ballot if you requested one and are registered voter. No one is just randomly sent a ballot.  Trump knows he‚Äôs losing. If he was winning he would be encouraging everyone to vote. Don‚Äôt believe his bullshit.
John Lewis Believed America Would Survive Trump
#MaxwellFiles let‚Äôs see some of those names. tRump is getting nervous!

It‚Äôs much easier to call other countries liars than to admit trump is a gigantic failure, huh?
‚ÄúSo, sorry, we cannot just ignore it when the President threatens to cancel an election. This is the kind of statement that should haunt your dreams. It is wannabe-dictator talk.‚Äù
Trump is not responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Trump has been a pathetic leader and has spread misinformation. Cain is an educated, intelligent adult. But he made an unwise decision. He should‚Äôve known better. He was a cancer survivor in his 70s.
Let‚Äôs not forget his other ventures, such as Trump U, etc.
Trump is so far right, he makes Jr. look like a leftist. And that is not a simple task
Barack is clearly an unrefined divisive hack  . Thank God for President Trump
Those accounts are most likely fake.  Think about it.  Trump's base consists of illiterate people who care nothing about Twitter and don't even own smart phones.  Want proof of election interference? Twitter is your best source.

That will upset Trump.
MAGA have to tell themselves that people dying of Covid are people who would‚Äôve died anyway. It‚Äôs the only way they can deal with the cognitive dissonance of seeing trump‚Äôs unpopulist response. They‚Äôre wrong though. Herman Cain would not have died anyway &amp; neither would others.
I agree, the toothless tweets and party rhetoric have been ineffective in taking on the GOP. I worry everyone is resting on their laurels assuming trump will lose but that happened in 2016 and this is where we are. I wish we had a firey progressive candidate to rally behind
All of which, by the way, ended in street violence. I haven't even mentioned the "2nd Amendment people" Trump has been priming for this battle, but they will make themselves known as all this unfolds, with grim results. 10/11
"He doesn‚Äôt have to win the election. He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn‚Äôt lose." - historian Nils Gilman, part of this bipartisan group that gamed out Trump-refusing-to-go scenarios. 9/11

McConnell's Senate refuses to certify the disputed results of a partial election, so Democrats sue. Or if they do certify, the states who sat it out sue to stop it. Or Trump sues, or the GOP sues. In which case... 5/11
Yes I do. My solution is early morning Trump sign removal. It‚Äôs my gift to America.
So, in other words, someone other than yourself and Trump, right? You have done more damage to this country than Trump could ever hope to achieve. Neither of you should be POTUS.
Under pressure from these people, and the right-wing media, Trump lackeys in state governments cancel, delay, or refuse to certify their elections, under the pretense of election security. 3/11
It's not Barr's call. We still do have a few laws that Trump can't screw with.

The Republicans who can't put their country before their party are idiots. Trump destroying our country is one thing. Sitting back and supporting it because you don't want the other party to succeed is idiotic.

No, you won't. Unlike most, I've read all your published policies and am fully aware of who is advising your campaign, and your history. You are a conservative sociopath who is a danger to American's lives, just like Trump.
The crazy thing that people don‚Äôt seem to be talking about is that the administration doesn‚Äôt seem to care. 2008 was crazy bad and we had villains to blame. 2020 is just an IEnumerable.MoveNext() on Trump‚Äôs tweets. Insane.
Maybe we‚Äôve got this whole thing backwards. Trump attacks the legitimacy of the election, claims it was rigged the whole time, loses, but then steps down as he should because, come on, there‚Äôs no way this man doesn‚Äôt hate every second of this. He can leave but also say he won. ü§î

Today the justification from some for President Trump saying delay the election was... Wait for it...   He can‚Äôt do it anyways.

Trump is the only one that kicked him out
But yet he didn't vote to impeach Trump. Political coward.
Trump, in a truly pathetic attempt to steal public attention, tries to steal from Obama‚Äôs incredible eulogy of John Lewis by choosing that moment to call in the camera go talk about Vanessa Guillen. Both deceased Americans deserve better. What a sad, small, pitiful man.
For 20-30% upside gains before the election. Trump will bankrupt America to keep this market up. Easiest and most guaranteed return I have seen in 20 years.

Trump is trying to cast doubt on absentee ballot voting because he‚Äôs losing. If he was confident of a win? He‚Äôd be encouraging voting.   Low voter turnout in 2016 helped Trump win. Even then he claimed elections were ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù Because he thought he would lose.   #VoteByMail

I think you mean the center. The actual "left" doesn't like Biden or Trump's shit policies.
I can‚Äôt imagine she wouldn‚Äôt recall Trump‚Äôs name though
I honestly give him too much credit. I see him as an evil villain who has worked out code words with his crime boss Putin.   Trump: Get this, get this, when I tweet üçï, the trolls push pizza gate.   Putin: Sure Donnie, so about pulling out of Germany, let‚Äôs get that rolling.
Eight years of you was more than enough for me. How you have managed to retain hero status is beyond me, you governed like a conservative and led directly to Trump's election. You're one hell of a performer though, you fooled me into voting for you twice.

No, but your beating heart is cause for concern. Given the atrocities that you have committed or enabled via draconian legislation, of which the consequences are now playing out, and your lust for war and profits above people, you and Trump are both dangerous sociopaths.

Apparently the co-founder of the Federalist Society agrees with you.
That any Democrat would support  for any elected office is appealing. The parade of conservative sociopaths who sought out the Democratic nation was horrific to witness. The only true Democrat running was vilified. We deserve Trump.

I'm furious with you. Rachel Maddow says, "watch what they do, not what they say." While Trump is spouting absurdities, behind the scenes the US Postal Service is under siege by a Trump-appointed mad man.  They are going to fucking thwart mail-in voting. THAT is how Trump wins.
In 2020, if you are still shocked at what Trump says and does after he SAID he would DO it... you are in for a treat.
Trump disbanded the Pandemic Task Force, said the virus would disappear ‚Äúlike a miracle‚Äù, and allowed 40,000 people to return from China w/o quarantine or testing. His response to COVID-19 has been atrocious.
Bye, bye, Gizlane. Take Trump with you.

Then trust it even if (when) you lose.  Don‚Äôt contest it based on false pretenses and hyped up lies.  The in-person votes will tell the story minutes after the polls close because it will be such a massive loss for Trump.  But, every vote must be counted.
No, it isn't. Those "presidents" are the sociopaths who paved the way for Trump to get elected and wage war against us. They are more than just complicit. Everything Trump has done, they have enabled through their failure in office.

The hypocrisy of my fellow Democrats is disgusting. It's one thing to call out Trump or the Republican party for committing horrific acts of cruelty and incompetence, but to ignore the same when it comes to our own delegitimizes any moral standing we take.

Trump claimed voting fraud in 2016 and he won. Now he claims fraud before the 2020 election is even held.  We know, then, that he claim the election was stolen from him when he loses in Nov.  So, the question we need to be thinking about now is how we will respond then.
My prediction, pin it.  Nov 3rd Trump loses countable popular vote 55% - 42%. Election called by networks for Buden.  Trump then says he needs mail in votes counted. Within a week, it is clear outcome for Biden.  Trump then claims mail in votes rigged against him.  Jan 20, Biden

Dollars to donuts your average trump supporter would fervently advocate for this approach. They‚Äôve been led to believe blue states and cities are populated solely by rabid animals that must be exterminated.
No not at all.  Would it make a difference in 96 days?  Impeaching him would have made the difference.  I think those up for reelection are definitely lying low, but still hoping to ride a Trump wave Nov 3.
"The possible cutbacks come as DeJoy, a major donor to President Donald Trump who took control of the agency last month, moves to eliminate overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers, potentially causing a delay in mail deliveries."

It's easy to read his mind. "Damn, this democratic representation system really bugs me. Why can't we just declare Trump king, or maybe emperor - life would be so much easier!!"

"Barack Obama, one of the sleaziest and most dishonest figures in the history of American politics."  That's a funny way to say Donald Trump.
THISüëáüèªis from a Federalist Society member! That‚Äôs how outrageous it is....
The Constitution in this regard is self operating. Like Biden said recently, pretty sure the US Secret Service will be happy to escort former Pres* Trump out of the White House on 1/20/2021.
Hard to watch. Trump gets into voting at the 8:45 mark. All bullshit. Gardner sitting right across from him says nothing, natch. Polis gives a pretty hopeful, glowing report on battling the virus. Sigh.
The only problem with this theory is that  is directly responsible for drafting and passing the draconian legislation that allows Trump to commit these atrocities. He is the same brand of sociopathy that Trump is.
Let me guess, what to do if Trump actually wins?

My paranoid (?) concern. Yesterday Barr admitted he had NO evidence of any mail-in voting fraud. But it was "common sense". Trump said it would be "very easy" for some country to run off thousands of phony ballots.  It sounds too much like "Russia, if you're listening"
Hillary did more to give us Trump than any voter did, but these people find it easier to blame a bunch of random strangers than to accept their fave isn't what they thought ahe was. Parasocial relationships with politicians are whack.
.Stupid is as stupid does-he should have instead watched President Obama and possibly-oh wait we are talking trump here
The only risk from mail-in voting is the Trump administration deliberately slowing down the mail. We've been all mail-in for years without incident. Absentee voting and mail-in voting are the same damn thing.
My thoughts exactly. Just another one of Trump‚Äôs bitches!

Trump should not be a role model.  When you mock Trump's partial paralysis you are mocking every stroke victim with partial paralysis.  Mock his decisions. Mock his dishonesty. Mock his insecurity. Mock his  lack of taking responsibility.  Having a stroke is not a moral failure.

Add in the other threats the USA is facing such as massive economic unsustainability, crumbling infrastructure plus the inability to handle basic challenges that other societies pass (pandemic) and the fact that more fascists will come after Trump  I fear for the future.
I‚Äôm only interested in saving the country from trump‚Äôs fascists. All I want from our government is truth, honesty and decency. That‚Äôs my agenda for winning. So fuck you if you don‚Äôt like that.
It's very frustrating to have watched both Mainstream Media and Liberal "Independent" Media excuse Violent Left Wing Extremism for the last 4 years; and CONTINUE to do so now.  It's not Trump who has a stranglehold on our Countrymen; it's "Journalists" and "Celebrities".
If there's nobody in the office of President or VP, the Speaker of the House becomes President. At noon on January 20th, election or not, Trump &amp; Pence are out of office. Also: Constitution requires that President's term expires &amp; doesn't require that Congressional terms expire.

I know it's hard to wrap ur head around, but Trump is slashing the amt of polling sites in rural/lower income areas so its near impossible for them to vote unless it's via mail-in. Covid is an issue, but this is also why we need nation-wide mail-in voting.

This is all about what Putin wants, not Trump. Trump and the Republicans have sold America out to Russia.

Obama would agree with the end of this tweet - today was about celebrating the life of a man who did his part to make our country better.  And today was also a day for Trump to give you pizza recommendations for the next time you are in New York.
Yeah. I don't blame Trump for covid. I do blame him for America's response being a train wreck. The deaths didn't need to be anywhere near as high as it is. We're 6 months in and WE STILL DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL TESTING PLAN. It's bonkers. Trump and his enablers own that.
His family should sue trump for gross neglience
Aren't you TIRED of shoveling sh*t after Trump dumps it??? We're sure tired of listening to you make excuses for that PATHETIC POS. Aren't you embarrassed enough already to drop the act?????
"Trying to lose" would explain so much. Then again, that presumes that Trump is intelligent enough to even plan something like that, or to stick to the plan.

So trump‚Äôs plan is to hold this country hostage. So we now know what his plans are. How do we stop him? How do we stop him from declaring martial law and suspending the election? This sounds like free campaign time for trump. How do we stop this?
Right, and this may explain why they hate him so much. More than 10 years ago, long before he decided to run for office, it was Trump who cooperated with the police after he learned what was going on over at Epstein‚Äôs house in Palm Beach. Trump barred him from Mar-a-Lago.
Trump sounds like he is suffering from delusions. What he is saying is not true. He‚Äôs telling how he is going to try to steal the election, steal our country. We want evidence, not just #BULLSHIT. Evidence.
Even For just admitted that. Trump can't even get the lipstick near the pig.
This moron is way too late with way too little. No trust in trump. Make a deal with Barr, save your family. Do time instead of them. Will never happen. Come on, B-actor, snarl and growl for us.     #BULLSHIT
fall for Trump trolling rhetoric ...
The old conman is floundering, in a panic, realizing how little he really knows. Trump is responsible for thousands of deaths. We have to elect  in 2020.  has a heart, has a soul,  has my trust. Vote
This isnt about Trump. Knock it off.
I'm of the belief that re-impeaching Trump isn't a good idea, because it would give Congressional Republicans one last chance to cut ties with him. Right now they are tied to their votes for acquittal. Now, the 25th Amendment‚Ä¶
Laurence is an insightful anti-Trump person. That is quite rare. I think we've found the needle in the haystack. Yes Laurence, you are exactly right.
I've tweeted twice and have a copy on my hard drive.  Carlin knew how this country works. He would have done a 2 hour standup doing nothing but ranting about Trump well before the end of his first year in office.
It's very clear that anti-Trump people are far more malicious and spite-filled
Let's get something straight here...  The poor The elderly Minorities People with pre-existing health conditions  These are the people who are #dyingforTrump.  They didn't choose to die, Trump and his mentally impaired cult helped to spread #COVID19.  #TrumpGenocide
Unbelievable that this tweet from Pelosi only got 49,000 likes and Trump‚Äôs tweet got 183,000 likes. I think he‚Äôs got a bunch of bots liking his tweets. I sure hope so.
Yet, we should take his tweets seriously. Have you been around the last 3 1/2 years? People just need to do their homework and know that Trump cannot do anything about when this election happens.
You‚Äôve got my vote. WA voting has never been better-run, easier, or more universal than it is now, with global mail-in. From Trump‚Äôs POV the problem has to be that it‚Äôs too easy for his deniers - he can‚Äôt stand that it minimizes the pain associated with voting him off the island.
I didn't vote in our last election. I wasn't enthusiastic back then. After looking into Trump's accomplishments as president, I have come around. He's certainly not our greatest president but far from the worst as some say.
Trump won‚Äôt step in, he hasn‚Äôt stepped in for soldiers with bounties on their heads. He kisses Putin‚Äòs ass. He doesn‚Äôt care about Americans.
And one person of color, at the very end of the line. The line sums up the Trump voter
What should he do domestically? Mask ban? You do know that states can mandate masks. No need for Trump to do that
That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I would love Trump to be thrown in jail, he deserves to be thrown in jail. And Trump is not far left. You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre talking about.
Good job,     Now if you could just do this to all of Trump's tweets, that'd be great.  Thanks!
It seems that when you are a member of the  team, you are not immune to the "prevarication pandemic" that is part &amp; parcel of the Trump regime.    "Truth" is whatever they say it is.  You only need to remember  offering "alternative facts" in 2017!
I was a diehard Democrat for a long time. I came to my own conclusions. I'm not a Republican now either. Anyway, cult or not, that's not the point. The enthusiasm gap can manifest favorably for Trump in the polls. That's why I bring it up
If a democrat said any one of a thousand things Trump has said, you‚Äôd have blown an aneurysm. So hush, concern troll.
Good to know Benghazi doesn't bother him at all.  Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Mail in voting IS secure, efficient and effective, been doing it for 11 years in Washington state; no issues. Trump if you try to suppress the vote you will find that the current riots will pale in comparison to the pain that we will bring personally and directly to you
Ferguson: WA Will Fight Trump's 'Unlawful' Plan To Delay Election
Ferguson: WA Will Fight Trump's 'Unlawful' Plan To Delay Election
That's good you can admit that. I can admit Trump is flawed too. But it is well known that there is an enthusiasm gap. People voting for Trump are enthusiastic for him. People voting for Biden are generally "meh, I guess so, about Biden. I've seen plenty of that. That's important
I don't think Trump wrote that, it has punctuation and makes sense.
Yup! And, tRump lost a vote in November. I wonder how many others he'll be losing as well once other rally attendees drop from this.
Correction, Trump Virus.
Lancet had to retract their anti-HCL article that wasn't part reviewed because #Trump
Please try to grasp reality. Donald Trump IS the President, whether you acknowledge it or not! ü§£ü§£ü§£
Only negativity I've heard about it is from Fauci the media and Government.  And Trump haters. Lot of Doctors are for it. Think we should listen to them
Meanwhile, back in reality, the media have been engaged in non-stop hysteria about Trump for four years.
Who could have predicted Trump would pull a stunt like this? It drives him crazy that Obama, who is, you know, *black*, could be more popular than he is. #MAGA
"Democrats just blocked lowering benefits to 200$ a week"  There, I fixed it for you... By the way, Trump is requesting a 1.4 BILLION $ bailout for his hotels....
I'm going to repeat myself just one time. Democrats calles Trump's travel ban "xenophobic", meaning they would've had a more delayed response. There are no Russian bounties. The CIA has backed off from that intel conclusion. But I don't expect you anti-Trump people to know.
You watch fake news. Millions of jobs are created each month during the pandemic. Democrats called Trump's travel ban "xenophobic". Their response would've been worse!
I can‚Äôt get past the 166k likes on this tweet, supporting him disrupting our democracy. Stupid fucking people. Fortunately Trump doesn‚Äôt have a say in whether we delay voting, Congress sets the voting days.
Odd. That's been my experience with anti-Trump experiment
Maybe it's Trump's plan to get rid of the "Deep State".
Fuuuuuuuck Trump
how are you feeling about this now?
Is that Schiffs wife. ü§£ü§£ü§£
The blood of a million dead on his hands but sure, he‚Äôs not a hateful person, because Mr. Drone Strike and Deport more people than anyone except Trump Obama said he was cool. Perhaps they‚Äôre all bad, friend.
Trump has done that to make fun of different people. So no, it wasn't an effort to make fun of someone who is disabled. But you wouldn't know that because anti-Trump people are willfully ignorant
And yet, Biden is the one constantly calling the POTUS "racist" and emphatically running on a "I'm not Trump" platform, rather than to discuss his own plans for the nation. Sleepy Joe, you're a hack.
don‚Äôt let trump delay the 2020 election
please stop Trump from delaying the election
The democrats called Trump's travel ban "xenophobic". Therefore, there's every reason to believe a Democratic president would have handled it far worse.
Even in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is still asking the Supreme Court to gut the Affordable Care Act and take health care away from tens of millions of Americans. That‚Äôs completely unconscionable. In Congress, I‚Äôll build on the ACA and finally get us to universal coverage:
Well no she'd be wrong. That "Trump Supporter" was actually just a REAL Republican who actively spoke out against Trumpty and for BLM.... Nobody knows who attacked him.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha omg trump is a misogynist, a homophobe, a rapist, a bully, an islamophobe, an idiot the one thing he is NOT is a leader
If Trump didn't have that rally? You expect him to not have rallies as a president seeking reelection?
Even Republican senators are backing away from Trump's idea of delaying the election. I wonder if any regret their votes to acquit him in the impeachment trial.  Read &amp; spread:
Trump: the virus is a hoax folks totally fake news  Also Trump: because of the dangerous virus I need to postpone the election
His term ends in January.  If no election, Pelosi becomes temp POTUS.  Trump has never read the Constitution.  But you can bet it all that he has read the first REAL internal polling info released, and he knows his numbers are worse than he has been told.
üôÇ   "I believe in being prepared. Months ago, I asked my legal team to get ready for the poss. that Pres. Trump might attempt to unlawfully delay the election.  If &lt;he&gt; tries to delay the Nov. election, we will immediately challenge him in fed court. And we will win."
Trump: let's delay the election  Dems: *gasp* but that's against the rules you've refused to follow for 4 years!!!  Trump: I need $6bil to delay the election  Dems: here you go üí∞üí∞üí∞
And a Trump-appointed ambassador is mourning the deaths of those Nazi soldiers.
"Trump can't do that!"  Trump proceeds to do it anyway.  Over and over again.
A bunch of my friends have talked me into calling it "the Trump Virus".  I was a little reluctant, since I don't wish to appear racist.
Are there still people pretending Trump is not a fascist?   I'm not being hysterical or dramatic whatsoever, and I'm not saying we live under a fascist system, but Trump's political ideology is, clearly, fascism.
Trump has no legal authority to delay a presidential election. The date is set in federal law, and the state and local officials who administer our elections all take oaths to uphold this law.   Anyone unwilling to honor their oath will need to step aside. This is non-negotiable.
When Trump stole the presidency.
I feel you, but I sure af don't want 4-8 years of Pence. I'd like to be able to enjoy Trump's suffering properly lol
I have a theory about this. I think if Trump goes down, Pence is the candidate of the GOP, and I don't think Biden beats Pence. Pence isn't "Trumpy" enough to push away Never Trumpers. Trump dying right now may actually not be better.
He caught COVID at a Trump rally
Being Black for Trump literally killed Herman Cain.
Conflating facts is not becoming. ü§£ I still love you.
Hey, America voted during the Civil War, so we can do this. I understand your fear and confess that I‚Äôm feeling horrible anxiety, but if we give in to fear, Trump wins. No fracking way.
It really is wild to see Trump doubling down on racism. Also wild: 1/3 of the country is hardcore into it, which doesn't overlap the plurality that will still vote for him and his racist actions because "being racist isn't as bad as being pro-choice" as much as you'd think.
Trump says absentee voting is "good", but universal mail voting will be a disastrous embarrassment. I'm having trouble figuring out the essential difference. ü§î #MAGA
In another unsurprising excuse to install himself as America‚Äôs first dictator, F√ºrer Trumpery is considering delaying the election AND not accepting results if he loses.
The most dangerous things the President may ever do. Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that  via
I distinctly recall a number of people voting for Trump because ‚Äúhe says what he means‚Äù. I agree   When someone tells you who they are, believe them.   #TrumpIsAFascist
"But he can't do that," they say, not acknowledging the many other things Trump "can't" do that he's already done.
Yesterday Barr declared that Congress had delegated census responsibilities to the commerce secretary, so he was free to define individuals as citizens. What's to stop Trump/Barr from claiming Congress delegated some part of elections to a cabinet secretary, and declare a move?
Is this the template for delaying the election? Everyone is now saying "Trump can't move the election, only Congress can", but what if Barr decides that Congress has delegated some election responsibilities to a cabinet secretary, and thus they can change it?
A Trump appointed ambassador mourinig dead Nazis. If someone had wrote this in a story we'd all thing it was way too heavy-handed.  But here we are, in reality.
No delay in the election. This idiot is going down. We must elect a new president. Our country can‚Äôt stand anymore disaster from trump. Vote  in 2020, vote blue, vote pro USA.
Now all the tRump fans will be clamoring for their commemorative alien DNA coins...
Barr has made his dissent with Trump clear on the case with Stone, so no not the case. Democrats are terrified that Barr is investigating the DNC for spying on the Trump campaign and launching phony scandals. Democrats are trying to distract America with the hearing. Wake up!
Lmao you‚Äôre obsessed with him. Just look at your sad timeline...all you do is talk about Trump! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why waste money right now when our country is in so much trouble. Trump is pushing it, he‚Äôs been pushing going to Mars since he got in office. He wants to be like Kennedy, which is a laugh.
It is possible he's hiding something regarding his taxes, but if it is something egregious the IRS would take action. And in either case, the actions of the democrats are not motivated by justice. Never have been. The DNC spied on the Trump campaign and launched phony scandals.
Bill Barr has a long, positive reputation and service to this nation. He is investigating corrupt democrats for spying into the Trump campaign and launching phony scandals at him. And now they embrace rioters. Congressional democrats are the ones who should be tried for treason.
Bill Barr has a long, positive reputation and service to this nation. He is investigating corrupt democrats for spying into the Trump campaign and launching phony scandals at him. And now they embrace rioters. I can't express in words how much I despise congressional democrats.
You know that mask mandates can come from the state. Stop blaming Trump for that one.
And yet so many libertarian gun supporters are going to help Joe Biden get elected by voting 3rd party.  Gun control groups support Biden. #WakeUp.  Trump 2020
None of this is true. Post office was profitable before the insane mandate to fund 75 years of future pensions. And on Amazon, they could charge more, but no one is subsidizing them:
Trump launched BOOGALOO 2020 with his Liberate Michigan VA MN tweets. Armed Hawaiian shirt militias show. Boogaloo Bois. Same white anarchists who perpetrated crimes during every BLM and Floyd protest. Trump Op. Barr covers.
No. Trump's approval rating is rising since the riots. Polls only show Trump behind Biden by 8-10% nationally but studies show Republicans are FAR less likely to choose to reveal their political beliefs. This skews polls. Trump does very well in online polls too.
You don't know why? Democrats have turned their backs on police officers across the nation. More than 100 police agencies have also publicly endorsed Trump. This serves them right.
Trump again attempts to stoke racial divisions in housing message #gopracist &amp; #gopkochsuckers ‚Å¶ this group can join #LouieGohmert and suffer in #COVID19 Hell
Last March: Trump told aides that journalists hated him so much they would try to contract #coronavirus on purpose to give it to him on Air Force One. ‚ÄúThis is full-blown, pathological, paranoid-level delusion,‚Äù a former West Wing official said.  #MAGA
That's an important distinction. Your side is motivated against Trump. But our side is motivated for Trump. You'll be miserable with either result.
üóØ Oh dear, now you're gonna rile up the #Bigfoot and #yeti crowd. They will send you loads of recent pics of the fella.  Recent pics of #Sasquatch, that is. There are lots of those.  #Trump reading, though... you're on your own finding that one.
Calling someone racist by immediately using a racial slur...classic ü§£ü§£ü§£ 1. Anybody who suggests to watch Fox News,CNN,MSNBC or any mainstream media for any information is the uneducated one. 2. The dems have tried for 4 years  to round up and kill Trump...FOH SON
Donald Trump and his supporters often claim "the left" is committing massive voter fraud but can never seem to get any evidence of it.  Funny, when we go looking for fraud, it's usually Republicans. And cops.
Remember when Obama have 100‚Äôs of millions to his friends solar company b that immediately folded when paid? Trump does it right, we will profit from his talents. #gop #fakenews
Trump is basically daring Dems to impeach him again while he actively dismantles systems of democracy.
So, the Republicans are in power. Look at the death around you. Realize how you feel, people. This is straight up propaganda. Donald Trump Jr. defines the term idiocy. Pathetic, traitor.
Depends what your view of America is but I am game for a conversation about when Trump did something for someone else. I have never thought to research that but would be nice to set things straight. Again, this is a biased topic to start, it's based upon a biased view.
Zero accountability for all of the beatings and illegal activity of the secret Trump police because this country won't protect its citizens rights for shit.
Obama barely brought any home. Nowhere near meeting his promise. With the threat of ISIS flaring up and various domestic issues, bringing them home was not as reasonable to do in the first 2 years. Now that Trump is trying to bring them home, they have to oppose whatever he does.
Russia bounty reports, U.S. troop movements put Trump-Putin relationship in spotlight
Holy shit this guy is obtuse. Crazy. Just read every tweet Trump sends. HOLY CRAP I can‚Äôt believe there are people like this. Can‚Äôt change racists.
Nope. Trump made all #blacklivesmatter protesters antifa so he could deem them domestic terrorists. Then as people starting thinking he speaks truth, they come out with aggression towards people peacefully protesting racial injustice. Trump propaganda to convince the uneducated
Retaliation for blocking Russia's entrance into the G7? Or, just trump being trump and retaliating because people like Merkel but don't like him? #NobodyLikesTrump
Come on . These riots have nothing to do with Floyd or racism! The Marxists said they would do this,  when Bernie was running,  only cares about ushering in Communism. Trump gets it and he will fix it and they know it! Thus they try harder to intimidate! #gop
Fauci is buddies with vaccine Gates. Trump all the way
That‚Äôs ... a lie. You‚Äôll do what‚Äôs best for your party, which is emphatically not what‚Äôs best for your constituents a lot of the time, and your spinelessness is why we‚Äôre withdrawing troops from Germany and Barr is using the DOJ to support Trump‚Äôs re-election.
I gave you ample opportunity to address Bush-Tiananmen, the effects of globalism on our policy options, and the BLM violence.  At every turn you have evaded and lied, instead hysterically denouncing Trump as a "3rd World Dictator."  I rightly conclude that you hate America.
Your "by all accounts" is a lie.  Your claim that "a different group altogether" is just another unsubstantiated excuse for violent, criminal rioters, and the racial demagogue "protesters" who given them cover.    You hate Trump so much it has become hatred of America itself.
Trump does not in fact have such  leverage.  He needed that deal to keep American businesses from being harmed more than China needed it, and why is that? The effects of globalism, bringing us back GHW Bush's total inaction in the face Tiananmen in service to that ideology.
Trump campaign slogan is literally "vote for me or all the terrible stuff that's already been happening under me will happen!"
Yes it is, dummy. Never a shred of evidence has been provided. Democrats could make up the most ridiculous nonsense and you'll believe it so long as it's anti-Trump
anyone who wants Trump in office instead of Biden is equally bad. I don't care if they have a red rose or red X in their Twitter name.
GOOD NEWS,  supporters!   Trump says he's leading in all the right places, based on his own polls.   So this means you DON'T NEED TO VOTE in November!  He already has all the votes he will need to win and, everything is under control! :-)
Your refusal to address my point about GHW Bush and Tiananmen speaks volumes about your hypocrisy and bad faith.   Trump (and Obama) have had no real discretion in seeking trade agreements because of the precarious and vulnerable position globalism has left us in.
Maybe trump is just a destructive guy, no plan, just tear stuff up.  He‚Äôs ok when he‚Äôs play-acting and getting attention.  The minute life intrudes, he‚Äôs a wrecking ball.
They called Obama incompetent while the man masterfully dismantled the country.  Today, we are still witnessing his craftiness  work  due to his expert "CommunityOrganizing" resulting in BlackLivesMatter #Acorn  #ObamaGate #PodestaEmails #PedoGateNews
Registered voters are mailed a ballot. There are no physical polls. There are drop off locations for those who don't use standard mail. And yet, no controversy or issues with elections. Almost like Trump is full of shit and just wants to suppress voting numbers.
Yes because people tend to be ignorant about his accomplishments. MSM doesnt report when Trump signs executive orders to uplift economically distressed areas for blacks and hispanics. They don't report when he funds sickle cell anemia research, first step act prison reform, etc
can't wait for our first dementia president to launch nukes "as a joke"  the dems had YEARS to come up with a guy to beat Trump and this is what they've got?  they clearly don't want to beat Trump.
Yes. The intent was for a rich trump supporter to influence Twitter. I believe that's why he bought into Twitter.
Kind of a downgrade in Trump's message, from "so much winning you'll get tired of winning" to "I will keep the evil hordes at bay". Negativity is his comfort zone. #MAGA
This is unserious and morally perverse.  Trump‚Äôs vulgarity and sexual immorality are trivial, utterly trivial, compared to unethical decisions by Presidents throughout our history, from Jackson‚Äôs Trail of Tears to LBJ‚Äôs lies and reckless tactics in SE Asia.
They are trying to get Trump re-elected by killing enthusiasm to vote üó≥
P that's why trump grabbed him.
Because they have a new part owner who is a trumpty dumpty.
Sure, forget about Trump. As I said, the CIA is no longer able to state confidently that these bounties exist. And the NSA has disagreed with them from the beginning.
I didn't vote for the guy. I suggest you cut past your own Trump hate and take an honest look at his accomplishments. It's actually pretty great.
MSM is failing us badly. Greedy corporations control the news we're fed. Experts like Dr. Mika are blacklisted because they don't want anyone to know the truth about Trump. George Carlin knew all too well how things work in this country. Specifically 0:39
The really scary part is that you don't have to look very hard to see the parallels. 5 years ago, if I had told you that Donald Trump's secret police would be abducting American citizens, you probably would have laughed. The normalization of evil doesn't happen overnight.
Then why are democrats opposing Trump from bringing them home from Afghanistan? It's because they don't want a Republican president credited with that. Some are coming home. Some are getting reallocated to more strategic locations. From a defense standpoint, you have no argument.
how does Trump's cum taste.I‚Äôm at peace, take me now Trump!
To be fair only 56.9% of the voters actually showed up to the polls in 2016 and he didn‚Äôt win the popular vote, so technically only about 26% of the voting population wanted him. That said, that many people supporting Trump is terrifying.
The rule that Trump struck from the Fair Housing Act was not just in terms of low-income housing. It's specifically about requiring non-discrimination in housing, primarily along racial lines.  "Whites Only" signs are banned but redlining still exists. That's bad for America.
I agree the tweet is not impeachable itself. Maybe they're picking this because they really secretly want trump to lose, and it's pretty clear you can't just move your own election so you don't lose. You'd think Republicans could easily condemn Russian bounties also.
Holy shit, thank goodness indeed. It hadn't even occurred to me that, had we not flipped the house, a GOP house might have backed trump up on this.
So true. These people are so annoying. I should be playing video games, but instead I am reading their none sense about Gizlane and Trump. HAHA
Now, it all makes sense. He was the called in assist attorney in the impeachment trial for Donald and this attorney being in friendship with Epstein and Trump. Wow!! It's one big gang of a circle of whoremongers, thieves and liars.

Look in the Trump mirror.
An old piece (2016) from white nationalist Tucker Carlson. It is useful to read in that it gives a view into the mind of a MAGAt. Explains why Trump still holds a 30% base.

Trump is going to make America safe again? Did he finally come up with a plan to get the coronavirus pandemic under control? 155,000 American deaths &amp; counting. Regardless, I have to wonder why Trump let America get so dangerous in the first place? It was much safer 4 years ago.

After listening to this  interview with retiring Rep.  I think the Democrats are going to win Texas. (I'm pretty sure that's not what Will Hurd wanted me to take away from this.)
Literally every tweet from you is "I'm not trump" that's great and all.... but is that all ya got? Like how tf you going to fix shit? Oh thats right .... "nothing will fundamentally change"  well shits pretty f'd so nothing changing is a bunch of malarkey!

Co-founder Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi, says Trump's idea delaying election is grounds for impeachment
What about the states (like mine) that have had mail in voting almost universally for YEARS?! Are our 13 electoral votes going to come into question just because of trump‚Äôs lies?
Ok so what do you do when those kids carry it back home to you and you get sick and die? That Herman Cain dude thought it was a hoax too and now he‚Äôs dead as fuck because he listened to Trump. But yeah go ahead and continue to think you‚Äôre smarter than scientists üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ

Expect another Trump diversion tweet akin to the election delay one he used today
By the way, when Donald Trump tweeted about making suburban neighborhoods "secure" by ensuring they wouldn't be bothered by low income housing... he alienated most of his own base. üòÇ That IS who his vote is MADE up of: low-income, non-college educated people.
There‚Äôs a good article in the current Vanity Fair about trump supporters and their conspiracy theories.
Hold your breath because it iant Bernie and when you wake up from your fit it will be Trump again
Trump only received 8% of the vote from people of color. That is 8 out of 100%. üòÇ That you think he will get more this year is fucking comedy. The difference was that in 2016 he had promises. In 2020, he has a track record.
trump is dangerous delusional slobbering moronic and just nuts.
Can't be nearly as bad as Trump's America
Exactly!  Way too clever to be tRump. While I believe he would say disparaging things on this level even about his base, it just doesn‚Äôt sound like his speech cadence and it‚Äôs too lucid to be him.

Oh give me a break. Election fraud isn‚Äôt committed where ballots are cast. Not worth the risk. In NV the only individual voter fraud in 16 was a trump voter who voted twice to try to prove it cd be done. She failed.  That‚Äôs typical. Not worth the effort v risk for individuals.
Maybe he just wants a replacement ticket. Not because he objects to Trump's fascism, but rather because he objects to his poll numbers.

Too bad that Trump didn‚Äôt realize that the country has two coasts unto which planes can land.... then there was his well planned out return of Americans overseas resulting in crowds stuck for hours in NYC airport. Donald is just one big genius..
Doesn‚Äôt trump have to be charged with something to get pardoned? If he isn‚Äôt charged until after Jan 20 there is nothing Pence could do.
Something must be done. BLM and their Goons are planning on attacking all Trump supporters at the ballot box on November 3. Saw it on the Internet today. I‚Äôm not joking this is serious! They want Biden in there so they can pull his strings. Joe is a puppet that they can control.
Why do you lie to the American people about mail in voting by saying it is much different from absentee voting?  There is no distinction between the two an in fact the Trump administration in their own brief in court, said the two things (terms) are interchangeable
Yes.  Have to agree.  Mulligan's performance certainly fits Trump and 90% of the Trump-GOP Party !  I have no idea where they are coming from or what they are talking about.  All I know is there are thousands of indians down there waiting for us.  Time to sing the death song !

Sure, if everyone but Trump agrees he actually lost the election.   Red states have to hold elections, split gov/leg states have to agree on electors, the Senate has to certify results, SCOTUS has to rule on any challenges. Even one breakdown and we're in deep shit.
I just made up my mind. I‚Äôm voting for trump. And I‚Äôll give you one good reason better than any of yours. He has a mind of his own, unlike Biden. So block me already or have something constructive to say
American parent here, Kim. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about our kids. He only cares about himself. Schools will reopen when it‚Äôs safe. That‚Äôs when kids will go back. Just like Baron! Sit this one out!
Too bad this isn't true, the health insurance companies own your heart and soul. You are every bit as complicit in these deaths as Trump and Obama. Sadly, other people are paying the consequences of corruption that you, Trump, and Obama deserve to suffer.
With all due respect,  killed Herman Cain. Herman Cain trusted Trump to keep him safe - he was betrayed by Trump.
They are the same.  You‚Äôre only sent a mail in ballot if you requested one and are registered voter. No one is just randomly sent a ballot.  Trump knows he‚Äôs losing. If he was winning he would be encouraging everyone to vote. Don‚Äôt believe his bullshit.

Trump is not responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Trump has been a pathetic leader and has spread misinformation. Cain is an educated, intelligent adult. But he made an unwise decision. He should‚Äôve known better. He was a cancer survivor in his 70s.

MAGA have to tell themselves that people dying of Covid are people who would‚Äôve died anyway. It‚Äôs the only way they can deal with the cognitive dissonance of seeing trump‚Äôs unpopulist response. They‚Äôre wrong though. Herman Cain would not have died anyway &amp; neither would others.
I agree, the toothless tweets and party rhetoric have been ineffective in taking on the GOP. I worry everyone is resting on their laurels assuming trump will lose but that happened in 2016 and this is where we are. I wish we had a firey progressive candidate to rally behind

The crazy thing that people don‚Äôt seem to be talking about is that the administration doesn‚Äôt seem to care. 2008 was crazy bad and we had villains to blame. 2020 is just an IEnumerable.MoveNext() on Trump‚Äôs tweets. Insane.
Maybe we‚Äôve got this whole thing backwards. Trump attacks the legitimacy of the election, claims it was rigged the whole time, loses, but then steps down as he should because, come on, there‚Äôs no way this man doesn‚Äôt hate every second of this. He can leave but also say he won. ü§î

No, it isn't. Those "presidents" are the sociopaths who paved the way for Trump to get elected and wage war against us. They are more than just complicit. Everything Trump has done, they have enabled through their failure in office.

Trump created the worst economy and GDP in history. He‚Äôs the worst businessman ever. This is what Trump meant by ‚ÄúMake America Great Again?‚Äù What a snake salesman. This is Trump‚Äôs economy and virus rather he like or not. It‚Äôs all his. VOTE. HIM. OUT!
Helluva thread in the vein of ‚Äúeverything Trump touches dies‚Äù
To be fair, he killed himself (not to downplay the incompetence of Trump)

Trump campaign temporarily halts ad spending for review of messaging strategy
Also what‚Äôs up with ‚Äúprefers Trump Republican Party‚Äù on our ballots
Trump claimed voting fraud in 2016 and he won. Now he claims fraud before the 2020 election is even held.  We know, then, that he claim the election was stolen from him when he loses in Nov.  So, the question we need to be thinking about now is how we will respond then.
My prediction, pin it.  Nov 3rd Trump loses countable popular vote 55% - 42%. Election called by networks for Buden.  Trump then says he needs mail in votes counted. Within a week, it is clear outcome for Biden.  Trump then claims mail in votes rigged against him.  Jan 20, Biden

Bitch, please. Every mom I know is terrified and livid about being asked to risk our kids' lives to help Trump's re-election chances. Cite your sources.
Congress can solve this by bailing out USPS instead of billionaires, corrupt lawmakers, and Trump cronies. We need to put maximum pressure on them to do so.

I'm so excited to see #EvictTrump trending.  On a day where so many intelligent, caring people spoke at John Lewis's funeral service, we are jerked back to the screeching sound of Nails-on-a-Chalkboard-Nincompoop's insanity.  Come November, Trump gets his eviction notice.
I continue to be amazed by  - you perpetually keep looking for the event that will cause the lightbulb to turn on and Trump will start acting like a President &amp; GOP like responsible adults. Seriously-NOT going to happen. Nov.3 is the cure.

Trump ran for city council but accidentally became president.
Also just to be absolutely clear it is impacting my health having Trump in office. That being said venting about it and doing whatever I can to ensure we don‚Äôt have him any longer is therapeutic. But, after November I hope to finally be able to rest a bit and not worry so much üôè

Dollars to donuts your average trump supporter would fervently advocate for this approach. They‚Äôve been led to believe blue states and cities are populated solely by rabid animals that must be exterminated.
No not at all.  Would it make a difference in 96 days?  Impeaching him would have made the difference.  I think those up for reelection are definitely lying low, but still hoping to ride a Trump wave Nov 3.
"The possible cutbacks come as DeJoy, a major donor to President Donald Trump who took control of the agency last month, moves to eliminate overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers, potentially causing a delay in mail deliveries."
Trump unfortunately has a way of working around the law.
And this surprises anyone at this point? I swear Trump does these things on purpose, but I really don't think he's smart enough. So who's planting it?
It's easy to read his mind. "Damn, this democratic representation system really bugs me. Why can't we just declare Trump king, or maybe emperor - life would be so much easier!!"
‚ÄòI fear our courts are becoming political tools rather than arbiters of the law.‚Äô That ship has long past sailed. When the SCOTUS ruled against trump and he continues to block evidence in spite of the scotus decisions, and you all ALLOW IT, you‚Äôve lost your credibility.
Might be a little of both. Anything better than trump doe
I certainly am not mourning him but I do feel generally sad about people dying preventable deaths because of their stupid decisions. P.S. he got coronavirus confirmed 9 days after attending the Trump Tulsa rally....
KOMO Political Analyst Ron Dotzauer believes Trump was simply playing politics with his tweet suggesting that the Presidential election in November should possibly be delayed.

It's their strategy. They know Trump will lose. This is a brand new charge that they can take up and feel righteous about and not lose face. I don't Pence to win and I don't think he would but he has a better chance than Trump, so they would rather give that a shot.
OUR CURRENT ECONOMY UNDER TRUMP... HE'S JUST A DUMBASS....

So, just so I'm not confused here, everything is FINE, and kids should go back to school, but the election should be postponed until it is safe for everyone to vote in person?
Trump saying "the younger the better" is...not a good look for him
i‚Äôts amazing to me how people only see how dangerous trump is, when it involves and is directly opposing them... the fact that over 100,000 people died from covid, the racism, the white supremacy, the sexual assault: all were not enough for you to fuckign realize this man is evil

Black Lives Matter is nothing but a radical left wing terrorist mob attacking our important landmarks. Don‚Äôt buy in to whatever bs Democrats say about it. Obviously Trump has a reason to stop domestic terrorism from happening, doesn‚Äôt make him a racist.
Ah but the strait and narrow way to Trump must be exact. ORTHODOXY STRICTLY ENFORCED.
I have a 30 day suspension on my Facebook, all because I was arguing with some libtard and then defended Trump stating how Obama lacked the job that President Trump does. Trust me all of social media violates 1st Amended rights from Conservatives. Something they need to regulate.
A thicko wishful thinking as there's zero chance of Trump quitting!
BREAKING NEWS: Congress to bring election date forward to first week of September.  (Not really - but if Trump wants to delay it why can't it be brought forward so #PresidentPandemic can go on his merry way and be replaced by a real President sooner than November).
These people will defend Pete like MAGA defends trump I don‚Äôt get it
Utah doesn't vote in person. You want Trump to overrule state laws unilaterally? Oh wait, he already does.
RINO = Not 100% Trump idolatry adherent
Only a dictator would suggest the vote be delayed.  It's so embarrassing to have a President of the world's leading democracy make a suggestion to delay the vote. Republicans of all people should be ashamed of Trump for making this suggestion.
I have voted for Kim the last two elections she has been up. I thought she was fair and followed things by the book. That still may be, but her and the state GOP's silence toward the rhetoric of Trump makes it impossible for me to vote for her or any Republican down ballot.

UMMM....NO  What do you think of this???  Trump suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
This is the insane part that scares me - trump cultists don‚Äôt fact check and will do what the tweets and FOX says. Then rather than get angry at who lied at them get angry at the truth and kill to change it.
For all the ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù crew; I‚Äôd like to point out the only 2 times there was known criminal activity regarding elections was Nixon (a republican) and Trump (a republican). If you‚Äôre so worried about fraud in the presidency, stop voting for the party that actually commits it.
Congress will sort out Trump if he tries to delay, he is scared of losing so is already making excuses that it  is a fraud election
You've been on Trump train too long. Can't get off now.
What the hell are you talking about? Seattle and Portland to mention two cities are democrat controlled and have nothing to do with Trump. The only thing that stopped the burning of federal properties had been because of Trump.
Vote Trump 2020, that's the right thing. I voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him again!
You need to educate yourself! Obama administration spied on Trump's campaign, this can be proven. Trump's campaign plane was bugged at the direction of Obama. How many provable scandals was Obama involved in? How many provable scandals has Trump been involved in?
So Trump is pulling his strings again, yay.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The US system of checks and balances will prevent Trump from putting off the election which he thinks he will lose. There is no such system in the UK. Johnson/Cummings could force through a Bill extending the life of Parliament, unless scores of Tory MPs blocked it. Worrying.
Unlike he did for Rep. Lewis, Trump WILL make time to honor Mr. Cain.
The Trump is who wants you out of the country. You just voted for your own export.
Trump in the bedroom with gonorrhea.
He's going into full 'Trump mode', if I say it, it must be true.  Can this man not say on honest thing, answer one question truthfully or get one thing right?  What a disgrace.  Boris Johnson claims 'massive success' in getting coronavirus deaths down
Seems to me  needs to apologize to AG Ferguson. This shows how local GOP is willing to dismiss anything Trump says/does as long as it fits his agenda.
It will be harder for Trump to do that, than it would be for Johnson to force through an extension of the parliamentary term, or to cancel the next local elections as they were (rightly) cancelled this year. The US has checks and balances, the UK doesn‚Äôt.
So, Herman Cain died of COVID-19.  I believe he caught that at Trump's rally.
That's not how are would work Cynthia trump dies pence gets in appoints another vice president pence dies that vice president gets in appoints another vice president they would have to die simultaneously for ugly ass lying ass Pelosi to get in
Anyone who has concerns about Trump delaying the election, is not crazy, stupid, or fear mongering. No other laws has stopped Trump from pretty much doing anything he wanted. I am scared to death Trump is going to cancel the election with the help of Republicans and the SC.

Serious question, I have always been curious about. I think your mom is a smart women, but she has been going along with Trump since 2016. Does she actually believe the things Trump is saying? I can't believe she does all of it.
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
Maybe my memory is playing tricks on me,.....but,....I seem to remember tRUMP's son-in-law buying up Casket Companies early on in the Pandemic....Could be that that is incorrect...sure seems I read that somewhere Long time ago NOW.
Suggesting that the Presidential election should be delayed is just the latest episode in this. I'm sure Trump wouldn't be saying these things if he were ahead in the polls...
I'm more certain now that Trump won't win in November than I was in 2016. And in 2016 I was 98.7% sure he wasn't going to beat Hillary. Biden is going to win in a runaway. Not cause he's better than Trump, but because Trump keeps being an idiot on Twitter.
In deed neither have I. Are you a ware tha a 60 yr old black man was murdered in cold blood for supporting President Trump. Another black man shot him. Hate crime and no one is talking about it on the left or great media. Please look into it Mark

So let me get this straight - the same day Trump talks to his lord &amp; master Putin, he does 2 things.   1. Makes sure to NOT discuss Russia paying Taliban forces to kill our troops;   2. Pulls 11,900 of our troops out of Germany.   What the actual fuck?
Lmaof!
True, but real life is not Twitter. People set up sock puppet accounts all the time. It's one way to paint your opponent as "too unreasonable" so that you just say "well Trump can't be that bad." He is.

I could say the same for the other side. Trump is very far removed from the Republican Party I know and respected.
Actually I am quite bright. I just had to process it because I couldn't believe Trump would actually just come out as a racist bigot like that. Please tell me how as a slightly privileged white woman I can be racist because I don't like Trump? That makes little sense.
Bro, Trump started this with his rhetoric.
China‚Äôs WeChat App is aligned with MSM against HCQ. I‚Äôm glad I live outside China‚Äôs firewall so I have greater access to info. There is clearly a commercial and political campaign against a potentially effective therapy that costs pennies,  not $1000s, and that Trump supports.

Well we know what we have to do if we can't reason with them. And we can't reason with them. Uncuff our resources and move forward without stepping back for a second. Pursue indictments, release indictments and let the Trump Card fall as it may.

Hopefully you guys have a guest appearance by the crazy alien demon trump doctor lady in season three.

For all the ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù crew; I‚Äôd like to point out the only 2 times there was known criminal activity regarding elections was Nixon (a republican) and Trump (a republican). If you‚Äôre so worried about fraud in the presidency, stop voting for the party that actually commits it.

The US system of checks and balances will prevent Trump from putting off the election which he thinks he will lose. There is no such system in the UK. Johnson/Cummings could force through a Bill extending the life of Parliament, unless scores of Tory MPs blocked it. Worrying.

I agree this is all horrifying, but isn't the idea of Trump voters not voting sort of the silver lining in all this?

Trump is faithfully executing the agenda of his puppet-master and banker, Vladimir Putin: sabotaging confidence in the electoral process, damaging the Western Alliance, undermining the rule of law, and to the best of his Ability, defying the Constitution of the United States.
The greatest proof Trump is a fake is that guy is still walking around free.
Comparing favorably to the abject horror of Trump makes Bush neither honorable nor decent.   Iraq. Abu Ghraib. "Mission Accomplished". Katrina. The Great Recession.   Bush wasn't the start or end of  decent into darkness, but he was a critical step in that journey.

The only embarrassment here is you, Mr. Trump.  You're the biggest embarrassment to humanity in history.  We will vote you out come November, and if you block the election, we will show up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. by the millions to "help" you move out.
Even Biden, who can't lead his way out of a paper bag, would have known how to let responsible people craft a response and then read the right words on the teleprompter.  I say it again: Trump is uniquely awful. All he had to do was not actively work to sabotage our response.
Umm... it could have started in Washington DC?  For all their flaws, which are legion, I'm confident that if Obama or even Hillary or Mitt or John Kerry or George W. Bush were currently in charge, our death toll would have been cut in half.  Trump is uniquely awful.

What the hell   You're blaming the USPS?  This is just going to stop people from even trying to vote.  You don't even mention that it's Trump's doing, as covered by many other reports:
Remarkably naked attack on democratic institutions here, simultaneously deriding safety of election and the clearest solution. Clearly borne of weakness, but further evidence that many will later question election's legitimacy.
I love how President Bush gets so much love nowadays. Before Trump, I have never seen any President just constantly dragged and called a moron, basically being called incompetent. I can't stand people.
Really, they're just going to tear up the existing roses and never plant any new roses. Another GOTCHA from the Trump family to the citizens of the US.

Herman Cain.   ‚ÄúHe will always be remembered for his love of country,‚Äù McCarthy added in a tweet.  No he won‚Äôt. He‚Äôll be remembered for the fool he was, the hypocrite, the liar, the traitor. He‚Äôll be remembered for not wearing a mask at a tRump rally during a pandemic.
Personally, I can‚Äôt wait for the day when Trump returns to being the crooked clown he used to be.
But then, there's a third "neutral branch of government" that is supposed to resolve conflicts like this. Of course, the courts take a long time to get things worked through. Luckily, Trump hasn't filled hundreds of stolen circuit seats and several SCOTUS seats with... oh.If we are going to knitpick, how about when Trump visited his underage brothel island???

Bull. He just wants more time to come up with more ways to manipulate, suppress, and/or interfere with voting base. Mail-in ballots are no more a security risk than any other means of voting. It's a larger voter turnout that threatens Trump, McConnell, et al.

So how does the motivation behind absentee ballots, which are implemented the same exact way as mail-in ones, make it less susceptible to fraud? Because that's the entire argument Trump, et al have been spouting.

Fauci said immediately after that: "But it's something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously." He &amp; other scientists did ‚Äì Trump &amp; his administration did not. Fauci had no authority to implement containment. That's USPHS &amp; CDC, at Trump's direction.

Note: we've seen plenty of instances of illegal arrests &amp; excessive and/or unwarranted use of force by Feds &amp; local police. Why do you think an investigation by DOJ OIG has been opened (whose chief will likely get axed if Trump/Barr don't like where it leads).
The Kompromat Putin has on Trump must be incredibly damaging.

Why is this a gender issue? Trump offends people irrespective of gender, a bully does that and it does not justify the behavior, but it means it is not gender. He behaves that way with a male Purple Heart winner, male journalist, Biden, Obama, Jeb Bush etc. Lack of decorum, yes.
And the data just needs to be processed. I'm still in the camp that doesn't think the polls were wrong in the last election cycle just that NYT and others were doing bad analytics.   Nate Silver gave Trump ~33% chance of winning. That's not bad odds.
I‚Äôm sure that Trump would consider me a ‚Äúsuburban housewife,‚Äù and this photo mirrors exactly how I feel about that.
Trump has begged Xi Jinping for help in winning the election.  What are the chances he HASN‚ÄôT also begged Putin?  Trump‚Äôs invasion of Portland mirrors the invasion of Ukraine:  fake news about the city in chaos, followed by a ‚Äúpeacekeeping force.‚Äù  This is how Putin is helping.
The 113 House Republicans who voted to keep Confederate statues and the bust of Roger Taney certainly let us know who stands with Trump racism and oppression. Taney wrote the ruling that black people are not human beings and could never be citizens. #GOP

Nope, this is all Trump.

Food for Thought, that GOP lady that went against Trump for a minute, said "they" need to take back the "House" and the "down Ballot" positions in November!  WHAT A HORRIBLE SCARY THOUGHT!
Those GOP Trump kiss asses are brain dead and just following everything he does to fight to keep the GOP devils in power!
"THE BIDEN PLAN", Trump needs to follow this plan now.
This should NOT be kept so quiet.  None of the MSNBC Anchors or CNN anchors are covering this?  Are they that afraid of Trump?
I would like to know why the only channel that covered this was "ABC World News at 2:00am pacific time!  Are they that afraid of Trump's buddies?
Hey White Evangelcials, remember when Trump cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette square with tear gas so he could hold up a Bible. And you were silent?  And then we learned: They were peaceful. It really was tear gas.  It wasn‚Äôt his Bible.  And you were still silent?
So I guess the New York Post likes to employ liars who spread propaganda for their master Trump. You should fire this corrupt spreader of propaganda but you won‚Äôt. Like Trump it‚Äôs all about the dollars.
Question of the day. Does the media prep in advance of being in front of Trump. Because it seems that the questions they ask are haphazard at best and moronic at worst. How do you not follow up on the I wish her the best comment. She‚Äôs an accused pedophile.  #fools
Tammy  Thanks for continuing to highlight this day after day. Trump must account for his protection of Russia and Putin. This is treason. Full stop.

No, there‚Äôs also the Ohio bribe scam, 144,000 dead, secret police in Portland, Jason Miller &amp; hookers, Russian spy bilking 1.8 billion ‚Ç¨, Trump using ambassador illegally to promote his golf course ...
Oh, and Jason Miller admitted (bragged) hiring prostitutes on multiple occasions.   And the GOP Speaker of the House in Ohio was the ringleader of a $60 million bribe conspiracy involving Trump officials.  Russian spy defrauded German company of 1.8 billion‚Ç¨.

That would be nice, but they'd rather have Trump than Sanders
It‚Äôs not going to change the mind of the cultists. It‚Äôs going to make a few of the power players consider their circumstances.  But Trump‚Äôs cult thinks he‚Äôs some kind of holy sending. Any Republican who tags that bear is going to be savaged.
President Trump is working the phones and holding ‚Äútele-rallies‚Äù as his new campaign manager Bill Stepien experiments with pandemic programming.
Drop out? And then what? I‚Äôm not gonna let Trump win so please tell me what a strategy looks like?
It doesn‚Äôt matter what strategy they come up with. Trump will find a way to mess it up. He just isn‚Äôt very smart so, it‚Äôs hard for him to stay on someone else‚Äôs message. If he can‚Äôt repeat it over and over again, he can‚Äôt remember it and will revert back to his childish ways.
Oh we understand and I've tramped around Trump country many o' time. Paranoid style + know nothing party of 19th cent. + 25th great awakening + confederate sympathy + dregs of nixonism + amway + australian megalomania + national enquirer = "does not compute"
I live in WA &amp; I normally use the drop box. Now that Trump is slowing down the Postal Service, I‚Äôm for sure using it.

President Trump is the only one that has done anything regarding child sex traffickers so sit down.
They're just still shocked by Trump's behavior. Their looks make total sense.
Trump owns his own golf courses guess again get the real facts not fake media that is just the problem with the left you follow trash lies
Your words about service industry people not making tips is 100% on point. There is no way these folks can earn a living on 25% capacity. Trump wants to focus on the economy instead of the virus and is failing at both.
Because they  won't agree to what you are offering tell the whole truth. Like the 1.75 billion for the new federal building,8 billion for repairs to Trump's wall! 100 a week unemployment insurance
Why do Trump supporters think that by pointing out the wrongdoing of others, it makes trump completely free from accountability for his wrongdoing?
Trump's supplicants. I love Brian Williams dialogue.
Can we just admit that Trump doesn't want the job anymore?  Its obvious that he's sabotaging the GOP chances of winning.

Trump rally goers should agree to move.....out of the country.
Battle of the suckups. Big ick factor.  "Mr. Trump is increasingly being used by competing G.O.P. factions, who recognize that he‚Äôs a useful ally in intraparty fights and that the way to appeal to him is to play to his insecurities."
This is just one of the far-right troublemakers who use the protests to undermine the BLM movement and push towards a race war. Is Trump behind this type of action?  the Minneapolis Police Link ‚ÄòUmbrella Man‚Äô to White Supremacy Group
So true. If they treat it like it‚Äôs big bad breaking news like they did to  I‚Äôll be so pissed. Watch for  She was all too comfortable carrying Trump‚Äôs water in 2016.
Oh, look, Trump achieved something YUGE!
You can‚Äôt really make a rule out of one example. Warren isn‚Äôt as hated by the establishment as Bernie. According to polls she was widely palatable to a large section of the party, and lost due to electability concerns which were due to the circumstances of having trump in office.
Trump has a better chance of finding true love than a second term.
Knew it...most of Trump's followers are his backup accounts for Tinder!
Think I figured out why Trump likes long ties.
just for the record Trump owns his own golf courses it don't cost tax payers donkey squat he is a billionaire there is nothing he can't afford he has to steal our money he donates all his pay to charity  he works for free get some facts not CNN OR MSN OR MSM
Lmao Or they thawed Trump out of the polar cap?
Are you serious? He went to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally! The one with all the people sick with Covid-19? Secret Service agents and Trump staffers included? Herman Cain Hospitalized With COVID-19 After Attending Trump Tulsa Rally Maskless via
Yea I agree.  I love that some of them wanna talk about it and then vote for trump. That‚Äôs a special kind of stupid.
And now he's dead. Trump is probably among the next to be on the slab from covid-19.
I'm oddly OK with Trump telling his supporters to vote much later in November.
His lack of leadership has nothing to do with the drop in economy our economy is down 33% because of COVID-19 and states being locked down.  WA may have a good voting system but there are other things it lacks.  And finally after 4 years of Trump you should know its hot air.
Just saw video of Trump voting by absentee ballot in Access Hollywood video. If it was safe then it is still safe today!  His lies are getting old.
Those people are crazy just like Trump
It is the TRUMP VIRUS. My son learned he was exposed today. Take me off all your sites. Drop me from the donor texts. You despicable man.
The clock is ticking, and time is running out on not only Donald Trump, but also his Conservative pundits, who won‚Äôt have a platform from which, to shout utter nonsense, FOX News will once again try to reformat, their program base to apatizing News...
you have done an excellent job as vice president keep it up I want to see you and Donald Trump in there for another 4 years
"Stop saying 'if we have an election'. You're spreading fear and being unreasonable! You're going to cause people to stay home!" What do those folks have to say now that Trump is thinking out loud about delaying the election?
We could have used it in 2009 and 2010 to get everything. But we didn't want to risk the "nuclear option." Which Republicans went to the second Trump took office and they wanted to pass dramatic tax cuts.
Although I didn‚Äôt call you illiterate before, I want to do it now after reviewing this thread.  Wow.  Twitter really does have the ability to suck one down into the gutter to converse with fools.  I really need to stop doing it.  Read the article.  Trump didn‚Äôt write it.  Goodbye
This fear bubbles up from one side or another EVERY recent presidential election. We have to remember Trump is an old, unhealthy fart and while they have shock troops, his cronies haven‚Äôt exactly put themselves in positions of unassailable authority.
What‚Äôs astonishing is that Dubya is arguably worse than Trump for us and the world and yet they are so far apart.
When did he call him racist? I lost respect for mike too. Trump is a walking garbage can of corruption and hatefulness, and clearly mike co-signed all of that.

It's reassuring to see that there's still a Trump supporter out there. He needs at least one shoulder to lean on.
Not in one yet, but there‚Äôs a large crowd cheering on the emergence of one. And who‚Äôd happily ignore the constitution if it meant Trump and company got to stay in power indefinitely.
Just heard a newscaster say fires were started by protestors! NO! They were started by very suspicious &amp; uninvited anarchists . Then, I remembered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching a Sinclair outfit. A company in league w/Trump.‚Äù So much for ABC. Hello NBC, CBS &amp; others not politically motivated.üòÇ
Obama motivates Dems by saying ‚ÄúWe can do this.‚Äù  Trump motivates his base whining about how mean we are to them.

Can a brave reporter PLEASE ask Trump, if he feels ANY responsibility for Herman Cain‚Äôs death?
Their only hope is to convince Trump not to run so a more acceptable opponent for Biden can be at the top of the ballot. I wonder if a financial package is being prepared to get him to abdicate. He‚Äôll also need a country to take him in so he can avoid prosecution. Russia? Turkey?
Can a brave reporter PLEASE ask Trump if he feels ANY responsibility for Herman Cain‚Äôs death?
Trump has been great for America like Hitler was great for Germany. He gave a semblance of greatness that was built on cruelty and evil toward his own people, and it all came crumbling down; Hitler in a war, Trump in a pandemic that he was too stupid to deal with.
I think you‚Äôd agree with me that removing Saddam from power created a power vacuum that lead to pure chaos. Pelosi is Saddam. Congress is the power vacuum. Trump and Mitch McConnell are the chaos, and they can do enough damage in 4 more years to break our country for generations.
Trump can‚Äôt postpone the election for the same reason you can‚Äôt drive your car over the speed limit.
Which is why the US is the only first world country to drop from the Paris Agreement, even though country's can choose their own emission limits. Even China is on a path to converting to green energy. Trump appointed the head of Exxon for god's sake. It's corporate greed!

Donald Trump and Company‚Äîthe whole modern Republican Party‚Äîis a lot easier to pin down what they‚Äôre against (almost everything) than what they‚Äôre for (preservation of privilege).
Yes exactly, Trump just wants the best for the common person to succeed, while some republicans and a lot of RINOs and Democrats just want more power because they are communists.
So how are you supposed to know if people are ,"masking up"? You idiot. The VAST amount of people already are. I'm ALL over and MOST people are social distancing and masking. You are keeping things shut down to suppress the economy and business. (so Trump cant win) Foolish

Trump has exposed the fault lines in our system. But I think it's the truly dangerous actors like Barr and Pompeo who stand to weaponize that knowledge.
If we somehow get past Trump, the next question must be how can we safeguard American democracy so that the next would-be authoritarian (who'll likely be a lot smarter) doesn't succeed.

At this point in the game, no. This is, apparently, as good as we are going to get, because of all this immense "Joementum" against "malarkey". The American public has spoken. Give us back our status quo, because Obama. Trump uses Obama. Biden uses Obama. Obama Obama Obama Obama.

Trump Will Be Stopped Because All Money Leaves A Paper Trail And Federal Laws Are Much More Strict Than Normal Laws
Really? Abuse of power to create problems for a political rival wasn't grounds for impeachment, but suggesting an election postponement, something he couldn't do without the aid of every state elections office, is impeachable? He's trying to dump Trump now that he's poison.
You wanna see some HATE? Just go on  live feed during a Trump speech and say something positive about the President. They will wish you and him death and report YOUR comment as unethical.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What in the world is happening with you? Biden said that Trump would "come up with some rationale why it [the election] cannot be held" and here he is hinting at it today. This era is full of confident foolishness.
Trump makes it easy to forget exactly how bad Bush was.
Pushing out USPS, anti-mail-in voting? The world could be so different if someone had just sent Trump birthday cards as a kid.
It is actually dependent on the character of the people and not the party. Despite what Trump propaganda wants you to believe.
Trump is as familiar with Article II of the Constitution, as he is with two Corinthians.
And how do you know a measly $600/wk is more than frontline workers? To keep children fed and healthcare? The selfish lack of humanity and empathy is astonishing! This mess is on Trump and the GOP for mishandling the virus from day 1! Actually before that by ignoring the experts.
Yeah, no. I'll never buy anything you recommend, ever. If Donald Trump likes it, it's gotta be bad.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

You are right not to trust  Mr. Trump. They have turned on you. Now they make up lies about you instead of about Hillary. All they care about is their ratings.
Mr. Trump, specifically to whom do you refer to by "the very dishonest LameStream Media"? You ask the individual members of your audience to imagine each knows who you are talking about.  You threatened to cancel elections, Mr. Trump. You are the greatest RISK to Democracy today.
Ask Trump about the Russian bounties.
Curious who‚Äôs balls you gargled before Trump. Must be easier to type than speaking with a mouth full.
One of the biggest mistakes that we make as liberals, progressives, Dems, Etc... Is thinking that Trump is doing this on his own. Donald Trump It‚Äôs not a very smart man. He is not carrying this out alone. We need to make sure the people around him also never get back into power.
If, by some miracle, you win, Mr. Trump, then certainly the House of Representatives will impeach you again. Count on it.
He just did. Also I am pretty sure he may be just be a RINO or a never Trumper. Also not surprised he is saying this stuff on Niel‚Äôs show who is known not to like Trump.
Maryland  is critizing Trump right now on Niel Cavuto show. Now I am not saying he isnt allowed to critize anyone because that would be unamerican. What I am saying is its pretty obvious this was troll or tactic by Trump to see who would take the bait.

Oh, but but Trump put the GOP under pressure!  Yes, and they immediately caved. Most of them couldn't cave fast enough. That's WHY they have to go.  They've proven that they can't be trusted with power. Getting rid of them is the essence of a Representative Republic.
I live in a state with a prophet for an AG. April 2020:
I think Trump ( honestly ) is being threatened by DHS and his family to go along w/ this ( all of this ) ! When he signed executive orders ( many ) I don‚Äôt even think he understood ( or made to )that it gave complete power to DHS ! Read Patriot Act 1 &amp; 2 if you don‚Äôt believe me..
Mr. Trump's had 3 1/2 years to make them happy.

I don't think Trump is actually trying to change the date. He's setting up excuses for when he loses. He'll point back to today and remind us that "everybody said" this would be a fraud election and that the vote is "fake." He'll then refuse to leave the WH.
Thank you for that tweet back to trump. He is nothing but trash
They are peaceful protesters!  it‚Äôs the white supremacy portraying themselves as BLM protesters causing the rioting the burning and looting, chaos and riots. I‚Äôm would not be surprised that trump didn‚Äôt send them there I don‚Äôt put anything past this crooked pos
‚ÄúKing‚Äù Trump?  We have royalists now?
Don‚Äôt let Trump near the laboratory! ü§Ø
This is disgusting. Trump needs to get out of our cities is right.
Does Trump charge admission 2 his rallies? Got concession sales under control? Plans 4 for introducing a new flavored Kool-aid ‚Äú2 die 4‚Äù. ü§Ø
Oh my gosh, ppl really are thinking this? Even though Trump has been losing money ever since taking office. Also if people really had good evidence that he was a pedo, rapist or a rascist the media wouldn‚Äôt of already been making that front page News in every network and outlet?
trump fan fic
China virus is racist. It's the Trump virus in this country.
‚Äú‚ÄùBill Barr is leading the Justice Department in this country with great integrity and brings a lifetime commitment to the rule of law,‚Äú the Vice President‚Äù - Err say what?! #Trump
Censor Trump...
You can show both Biden's and Trump's racism at the same time. Oh, when you said first I thought you would follow up with Trump's. #CentralParkFive
Isn‚Äôt Trump secretly in charge of Twitter since 2016? This might be part of the story he has to tell.
Actually, he said "You look bad atthh in a face mathk".  (Normally I don't mock speech difficulties but once you come out as a Trump bootlicker, fuck you.) #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
So true Trump should be so proud of himself. #TrumpIsAFailure  Trump will never take responsibility, granted Cain should have never been there. People need to stop following and believing in trump the loon
There will be a massive deployment of federal agents under Trump/Barr direction at postal facilities and polling places in November. They will intimidate and harass. Portland was the test. Stay firm. Register. And vote!!
If there's no election by January 20th, Trump and Pence are automatically out. That is the end of their term. I think Pelosi would then be next in succession, wouldn't she?
Really because Trump has been touting a drug that works very well but the media same to hate it with all their heart for some reason even know its been known to help patients very effectively and its not just me saying that its thousands of Drs. around the world. Yet they censor.
After Clinton and Obama, truly GREAT public speakers, Trump and his 35-word vocabulary would have would have lost him the election for certain.
Well, I'll answer my own question. I guess if it were a push like "impeach now", we'd be hearing from a lot of Trump surrogates. To me, volume 5 is so huge, I figure there must be a reason why Warner isn't publically pushing for its release yet.
like when donald trump wished his friend ghislane well like 1 week ago? get a haircut
We have a prophet for our AG in WA state.  April 2020. I think he's been preparing a lawsuit, just in case.
I am SO glad that Trump didn't go to the Lewis funeral. Between his 35-word vocabulary and need to make everything about him, it would have been difficult.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Trump can‚Äôt delay the election.‚Äù  Which part of the last four years gave you the impression that he doesn‚Äôt just do whatever he wants with zero reprocussion?
Everything is proceeding as WA AG Bob Ferguson has foreseen:
Trump so scared of looseing he would spread bullshit about voter fraud really get together bro if Trump was living a godly life he won't have any doubt he would go on faith I have news for Trump God has the finally word who will take office in November
We say it out of guilt, embarrassment over other white people, and  to prove we‚Äôre not racists. I‚Äôve stopped saying it, but it doesn‚Äôt make me any less angry at the number of white people who ignored tRump‚Äôs racism and voted for him anyway.
If you spend 60 seconds listening to Obama, and can‚Äôt discern the difference in basic humanity between Obama and Trump, there is something wrong with you.
WA Secretary of State Kim Wyman responds to President Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the General Election
Maybe because said Democrats and celebrities actually listen to doctors and scientists, and Herman Cain preferred to be a prop for Trump despite being immunocompromised.  Some people whistle past graveyards and get what's coming to them.
It funny  how Trump tweets about Republican Herman cain but pays know respect to Rep John Lewis  but Republican president George W Bush can give a heart whelming speech regardless of what party they represent trump has know class
Not one of the right-wingers praising Cain on Twitter mentions the fact that he died for Trump‚Äôs vanity.
Stop talking about trump trying to postpone the election. He can‚Äôt do it. Don‚Äôt worry. Bring all the attention you‚Äôre giving him back to things that actually matter right now (BLM, GDP, Covid, anything other than his delusions)
Barack Obama signed my military retirement certificate, something Trump will never get the privledge of doing.
If Trump and his followers hadn‚Äôt decided that concern about this virus was a political attack, tens of thousands of Americans, including Herman Cain, would likely still be alive right now.  FACT.
You can‚Äôt bravely overcome bone spurs. I‚Äôm a vet and I can‚Äôt stomach Trump or his cronies. Also I have a lot of respect for  and his work.
Washington governor slams military testing impact on orcas.  That‚Äôs why we elected him. To represent us. To stand up 4 us. Not let Trump walk over us. Yes, Trump is involved. üò§
Herman Cain just died from #COVID19 that he apparently contracted at the tRump Tulsa rally, and here we have more tRump supports with no masks and not socially distancing! This is beyond irresponsible!
Of course you make this political and about it being Trump‚Äôs fault. Man can you guys ever feel basic emotions beside anger?
Published in April of this year... üôÑ
Says the heartless bastard standing on the grave of her daughter to slander Trump.
Mr. Trump, can you verify whether this Reuters article is correct? It says that if you delay the election long enough, then the Constitution provides that the Speaker of the House will become acting President on January 20.
Go ahead it‚Äôs still a free country until you idiots allow trump to stay in office even when he loses or even tries to postpone election. But you can also go in and teach in the classrooms for the teachers. This is just a hoax right ?
Are you serious?? Not one single word to the families of over 150,000 Americans who DIED of the TRUMP flu not to mention all the soldier's you allowed Putin to kill but you'r promoting pizza?? You are the single biggest embarrasment to this country. Pack your bags you are done!!!
Trump and Biden are close like the Moon and the Earth are close, but the Moon is still 238,900 miles from Earth, which is 10x the circumference of our planet, so from the perspective of our normal daily lives, the Moon and the Earth are still pretty fkn far apart.
You know it‚Äôs Sean Hannity when he won‚Äôt cover the biggest news story of the day (Trump suggesting delaying the election). Grow a pair, Sean. It‚Äôs okay to disagree with him.
But if Trump actually says something about it, it‚Äôs a ‚Äújoke,‚Äù right?  Jokes are funny. And Republicans are rarely funny on purpose.
Herman Cain died for Trump, and Trump hasn‚Äôt said anything about his death. Oop
Bring back the Trump Rallies!! More #TrumpieCultFollowers together makes a BIGLY party  #LiberateFlorida #LiberateTexas #LiberateArizona #LiberateGeorgia
Good, a fired up Obama can only be good for the country.  He's gotta be pissed about 2016 still and would love to have been able to hand Trump his doughy white ass.
I swear Trump says this sh!+ just to get them riled up.
Trump killed him...
trump should continue his rallies &amp; staff meetings - pick off his supporters one by one #TrumpPlague
If Trump can't be held accountable if someone dies from his rally then neither can China.  China is a distraction from Trump's failure...  China China China
More proof trump loves and counts on his uneducated. Science and doctors be damned!
Then maybe the Trump campaign should pay its outstanding bills for police protection at his rallies.
Mich McConnell do your duty to the American people and pass the bill and extend the unemployment benefits. You're here for America not Trump.
If Trump can't be held accountable if people die from his rally, then neither can China.
McConnell calls Trump push to include FBI HQ money in next coronavirus aid bill 'a mistake' #SmartNews: Trumps trying to steal!!!
trump put babies in cages after stealing them from their parents. There was no presidential term limit until FDR changed it.
Herman Cain died today after catching COVID after a Trump rally. I‚Äôm not going to make jokes or point fingers like many of you cornballs are. I don‚Äôt wish death on anyone. This is just a PSA to wear a mask.
The answer is yes.  The GOP and Trump would, if they want to hand full control of the government to the Democrats I'm fine with that.  Win by any means possible.  Trump must go.  Humanity will not survive, take the win move on.
Pres Bush, John McCain, Elijah Cummings, now John Lewis, all funerals televised to the American public not attended by Trump.  He was not wanted.  His dishonor and disgrace is now complete.
Republicans flat-out reject Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay election #SmartNews: You‚Äôre on your own!!!
Bless your heart, one day you'll understand the stank of Trump will never rub off. It will forever stick to you and you will go down as a enabler of the worst possible President.
#trump in awe as he asks himself; how can one man be so eloquent while I struggle at putting 2 syllables together?
Trump is a pathetic, incompetent, pathological liar!!! We will not survive another 4years of this maniac!!! Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!? 150,000 DEAD!!! Vote Trump out before we don‚Äôt have a Country left!!! RESIGN!!! Enough is enough..
Q - Seeing the ‚Äòangle‚Äô for this is that if enough people (read: Repubs) sit out of the election, it can be invalidated. Screams of despair deza, but is that a ‚Äòthing‚Äô? Like, invalidating an *entire* election bc not enough people voted and ‚Äòmagically‚Äô Trump remains POTUS?
no the Lord didn't get him, stupidity and trump did.
It‚Äôs still spelled correctly. trump doesn‚Äôt deserve to have it right.
Trump is leading them, like lambs to the slaughter...The worst part about Herman Cain‚Äôs death is that his family can‚Äôt sue Trump for negligent manslaughter,  since Trump made attendees sign a liability waiver. Trump is the modern day Jim Jones. Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!?
news bulletin Trump was not impeached get the straight and the only one that the Russians helped was Hillary
Yeah, I‚Äôm fucking done hearing people ‚Äúexplain‚Äù what Donald ‚Äútarred and feathered‚Äù  Trump meant during his last speed fueled tweet binge. Stop fucking wasting your breath.
I think you meant to say TRUMP VIRUS
Who looks like the idiot now? Trump will try and do absolutely anything to stay in power. And you will sit back and make excuses for him every step of the way.
Mr. Cain is no longer here because he attended a Trump rally in Tulsa, OK.  And Mr. Trump and you wonder why nobody likes him?  Counting the days until Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2020.
Love you Trump 2020
Today is the day Trump finally became president. For life.
This just shows how stupid Trump is.
Wow, you've actually met almost everyone in the Trump family!
And so it begins... GOP legislators spinning irresponsible tweet by POTUS as a joke. Trump is never joking - I'm not sure he even knows how to joke.
Herman Cain is a perfect example of what happens when you blindly follow Donald Trump.
Trump has fried your brain to the point where you think the man who has donated millions of dollars and helped with multiple vaccines is the one behind our current pandemic. News for you, it‚Äôs because of Trumps awful delayed response we are in the spot that we are.
Be sure to see the documentary ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my Roy Cohn?‚Äù   Explains a lot about Trump.
Dr. Fauci controls nothing.  He works for Trump and advises, that's all.  Any decisions made or not made, concerning the response to the COVID-19 virus, rests squarely on Trump's shoulders. Trump has failed miserably.
Trump uses a teleprompter also.  Get a grip!
He also said, on live TV mind you, "that it's NOT going to get any better than this, what is Mr. Trump going to do, wave a Magic Wand to bring the Businesses back" to a round of applause by the sheeple press.
Mr. Cain took taking one for the team to a new level. I didn‚Äôt agree with his politics. But this man should NOT be dead!!!! Trump must RESIGN!!!  Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!?
Dear  , ya just can't fix stupid. And the Trump cult has cornered the markets on Stupid.
Are the presidents, dictators, empowers, supreme leaders, monarchs, etc of other countries also responsible for their nations deaths, or just Trump? Asking for a friend...
#TrumpieCultFollowers get what they deserve. They can drink the disinfectant (not cool aid) all the want. Freedom to follow Trump, Ingraham, Hannity, Carlson cult is their right.
So Cain attends a Trump rally and magically a month later he dies of COVID... #TrumpkilledCain
Of course he would say &amp; think that Trump &amp; Barr could do that simply because Pompeo is just as stupid as they are. Besides he thinks that if Trump becomes King or some shit he'll get to be on the Kings court or some crap like that. Well, none of them will ever see that happen.
Trump uses the corporate media to sow chaos. Chaos is the most effective tool for establishing authoritarian rule.
the democrats have blood on their hands not Trump
#TrumpGestapo  #WallOfMoms  #PDXFedOccupation   Help Me Find Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAnarchists‚Äô in Portland
Donald Trump is OPERATION WARPED!!!
Trump is a pathetic, incompetent, pathological liar!!! We will not survive another 4years of this maniac!!! Mr. Cain took taking one for the team to a new level. So very sad!!! I didn‚Äôt agree with his politics, but this man should be still alive!!! Trump must RESIGN!!! Full stop
Oh, hey, another person Trump murdered.
Have the experts been able to prevent anything so far? My guess is that the landslide victory in Biden 's favor will be astronomical. I don't expect Trump to carry one single state at this rate! Mitt Romney may be the only Republican left in 2020 at least in the senate.
Trump is running this country like a crime syndicate!!!! 25th Amendment!!! NOW!!! Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!? Enough is enough...
Trump is running this country like a crime syndicate!!! 25th Amendment!!! NOW!!! Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!?
He knew Russia interfered in the 2016 election and he did nothing, in fact, he encouraged it. He said nothing to Putin yesterday, because Trump is a weak man.
Trump must RESIGN!!! Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!? Or better yet, 25th Amendment!!! NOW!!!! Enough is enough...
They hate Trump enough to sacrifice the kids if it will help him lose.
Well that‚Äôs taking one for the team, to a new level... Trump must RESIGN!!!! Y‚Äôall tired of winning yet?!? Enough is enough...
Trump won't be re elected if they take away this money. My state is closing back down. Things aren't looking better than they were in may.
President Trump announcing that the election is postponed until the state of emergency (that he declared) is over.
Actually he is wrong about one thing, what a President does, does control the market. The market started stalling before COVID-19 is because of the uncertainty of what Trump was going to do with China, which was reflected in all business dealings, businesses were invested  in CCP
Trump himself said that if everyone who was eligible to vote did, no Republican would ever get elected again. He said that THIS YEAR at the beginning of the pandemic.
Unlike he did for Rep. Lewis, Trump WILL make time to honor Mr. Cain.
‚ÄúTrump attempting to delay the election‚Äù is actually the free center square of your COVID-19 Bingo card, but mark it anyway.
Mr. Trump, you refuse to provide any evidence. There's no story for the "Fake News" to report. They don't have to report the figments of your imagination, do they?
I just want to survive to see Trump out of office.
Screw Bob Ferguson..  he and inslee put Washington citizens in danger daily with their radical leftist propaganda..  and they cry about Trump instead of fixing the GANG violence raging through king county
there is no "2% fee to NATO", Mr. Trump. You must be the most ignorant person ever to have had significant responsibilities in foreign affairs.
Your evidence, Mr. Trump?
MADNESS! Illegal, unprecedented.  Leaders who delay elections, 'suspend' their constitutions, abridge the rights of their citizens, and send armed thugs to accost citizens are called many things:  Strongman, Despot, Dictator, Tyrant, and now: Trump. #GeneralissimoTrump
Do you think prior to his death that Herman Cain confided in anyone that following Donald Trump was a mistake?  Do you think a lesson was learned before he passed?
As you know, Mr. Trump, "Anarchism" isn't a crime, and "Agitation" isn't a crime.
Trump is a danger to our democracy... All it takes is for him to piss the wrong person off.
The Trump is who wants you out of the country. You just voted for your own export.
Heck NO! Trump has got to go!
By my reckoning, Mr. Trump, you have tweeted "drug prices will soon be lowered", or words to that effect, every few months since you came down the escalator to announce your campaign for the Presidency. Can you imagine I might suppose you are lying?
Ok media and rich assholes that own it all.  Trump is wounded, his base is crawling back under thier rocks, time to end this.  End Trump's political career, demand resignation, let lose all the investigations.  End this nightmare!
Mr. Trump, you propose the very method by which dictators retain office. You have assaulted the most important of democratic institutions. |
Perfect example of a trump supporter
Because laws have mattered so much to Trump and his Republican enablers.
Too fucking late, Trump wants to be a dictator for life.
I want Trump out of office! The sooner the better!
Foreign policy = kill everyone and take their shit  Anything less = sOcIaLiSm  You sound like Trump.
We must have absolutely no delay in the November election.
The only thing I have to add to that is Trump is what republicans wanted to be once out of the closet. I mean.... with 96% plus approval rating amongst the Republican Party.
Way back in April, WA GOP was enraged by AG Ferguson saying 45 would try to cancel the election.
and they want us to pray for trump. Is something wrong with him--heh
Your poll doesn't take into account Trump being the idiot who is responsible for 150,000 American deaths.
I see lines of mask-denying incredibly selfish stupid people. This is consistent with the kind of people who continue to support Trump.
I'm hoping that, out of fear of embarrassment, Trump will just flee the country before Election Day.
It isn't about being elected in 2016! Trump has turned this world upside down SINCE 2016!
That's a damn good idea. They outta just put up big "Trump Twitter Cam" TV monitors in the Capital.
Donald Trump just killed Herman Cain. Without Trump's instance on a rally during a pandemic,and fighting against masks ,Cain would be alive
Trump's tweet came about 15 minutes after news of the worst-ever-recorded quarterly performance of the American economy. - NPR
NHL Teams are not kneeling, in fact they are standing proud and strong for the Flag and our Anthem, now let's talk about the NFL or the NBA who actually kneel to the flag and disrespect our fallen hero's, if you were an actual Trump supporter  you would be appalled with that
Herman Cain died from Corona virus. He most likely caught it during Trump Tulsa rally.
Trump Continues To Sell America Out To Foreign Countries For Financial Compensation
On January 20th you're going to be a free agent and salary negotiations aren't looking good. I'm looking forward to your term as inmate Trump.
Trump has nothing planned until mid-afternoon. #NiceWorkIfYouCanGetIt
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Trying to make a silk purse out of a Trump's ear.
Have you seen trump walk down a Fucking ramp?
How much you guys wanna bet that Trump tries to sign an Executive Order citing the #COVID19 pandemic as a threat to national security so he can skirt congressional approval? Hasn't his whole Presidency reflected this? We can't underestimate his depravity! #DictatorTrump
if people don't have a job then they can not make purchases thus the stocks will go down, a President on his actions can make things better by creating more jobs, which Trump has done with his deregulations and allowing businesses to come back, thus creating more jobs which means
Do not fall for Trump‚Äôs lie about the election being cancelled, it‚Äôs a lie and to distract! Report him!
says ‚ÄúDelay the election until people can properly, securely and safely vote‚Äù but wants to send children to school when it‚Äôs unsafe. Meanwhile Donald votes by mail and Baron Trump‚Äôs school will be postponed. #DicatorTrump #Hypocrite
you again? We don't know what would have happened because of COVID-19, that's when everything went down because people wound up losing jobs because of business closures. You don't have a crystal ball nor does Trump, we don't know if Stocks would have gone up or down
Definitely a cure for cancer... I have no dout now...
Not only Russia, but China and Ukraine too.
I agree, who's going to vote for Trump THIS Election? I know I am.
How could any black man or woman even consider aligning with trump???? Unbelievable!!
I also think - from the hours of video via social media - that America as more dangerous under Trump than it has been in decades
It's almost as if Trump doesn't listen to your incoherent ramblings. That's weird because of all the times you have spoken positively about the president, I'm shocked he hasn't invoked special powers to do something he already did months ago.
Haven't figured how to 'rig' it reliably yet? Haven't convinced Congressional Russpublicans to crash the USPS to disrupt voting? You gotta GO! #MAGA #MAGADT (...Dump Trump)
That is exactly what happened.
Herman Cain died for Donald Trump's sins.
It's wrong to say both parties are obsessed with the idea. Only one actor is -- Trump. Biden merely predicted it would happen based on evidence Trump had previously presented, such as suggesting he would like to be president for more than 2 terms. Argue in good faith, please.
Trump's latest tweet on suburbs would look better printed like this.
Elections are run by the states, not the federal government. Does Trump really want the spectacle of only Dem-run states voting and losing every one?
Does Your Hatred of Trump Outweigh Your Love of America?
Talking about Trump losing by a Landslide? To whom may I ask is he going to lose to? Joe, Dementia, Biden?
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
you instantly disbelieve Politicians? Mate that was your first mistake right there, Trump is not a Politician, he is a businessman that decided enough is enough and chose to run for President.
Trump votes by mail. Along with press secretary. Barr. His family.........
Donald Trump you are FRAUD mofo‚Äô
Trump wants to delay election? Sure.   Republicans, go ahead and vote at a later date. The rest of us vote November 3rd.
Guess you forgot what Obama said on October 2016 before the Election, where he said Get over it, the Jobs are NOT there in fact my question to Mr. Trump is how is going to bring the jobs back, wave a magic wand? Mr. Trump needs to concentrate on getting votes instead.
Too bad the GOP will stand behind trump, and not the constitution #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Hold it!!! You must be protected UNLESS you are speaking??? As a RN in the OR since 1987, I never ONCE had to take my mask off to speak nor did ANYONE!! Such MISGUIDED INFORMATION!!! AND YOU DARE TO TALK ABOUT TRUMP!! PELOSI we are onto YOU!! FAILURE
At this rate, he‚Äôs going to fall out a window, or get polonium poisoning. We‚Äôre not getting an election, so you get your boy Trump until he decides he‚Äôs done. Enjoy.
Wow!!! What a leader!!! That has always been the recommendation! Did you really think because you are a high and mighty Representative that that made you exempt??? It is now almost AUG and you are finally getting on board!! How DARE you talk about TRUMP!!!
Trump is just a big crybaby he just want power
He must be one of the biggest liars in the world, along with  Trump and Putin, quite an achievement
What is even more disturbing is the Trump cult continue to believe that it is somehow all the left's fault that this is happening. They refuse to look at the reality of the cause which is Trump's total failure to do his job and putting totally unfit people in place to serve.
This is the most disgusting, unAmerican tweet I have read in a while. Accelerationist garbage. I've been telling lefties to arm themselves because of "conservative" trash like this. This is what's in heart of many Trump supporters.
Part of Trump‚Äôs relentless NPD ineptitude is the inability to strategize or control impulses. Of course he wants to delay the election‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt want it at all. If he‚Äôd waited to demand it closer to November, there‚Äôd be less time to attack the idea. But he wants all things NOW
Again, if the people run government poorly maybe we will all just get rid of it. Seems to be the tRump Admin motto. Jan 2021 better have some definitive election results.
Read what Trump said, don't worried about Obama.
Election delay.  Hey - I've got an idea. Those 150,000 dead people? Let's assume they would vote for Biden and just hand over those votes over to Joe. After all, if it weren't for Trump, they might still be alive.
IDK how accurate reporting is about trump‚Äôs postmaster general delaying the mail is. I enrolled 3 of my grandchildren in a book club and this is the first one that has been delayed. They live in Fort Worth. Their books have been in Dallas for over a week. MAIL YOUR BALLOT EARLY
Trump is floating the idea of delaying the election.  Trump must go.
Donald Trump is a Russian mole that has made it to the Whitehouse.
DELAY THE ELECTION???...the real coup is starting , Trump will replace a win with an unlawful take over of the government,who will stand by for that.
More bullshit from Trump and as predicted, threats of a delayed election.  Reported.
And the trumpflu kills a 1000+ each day here while Trump worries that the media isn't properly covering other countries.
Can you please respond to why Trump didn‚Äôt rip Jizzlaine a new one when given the chance? Why did he ‚Äúwish her well‚Äù? She is a big piece to what we are all trying to take down? I feel like your message is being twisted into a hate fest &amp; not actual change #EpsteinDidntKillHimself
It‚Äôs disgusting! The Stormy D stuff doesn‚Äôt bother me, that‚Äôs adults but those children?! This is the legacy being left behind and hidden behind words like ‚ÄúGod bless‚Äù when he talks &amp; the people are like oh wow so great! What does #Q have to say about what Trump said to Ghislaine
Trump ushered a new area of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs wish pedophiles well‚Äù but hey you love the new income and pedopillia! Cool cool
Bro, he is so scared he wished a well known pedophile the best. For how ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúnot scared‚Äù he is she is the first person to have him say something nice to them when they deserve the ugly Trump treatment and she got nothing! So please he is beyond a scared puppet!
My grandparents and parents were republican and they were NOTHING like Trump. I think the definition has changed. Just saying.
will #trump be aboard?
Maybe he was a Russian "sleeper" agent, planted decades ago, helped up the ladder of what has passed for success? Let's face it, Trump will sleep with anyone... Maybe Trump's handler was always Putin, from the earliest days in the KGB? #ConspiracyTheoriesRus
those that believe #trump about anything demeaning Biden were going to vote for him anyhow
Sorry Trump but the first amendment works both ways. Not only are you not suppose to use your position to go after people for what they say, but you can't force people to say nice things about you either, or host and tolerate you're lies and misinformation. Unconstitutional prez
Is one of those places the United States? Because our government seeks to starve us out of at least in compliance with Trump's policies!
On Trump:  Dave Barclay  "What is painfully obvious in these moments, isn't simply that the person alleging to lead this country is a terrible human being‚Äîit is that anyone left still defending him, applauding him, justifying him, amening him, probably is too."

Orange County seems to be the Donald trump of US counties - dumb as a stump and soulless.
And she look like trump
The  vice President said troops were to be removed from Portland, today. Wolf said they aren't leaving just yet, which means who can supersede thVP? Only  one comes to mind! So their marching orders are coming directly from Trump.
I am concerned if the cure for Coronavirus is now coming from alien dna,is it coming from from his little green men? Demon sperm sure would explain a number of Trump's thought processes to me! Is that what they are drinking,hmm? Curious minds!
Trump at work! That was the plan. To fleece Americans. It‚Äôs all about the money.
This is an Important message. Verify this allegation and end drone usage in Somalia with immediate effect. Trump policy in Africa is the same as Obama.

I appreciate your spirit.
I grew up in Orange County, the suburb to end all suburbs. It was red then but blue now. I‚Äôve canvassed in suburbs in NV and WA and people are completely done with Trump.
The war in the streets isn't fed or egged on by conservatives. It is fully supported by Leftist leaders who are determined America become the next socialist/ communist hellhole. Congress Dems. Like Waters who hate Pres. Trump told them to since 2016.
Since when is trump a racist? If you don't recognize it when he speaks I'm guessing you're a racist too, you just don't know it. That's beyond sad.
Trump Lied On The Yankees, No One Should Be Surprised.  ‚Äú...pathological liars lie for no apparent reason...‚Äù üò≥
Trump's legacy that Biden is inheriting.
This is a good window into Trump. He‚Äôs losing in the suburbs because he‚Äôs racist but he lives in a bubble so he thinks that suburbs now are the same as the 1950s ‚ÄúWhite Flight‚Äù era. I grew up in a suburb where this would be an extremely convincing Biden campaign ad.
Biden Is Another Very Bad Joke Being Llsyed On American People If You Want Another Person Just As Bad If Not Worse Than Trump Pick Pathetic Biden You Will All Be Very Sorry
I‚Äôm so pissed by this. Somehow the govt can‚Äôt help people who are out of work but can spend all this money to turn  into a pharmaceutical company?? Don‚Äôt we have enough of those in the world? WTAF? Trump &amp; Co must have a connection. It wouldn‚Äôt have happened otherwise.
You probably know more about Donald Trump than Mary Trump. #TooMuchAndNeverEnough
Recently, Fox appears to be taking baby steps toward doing actual journalism rather than simply being a right wing propaganda outlet so this is a rare occasion where I agree with Trump.
Oh, so suddenly Trump cares about Portland.
I love Trump
#NobodyLikesTrump? Those fake Christians love trump. Even though Jesus said Love Thy Neighbor, but he wants to kick out your low income neighbors. Blessed are the poor? Nah, let‚Äôs get them out of our surburbs!
The idea that he can convince people that a moderate Democrat with a long  history of middle-of-the-road votes in Congress is some kind of Che Guevara figure is magical thinking even by Trump standards.
To all voters:  It is the GOP/Republican/ Conservatives/Tea Party who do not want to help the schools,or extend your unemployment assistance.  Fox and President Trump will tell you it‚Äôs the Democrats.  It is the Senate Majority attaching pork to the bill.Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

In Washington DC or in the affluent, I doubt it. But I appreciate the RVAT people who speak out. They have more influence than the blue does to speak to the red. I welcome all who are anti trump any who support/ defend him.
Yes we should. But trump wants the non- affluent (majority) to live in mud hovels.  No, that‚Äôs optimistic. Where does he think the majority of the tax base comes from?

If you think I'm anti mask or pro trump because I hate inslee you're a ü§°
This is the Bat Sh*t Crazy Doctor that Trump called "Impressive". She believes in Demons and Alien DNA. Who are you going to trust, her or Dr. Fauci.  Stella Immanuel - the doctor behind unproven coronavirus cure claim
A vote for trump is a vote against our democracy.
Stop blaming your state government when on a federal level the trump administration makes the decisions, and much rather prefers filling their own pockets by bailing out big businesses and then giving small businesses scraps.  Whose side are you blindly on?
A vote for trump is a vote against America.

The economy just tanked worse than it has in the history of paying attention to the economy.‚Ä¶ and Trump tricked everybody into paying attention to his empty threat about the election. Eyes on the prize, people! #GoodTrouble #NecessaryTrouble
That's why Trump won't do it.
So, in recent tweet, President Trump "floated" the idea of delaying the nat'l election over concerns that there is massive fraud in mail-in ballots.  Three thoughts:  1) The President as never shown any evidence that there is any fraud in mail-in ballots, let alone massive fraud.
Trump instructs his DOJ to arrest terrorists. Obama meets with them and agrees to their demands.
Obama let Ferguson burn. Trump is trying to put out the fires in Portland.   The difference in response to criminal activity is night and day.
this is horrid, not because its trump (i kinda like him), but because someone took the time to make the models and animate this for multiple hours on end.
I bet  would be just fine delaying the elections. Well she would probably be "concerned". In reality we do not know, as she has yet to condemn Trump's tweet.
Since he cheats at golf, we should not be surprised that he wants to cheat his way out of a defeat at the polls.  #TrumpMeltdown
Stop it. How many leftists and donald trump reply guys do we have to watch denigrate Mr.Cain before we realize that we cant stand for this shit anymore. We show our respect to Mr. Lewis, but they want us dead. The feeling will soon be mutual
If you think about it, Trump supporters are more inclined to believe him about the vote being rigged so MAYBE they are also more like to stay home. That would be justice.

I disagree. Donald Trump is a great racist
We must remove Trump even  if he has to be taken out by the roots of his effed up hair!
I still get goosebumps when I hear Obama speak. (I break out in hives when I hear Trump talk.)
Obama had guts and integratey. While trump has no spine and refused to go just because lewis was a critic of his and is acting like a child when there feeling are hurt but trump has no feeling since he is a soulless abomination.

I am sorry you believe everything Trump tells you.

Nah, it's racism. Which I suppose is its own type of fear. But no, Trump supporters are racist. Trump is racist. They like each other.

Here is WA Sec. of State Kim Wyman's response to President Trump's tweet about possibly delaying the November election.
"Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better."
Does Trump really have the authority to stop the election?
I think she‚Äôs trying to show her dumb followers that Trump can‚Äôt do what the resistance libs think he‚Äôs going to do with the election.
Can we stop talking about Trump's idiotic threat to change the voting date and talk about the historic 30% annualized drop in the GDP. #
Is Trump trying to time this to interrupt Obama?
Crazy? Sure. But what is even more crazy: who is going to stop him? No one has so far.
I won‚Äôt make fun of #HermanCain‚Äôs death. But I won‚Äôt mourn him for giving his life for trump. #TrumpVirus #ETTD #winning
Only if you know you‚Äôre going to lose would you think about changing the election date. Sorry Trump.
They didn't drink poison at gunpoint, they drank it because the believed in their leader so much that they were willing to die for his corrupt unconscionable message, just like Trump supporters.
Donald Trump is the liar of liars. Please use all the legal and necessary actions to prevent the president from taking any unconstitutional actions.
The administration you work for killed him. You sold out for fame and what's messed up is your family is already rich. Why did you do that? Herman Cain is dead. Was it worth it? For Trump? Was it worth it Kayleigh?

Unflinching?  No.  Pragmatic.  I don't actually like Biden.  He was dead last in a raft of much better options.  But that's who I've got, him or Trump?  Yeah, Biden's better than Trump.  He's not amazing, but he's better.  And right now, all we get is better.
And no, 4 more years of Trump isn't going to change the DNC.  It's not going to punish them, or make them change, or fuck, make VOTERS change, because they picked Biden.  The people picked Biden.    I don't agree with the people, but he's what we've got vs fascism.

Fear of trump refusing to leave the WH if he loses is overblown (has no constitutional impact on who is president).  But the trashiest housing decision a millionaire could make is to excersies squatters rights, so I wouldn't put it past him.
House votes to stymie Trump's transgender troop ban
Yes, you're right about Trump exploiting her. Unfortunately, your remark insulted her because of her skin color. Sometimes, fine-tuning consciousness-raising takes awhile and mistakes are made. The Aunt Jemima crack could be dismissed as a mistake IF you don't double down on it.
Corruot tRump stooge
Trump is a bonafide idiot .........
Working crap jobs for 10yrs, I have the best job i've ever had now. People in my office dedicate 10-30min badmouthing Trump &amp; Conservatives. I pretend 2 be a moderate and still I'm attacked. They know I'm gay but I live in fear every day that they'll find out that I support Trump

‚ÄúMany people are saying‚Ä¶‚Äù that they have caught on. Like you wouldn‚Äôt believe.
I watched and being moved by the eulogies at John Lewis‚Äôs funeral today.     He took so many beatings for America. GOP senators (except Romney) can't even stand up to Trump tweets.
The Constitutional Case Against Trump‚Äôs Use of the Department of Homeland Security  via
Barr works for Trump. However it ain't gonna happen so there it is.
Genuinely curious to hear any Christian defend Trump‚Äôs rollback of suburban segregation.   Or have the excuses for Trump‚Äôs racism gotten so tired they‚Äôre not even trying anymore.  But they‚Äôll support him anyway.
Trump said he wants the stimmy checks to be higher than $1200? I mean fuck it we ball but I‚Äôm still not voting for you champ
Keep an eye on the USPS and Trump‚Äôs new Postmaster General. Seriously. ‚ÄúSlowing down‚Äù the mail? What other shenanigans are in store for Nov. 3?
Anyone have a list of accurate, non-ableist terms that can be applied to Trump to describe his disqualifications to serve as POTUS? #TrumpUnfit
He's out on Jan 20th no matter what. Pelosi takes over if an election has not happened by then (Though Trump doesn't have the authority and already Congress has said he was "joking")
Dive into the Russian bounties. Trump still hasn't addressed it publicly.
Good luck going up against WA state AG -
Now visualize Trump doing this speech.  "He was GREAT. Very, very GREAT. Just like me. I'm GREAT"
I know Obama signed the NDAA in Dec 2011 which gave Trump the powers he is flexing now. So do you think only the right is the enemy?! Or do you vote democrat?
It's time to take Trump seriously, figuratively, and literally
The degree to which Trump has been priming his base to reject the results of the election/claim the process is illegitimate is making me fucking nervous.
In Dec 2011 Obama signed the NDAA which gave Trump the power he is flexing now. The left have made the police stand down while the right builds up its force and now they have a so called ‚Äúenemy‚Äù to fight. I see us being played from both sides.
Trump is faithfully executing the agenda of his puppet-master and banker, Vladimir Putin: sabotaging confidence in the electoral process, damaging the Western Alliance, undermining the rule of law, and to the best of his Ability, defying the Constitution of the United States.
Trump pulling out of Germany is a huge deal
Do you suppose Trump can even connect the dots? That his actions lead to his friends death. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
The greatest proof Trump is a fake is that guy is still walking around free.
Comparing favorably to the abject horror of Trump makes Bush neither honorable nor decent.   Iraq. Abu Ghraib. "Mission Accomplished". Katrina. The Great Recession.   Bush wasn't the start or end of  decent into darkness, but he was a critical step in that journey.
Fascists love chaos and they spin it so the chaos is from some other party. Covid? That‚Äôs the Wuhan flu and it‚Äôs China‚Äôs fault. Lost your job? Dems closed the economy. Antifa? Scary Marxist socialist Venezuela no iPhone. The intended takeaway is that only trump can fix those
Donald Trump sucks
Nobody cares to listen to trump.
To Trump, people who get sick and die of the coronavirus are betraying him.
He got sick after attending a Trump cult rally and not wearing a mask.  Didn‚Äôt need to happen! Should never have held a mass gathering and should have worn a mask.
President  is delivering an incredible eulogy for  right now, excoriating the Trump regime for its attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election. Preach! #GoodTrouble
Is it possible that tRump like a broken clock is correct today? I am all for having congress move the election to August and we can get rid of the orange menace sooner. #25amendmentnow #TraitorTrump
Even Biden, who can't lead his way out of a paper bag, would have known how to let responsible people craft a response and then read the right words on the teleprompter.  I say it again: Trump is uniquely awful. All he had to do was not actively work to sabotage our response.
Umm... it could have started in Washington DC?  For all their flaws, which are legion, I'm confident that if Obama or even Hillary or Mitt or John Kerry or George W. Bush were currently in charge, our death toll would have been cut in half.  Trump is uniquely awful.
Republicans flat-out reject Trump's suggestion to delay election
Trump floats delaying election over false claims about voting by mail, but he doesn't have the power
Trump &amp; GOP want you to believe that all Dems are ‚Äúradical left‚Äù. This simply isn‚Äôt true. They deliberately mislead to further divide us. What does this accomplish?  We want safeguards to prevent abuse of power by govt, corps &amp; the top 3%. We want basic civil rights for everyone.
The black lives most at risk are inner-city school children. A Biden presidency won‚Äôt help them, writes
Joseph Welch, the lawyer tasked with defending the Army against McCarthy‚Äôs charges, told him, in a 1954 Senate hearing, ‚ÄúYou have, I think, sir, something of a genius for creating confusion, creating turmoil in the hearts and minds of the country.‚Äù
Gee, Trump says we need to stamp out the ‚Äòembers‚Äô from the coronavirus now. Somehow ‚ÄúLiar liar pants on fire‚Äù and the world being engulfed in flames seem to be related, but maybe that‚Äôs just me? Ol‚Äô Orange Sparky at work.
Genuine question: how is  wrong?  Yes, you can still get the virus with a mask, and Cain might not have gotten it from Tulsa.  But McMullin's point, that Trump-world is being entirely unserious about this, and that this is literally killing people, is quite right.
House GOP pushes back at Trump on changing election date
Trump's call to "delay" the election is a distraction ‚Äî but it's also a serious threat
Trump is scared shitless of Putin.
The only reason I'm aware of during the Primaries, is because, say you are going to vote for Trump in the Presidential Election. You obviously will want the least qualified candidate to run against Trump, so Republicans will vote for some no-name person running otherwise ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Can't wait to find out what Putin has on Trump.
Get your facts straight. The MORON = TRUMP did not get over 50% of the people‚Äôs vote. He lost that by almost 3 million votes.
What the hell   You're blaming the USPS?  This is just going to stop people from even trying to vote.  You don't even mention that it's Trump's doing, as covered by many other reports:
Imagine Trump with Twitter dies
Really, they're just going to tear up the existing roses and never plant any new roses. Another GOTCHA from the Trump family to the citizens of the US.
Would-be dictator Donald Trump would be unstoppable in a second term. That must not happen
What is disgusting and fraudulent is tRump and McCarthy
A "Cops For Trump" rally in the midst of a nation-wide cop riot should be a pretty clear signal to all that the GOP's serious about paramilitary violence as an election tactic.
Trump has declared war on America
Trump: kids need to go back to school they'll be fine Also Trump: we need to delay the election it's too dangerous
we need the onlyfans gays to run negative ads on trump tbh
Trump is suggesting postponing the election. I can't see a world where Congress let's that fly, as it's not in his power to make that decision.  Either he knows this and is trying to distract from the abysmal 32.9% fall in the economy, or...
Hahaha üòÜ Joe was right! I don‚Äôt know who this guy is but he owes Biden and apology!
No. It will be a COVID election. Trump wants to make it a Law &amp; Order election. But the virus can‚Äôt read Trump‚Äôs talking points any more than he can read his PDB.
I don't entirely disagree with this, but I'm having a hard time convincing myself that either Trump, the GOP, or the right-wing mediasphere will be constrained by what's "legally impossible."
That's it. Trump has to go.
I love reading white men comments on fb talking shit on trump. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt fight in Nam for a facist to be president‚Äù ‚Äúmy granddaddy didn‚Äôt fight in WW2 to relive this shit‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs no way to talk about a lady‚Äù like appreciate the sentimate now vote blue November 3rd guys !!!!
Changing the election date is an interesting idea. How about some time in early August?
Herman Cain.   ‚ÄúHe will always be remembered for his love of country,‚Äù McCarthy added in a tweet.  No he won‚Äôt. He‚Äôll be remembered for the fool he was, the hypocrite, the liar, the traitor. He‚Äôll be remembered for not wearing a mask at a tRump rally during a pandemic.
That‚Äôs all transparent BS and spin. Mail-in voting is safe, efficient, and can be every bit as secure as in-person voting. Trump and the GOP hate it because it limits their ability to suppress the vote with restricting poll access.
Trump‚Äôs strategy is to allow the unchecked explosive growth of the epidemic, in order to delay the election and remain in power.  He is insane. #TrumpTreason
But then, there's a third "neutral branch of government" that is supposed to resolve conflicts like this. Of course, the courts take a long time to get things worked through. Luckily, Trump hasn't filled hundreds of stolen circuit seats and several SCOTUS seats with... oh.
If SOMEHOW Trump wins, it will immediately be called into question, and rightfully so. There was pro-Trump interference last time, not to mention all the active suppression occurring now. If Biden wins, Trump will claim foreign interference and suspend the results.
US history is nuts so maybe it happened but regardless I do believe Trump will refuse to give it up
Donald Trump is a used Trojanz for Russia.
... which is exactly why Trump doesn‚Äôt want mail-in voting.
Trump supporters, please follow the great leader‚Äôs orders and do not vote until next year. #Election2020 #100Days
WATCH: Trump fans line up for Pence rally without masks hours after Herman Cain dies of COVID -
He certainly promoted stupidity but people are responsible for their own actions. The blame is mostly on the individual but partial blame does go to Trump.
Remember Trump, Barr and Pompeo and all those who enabled them, on trial in 2021
Donald Trump is #InaccurateAndFraudulent  #Russiapublicans
Protesting certainly isn‚Äôt and almost all of the protestors are wearing masks unlike Trump‚Äôs rally
No one I see is praising his death. I‚Äôm seeing tears. He died for Trump, supporting him. I hope Trump takes this as a wake up call, before more die to support him.
Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress
Basically, Herman Cain died for Trump. I hope he appreciates it.
#WeWillVote  Donald Trump, shame on you for toying with our democracy.
Feel bad for his family. Here he is at a Trump ralkey with no mask. Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Let‚Äôs not forget in 2016 he bitched that voter fraud was rampant.
When Trump tweets about voting today, he's really trying to get you to not read this. There's no other reason, he can't actually delay the election.
Trump‚Äôs ego killed Heman Cain. RIP
So support tRump, go to his rallies, but make sure you sign the waver so you cannot sue him. #25amendmentnow #TrumpTraitor
Add to that Trump now suggesting that stimulus checks could be larger than $1200... guess what strings will be attached to that....
Trump is a murderer
This person along with over 150,000 other Americans are dead because Donald Trump cares only about his image. I don‚Äôt see how you can find any virtue in that.
Trump suggests delaying November election, something he doesn't have the power to do
All because of Donald Trump. He needs to resignI had a dude on FB try to tell me Trump's told the most truth of the last three presidents we've had.

Donald J Trump, Prince Edward, William Clinton , CEOS, former politicians. This spanned almost 20 years.

What a bs headline... it should read ‚ÄútRump has TANKED us AGAIN‚Äù #QuitBeingNice #TheyAreCorrupt #EndTrump
The republicans, and trump either don‚Äôt care, or just oblivious to the sufferings, and hardships,  of 99%  of Americans. Extend  the 600 unemployment  stipend. It‚Äôs a no brainer, it didn‚Äôt take long to pass the tax break to the wealthy. It‚Äôs disgraceful .
That's okay, twenty years from now I'll still be calling it the Trump Virus, if it doesn't get me first.
tRump is the bad guy! He is the villain in our actual lives! His sleaze and corruption he wears on his sleeve like a badge of honor or something! #EvictTrump is just the beginning of the evictions! #VoteOutTheGOP #TrumpIsHate #NobodyLikesTrump

A MUST READ!
The clock is ticking, and time is running out on not only Donald Trump, but also his Conservative pundits, who won‚Äôt have a platform from which, to shout utter nonsense, FOX News will once again try to reformat, their program base to apatizing News...

No doubt about it! You KNOW your vote is GOLDEN when tRump and Republicans will do ANYTHING possible to steal it!! #VoteForOurLives #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
When did he call him racist? I lost respect for mike too. Trump is a walking garbage can of corruption and hatefulness, and clearly mike co-signed all of that.
Twitter defends blocking Trump‚Äôs Political tweets but not Iranian Leader‚Äôs Genocide Tweets -
Oh, Trump can, but he ought not to.
That works for me.  Unless we know otherwise from the election results, the term of Trump and Pence ends on 1/20/21 and Speaker Pelosi becomes President.
Trusting Donald trump can be a hazarded to your health
"A party rooted in decency and values does not embrace the anger that Mr. Trump peddles as patriotism."
In short, I Donald J Trump am looking for Heman Cains. Tick tock tick tock.
Once again, today is an example of why Trump will never be half the man or president that Barack Obama was. One delivered a powerful &amp; uniting eulogy for a hero, and the other hid somewhere and made cowardly, nonsensical statements. #StillMyPresident #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I think Trump has shown that it‚Äôs easy to become that.

Wow, Trump REALLY loves it when people die from coronavirus...
Trump is as familiar with Article II of the Constitution, as he is with two Corinthians.
Do you think Trump will still be claiming mail in votes are fraudulent if he wins?
Black Lives Matter is nothing but a radical left wing terrorist mob attacking our important landmarks. Don‚Äôt buy in to whatever bs Democrats say about it. Obviously Trump has a reason to stop domestic terrorism from happening, doesn‚Äôt make him a racist.
I have a 30 day suspension on my Facebook, all because I was arguing with some libtard and then defended Trump stating how Obama lacked the job that President Trump does. Trust me all of social media violates 1st Amended rights from Conservatives. Something they need to regulate.
A thicko wishful thinking as there's zero chance of Trump quitting!
BREAKING NEWS: Congress to bring election date forward to first week of September.  (Not really - but if Trump wants to delay it why can't it be brought forward so #PresidentPandemic can go on his merry way and be replaced by a real President sooner than November).
These people will defend Pete like MAGA defends trump I don‚Äôt get it
Only a dictator would suggest the vote be delayed.  It's so embarrassing to have a President of the world's leading democracy make a suggestion to delay the vote. Republicans of all people should be ashamed of Trump for making this suggestion.
I have voted for Kim the last two elections she has been up. I thought she was fair and followed things by the book. That still may be, but her and the state GOP's silence toward the rhetoric of Trump makes it impossible for me to vote for her or any Republican down ballot.
Does Trump even have a copy of the US Constitution?  Sigh.
McConnell calls Trump push to include FBI HQ money in next coronavirus aid bill 'a mistake' #SmartNews: Trumps trying to steal!!!

That‚Äôs because the stock market is artificially inflated from the TRUMP -administration. And no where in America is the stock market numbers mean anything to most Americans
UMMM....NO  What do you think of this???  Trump suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
This is the insane part that scares me - trump cultists don‚Äôt fact check and will do what the tweets and FOX says. Then rather than get angry at who lied at them get angry at the truth and kill to change it.
For all the ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù crew; I‚Äôd like to point out the only 2 times there was known criminal activity regarding elections was Nixon (a republican) and Trump (a republican). If you‚Äôre so worried about fraud in the presidency, stop voting for the party that actually commits it.
Congress will sort out Trump if he tries to delay, he is scared of losing so is already making excuses that it  is a fraud election
What the hell are you talking about? Seattle and Portland to mention two cities are democrat controlled and have nothing to do with Trump. The only thing that stopped the burning of federal properties had been because of Trump.
Vote Trump 2020, that's the right thing. I voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him again!
You need to educate yourself! Obama administration spied on Trump's campaign, this can be proven. Trump's campaign plane was bugged at the direction of Obama. How many provable scandals was Obama involved in? How many provable scandals has Trump been involved in?
A criminal , like Trump
So Trump is pulling his strings again, yay.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The US system of checks and balances will prevent Trump from putting off the election which he thinks he will lose. There is no such system in the UK. Johnson/Cummings could force through a Bill extending the life of Parliament, unless scores of Tory MPs blocked it. Worrying.
Unlike he did for Rep. Lewis, Trump WILL make time to honor Mr. Cain.
The Trump is who wants you out of the country. You just voted for your own export.
Trump in the bedroom with gonorrhea.
He's going into full 'Trump mode', if I say it, it must be true.  Can this man not say on honest thing, answer one question truthfully or get one thing right?  What a disgrace.  Boris Johnson claims 'massive success' in getting coronavirus deaths down
Seems to me  needs to apologize to AG Ferguson. This shows how local GOP is willing to dismiss anything Trump says/does as long as it fits his agenda.
It will be harder for Trump to do that, than it would be for Johnson to force through an extension of the parliamentary term, or to cancel the next local elections as they were (rightly) cancelled this year. The US has checks and balances, the UK doesn‚Äôt.
So, Herman Cain died of COVID-19.  I believe he caught that at Trump's rally.
I also think - from the hours of video via social media - that America as more dangerous under Trump than it has been in decades
That's not how are would work Cynthia trump dies pence gets in appoints another vice president pence dies that vice president gets in appoints another vice president they would have to die simultaneously for ugly ass lying ass Pelosi to get in
Anyone who has concerns about Trump delaying the election, is not crazy, stupid, or fear mongering. No other laws has stopped Trump from pretty much doing anything he wanted. I am scared to death Trump is going to cancel the election with the help of Republicans and the SC.

Serious question, I have always been curious about. I think your mom is a smart women, but she has been going along with Trump since 2016. Does she actually believe the things Trump is saying? I can't believe she does all of it.
He must be one of the biggest liars in the world, along with  Trump and Putin, quite an achievement
He sees the internal polling. Repubs, as well as himself are going to get routed. So, he is going to do everything he can to try and contest the election. Do not be surprised if Biden wins be 5-10% and then Trump sues and tries to use the 12th amendment to overturn the election.
Maybe my memory is playing tricks on me,.....but,....I seem to remember tRUMP's son-in-law buying up Casket Companies early on in the Pandemic....Could be that that is incorrect...sure seems I read that somewhere Long time ago NOW.
Suggesting that the Presidential election should be delayed is just the latest episode in this. I'm sure Trump wouldn't be saying these things if he were ahead in the polls...
Maybe he was a Russian "sleeper" agent, planted decades ago, helped up the ladder of what has passed for success? Let's face it, Trump will sleep with anyone... Maybe Trump's handler was always Putin, from the earliest days in the KGB? #ConspiracyTheoriesRus
In deed neither have I. Are you a ware tha a 60 yr old black man was murdered in cold blood for supporting President Trump. Another black man shot him. Hate crime and no one is talking about it on the left or great media. Please look into it Mark
‚ÄúI reclaim my Time-O-crats‚Äù sealed their fate. Drain Baby Drain! Trump 2020!
And who is up set about the 60 year old black man who was murdered because he supported President Trump. He needs a proper funeral like Floyd got. His desth is a hate crime and no one is talking about it. This needs to be in public tv media it‚Äôs a hate crime because hating Trump
Yep. Not by choice. tRump fueled insomnia. Almost 2 am in Auburn, WA.
This is an Important message. Verify this allegation and end drone usage in Somalia with immediate effect. Trump policy in Africa is the same as Obama.
That‚Äôs so fucking stupid.  No Trump supporter is putting up a Biden sign. They just wouldn‚Äôt put a sign up at all if that‚Äôs a case. Maybe they don‚Äôt all love Biden, but it definitely means they hate Trump.  Insanely naive and gullible.

So let me get this straight - the same day Trump talks to his lord &amp; master Putin, he does 2 things.   1. Makes sure to NOT discuss Russia paying Taliban forces to kill our troops;   2. Pulls 11,900 of our troops out of Germany.   What the actual fuck?
Lmaof!
True, but real life is not Twitter. People set up sock puppet accounts all the time. It's one way to paint your opponent as "too unreasonable" so that you just say "well Trump can't be that bad." He is.
Based on the insane biased by Barr under testimony.   The only way  America will be safe from Trump's insanity is when we vote it out in November .  Barr Repeats Trump Falsehoods in Congressional Testimony
Sound great for Trump, but what do we get out of that deal?
How can you support someone like Trump? I just don't get it. He's a terrible person
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
HE WANTS TO EXCLUDE POORER INCOMES FROM COMMUNITIES AND KEEP THEM EXCLUDED. I put that in capitals because I think you're just not getting it. In any case, you obviously are a Trump supporter and will not listen at all. So, I suggest we simply agree to disagree and part ways :)
I could say the same for the other side. Trump is very far removed from the Republican Party I know and respected.
Actually I am quite bright. I just had to process it because I couldn't believe Trump would actually just come out as a racist bigot like that. Please tell me how as a slightly privileged white woman I can be racist because I don't like Trump? That makes little sense.
Bro, Trump started this with his rhetoric.
Because she is the clearest and strongest choice, believe me, they fear the others as well but not as much as Mrs Harris. She's been a strong pick from the start and is coming after trump and his swamp, even the dems that quietly support trump are in hot water with this woman
China‚Äôs WeChat App is aligned with MSM against HCQ. I‚Äôm glad I live outside China‚Äôs firewall so I have greater access to info. There is clearly a commercial and political campaign against a potentially effective therapy that costs pennies,  not $1000s, and that Trump supports.
The same people saying ‚ÄúTrump 2020, Fuck your feelings‚Äù are the ones complaining about their hurt feelings because Walmart and Starbucks require masks... I say to them, Wear a Mask, Fuck your feelings.

The problem is, he lies, you buy it because he is trump's defender, not a defender of the law, you people are crazy...

Anything less than a landslide, namely Biden winning fewer than 45 states, and Trump will spend the next few weeks challenging the result in as many states as he can.
i am begging for literally any reason beyond not being Trump to vote for Biden and he can't even bother to do that.
GOP and incompetent corrupt Trump still have no ideas, no policy, no plans, and horrendous public health and unemployment results. We are where we are because the GOP has no idea how to govern. Only fools would continue to endorse this incompetence.

Every judge appointed by Trump, including Kavanaugh, needs to be investigated for bias and prejudice, and kicked off the court if they are not neutral!!  America‚Äôs courts are worth care and consideration, if they are going to take us into the future!
Trump and his family will be in federal prison, if there‚Äôs any justice in the world, and that will take care of their ‚Äúfederal‚Äù protection!
I think we'll be hearing you (and your buddy, Trump) saying "I don't remember" over and over again. In court, after he is driven from office and held accountable for his crimes. And all his buds go down with him.

They used to say the same thing about Gee Dubs, and now they're praising him.  If you think Donald Trump is bad, just wait until you see the next Republican president.
Right, Mr Cruz. This is a horrible action by Kavanaugh. Just what the people warned against when the Senate voted to install the Trump lackey. Kavanaugh shows no independence or desire to follow the rule of law.

I'm not saying "just vote Democrat, bro".  Blind faith is bullshit.  It's pragmatism, nothing more.  It's important to note that when I say Trump, I don't just mean Trump, I mean every shit he's put into a position to assist with any agenda he or others have.

If the only reasonable alternative is fascism?  Yup.  Abstaining from voting?  That's a vote for Trump.  It impacts nothing you want.  It has no impact because you have subtracted your voice from the discussion.  You don't even seem to want one.  You just want to complain.
Unflinching?  No.  Pragmatic.  I don't actually like Biden.  He was dead last in a raft of much better options.  But that's who I've got, him or Trump?  Yeah, Biden's better than Trump.  He's not amazing, but he's better.  And right now, all we get is better.
And no, 4 more years of Trump isn't going to change the DNC.  It's not going to punish them, or make them change, or fuck, make VOTERS change, because they picked Biden.  The people picked Biden.    I don't agree with the people, but he's what we've got vs fascism.
What 'other things' are more important than bounties on our soldiers? Somebody needs to put a bounty out on Trump.
OMG!!! This is the 1st I've seen of what she says. So obviously she's watched Men in Black and thinks it's a documentary. This 'doctor' is off her rocker. Of course Trump would believe her. At this point, aliens aren't invading &amp; have left bc they don't want Covid. What a loon!
Russia may be adding to the confusion, but Trump is the Grand Master at lies, distortions, and bullshit.
Trump only cares about the "well to do"
Hey trump, they're the sane ones...not you.
Well, all the citations you've provided have been meaningless. 9/11 of the people you used as your examples were justified killings based on the circumstances of the event.   I get it. You're a Trump supporter. He loves the uneducated.You're sane and know there are far more important things to worry about than random opinions and comedians making jokes. So we know you won't make a mockery of the position like trump (anus Tangerinus) has done. Good luck. :)
You‚Äôre starting to sound a lot Trump.  Lying while accusing others of EXACTLY what you are doing.  You have outlived you welcome in the senate.
Mitch McConnell‚Äôs waiting for the pain to become so acute that the American people will tolerate anything (more Trump and Co.) to make it go away. He‚Äôs a nasty bastard. The world will be a better place when he leaves it.

So Trump wants to move the election back?  I say lets move it forward!  Lets vote his corrupt, lying, incompetent ass out of office next week!
Trump just said Red Cross has a lot of experience with plasma. He‚Äôs a smart one, that guy. #IdiotInChief
They impeached the president and the media was implicit in his acquittal. Trump sucks up so much media oxygen the story wouldn‚Äôt get any coverage anyway. Doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt try, but don‚Äôt expect to hear about it on the news.

Cain was treated for the coronavirus in Atlanta. Two weeks before falling ill, he attended President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He had also recently traveled to Arizona where cases are spiking.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a "delay" to November's presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
In weekly phone call:  Putin: Withdraw troops from Germany Trump: Sir, yes, sir!  Vladimir Putin is the President of the United States
Let me get this straight. Trump says it‚Äôs perfectly fine for kids to go to school but the virus is too dangerous to have an election? That‚Äôs some effed up logic right there.
Wondering why Trump hasn‚Äôt yet dumped the whole mess in Pence‚Äôs lap and jetted the hell out of the country.   That way he can say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lose, Pence did!‚Äù His ego cannot handle a crushing defeat.
I fail to see anything technical about it. Trump intentionally and knowingly created an infectious environment. The death of Herman Cain merely proves his theorem correct. At least he destroyed one of his own. Next he intends to kill your children.
Putin: Withdraw troops from Germany Trump: Sir, yes sir!
How dare you. Trump FACILITATED his death. Does that Harvard education allow you to connect the dots? Complicit disgusting chit.
I believe Cain is mostly responsible for not wearing a mask BUT Trump is guilty for facilitating this and bears a consider amount of responsibility for his death.
I'm alway surprised by how reassuring W's voice is compared to Trump's. Hearing actual Presidents speak again is a stark contrast to Trump. Especially when they both subtly rebuke Trump in their eulogies. I think John Lewis would have enjoyed this. Pelosi is nails on a chalkboard
What if we delay Trump‚Äôs ability to tweet out election destabilizing crap?
Yup. Trump facilitated his death.
Trump killed him. Don‚Äôt care if twitter has a problem with me saying this.
I agree that trump  should  stay  president until there is a safe and far way to have elections! As this could be years just let trump be president for four more years! At that time place another trump  in office!" We don't  need  elections there so tiresome and expensive!
And Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities have been challenged?  You were played by Trump this whole time. Check today‚Äôs tweet by the dimwit in charge.
and Twitter is following Trump's fake news about trying to delay the Nov election, no wonder he keeps lying, people spend so much energy putting his BS back in the box
Thanks, Trump.
You think Trump has looked at the Constitution? Good one.

Trump and his minions are doomed to fail by their own hand.  Deaths, will not slow until diagnosis‚Äôs do, with a 30 day lag. There will be 350,000 deaths by Election Day. Stay the course. Take our country back. At all costs vote early and vote
Funny, I did not even notice that part of it.  I noticed the part that he liked Trump due to his policies.  That his policies were better than Obama.  That the economy was not Obama's but Trumps.  You are racist!
You're letting them pay cash to kill our soldiers, so what's the big deal? Trump Tower Moscow?
White racism at its finest. Fascism, big business/corporate control of politics and if you make less money than I do, your a nobody. This I would imagine is what Mr. Trump thinks of people.
You're as much of an a****** as Trump and he is saying what he's saying trying to get votes for re-election or build hotels where he wants to build hotels. Maybe he should go build hotels in Russia with his buddy (Putin) and the rest of his henchmen.

It will take time to undo what Trump did.  That's why we need Trump another 4 years.  To make it completely impossible to change what was done during his tenure.  Trump destroyed Obama's legacy and now you are attempting to destroy America.  Seems fair.
Trump can‚Äôt. Can I introduce you to  ?
Trump destroyed obama's legacy.  you are wrong, just about everything he did is no longer there.  He killed the iran deal, still working on killing obamacare, etc.  Total destruction of what he did.  I know it conflicts with what you believe.

The governor and the mayor are saying that Trump came in and made the protesters violent.  They are claiming that the protests were almost done before Trump came in.  Total lies, complete and total lies.  Since when do you abandon federal court buildings, sir?
Oh isn't that special.  Trump completely destroyed everything Obama did, completely destroyed it.  You have to agree with that.  How is it that it is still Obama's economy when Trump reversed everything he did?  You are living in a lie, friend.  You need to find a way through it.
That's okay, Joe is on the way.  Obama &gt; Trump
The virus is not the problem! The democraps are the problem! If the economy doesn't start up soon it won't matter if you're alive or not! You'll be just as dead! And so will  your family's! That's why trump wants to get all the blue states open!
Trump saved this country.  The country was doing great till you stupid idiots jumped in.  How can people love Biden when he won't even show his face?  He makes no comments on what is going on.  You live in a fantasy world and you better wake up before it is too late.

Barr has really been a good partner for Trump.  He is able to handle himself under stress and does not ever whine about what he has been asked to do.  He seems quite loyal even during apparent stresses between the two.  Clearly they both, Trump and Barr, have a common goal.

Why have mail in ballots?  You can wear your mask and be safe!  Screw your mail in ballots.  I think Trump is right.  It creates problems with the election.  Why would you have issues protecting the national election from issues? The problems are wide spread with mail in ballots.
Trump said he won't throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium, saying he has "strong focus" on the coronavirus, vaccines &amp; the economy.
I think that his presence would be more of a diversion from honoring Congressman Lewis, than any sign of true respect.   And I am guessing the family is fine with that.   However, there are other ways to show your respect for a hero, and I doubt that Trump will do any of them.

You do realize fascist and communists are at polar opposite ends of the spectrum.   What trump is doing to Americans is fascism.
President Trump sends his federal officers to take care of the business you refuse to acknowledge is a problem. You Jay Inslee don't do your job. Inslee one day you will run with your tail between your legs! You are the worst govenor in history!
Very good point.  Joe Biden is running against himself.  Trump has the heart and soul of America.  I really think he has become a major issue for these elite.  All the more reason to vote for Trump.  He is right for America at this time, my kind of super hero.

Looks like that changed!  I'm voting third party.  I believe Trump is a dangerous fascist, but Biden is status quo  and status quo has proven to just be a red carpet for fascism.
To be comparing Trump at 50 vs Fauci at 79 makes someone look really stupidü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If you don‚Äôt like America, you are free to leave it. I am kind of hoping for a mass exodus from the country after trump wins again. So, I will save you a ticket.
Too late mayor. You can‚Äôt spin this after trump waited months for you to get things under control. The coming slaughter is on your head!!!!  You are the one trying to sacrifice Portland!
what ever happened to the conservative's platform of 'small government', now we've got Trump creating a national police force to suppress freedom, basically nazi america
Trump's BIG GOVERNMENT POLICE STATE is BS pal, what happened to conservatives platform of small government?  ha!  total chaos in  land
No they won‚Äôt be putting anything in my body with out my approval
I love #Portland and it makes me sick to see it being used and abused for #Trump's media spectacle. #FedsOutOfPortland #StandWithPortland
Actually, he is doing a fantastic job running the country.  I hope you will join me in saying Trump 2020!
I disagree.  America is coming together to Trumps side.  The dems are losing their base and rejecting progressive socialism.  Look at the interactions of the people on twitter. The dems are increasingly panic'ing while the Trump team is becoming increasingly more optimistic.
Well, the city of Chicago now recognizes who has taken responsibility for the city.  Trump is no longer the cause of the problems.  Trump can still protect the US Governments property and will decide if he needs to drop kick this mayor into oblivion.  It may be the only way.
But not to #PedoJoeBiden. He'll probably think he's watching a broadway musical on TV when it's actually Trump's second swearing-in ceremony.

Oh Portland. Love you. The rest of the country are getting a peek at your vibe (Portlandia anyone?) and your unique way of handling what life and Trump throw at you.
You had no business center stage and barely qualified for the events which meant you were off the the edges by Marianne. Your just as illegitimate as Trump is at this point.
I think Biden should refuse to debate Trump as long as Trump refuses to release his taxes.

Well, it is one of the proudest (political) moments of my life because my husband, who erroneously voted for Trump in 2016, just confirmed tonight he is voting for Biden. üé§ drop.
Wow!  This is awesome.  Democrats went to far and now they are jumping ship.  Welcome aboard the Trump train democrats!  You are welcome to join the team!
Actually, I look at it this way.  Trump approved the masks so that the dems would not have an excuse to do mail in election.  Jokes on them. The agreement by the populace was to prevent the hospitals from being overrun.  No more risk of this, so no more emergency.  Free America.
Only 100 pro Trump Republicans in that survey, 7,000 others were told to shut upWashington State.  Everyone I know is voting Red.  We have to lose Inslee!  President Trump is the best president in my lifetime and I am 76.

Trump's been fighting an uphill battle and winning every step of the way can't wait to see what he does the next four years of these Dopey Democrats
I don't think you know the meaning of the word riot. I see peaceful protestors getting attacked by the federal Gestapo. There are a few criminals that use the protests as a cover to commit crimes but they are few and they are Trump supporters but a few do not make a riot.
How about AND Trump.
No....because you won't be elected president! I love Trump's tweets....the only way we can get the truth.

I feel exactly the same way! I had no idea the amount of hate that I have for him and all of them that support him! I‚Äôm working on it though. I don‚Äôt want trump to change me into being a hateful person. I don‚Äôt ever want him to be relevant again in my life after January 20, 2021
Obama didn't do crap for eight years. He could of cared less about civil rights, crime on the streets, or anything else for that matter. Thank you President Trump for caring!
Trump is trying to take healthcare away from 27M people during a pandemic. Shut up

They impeached the president and the media was implicit in his acquittal. Trump sucks up so much media oxygen the story wouldn‚Äôt get any coverage anyway. Doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt try, but don‚Äôt expect to hear about it on the news.

Trump is having a bad day. Funeral for John Lewis,  he is jealous as hell, Flynn, taxes, G. Maxwell, Tropps leaving Portland and Seattle. I expect the next 72 hours to be nuts.
His suicide was encouraged by you and your colleagues as well as Trump and the GOP. I have little sympathy for Herman Cain because he was educated enough to understand the risks he took. I feel really sorry for the people he willingly infected on his way to dying.

I won‚Äôt vote for either Trump or Biden. I will, however, attempt to vote out every Democrat on the federal, state, and local elections. The voices coming from the Democrats are: a senile, corrupt hollow man lifer‚Äîa funnel which the Marxist style element will flow through.

What the hell is the DoJ waiting for? Kicking the ball down the road is not an option! Say President Trump is not elected. The DOJ will have lost any credibility it might have once had. Lady Justice would have failed, diminishing this great nation.
Negative! We are engaged in an insurgency with law  enforcement that is both restrained and constrained. It  doesn‚Äôt make sense. President Trump has a constitutional mandate to protect our national security. So do it.
So sorry- not meaning to get combative with a fellow trump hater, I'm just SO FckiNG sick of seeing him skate through life when he's the worst. Like how can even really bad people put up with him?
The article you posted says local police are taking over. That‚Äôs not a reversal for trump you moron that‚Äôs the local police deciding to do their damn job. Prior to that point the mayor and governor had refused to protect the building.

Capone had the ability to do that because he had money and was continuing to make money while he was in prison. He had the cash to pay the prison employees. Trump is an idiot and all of his money will be tied up while he is in prison. He won't be able to pay the employees.
Our economy was great under Obama / Biden. Our economy crashed under Trump. We can't afford another four more years of Trump.

"Pure evil" is the perfect oxymoron. It also is the best description of trump. He has practiced his brand of corruption for 74 years. Born with no conscience in the definition of a sociopath.
Protests were beginning to calm when trump sent his "Feds" in.  It caused a dramatic surge in tension. They weren't needed nor invited! He only did this to look good for his base, not to help BLM.   He's pure evil!   What if the violent rioters are trump's men too? At all sites?
And these paid thugs are from Trump who is a Russian asset.  Next argument???

It was a black swan event. The WHO originally stated it didn't transmit human&gt;human. 'Wear no masks,' was the initial advice. NY politicians &amp; others supported a variety of crowd based celebrations. It was an overall "what we worry" from most politicians. It wasn't just Trump.
I this makes my skin crawl. It us such a vile piece of propaganda by Trump.

Carlson is wrong, of course. It will still exist. Biden is good, but he is not superhuman. A superhuman effort would result in convincing Trump‚Äôs America that they have been misguided and that it‚Äôs time to latch onto what America should be. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen.

I haven't slept without  fear for almost 4 years.  I swear we are all, the entire nation, is going to have some level of PTSD and need some forms of therapy after Trump leaves office.  I hope there is  a plan for mental health when Biden takes office.
Yes HE does and your savior Trump couldn‚Äôt quote the Christ to save his own life without a cheat sheet, and then it‚Äôs still a iffy.

Help if you can! Elect Kim Mangone and defeat the enabler McCarthy.  He doesn‚Äôt stand for Californians, only for Trump.
Nothing.  You  are still working under the assumption that the President would care for it's citizens.  Yeah, No, Trump doesn't give a shit about any of us.
On Trump's lawyers and CRIME FAMILY?
Yes, but because there are so many issues, the protests are BLM, ending police brutality, free speech, standing up to Trump.
Thank you President Trump! Biden wants to start a program where prescriptions are mail ordered to your home.  Lol
They know, the ones that don't care, are Trump supporters.
It's time to change it up.  Trump is seeking confrontation, switch the narrative.  Do all the singing, dancing drumming, peaceful protest, but then walk away about 9 p.m.  Get off the streets before it gets dark.  They want those confrontations at night. Don't play their game.
true enough, but democrats need to quit being republican lite. I am not a trump fan, but I need m4a more than I need anything

Obama killed re-importation and medicare for all. Don't let partisanship blind you. If Trump goes all-in on Medicare for All, he will win in a landslide

It's been reported that the majority of the "protesters" in Portland are white. Do we know whether these are even BLM people or if they are right wing infiltrators sent in to make the real protesters look bad? Something really stinks about this! trump &amp; Barr is behind it all.
When red states began surging trump finally shows an interest in Covid.   As long as it was blue states and people of color dying, his attitude was fuck'em.    He has all ages, races, genders and Republicans dying now, and it's TOO LATE TO STOP IT!  You are a murderer, trump!
