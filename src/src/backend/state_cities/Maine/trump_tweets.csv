It is as if bully Trump has now imposed a tax on our own citizens by assessing this idiocy upon Canada, as the USA does not produce enough aluminum for our country. Trump is a lunatic.
Trudeau is an honorable man unlike lunatic Trump. Canada, please forgive us. You are our treasured ally. Our embarrassment is great. 🇺🇸🇨🇦
Trump’s stupidity will cost Americans again. Canada can impose dollar for dollar tariffs to meet Trump’s nastiness. We were allies until Bullyboy Trump bulldozed his way to the presidency. Canada pities us now.

So far this feels like 2004, when the Dems had full-blown BDS and nominated an unlikable stiff. Now the Dems are seem to have a lot more hate for Trump than any enthusiasm for Biden.
The only reason people have attacked the integrity of  is because she's been dishonest, especially since Trump was elected.

No one should ever listen to trump on any subject ever, except how to use the office of the President of the United States for personal and familial gain.

Why is tRump even still in office. He is clearly unable to lead, to help, to resolve, to president. #25thAmendmentNow or impeach again or whatever it takes. He cannot stay. #RemoveTrumpNow
No, no ...he got it wrong...Satan created IMPOTUS to see how fast he could corrupt everything in tRump’s path.

I love how these idiot Trump supporters love to believe the victims when it comes to Biden and Clinton but conveniently ignore the victims when it’s Trump.
Hmm, ok. But I wonder what are those ‘normal processes’ (no postmarks in...Dem cities, perhaps?) And didn’t Trump assert only FL where the USPS was ‘built up’ could handle high volume of ballots?
Im seeing a lot of people's takeaway from this thread is that voting doesn't matter, and that Biden is the same as Trump. I hope people can realize the trickle-down impact that the policies set by the government in charge have on everyone. Things like supreme Court justices.
The big bad orange racist monster is quite capable of proving that he's a big bad orange racist monster just by opening his mouth. No manipulation required. And white supremacists hurt minorities with or without Trump's existence. It's kind of their whole deal.
Jassica Talov what has Joe Biden done for the African American and for all people in 50 yrs in congress give me one thing , 8yrs as Vice President , you want me to tell you , nada you no what that means ? President Trump as done more in 3 yrs than all dmocrats in office..

Ohio Republicans turn on Trump: ‘We will not make the same mistake this November’ -
They haven't been any of those things for YEARS.  Clinton cleaned up the Reagan/Bush mess, Obama cleaned up Bush's mess, and Biden will have to clean up Trump's. How many times will Americans be fooled by these con men?
Hey   Trying to dissuade African American voters from voting for Joe Biden to vote for Trump is like asking them to return to a Jim Crow America.  Because that’s what a second Trump term would look like.  Not gonna happen.
Trump fights with everyone, he’s not sane and needs to be voted out!

What are the percentage rates of infection. NYS 1%. Florida is 20% so on. Trump needs common sense.
The first thing that struck me, of course in comparison to the malignant narcissist in chief, was how Biden listened. I don’t recall tRump listening in any way that wasn’t just to calculate how he was going to either kill the messenger or soak up adoration and use it to boast.

I think it’s obvious that the lazy hateful Democrats socialists are doing their best to destroy our country and take down President Trump how horrible they will do anything to ruin our president❗️

Yeah, if it's OK for the president to misappropriate funds from his charity it's gotta be OK for us, right? Oh wait, it wasn't OK for trump? Says who? Oh, Says the attorney General of New York... well, we're different, right? Right?
I don’t ever remember seeing so many articles warning everyone to not be an entire cockparade to an as-yet-unannounced VP candidate.  All it says is the media/internet is aware that it sucks &amp; fully intends to Hillary this woman &amp; re-elect Trump. But it feels real bad about it.

How can we elect someone who isn’t Biden or Trump? Is there a way?
Are there any Democrats that are actually dumb enough to vote for Kanye? I thought all the dumb Americans were planning on voting for Trump.
To understand Trump, you need to recognize that his pressers, wherever they occur, are always set up so that the wind blows from right to left, across his face, so that the hair-sprayed frisbee of bleach blond hair atop his bald pate remains largely frozen in place.
Good. Let trump and his train wreck administration flap in the breeze and self-destruct through their own stupidity and incompetence.  American voters will just watch and count the days to November 3rd when we will end this nightmare.
We were talking about orangeade earlier. I think ‘simple orange’ fits Trump down to a T.
it’s not about “would you wait in a line for 8 hours to vote out trump” its “can you wait in a line for 8 hours to vote out trump”
More of trump's "policy by petulance." Trump has no real understating of trade or economics.  He is a corrupt real estate salesmen and free lance huckster, selling everything from board games to neck times to fraudulent universities. All have failed.  He act by personal feelings.
If you grow up in Queens that’s how we pronounce it. Picky. Picky. Picky. Find something of substance to point out. It’s not hard to do with Trump.
This made me think. Pres. Trump thinks highly of himself. Very highly. Like self deification highly. So “hurt the Bible, hurt God...he’s against God”, is his clumsy way of complaining that Joe B intends crack him in his sweaty orange mouth.  And not alone with the God complex....
Wait til you find out where all the tax payer money went in the 32 or so years prior to Trump taking office. You will be incredibly grateful for what he’s done.
Because he's taking orders from Trump.
Hardly surprising that the greedy, carnival barking evangelical fakirs and phonies have embraced a faux president and faux christian. trump is a treasonous grifting fascist.

There are hundreds of ways to dress it up.  Nobody would even tweet about it, let alone notice it, if Trump had said this.  It does not make it an OK thing to say, but it does make it absolutely irrelevant in the context of this campaign.
I remain gobsmacked that a single human being could cast a vote for trump after all we know and have seen.
In fact, he is in favor of free trade, isn't he? And he has a word, doesn't he? And he understands the world, doesn't he? And he is a "very stable genius," right?  #TradeWarAreGoodAndEasyToWin #protectionism   via

Joe Biden should challenge Trump to a debate on religion.
These always make me fill up with tears.  That is ok. I feel the pain and will continue to work to vote Trump out. ❤️
Trump passed the buck. L he spoke against the doctors on his staff, said he wouldn’t be wearing a mask, pushed a drug that doesn’t work, and then said it’s on the governors to make the decisions. Then he talked shit on the governors decisions. Told people to rebel against them.
respect to your grandparents but you’re still stating it as fact for the vast majority. That really isn’t something you can claim. Everyone’s opinion is valid, but we can’t speak for everyone. Just because my family doesn’t think trump is racist, doesn’t mean he is / isn’t.
I just did a google search for any hearings, indictments, prosecutions, criminal investigations regarding President Obama and spying on the campaign (not incoming President as is being alleged) of Trump and nothing came up.  What government agency are you getting your info from?

So true yet Obama is a saint while Trump is to blame for everything!!!
Really religion? Biden is a real Catholic. A church going one. Trump isn’t religious and doesn’t go to church. Just another Trump lie
oh boy I'm rich ,trump is trying to stop the election by hiring another idiot,who is causing USPS to go on tilt,because of his fear of votes for Biden,so when do i.pick.up my money?
The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act Offset a temporary payroll tax cut with spending reductions in unemployment compensation, Medicare physician payments, and other health provisions. That legislation decreased the deficit, Trump's would increase the deficit again.
sadly it doesn't matter, to the Christian Right, being *white* rather than *Christian* matters, Trump has never read the Bible, Hillary started every day of her campaign with a Bible lesson/reflection, they voted overwhelmingly for Trump.
How’s this an interview? There were no hard questions. It was just a chance for Trump to say what he wanted to say and pat himself in the back as usual. Would’ve hoped Geraldo was a better journalist than that!
I liked Obama!  I have hated Trump for many years.
Remember when Trump was asked his favorite bible verse and literally couldn’t name a single one

This poll also has interesting numbers on the presidential race here: In the 1st Congressional District, Biden leads Trump 61-30. In the 2nd, Trump has a slim 45-44 edge. Remarkable split and a sign of how different, politically, those two districts have become.
as someone who lives in maine, im especially excited about this new batch  polling:  - Sen: Gideon 48%, Collins 45% - Pres: Biden 53%,  Trump 43%  W/ Biden at 50+1% this could leave Gideon well positioned in a potential RCV runoff
He just wanted an excuse to not meet with Trump
We know trump went to Epstein's Island and lived just down the street from him for decades and partied with him for decades
I guess I don't understand that given these poll numbers Collins has been so reluctant to speak out on  Trump. It seems like there is only upside to doing it.
Joe Biden is a sincere and observant Catholic. Trump once reacted to being offered communion at Presybterian church—his alleged denomination—by putting money on the tray.
Trump was anti segregation while Biden fought for it.  Educate yourself and don't be a sheep

we're already shocked and appalled at -- Trump &amp; his sick cabinet, executive power grabs, stacked courts, Barr's obstruction of justice, lack of Congressional oversight and subpoena power. The GOP Senators are corrupt traitors Share the Senate Intel with us!👇
Funny how people always tie Obama to bombings and not Trump. Trump literally broke the record in bombings last year
Yes this happened, but let’s also discuss the record breaking amount of bombings last year under Donald Trump. Every US president drops bombs non stop. It’s disgusting. War is disgusting
Tell MR Trump to ask him what city they are in about half hour into the debate I guarantee you he will not remember
The level of corruption in our government is so high, that I'm not sure that we can clean the swamp. Trump deserves to be in jail, along with his children, but I'm not sure he'll ever get there. The GOP that went to Russia last July 4th are dirty too, but greed rules them all.
Do a web search using the parameters 'trump backstage teen beauty pageant' you'll find a dozen different stories
There are no credible charges against me, trump, on the other hand has literally dozens   But you refuse to even look at those, even when he admits to them
We've been asking that since trump announced his candidacy
I guess, to me, I cannot wrap my head around people's blind obsession with this guy. To some of these Trump dick riders he can literally do no wrong. Where did this originate from? When I was growing up I never encountered such mania for a President lol.
Trump trying to hold on to all his campaign cash to launder to himself and family knowing he’s gonna lose.
If I busted my ass in undergrad and grad school to become a politician/eventual president and then someone like Trump wins an election &amp; Kanye West makes it on to ballots I’d feel sooooo disrespected
Trump is a death machine. Everyone around him dies. It's what happens when you value money more than human life.
A fake fonz.  Objectively trump is not (and has never been) a handsome man. This little fake “DA” is a failed attempt to give him some cool, bad-boyness like The Fonz had.   But, like The Fonz, trump has “jumped the shark...”
Trump would lie about what he had for lunch... to someone who ate with him.

Yeah agree, I think Trump should of been impeached after he let Puerto Rico die after the hurricane Maria. Just saying if he someone is this human trafficking ending hero, awesome.
Abortion rates went down under Clinton and Obama, as birth control was more available, and unwanted pregnancies went down. Trump et al want to limit birth control and limit abortion. That is the root of the issue. You cannot have both.
"Trump falsely says..." PERIOD!!! Why?!?  Why is no one putting a stop to this?!?
Agree but reserve right to change mind if Q is actually real and Trump will be successful in brining down world human trafficking ring. Not holding breath though.

That doesn’t matter to Trump because all of his wives must have thought he has mental problems.
Trump's going away. Things go away. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
DOJ  says they won’t indict a sitting president, that doesn’t mean NY can’t do so. It would be contested, but that will be true of everything going forward. Trump isn’t looking to win, just to invalidate the results.

Nixon was Gandhi compared to Trump.
Really? What  an idiot. Right now trump has been doing as terrible a job as leader as he is with the coronavirus trying to convince us he’s doing great. 1000k deaths dly , he has done a very very poor job. Hes even been impeached for lying about his attempt to get dirt on Biden.
I’m so glad I blocked her after I saw her dancing to Fudge Donald Trump.
Yes trump answers questions but let’s look at the truth to his answers, something he has a hard time doing even through this pandemic he says things are getting better. Liar In chief

Michelle Obama says no to public office, but fans still want her as vice president  PLEASE YES MRS OBAMA - there’s no way Trump could beat Biden if you were his running mate. Not only would you be the first women President, but the first Black Women POTUS.

Clyburn claims Trump won’t leave office quietly, military might have to step in  #FoxNews- stop that’s nonsense. Even Trump is not that crazy to have military remove him from the WH. He would be the laughing stock of the world. Just another attempt by Dems
Actually, he said he's "forward looking" to them.  Guarantee if there are any debates at all, there won't be a 2nd because the 1st will be such a disaster for Biden that his "team" won't allow him to go another round with Trump.
Fauci should resign.  Trumps deplorables are dangerous and they will not mask or listen to reason. Trumps admin doesn’t deserve him.  He can resign and one of the networks could give him an hour a day to say everything Trump censors.

Why doesn't Trump go to Mar-a-Lago to give his acceptance speech. It's his home in Florida, isn't it. That's the info I'm finding on the web. Or Camp David?
The locker hypothesis is interesting. We can imagine that Trump asked one of his minions to provide numbers on the pandemic because, he said, "I want a reason to lock Biden up."

I also realy just admire how carefully the media has avoided calling Trump a liar for peddling conspiracy theories for years, but when Biden calls it he’s wrong to spread such misinformation &amp; no retraction will ever be given.  All the while mostly ignoring the USPS crisis
That liberal media, I tell you what.  Calling Biden ridiculous &amp; conspiratorial for saying Trump would try to move the election &amp; mess with the post office months ago.  Not apologizing now or offering positivity about a candidate predicting his opponent’s every move.  Good work!
#girlboss culture has rotted liberal brains. you know how liberals keep saying that we're going to have to 'hold biden/harris accountable'? this is what it looks like. a consumer advocate putting pressure on an elected official is doing their job. she has the power here.
Why because he tells the truth about no questions Biden?
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama as they CLARLY can’t seem to see “Eye to Eye”.  Read on &amp; YOU be the judge.

The liar on the ticket. 🎤 Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
I agree that most of the media is a PR arm, but he's a befuddled old man whose racism washed out decades ago. The real problem with Biden is that he's still on the wrong side of the class war.

Ps he is not the same.  He won’t sabotage the USPS, he won’t coddle dictators, he won’t enrich himself through his office, he will implement a national plan to deal with COVID19 Biden is very different from Trump, and the fate of the nation requires that he be elected.
I’m confused. Trump said Biden has been taking away the dignity of police and they would be getting it back on Nov. 3.  Trump has been president for almost 4 years.  If he hasn’t been able to give them back their dignity yet, how does he think he can do it on Nov. 3?
Political Humor.  COP A FEEL, the  slogan for the Harris-Biden campaign. Compliments to Eric during The Jimmy Dore Show.
I don’t think Biden is a racist (not since the 90s anyway). He would end this Trumpian/GOP nightmare and enact some reforms. Yea, not to our standard, but at least we wouldn’t have a homicidal psyhopath as president
Political Humor. If Biden moves to the left, he could break a hip. Compliments of The Jimmy Dore Show.
I’m all for criticizing Biden/Harris but not by suggesting they’re no better than Trump

Then I guess the establishment should have moved further toward the progressive goal post. I’m not giving my vote to someone just because I hate the incumbent. If Biden needed the progressive vote he should have offered up more than he did. (Which was NOTHING)

Not quite.  At his current lead, Biden will take both the popular vote and the E.C.  This isn't Hillary's lead.
Gore was not my candidate. McGovern was not my candidate. Kerry was not my candidate. Biden was not my candidate. Every single one of them way better than their general election opponents. (Btw., you said the Supreme Court elected Bush and then you demonstrated it was you.)
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
It should not have been close enough for the Supreme Court to put Bush in office. Yes Gore had weaknesses (Pssst so does Biden), but Gore would never have taken the USA to war in Iraq. Gore would have addressed climate change.
You idiots need to get a grip. The protests may even fizzle out once Biden is elected and we have an administration that will work to benefit all Americans.

I really hope Biden / Harris win so I can constantly run off at the mouth about how much I hate them.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris delivered an aggressive one-two attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, as they made their election case for the first time as running mates.
No.  Trump / Pence is sad.   Now we have a chance to live.  We should be grateful and rejoice for good people instead of worrying about their beliefs, and Biden demonstrates his deep faith.  I’m Catholic and I’m happy.  I feel sorry for you.
I was driving and clapped a lot!!!  Is it wrong to be happy to hear normal humans speak? Is it wrong to hear someone talk about uniting this country? Wtf have we had to listen too?  Biden/Harris 2020
If Joe Biden had picked Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms as his VP, he would have had the most iconic campaign name in American electoral history
fuck joe biden
what do you think of biden’s vp pick — anyone but trump
If Bernie was more popular than Biden, this wouldn’t have hurt him, it would have given him clear path to victory.... unfortunately the majority of the party voters didn’t want him..
It’s not... but you can’t see what happened with the Bernie blinders on. Sucks.  On the bright side, Harris voted with Bernie over 90% of the time..  I trust Biden and Harris to do a better job than we have gotten over the last 3 plus years of hell.
Jeanine Porto suggests something will happen to Biden before the election and he won’t be the nominee. Others on Fox have to walk back her comments. That woman is bat💩crazy.
No one dares laugh at Trump. That gives him power.  Biden will laugh &amp; suddenly everyone’s chest will be less tight because laughing at power IS power.  It’s the thing Biden can do that no one else can. Watch his debate with Ryan. It’s the laughter that wins. Chief. Malarkey. Son
Hillary couldn’t do it bc women play by different rules bc life is garbage. Also people already hated her.  No other D candidate gets away with it like Biden does because Uncle Joe means well &amp; America knows it. They know him.  So yeah he’s gonna tell Trump he’s full of shit
Everyone got so mad that Biden said that (ringer, w/ NRA ties) guy who yelled at him about guns was full of shit.  You don’t get it. That’s the only kind of thing that works with Trump &amp; however many of his voters can be moved at all.  He’s gonna say something similar to Trump
There is absolutely no political argument or policy debate or gotcha moment that can phase Trump. He has no morals, he doesn’t care, consistency is nothing.  But Biden will laugh &amp; call it bullshit &amp; that does get through. Fascists must be serious. They cannot take anything less.
It’s a superpower because Biden can laugh at his opponent and come off genuine and kind, like grandpa watching you fuck up. He doesn’t come across as a dick, he just seems right.  Trump won’t have an audience to pump him up &amp; Joe will laugh at him like the joke he is.
I keep thinking about the debates &amp; ive heard all the doom-moaning but I think they’ll be amazing  Biden has a superpower. You can’t get Trump on facts or morals. He doesn’t care  Biden’s gonna laugh in his face just like he did to Ryan. THAT he can’t stand. That goes to his core
Finally, leaders that listen to medical experts for a medical problem. As I write this, I am still in disbelief that we have to look outside the current administration for this kind of leadership. Voting for Biden/Harris will save thousands of lives. Vote BLUE4LIFE Vote RED4DEATH
As a life long Alaskan/Mainer who lives off grid &amp; and a lifelong responsible gun owner, I’m absolutely voting for Kamala/Biden.  These tweets are trash &amp; the NRA is disgusting.  I wish more responsible gun owners would stand the fuck up.  Common sense gun laws are COMMON SENSE
I'm an astrophysics major and I support biden.
My uncle called Biden/Harris lying leftists and this was my brother’s response, which has helped me realize how far behind progressives are here in the USA
Innocent thought my butt. What the hell happened to you.Os it in important for Americans to see how the Presidential candidates respond to questions?There has been legit questions regarding Biden’s mental acuity. At a debate, he could put those questions 2 bed or not.U R shameful

Joe Biden did not run in 2016.
Unfollowing any dumbshit supporting Biden/Harris
okay but people can still be critical of Harris and Biden even if they vote blue  because treating them like "saviors" would risk allowing them to get away with a lot, simply because "at least they aren't 45"  it's okay to have high standards and keep them there
This is sick and frightening...it's almost a threat to Biden!!
Were you upset today when Biden pronounced it exactly the same?
And by the way, I really liked your vomit joke when it came towards the Joe Biden and Kamla Harris thing. 🤣🤣😂😂😂. I was LMBO!!
And of course, we should all vote and GOTV for Biden like our lives depend on it. Etc, etc.
The DNC never cared about the South. And then, they didn’t care about Northern Union Workers. We use Biden and Harris to get past Trump, then we transform the Democratic Party into a more progressive, climate minded, socially equitable political system.
Republicans are really reaching. Nothing they say about Biden sticks. Kamala confuses them. They've got nothing. #TheReidOut
I think it would be fun to watch Biden attempt  saying that slogan.....”you know the thing”🤣
Joe Biden could have chosen the most effective VP in 100 years.  The fact that he *didn’t*—despite all the evidence—doesn’t speak well for his judgment.
My mother and I used to call each other #mamala so when  said that today it brought back fond memories for this jewish grandma.   Was so proud of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris today! They have my vote! #BidenHarris2020Landslide

Lol that time Joe Biden was at my first holy communion (his granddaughter was in my Sunday school class), and my grandma fan girled him and told him she voted for him
You can't just vote, you need to rally your followers to do what the Judy Jacobs Central Oyster Bay Democratic Club is doing. We're contacting the Biden campaign to do remote phone banking for the swing States. Our votes in NY are not going to make a difference in PA, MI,WI, etc
if ur a liberal or socialist. shut up i hate u vote for biden and call it a day. ur just as bad as the right
Kudos to you  for giving little girls, especially black and brown girls, a sense that all is possible and maybe one day, they will grow up to be president. Thank you Joe Biden ❤️❤️❤️❤️

You would have to be an idiot to blame Trump for all of the jobs lost. What? Should we not have locked down and saved thousands of lives? The Democrats seem to believe this. If America elects Biden he will destroy this country and many more Americans will die.

I don’t think Michelle would want Biden to pull her down.  But she might be Harris pick for VP  when joe is forced out and Harris takes lead
I'm really excited about the possibilities of a Biden / Harris administration and the progress we can make on #ClimateAction and environmental justice. Who kicked VWs butt for falsifying emissions data?
With a Biden/Harris ticket, the Democratic Party has gone mask off and proudly proclaimed that they dont care about us working class folks.  So we invite you to go mask off with us and proudly fight for an equitable socialist future. Join us.
The giddiness CNN and MSNBC show regarding Biden and Harris is vomit inducing in comparison to the unfair and vile treatment of Trump
If Americans know anything about Joe Biden from the Obama era, it's that he's a...checks notes...radical extremist?
This is a weird take...Biden literally said he was going to pick a black woman, which makes the choice not based solely on merit, and eliminates a massive number of qualified people, Mr. “Acheive Legend” isn’t racist for pointing that out
I am thrilled! Kamala Harris is an intelligent and mature leader. We need her!!!!! Go Kamala!
You’re killing me! Best comedy routine in a long time! Biden/Harris
"please name 3 planks in the Biden-Harris platform"  "sweaty 👏 they're 👏 not 👏 Hitler 👏"

Love this message👍🏻I find it so inspiring that these fed up Repubs are changing their course on Trump and his Administration to vote with with us on Nov 3rd! We will win this election 😜 BIDEN AND HARRIS🇺🇸👊🏽

Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris today:
I feel that Biden's choice to exclude all men for his VP pick is sexist. I feel that is a very bad message to be sending. Sexism to the other extreme, benefiting the other sex, is frankly, still sexism.  No?  Yes, I get it, white men have the upper hand over women in these roles.
I never have the popular opinion so I apologize in advance for the eyeroll you are likely to have after reading what I 'for whatever reason' have to get off my chest.  Let me start with hell yes-I will be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket in November - but I am sad.  A thread
I love Kamala Harris as VP, she seemed very sharp during the Democratic debates. Biden/Harris have my vote! 🇺🇸
Darn right ✅ about that one. Why is he feeling sorry 😞 for Joe Biden?  Talking about kamala was nasty to Joe.  He should listen to himself talking about nasty.
VP Biden I was so happy you entered the Presidential race. You had my vote up till yesterday, as a Baby Boomer &amp; Middle Class citizen I can no longer vote for you picking a socialist as your running mate. In fact if a large majority of Baby Boomers votes this year Trump wins.

Biden lost the election once he picked a socialist as his running mate.
not only black voters.   older black voters and middle class voters voted biden.   younger black voters and poor voters voted bernie.   young people just vote in less numbers than old people. this isn’t new information, it just doesn’t fit the clean narrative
Yeah we all know it’s Kamala running for President, it’s a waiting game of when Biden will resign, I give it till Mid June 2021 if, big IF, he is elected.
did i say black people were the establishment? no.  who’s VP is she? joe biden, a white guy who she attacked for being kind to segregationists less than a year ago. i ment centrist establishment.
I don’t blame anyone for being unenthusiastic about voting for Biden, I’m not. Unfortunately with RBG’s SC seat opening realistically soon another Kavanaugh could be a serious danger to many people’s civil liberties.
He needs to see the notarized contract, witnessed by a rabbi, between trump and Kanye, otherwise it just cannot be true. On the other hand, I bet he believes Hillary/baby trafficking and Biden being a sex demon

I live in the suburbs. My wife thinks you are as popular as dog crap. Good luck on your idea that she’s gonna vote for ya. Biden Harris 2020.
i mean joe biden can say he’s for the GND and i can say i can fly......but we all know that shit ain’t happening. and this kind of measly mouthed bull shit is getting old really fucking quick
Biden is very smart. He is basically playing out the clock
Vote in person. Elect Biden.  I'd say that's the simplest plan.
who's more racist her or biden?
Knowing me when I have the ballot in my hand I’ll probably concede and tick the Biden box anyway...  This fucking sucks.
I agree. It doesn’t do anything. NY is going to Biden Harris and my not voting for them does nothing besides make me feel better.
Harris has all indications of covering every minority voters wish,I think optimism may be in store for us poor Democrats,ha ha,GOP must be having trouble finding a V.P. now that Biden has blown his mind with Harris
get off your high horse, there is a reason biden went from 40% in the polls down to 10% before winning &amp; Kamala dropped out before any primaries happened.   i obviously prefer them over Trump &amp; holding elected officials to account is what you are supposed to do.
I confess I don’t quite get why the E in Biden is emphasized in the logo?   Is it for “Elect”? “Election?” “Excellence?” “Equality?”   “Eleganza?”
people who don’t understand that in politics you are supposed to hold people to account. so people that are upset about Biden Harris ticket are allowed to be upset(it’s a horrible ticket) but as long as everyone realizes the real goal is removing Trump from office
The number of times I have seen people hiss at Biden for saying he’d pick a woman because that wasn’t picking the most qualified person and men would be passed over…far too high
I won’t be voting for Biden Harris. Sorry. I’ll vote dem down ballot but NY is going to go to Biden anyway so the least I can do is make myself feel a little better with a useless display of contention against this.
I'm a progressive who isn't thrilled about Biden or Harris, but I know they're way better than Trump &amp; Pence.  So, I donated to both to    And to  which is trying to bring #RankedChoiceVoting to MA:
If you are progressive and disappointed with #Biden, ask:  -which President will respect our collective power to organize?  -which President can we more likely influence?  -which Judicial appointments will honor equal rights?  -which administration would have most accountability?
Biden is a Republican.
Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
Agreed, Biden should not. No upside. Let trump et. al rage and sputter and whine and yell. The more he does the more unhinged, unstable, erratic, petty, mean, and frankly delusional, trump appears.
My only hope is that if the debates go on, every time Trump or Pence say anything that we know to be pure BS, Biden or Harris just say "roll the tape" and fact check them in real time. They
Cancel Culture is cancelling statues because they represent men who owned slaves, but is okay with Biden and Kamala who’s family owned slaves.
I too am upset not to have  on the ticket. But her spot was at the top of the ticket. I have already processed my disappointment. Knowing she has Biden’s ear &amp; her policies will be championed is enough. And you know what is even more important? Being 💯for Biden!
Trumps attacks on Harris will backfire. Harris is more popular among Republicans than Biden is and attacking a female candidate in the manner he has will alienate the rest of the suburban female voters who support him and Kamala fights back hard.
Most of the “Kamala is the safe pick” stories I’ve read don’t mention a thing about her policy ideas (who has any idea what those are? Or even really cares?). It’s all “she’s a pick who won’t lose Biden suburban white votes”
Im so happy Biden chose
Also! She’s actually left of Biden on weed and a bunch of other things! She’s the 2nd most progressive senator and votes with Bernie 93% of the time. This is a win for progressives. She’s been smeared her whole career, as almost all women in politics have.
imma feel real dirty voting for Biden and Harris but this mf pedo cheeto needa get the fuck outta office 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Democrats’ greatest recent success was brought about not by progressives who retained Democratic seats, but by centrists taking seats held by Republicans." &lt;~ We don't need to turn protesters into voters, but Reps into Dems. Move center. #BidenHarris2020
Yeah as you vote for Biden
We live in Maine’s 1st district which is safe blue anyway. I’m not voting for Biden. I will never vote for an abuser.
We could have had a Sanders/Abrams ticket but instead we have a Biden/Harris and consequently will lose in November. Very left leaning people won’t compromise their vote, for better or worse. Though I’ll vote for Biden begrudgingly, I can’t really blame them.
Wall Street can’t wait for Kamala to push Biden into taxing trading transactions!
Biden people don’t do boats. They’re into lockstep.
If Biden claims he is Catholic publicly and uses it in his campaign and stand against the moral teachings of the church he should be criticized.  I’m not aware that Trump has voice belonging to any denomination.
We are going to see what happens after Biden wins.  I'm predicting the Baby Steps approach so as not to offend their corporate donors.  End Citizens United, enact term limits, reign in the Military Industrial Complex and the Political Industrial Complex

the United States in the event of Biden's death. We are in the middle of a financial crisis which requires the most competent business people, not these lame, insipid politicians.
Electing Biden is the first step toward ANY leftward movement and without it we are lost. There was no way to rocket from Trump that far to the left, this country just isn’t there, the majority want stability after experiencing blowing up the system.
Joe Biden is Catholic. And he also thinks that the guy in the robes with the funny hat in the front of the church is God.
The best argument for Harris on CJ is she seems to have changed her positions but like Biden she chose the strategy of insisting that no, she's actually been consistent and good the entire time. Unlike someone like Gillibrand who admitted that her past was bad.
I don't see a world in which Biden signs something to deny my ability to get healthcare, or to allow jobs to fire me for who I am. Trump has done one already. I'm certain he would do the other. In more ways than one, I'm voting for my life.
leave that Trump/Biden poll up for awhile today...after 5pm please...that’s when most Trump supporters will answer...they can’t right now...they’re working.
Kamala Harris will be the first Woman and Woman of color as USA President if Biden wins.  He probably won't remember where the White House 🏡 is located.  Happy a native Oaklander is on the ticket.  Maybe she can make Oakland safe again
Wow, your hate for Trump is really strong today. If you think so highly of Biden, you shouldn’t have any problem seeing him in a debate with Trump. That shouldn’t even be a contest, right? Don’t you want to show the world what a great candidate he is?
a SLAY QUEEN and KING who are backing BIDEN/HARRIS in 2020!  This absolutely isn’t a damning indictment of the state of American electoral politics!
Beware the ‘Secret Biden / Harris Voters’; they’re out there despite the polls.
Let me help you with this: Racist white women will be voting for me. They are scared of black people and thrilled that I am willing to be openly racist and not let black people invade their neighborhood. Biden picked Senator Harris, black. Corey Booker is also black, be afraid!
NPR is actually lying  If reelected, Trump will forgive any need to repay  Would Biden demand repayment?  Trump had to do an Executive Order, because congress wouldn't DO THEIR JOB  So don't look to NPR for news, it's propaganda for DNC
In the same world where men can get pregnant and Biden has all his faculties.
Excitement is building from this morning's Best PR Headline thus far: "National Banana Split Day is just two weeks away!" Everybody and his uncle is tweeting about Biden's VP pick, but remember you read about banana splits here first.
You can’t put Kamala and Biden into a simple hoodie romance, it is far more complicated than that and to be honest you are demeaning the suffering the black community has gone through of at least 40 years of their reign including mass incarceration, do better
So why are we taken down statues? If symbolism matters why do we have both Biden and Kamala slave owners? Why not have someone who is #ADOS  that would truly send a messages
Biden’s family were also slave owners and I’m sure the media would’ve tracked down on Trump and Pence by now, but I can’t find anything online about it. So yeah, if symbolism matters why take down statues? Why have 2 people who’s family owned slaves? Why not have an actual #ADOS

Me too! I understand the Biden perspective much better since I've been diagnosed with leukemia. I'm grateful for all the good work they did with the ACA. Trump undermined it, Biden/Harris will grow it.
Look at the Biden/Harris healthcare platform. It's moving in the direction you want. It wasn't easy to get the ACA, we shouldn't throw it away, when we can grow it and make it better.
Y’all preach equality then you get on here give the people a false narrative. Kamala Harris was just calling joe Biden a racist during debates. Now you on here supporting Jb bringing in her for minority votes. Man all y’all niggas deep state lmao.
This is the weakest and most corrupt ticket that the Dems have ever put up.  They're going to get crushed.
Biden/Harris have an extremely progressive social platform, the most progressive Democratic platform ever. Be happy. Be hopeful.

Give me a break. There’s nothing we haven’t heard before. What I mean is if it hasn’t hurt Biden already, it’s not going to damage him now.
I really think that’s what’s gonna happen. Biden just doesn’t seem “all there” anymore.
why aren’t we allowed to criticize the shitty option the democratic party gave us? when ARE we allowed to criticize her or biden?
This is 100% the truth. The same way Biden brought in Sanders supporters to form platform ideas after a tough primary. Biden just seems a decent person who is open to growth and change. It’s quite a contrast...
Kamala Harris, whom expected Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday as his running mate, said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault.  “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage”
so with a Biden/Harris ticket I’m curious on your thoughts about the possibility of the legalization of cannabis? Ty...
It does not matter who is VP. Should Biden win, there will be a team of Obamettes in the White House making all decisions. Neither Biden nor Harris will be anything but window dressing. We, as a nation, are going to spend an extraordinary amount of time and energy uselessly. DJT!
Biden-Harris is a great ticket for America. Excited for Kamala Harris because she's very qualified. I'm a pre-Trump conservative who wants to save our democracy with any ally willing to help good people and she carries that human spirit into every battle.
We have to win before anything else matters. And I believe Biden wants to do right.  Are you happy to let Trump’s people stay where they are?

Joe Biden owes Jim Clyburn so much. #Maddow
Eric Trump Used Robin Williams To Attack Joe Biden? Oh Hell No
Agree. Biden at least has some experience digging is out of an economic hellscape.
I think she’d wait, unless Biden/Harris  turn out to be a disaster
President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have won their parties’ presidential primaries in Connecticut Tuesday:
It’s very important to Distinguish that Kamala is not African American, she is Indian and Jamaican, most importantly she is not #Ados and even more important, both Biden and Kamala Harris Family all owned African American Slaves! Nice pick America 😡
President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have won their parties’ presidential primaries in Connecticut Tuesday:
I really like her but honestly I want Biden to put her in charge of a voter suppression task force or something. Head of the FEC?
Rove is correct. Keep it about Biden #Hannity
It's not a contract. But baptism and his progression through the sacraments confers certain rights. Biden can have a Catholic burial, for example. Chief among them, however, is that the theology of baptism means no dude on the internet gets to say you aren't a Catholic.
Even if Tobin could excommunicate Biden for any of this—which is absurd—Tobin is the bishop of RHODE ISLAND. Meanwhile, upright Catholic that you are, you deny the Pope is the Pope. Beware, the bishop of Borneo is gonna excommunicate you!
Now that the #Veepstakes is over, let’s play another favorite game: “who will  appoint you fill the remainder of  senate term?”
It’s true, and also she didn’t really bring a regional constituency (Kamala doesn’t either tho) and hasn’t won a contested election and didn’t really seem to try to get the job. She didn’t have the experience &amp; I can’t imagine she would have wanted to work with Biden
“Not long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.”  Fact: Harris explicitly did not call Biden racist but she did criticize him during a debate last year for talking about working with two segregationist senators.
Biden doesn’t have dementia and neither does Kamala get a grip
I am psyched to see her meet the moment and shine.  She will appeal to a lot of voters who need inspiration. She is the inspiration to Biden’s empathy.  I am old. I don’t need inspiration just competence, ethics, and integrity.
It’s time. Game on. Enough.  Joe Biden VP pick: Sen. Kamala Harris
I thought the far left didn’t like her because she was a prosecutor? And Biden worked for someone who wasn’t born in Hawaii!!!
the fact that liberals are literally slandering biden like do you want trump again i don’t understand
Everyone POTUS candidate picks someone different from him or her self. As did Biden. It will be a big problems for Rs in terms of her race and gender. And ads will be ok with the pick.
Great op-ed by my ⁦ colleague ⁦ on selection of ⁦ as VP candidate.

Biden is never getting on a stage with Trump. Something will prevent it.
Purity tests SUCK. Read some history: Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. Nixon created the EPA. You think Biden/Harris won't seize the moment? You just want to label people in your mind -- it's regressive, and ultimately has more in common with racism and fascism. Do better. 🇺🇸
So wait a minute she basically believes joe Biden is guilty but jumps on his ticket . It’s a disgrace, and shameful

nah forreal, tho. biden really looked us in our faces while fighting for police/prison abolishment and picked the prison industrial goddess??? like, neither side is even trying anymore
I couldn’t be happier. Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party
It is a life and death choice. We vote for Trump who’s Covid response has killed thousands and will continue to kill us or Biden who will follow the science.
Honestly I thought Biden would pick an inanimate carbon rod. Or at the very least Amy Klobaucher.
Melanie is just a wife and mother. She didn’t run for anything. Therefore the way she chose to advance her career is irrelevant. Not true for Kamala Harris, who is set up to 25th Amendment Joe Biden in the first 100 days. 100 hours?
Without question; Biden will serve 2-2.5 years then make way for whoever his running mate would have been

The Dow dropped faster on the news of Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris,  than Kamala would drop to her knees. Which is pretty pretty fast.
Naturally, in 2020, the Dems nominate a sexual harasser and accused rapist for president, and a prosecutor whose spent her career (along with Biden) upholding the prison industrial complex for VP.   Cool.
I think trump is the Great Unifier and Biden will be the vehicle.
Kamala Harris supported joe Biden’s sexual accusers
She supported joe Biden’s sexual accusers !
In my dreams, I see a Biden/Harris administration with a cabibet 💯 of women! #femalecabinet

Big Warren fan and I appreciate what Bernie brings to the table, but I’m already looking to order my Biden-Harris sign.   Just having a little fun on this site for the first time since June 2015.

'Oh Sh*t!' Maya Rudolph Reacts to the Selection of Kamala Harris as Biden's VP
This is the correct view. “Biden at least means well...”
57% of Americans think that Biden will die in office so it’s only right that he picks a VP that is guaranteed to smother him with a pillow

Excommunication can indeed be appealed. Theologically, an unjust excommunication doesn't exist. In any case, Biden hasn't been excommunication; the idea is absolutely absurd. These people wandered off the set of Warrior Nun.

No surprise-trump’s childish name calling &amp; mean spirited attacks on Biden and Harris who will takes us to a better place after we vote November 3rd. “Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride”- Betty Davis, ‘All About Eve’. #BidenHarris2020 #vote
if biden got g checked like this on race  by her and accepted to open up the ticket given the way politicians hold grudges this is a slow step to no more 70 year old white dude presidents
Excommunicated individuals do not become "non-Catholics." The are prohibited from the sacraments and much else, but their baptism is not undone.  Biden has in any case not been excommunicated. But bishops can excommunicate, and various actions can excommunicate you automatically.
Is everyone out there surprised at the Harris VP pick as Biden was ?
Kamala doesn't mind getting that runner up prize as long as Biden sniffs her hair and she can call him 'daddy'. 👀👀👀🤡🤡🤡😆😆😆 #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
I’m looking forward to watching Biden pinch Kamalas ass
Allow me to suggest that Noam Chomsky has borrowed the “wart the hockey” Biden theory from  family
It’s sad that Biden can read?  You guys really have set a low bar. Perhaps the lowest bar ever. Only Donnie could maintain and slide his graceful body under that bar.
Trump campaign blasts ‘phony’ Kamala Harris in ad, says Biden pick reflects ‘extreme agenda’  #FoxNews- the word to describe Is “”” SOCIALIST””””””
Ah yes, "Tough On Crime" "You ain't Black" Biden calling others out on white supremacy.
And what if she answers "no?"   Does that mean people like Biden aren't allowed to evolve?
Kamala Harris, Biden's radical VP pick signals bad news for American workers, economic recovery  #FoxBusiness- sorry Biden you lost my vote- I’ll be dammed to vote for a socialist as your running mate. Biden you a,so are embracing Sanders.
I like her for the most part! I don’t know how I feel about how we she consider criminals like the Boston bomber being able to vote. Or her being on Joe Biden’s side - when she also said she believed the victims of his abuse. She’s fiery and compelling tv for sure🤷‍♂️
Biden got a his token black VP. Choo choo the Dementia train is leaving the station. All the BLM and Antifa can get behind that I bet. Biden's 'roaches' as they call them *respectively* #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden #Kamala #doodoobrownkamalasmealticket
I'm really excited about the Biden Harris ticket! Can I vote yet? I'd mail it in tomorrow to make sure it gets there on time...
Joe Biden was Catholic enough for this moron in 2012, but after Biden's son died now he's not Catholic enough.  And they wonder why no one under 67 comes to mass.
I love Biden. He's awesome. He's got a stutter. You'll get used to it.
by that logic a vote for third party is also a vote for biden so you’re fucking welcome
Leaving aside his sincerity, which you obviously doubt, Biden is a baptized Catholic. Catholic baptism creates an irreversible, ontological change. As a bishop you are obligated to understand that and not deny it. Don't you have a theology degree?
Congrats to the next Vice President of the United States! Joe Biden has made the right choice. Sending you all our support!
If learning Chinese would guarantee that Biden/Harris wins the WH, I would start studying Chinese now. Trump is a moron.

Nonsense. Donald needed a headline to counter Biden's Veep pick. So he made something up. He lied.  Trump has no credibility.
Ralph, do you really think Biden made this decision? Pretty certain the puppet masters of the Democratic Party made it for him.
Check it out, Zach: remember Harris calling out Biden on her own experience w school busing? This was a pick about reconciliation, about learning, about excellence rising to the challenge. So sorry if you don't get that. 🇺🇸

I contributed to Biden in exchange for advance notice of his pick.  Exactly five seconds before. But it felt so good.
Bright side: Biden and Kamala have proven that they can be bullied into more progressive stances if it suits them
I'm so happy and excited too Cher..Kamala was my choice from the start!!#Biden/Harris
We now have a coalition of moderate Republicans, corporate Democrats, miscellaneous Democrats &amp; lndependents who just want Trump out, and progressives who have to join in and want to push policies left. It's a curious party, but Biden &amp; Harris absolutely have to win to save us.
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Kamala may not be my first choice but you can BET i’m voting Biden. The election isn’t about the “perfect candidate” it’s about choosing the person who will take the country forwards, not backwards.
Are you aware of the horrendous things Joe Biden has said and done to people of color?
Really disappointed. Harris has got as many skeletons in her closet as Susan Rice. Rice's closet has virtually been cleaned out by Congress. Will still vote for Joe Biden.
To that end, I feel like Biden and Harris are much more impressionable than our current president. Meaning that the American people have a better chance of getting their wants and voices heard.
Biden/Harris. I'm on board!
Knew Biden was gonna pick Kamala and it still is painful
Biden committed to choosing a woman, and there was significant pressure to choose a woman of color. He had no choice. Kamala was the most popular and powerful VP candidate that qualified and brought geographic distribution -- California. Biden-Harris is a strong team.
Not happy about the forecast for Second Amendment rights, but otherwise I’m fine with Biden/Harris.
Please enjoy if you like slurred speech lies and words pronounced incorrectly naw i'll be enjoying Biden/ Harris 2020 news for real enjoyment
This actually works in their favor if they approach as Biden wanting those around him to challenge his views and give him honest opinions.
I love the Biden/Harris ticket💞💞💞💞💞
Dems are so fake woke but i want trump n pence outta here so biden harris it is 😔✊🏼
I've been BIDEN my time long enough. HARRIS The vice presidential nominee finally!
Wonder if Kamala is going to change Biden’s Diapie..😂.. his doody pants! Lol
She probably already blew Biden to get the VPs spot.
Ok here we go,Biden has picked Harris for his V.P. there's going to some rumbles in trumps jungle,oh the muck is going to fly,the white Supremacists will be congregating,oh let's call The National Guard because trump is inciting riots,all security must have valid documentation

If the VP is meant to be an attack dog, you couldn’t ask for much better than Kamala. She provides energy and charisma Biden needs. I would have preferred Duckworth, who had less baggage, but that’s how elections go.
Funny I was discussing the Maya Rudolph casting last night, and it only enhanced her candidacy. Last summer in Quebec City, a Canadian told  &amp; me that a Biden Harris ticket was perfect &amp; would win. I know you are happy too.

Oops...
I had grown to like Biden's weird font, that almost looks like it should be used for a comedy movie poster or a child's toy. I think this new one is a downgrade.
So,  has announced his VP. The most important thing that means is a new logo. And unlike most presidential campaigns, Biden actually slightly changed it, instead of just adding his VP's name in the same font. The font is now simultaneously less sharp and less fat.
Duke, I’m already making room on my lawn for both a Biden/Harris sign and a Susan Collins sign.
Seriously pardon the pun, I understand you hate Trump and that’s fine but you can’t be excited for Joe Biden ! He will just be a puppet to the party and Kamala is lucky if she doesn’t get her office taken away by Pelosi and Schumer.
This dynamic duo is going to be awesome... who’s ready for the first BIDEN-HARRIS insta live grilled cheese sandwich session? #JoeBiden #mepolitics
I just donated to Biden and Harris!
Shoot. I really had hoped Biden would pick a progressive veep.
the woman who spent her career locking up black men, while giving sanctuary cities to illegal immigrants.   I guess it’s fitting, since Joe Biden helped write the 1994 crime bill that separated black fathers from their families.
I ❤️ when privileged, progressive people complain about the democratic ticket. We don’t have time for your shit right now. Biden/Harris 2020 because having another four years of a dangerous president is not worth putting to chance. Get out of your bubble.

Biden was on the speaker list before being named VP. So was Kaine.
I know this isn’t fair to Susan Rice, but if she is Biden’s VP pick and we have to deal with conservatives relitigating Benghazi AGAIN, I will scream.
Biden may make some gestures to lessen the pain of some means-tested “deserving poor” but will always ensure that the state always has plenty more pain and suffering in the pipeline and will do nothing to slow it.
Yay! Biden’s VP will be in great hands. Karine has great energy and is brilliant.
I was very discouraged last week, but I now have some hope. I think there are little signs, like this, that, taken together, signal EW may be Biden’s VP choice. Politicians of  caliber come along once in a century; we desperately need her now.
So I’m guessing Kamala Harris will be Biden’s pick for AG then.

It may be wishful thinking but this is what I’ve been thinking as well. Whitmer needed to be talked up for balance purposes and to deflect from the widely circulating belief (untrue) that Biden had committed to  choosing a WOC.
We know damn well that Biden has decided on his pick.  We’re now in the rollout orchestration phase.
Biden winning would be extremely catastrophic to the black community

The only thing better than Biden picking Sally Yeats as his Veep would be Lisa Page.  I shit you not.
This should be trotted out every time they lay into a Biden gaffe.

Yes.  The EPA rollbacks have to be corrected as soon as Biden wins. But it will be more difficult if mining and drilling and fracking projects are in motion.  How can they do so much damage every day?  It's mind-boggling and discouraging.  Can't fight it without lots of money.
Biden is an American patriot unlike you and your father.
