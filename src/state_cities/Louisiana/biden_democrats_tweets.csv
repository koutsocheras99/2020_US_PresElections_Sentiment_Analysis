Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden -
Again why should I explain Biden. I can’t it’s not explainiable just like grabbing a chick by the pussy. Who the fuck does that??? It’s nuts.  They both are out of their minds and can’t even speak
Obama was a disgrace to use that platform for a campaign speech for Biden.  What did Obama do for blacks when he was President for 8 yrs. NOTHING.
I need to register some more voters. We have got to kick Biden’s a$$! 🇺🇸
I agree he is but so is mr “grab em by the pussy”.  I am voting for  I think the only monopoly that matters in this country is the two party system which has brainwashed you to thinking you have two options.  Trump or Biden no difference, they don’t care about you
Who is a Scientologist?
I am not voting for that psycho either the fact that you think you have only two choices shows how brainwashed was YOU actually are trump is a failure our bubble economy and collapsing dollar prove that. And Biden will not help. Time to break the two parties up
Why do I need to explain anything about Joe Biden I didn’t vote for him and I won’t vote for him
What about that plane that went down around Poland that was carrying Russian generals that could also tie into Biden's bribery scheme.
And I found out the fact Joe Biden has had 2 surgeries for Brain aneurisms in the 80s so he wasn't even fit to be VP and further explains why Obama didn't let him on TV for 8 years.
75 innocent civilians were killed in Ukraine during government protests by snipers which lead to a revolution that replaced the government. I’m willing to bet those snipers were put in place by Biden and Obama so they could install a corrupt government.
Absentee ballots are approved mail in ballots should not be approve!Proven fraud with mail in.Dems are pushing this to rig elections! The more mail ins the more Corrupt!This is the only chance a mentally challenged Biden can win!obamaneeds this win to keep his admin out of jail!!
And that really says something if that publication is saying Biden is leading
Joe Biden Will Choose His Running Mate Tomorrow, And Here Are His Options
Like most, he supported Biden because he isn’t Trump. Period
Trump is for black Americans. He signed the prison reform bill &amp; black american unemployment at record low in 50years before covid. Kamala made sure black Americans were incarcerated. Joe Biden is a  pedo with dementia that would be replaced by his VP a week after in office .
Biden grab ass 😂😂😂😂😂
Sounds like a Biden - Obama rally, not a funeral
Did Biden speak at the Lewis funeral today?
If you don’t vote Biden, you ain’t a Black Boy..👻💩
AG under President Biden?  What do you think,
Trump because I want peace and prosperity in the USA . Not for it to turn into a socialist💩hole with whoever the DNC hand picks to be president after they finally declare Joe Biden unfit for public office.
Nope that would be Joe Biden in the Ukraine after losing another election.
Those who actually went to Epstein's or Joe Biden's islands are.
They will throw a monkey out of a airplane with a parachute and the first person the monkey shits on will be the Biden’s VP... 🦇💩👻
BFd. Why does dump have to read everything? Because he has no idea what’s going on except that he’s losing. President Biden doesn’t read from cue cards.❤️
It’s you, Biden and Watch This:
Because you won't be president . DNC would replace you with the VP they picked for you and the VP they picked for that person. Just say it Nancy Pelosi is Joe Biden's VP pick.
If you count the Deep State’s ability to rig an election, than “The Place Holder called Biden” maybe has a chance.   If polls aren’t based on merit, than they’re useless.
Anything mainstream has proven to be so wrong now that the truth about world is revealed.  Biden anywhere near Trump is ludicrous.
A win for Joe Biden in November...
He’s not a national disgrace but I’ll be honest with you Joe Biden selling out to the craziest part of his party and giving into TRUE solecism just to get a victory that could be a national disgrace real talk
is the one who should know better.
Terrified of Biden?  And You?  Oh, bless your sweet little heart!
Smart, savvy and tough as nails. I can surely support this woman as VP...
Joe Biden is a pedo and she endorsed him.
Yep, who they are isn’t a reflection of who I am. Help them out then say Vote for Biden 😁
I'm tired of old white men sitting in back rooms deciding what's best for  my country and me...
So you are one of them Biden pedophiles,  that explains it all
So you are saying Joe Biden is dropping out of the race for president because that's what it reads like.
Only Democrats would wail about "But, think of the SCOTUS! Kavanaugh! Gorsuch!", forgetting that Biden enabled Clarence Thomas by attacking Anita Hill and voted in Antonin Scalia; and that Obama SCOTUS appointees RBG &amp; Breyer have ruled with the Right on several key decisions.
Only Democrats expect us to scream loud about Trumpster and "Latinx kids in cages" while conveniently ignoring that the system of border camp prisons was established by "Black Progressive" Barack Obama, defended heartily by Bill and Hillary Clinton, and reinforced by Joe Biden.
Joe Biden  all pictures really except for the bottom left.
A debunked convo . However secret service couldn't  assign women to Joe Biden's detail because he would grope them or walk around the VP house when Jill wasn't around.
So you support losing your rights and freedom as well as nearly all your money  to socialism then communism then dictatorship? Because that's what will happen if Joe Biden would be elected then replaced  because of his condition with whoever the DNC picks as his VP .
No y'all lie and say Joe Biden is fit for office when clearly he wasn't even fit to be VP  in the last administration. And he is a pedophile sexual predator.
Man hush it. Lol. Yall comment on every topic like know at hell going on. Wn it comes to national security, we hv had no issues. He wiped a terriosts organization and troops r slowing coming home.  U sound like Biden, half asleep, man yall got a prize there
He’s not black enough to back Biden
Glad to see you are back Candice . Isn't there another system in place for adults with mental decline issues like Joe Biden ?
How’s this: President-elect Biden thought the last 5 questions were easy!
I love how Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and the entire DNC are non-corrupt individuals who fight for progressive values :)
Normal DemocRATS candidate start to lean to the Center left but not Joe Biden he wants to be the most progressive president in history. That's not going to sell well to middle America or better known as fly over Country.
Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden got some kinda pack going on. That's why Joe pick up a lot of Bernie positions and policy the Far Left agenda.
He doesn't . But Congress and the senate do. Ask Nancy Pelosi about her credit card fiasco or Joe Biden about Ukraine which he has criminal charges pending there .
Biden,”if you don’t for me u ain’t black.”
Assuming that other races cannot live in the suburbs is racist. Vote Trump, even if u don’t you’re still black (play on words of what Biden said😂) also he has brought more jobs to multiple ethnic groups than any recent president. All the violence in the US is caused by liberals.
He did that Bc they didn’t the pay for it, like how y’all look at stuff he did a long time ago, but you’ll ignore the fact that Joe Biden signed for incarceration rate of blacks being raised.
‘Your Daddy is a traitor’: Ex-tea party lawmaker slams Don Jr’s attempt to mock Joe Biden
Your daily reminder that the #KHive is simply the spinoff of the original #PUMA #Hillbots, who are still pissed because Hillary was denied her coronation TWICE.  If Copmala doesn't get the VP role, they'll be riffing for a Hillary coup to oust Biden from Day One.
Trumpster, 2016: "Barack Obama is a Kenyan Muslim!!! Show us the birth certificate!!!"  Democrat loyalists: "WTF??? Get outta here, Birther!!"  CorpraDem surrogate attacks Indy Leftist  as grifting Canadian for not backing Biden 100%  Dem loyalists: *crickets*
Wonderful human being. Better than trump. Biden can spell. Biden is a family man.
Get Biden the fuck away before he makes another conservative commercial
These are the Bernie bros. they just love all of Biden’s socialism 😂😂😂😂
When Democrats who scream how Obama Birther Trumpster is the next Hitler 2dot0, decide to go full Orly Taitz at Indy Leftists who dare not to march in front of their Biden bandwagon....  #BlueMAGA  #SameAsRedMAGA #ButBluer   (PS:  is an American citizen by birth.)
Lies?  The president lies daily. 😂😂😂😂😂😂. They literally had to fetch the charter to prove he’s a liar.  You are all a bunch of laughingstocks
Joe Biden oh wait that's dementia.
U just keep hate tweeting, and The boss will keep moving up. Lol  one pollster with an impressive track record on these things has reported that Biden and Trump are even while showing how the US voters now believe Trump was set-up by Democrats during the Russian-hoax.
He sent out huge subsidies and even wanted his name signed on the checks.  The FY2020 deficit is near 4 trillion dollars.                                             2.  The democrat nominee is Joe Biden.  He isn’t for Medicare for all.  The only way either of these pieces of
Lol. If they admit to a cure, that means people get better, all the college's start back up, which eliminates bt 70% of protesters and Democrats wd hv to put Biden up against Trump infront of voters. They can't let that happen, Trump as smash him in debates, record and tweets
Biden camp ask politico to accidentally leak it and get feedback because they aren't sure if headboard Harris he is worthy
“I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August," Biden said. "I promise I’ll let you know when I do."
This election is between Satan (Joe Biden) and (Michael the Archangel) Trump Save America Vote Trump
If Biden wants to guarantee he won't gain any young, progressive voters... then by all means pick Kamala.
It appears POLITICO accidentally published a story identifying Kamala Harris as the VP pick for Joe Biden. I’m guessing there are multiple drafts they are working on (I’m doing the same thing) and accidentally published one.
So, when are you going to line up and call out DEMOCRATS who voted for that Pentagon budget, and who are already crawfishing back on the $600 PUA smelling the donor fund rush?  Get Biden out of your head and go back to fighting Indy Left, Senator.
Biden in most polls is up by 15+ points. If he really was that good a candidate, he wouldn't need you shaming Left voters who truly want an alternative.  My vote is MY vote, not yours.
TFW Biden all of a sudden at the convention announces that he has to step down for "medical reasons"....and hands the mic over to Hillary Clinton.  Who then nominates John Kasich as her VP for a "Unity" ticket.  #ItWasMETrumpster   #ItWasMEAllAlong
I have never seen such Soft Ball questions given to any presidential candidate as Joe Biden is getting right now.
Joe Biden is a bumbling fool!!!
Looks like Biden's isn't even waiting for the convention to make the traditional lurch to the Right that all Democrats make during this time.  Meanwhile, crickets from
Please, Mr. VP Biden address all the protesters in all cities to not go near federal properties they are giving him ammunition for election. Let them know you hear them and will correct it all after election, Thank you!!
Here we go, Obama/Biden administration again... #BarrTestimony
Not a Trump fan, but I don’t need Joe Biden or any other man to ensure my success, either.  They’re both patronizing.  It’s ludicrous that neither party can field a better candidate.
You support Joe Biden then you are supporting a habitual liar and pedophile. Look it up I'm not doing it for you. all can be found here or other places on the internet that are reputable. Fact Joe Biden has had 2 surgeries for Brain aneurysims hence why he isn't fit for office.
Biden likes anything he can grope or sniff 🤮🤮🤮🤮
What if you and pedo Joe Biden refuse to accept 4 more years of president Trump?
Is Biden even still running for president? I feel like he dropped off the face of the earth since COVID and BLM stuff started
Lol. 4-5 decades they all been in power and yall thought they wd change cus yall helped hate tweet and riot. Keep voting biden
Lol but yet y'all want Biden or Sanders lmao GTFO Biden is one of the most corrupt demorats in the world #FUCKDEMORATS
Joe Biden sniffin kids all day lookin boi
PONZI schemes. They  are gaining financial and popularity by hating on Trump. They are getting money for lying. after Nov, we will get our pay back. But they hv to live with fact they walked out on Repubs and now support chaos, fires, bus in burning, murder, collusion and Biden.
Btw Matt. That was sarcasm. Trump sucks; Biden 2020
He's been taking every and negative ad or banner or headline for almost 4 yrs, he's fine  In the Morning Consult tracking survey Biden rated a minus 15 (35% approval, 50% disapproval), and even in polls where he has scored better, his support [among independents] is weak.”
They are Hidin’ just like Biden..👻
Joe Biden Plans to Restore Federal Funding for Planned Parenthood
It won’t be ready until President Biden is in office.
He didn’t do anything except tell us what many of us knew by reading the news. But keep drinking that koolaid. By the way, I know lots and lots of right wingers who’ll be voting for Biden.
not supporting Biden? Very disappointing. You must be a trump supporter. I sure hope you lose.
Louisiana! I have family in Texas voting for President Biden also!
Me after reluctantly voting for Joe Biden
Shouldn't your tweet be for Joe Biden ? Cause that's what's going to happen.
Yeah! Electing Biden is enough payment for me. It will be nice for our country to be civil again, and I’ll bet the covid vaccine will be ready under President Biden’s watch!
hard as a racist because of it.  Secondly, Kamala wasn’t a part of a federally mandated busing program.  The busing she received was municipal, which Biden supported.
The matter isn’t if it was racist or not.  The matter is that it was a terrible thing to say (especially when Biden was absolutely correct to block federal busing) because now it gives fodder to the republicans.  They have made a meme that misquotes him and have been hitting him
the more I watch Joe Biden speak the more Im like wtf are we doing bro
Joe Biden is a viable candidate for president.
SC's primary is open to all parties.  With Trumpster running by himself without opposition, very easy for GOTP voters to cross over to vote for Biden to stop Sanders, and allow DNC and corporate media to tout "Black rejection of Sanders" narrative.
People need to realize you can be conservative &amp; not support Trump, just like you can be liberal &amp; not support Biden.   Let the trash take itself out.
Hey Fox News, Chris Wallace did a great job of proving the truth. I guess he didn’t get paid off like the rest of you! Biden 2020. Trump 20 to life!
This is just a discussion.  This guy and I always discuss things.  He’s actually one of the few guys that I follow that knows a bit about something.  We are both voting Biden and trying th get everyone too as well.
There have been dozens of reports that describe Trump signs littering the country. People who turn out to vote are those who take the time to support their candidate. No one had seen Biden signs.
Social media has become the target of a dueling attack ad campaign being waged online by the sitting president and his election rival. They’re shooting the messenger while giving it lots of money.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
We know it's bullshit. But they got a mask, the Biden supporters are burning down child detention centers, throwing bricks and fireworks at federal agents and blinding them with lasers. Better try and find worst actors than these dude.
Oh Lincoln Project, the PONZI SCHEME, IS working overtime to try and tie Trump to Epstein. Unfortunately, the list is filled with Democrats and Hollywood, the exact people they aligned with for 2020.  And yall choose Biden, same one they hated for decades. Lol. Gonna b fun
for non-environmental reasons I got sick to my stomach reading that Biden wants to end off-shore drilling.
Best reason to vote for Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
YES SIR, THIS IS THE 98% OF AMERICA WE LOVE. THE CRAP ON MEDIA CHANNELS IS JUST A HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION GIVEN TO DEMOCRATS TO TRY AND MISLEAD VOTERS INTO VOTING FOR BIDEN. NO OFFENSE TO YR INDUSTRY SIR. IVE SEEN ALMOST ALL OF YOUR FILMS BY THE WAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HONEST!
No Joe Biden is under the desk. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
So true, Daytime Fox is lost to the Deep State influence. At least we have nighttime news on Fox that is still Fair and Balanced..
This man is as screwed up in the head as Joe Biden is! I’m so glad I don’t live in the state of New York, especially NYC.
Makes perfect sense.....Biden would see 45’s portrait and be like “nah fam”
Who gives a shit? That’s what politicians do. That’s what media companies do. Joe Biden went on the Breakfast Club and told African Americans if they didn’t vote for him then they aren’t black, I think Trump and Dave can shoot the shit on baseball for 20 minutes.
No way. Democrats and Biden are trying to harm the nation's cities. We see it and history tells the story, it also repeats itself.
What a hypocrite.  Bernie Sanders received $250M from working people for his "revolution", yet sold them out TWICE to sheepdog for the conservative Democratic Party establishment. Now Sanders wants to pretend to attack billionaires, while still backing Joe Biden. Pathetic.
A Dam Breaks As Whites Abandon the GOP — According to new polling, Joe Biden is close to erasing Trump’s advantage with Caucasian voters.
Send this joe biden ad to ALLL your friends
You have wrote fiction for too long that you can't accept reality. No one wants to elect a pedo Joe Biden with dementia . He has had 2 brain surgeries for aneurysms in the 80s which has caused his current mental decline.
Give it a rest. The fact is Biden doesn’t even have to campaign! Trump duh, and is constantly digging his own grave...not from ‘fake news’...from his own mouth, his own actions. Good riddance. He has done nothing but divide this great nation.
Trusted :15 | Joe Biden For President 2020  via
They’re trying to guilt you into voting for Biden. That’s saying a lot
😂😂😂 definitely will be voting for Biden
Not about race, it’s about intelligence.  People with common sense will vote for Trump.  Idiots will vote for Biden.  Trump will win in a landslide.
I've never been more into see a caring, compassionate, Leader like Joe Biden, win this Presidential Election. And  make the much needed changes. Time to take Trump's  bigoted, racist, views, out of our Whitehouse. Trump belongs in Jail. When we eject him, then he will go to jail
The democrats fake polls say the incompetent democrat Joe Biden  hiding in his basement at home with a mask on is leading in the polls.   I’ll take the most accurate pollster in the last 20 elections model instead -
Well that's definitely something Biden can't brag about.
I'm cool with any name you choose, except maybe "Roz for Biden" 😉😎
Didn't know Obama and Biden had been doing all this cool shit with zoning laws. Imagine reasonably sized towns with decent drainage and bus systems and affordable housing so the kids out there stop growing up with such stunted, unfortunate personalities,l.
Please take your America hating ass and Joe Biden and leave our GREAT country..
Do you think you beat a Biden/Obama ticket?
No. A big reason why is because my husband was recently laid off from the oilfield and under Biden things will only get worse for my family. I don’t agree with everything that Trump says or does but I’m looking out for the well-being of my family.
Biden would have a busy “Day One”..👻
Sanders actually has moved himself slightly further to the Right since his early days as an Independent; and he's now essentially reduced to being a cheerleader for Biden and the Democrats.....and yet, he's still thrashed as "FAR LEFT" even by establishment Democrats.
Ur Joe's 1st racist prez article is a failed anti-Biden hit piece. Absurd mention of Reagan 4 a sgle pvt remark. Same w/Washington et al &amp; FDR. Joe meant modern Amer HX &amp; a creep who is racist to the core, DAILY by words &amp; prez deeds. Truly a tragic 1st!
i fucking hate Joe Biden.
Nope Biden and he is a pedo too.
No Joe Biden will be in Ukrainian jail Jill for his involvement with Burisma . Y'all should have raised Hunter better than y'all did.
Biden is an idiot but he acts like he cares for the American people, Trump couldn’t give two shits about the American population and couldn’t be bothered to pretend...he too, is an idiot *Que Roman Sionis breakdown*Biden is worse, but you say we like you're part of a  Different United States that's the problem.  We need to get rid of term limits, and we need at least 3- 4 parties. This gang 💩is sick, and most Americans hate both parties
That’s fair. I hope Biden gives the Republicans an opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis (and that they take it). If not, I am favor of eliminating it just to get things done for once. And I am putting my faith (and money) in the moderates to do that without going crazy.

I think you can take solace in the fact that very few Senate candidates are “progressive.” Many of them are in the Biden mold. You won’t get Senator Bullock or Kelly voting for the Green New Deal or anything.  As such, burn it all down.
Biden will take incisive measures when the time is right and the vetting is complete. No room for errors. He can take all the time he needs!
"The latest Yahoo News/YouGov survey suggest that Trump’s efforts to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in voting may be starting to have their desired effect."
“Some also argue that she's too ambitious.” Would that be a problem for a male candidate?⁦🤔 ⁦ is ambitious about leading us in the right direction! Ambitious about equality, fairness and lifting up working families. Don’t stop! 🙌💥
Being as well informed as you are I’m sure you understand that Biden had a former stuttering issue and does every now and then.  Are you really making fun of that like an uninformed child might? Substance and respect of others are also what he has.
I’m talking about how you started listing negatives about Biden just because someone said they were voting for him. Cause we can list negatives about trump TOO. So stop trying to force your political opinions on others. K? Thanks :)
It is closer than the polls but I think Biden is up. That will change if Biden refuses to debate or if he does debate.
My money’s on Rice because Obama wants her! She was liar in chief for him and so she’d be for Biden!
Really between a rock &amp; a hard place. Have to vote for Biden but if he does not get Kamala I will be seriously volcanically pissed.....how obtuse is Joe to even have Dodd as an advisor. This is NOT the 70’s or 80’s Joe.
If Biden Is Elected, Residents Fleeing Chaotic Cities Like Seattle and Portland Are in for a Rude Awakening
Now they wouldn’t select Obama because he could not succeed to the Presidency.   They could elect Hillary. But they won’t.   They would obviously elect Joe Biden President Pro Tem.
If Trump could postpone the election (He can’t), Biden would become President.    Do you want to know why?
A PREDICTION  With in 30 to 60 days of the New Biden Administration, a republican politician will concoct a bill which will make it illegal for a Potus to use Twitter or other  direct to citizen social media. He or she will say, such platforms give an incumbent to much advantage.
You're not trying to convince them. Many of them are sadly lost. Those that are not will be clear (i have a friend who voted Trump in 2016 and now is voting Biden thanks to the arguments I've made)  But remember the people who just read. That's your audience.
A good week usually means the MSM will pound us with Biden +13 polls and rumors that Texas and Georgia are in play. It’s on auto replay. Yawn

This sums up my feelings about Biden. He will win, the decay continues, Generalissimo Hawley does a coup, and then bad things happen
We will and China balls Biden also.
I am with you. Neither sleet nor snow... wait a minute, I’m in Louisiana. Make that neither hurricane winds or flood will prevent me from casting my Biden vote.
Remember how many weeks (months?) Joe Biden teased his presidential campaign itself, the basic question of whether or not he was going to run? This is like that. He takes up more bandwidth not-deciding than he does deciding.
Ok so lemme get this right.. Niggas really supposed to vote for Joe Biden the author of the 94 crime bill that devastated black people communities and its looking like he bout to pick Kamala Harris who feels like this ..     #bet
At the end civil war.   We are ready getting some zombies will be an adventure
Joe Biden is using her policies because he know good and well this woman is going to change the dynamic for all people in this country. And she’s for the people😢✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼
just remember that who ever he picks you will be looking at the next president, NOT Joe Biden !   article 25 ?
And so is Joe Biden..he's not abolishing the police either. Find a new political tactic that's relevant!
Senator Biden knows from experience how our Democracy works! "President" Trump had to learn his job from the ground up, his ill-advised appointments notwithstanding.

Mr. Trump is attempting, in advance, to make excuses for losing the up-coming election! Me, I'm voting for Senator Biden!
I think R office holders down ballot would continue to urge their people to vote and argue that they will serve as checks on a Biden presidency.
As soon the media sees it getting closer, they’ll dump the Biden +12s to try an deter us. The gig is up. #KAG2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
So you don’t like the Cheney example, then go with Biden. Obama did not pick him because he was looking to pick and groom the future of the party.
And for the record I don’t disagree. I’m just saying for some it may not be the only concern. Barrack Obama did not pick Biden to groom a future leader
There is absolutely no enthusiasm for Biden and he will get less of the Bernie vote than Hillary I believe. He just doesn’t bring anything to the table. On the same token Trump has got to find a way to start building up enthusiasm on our side. It’s like he’s stuck n 2nd gear.
THE #NWO  WANTS CIVIL WAR THIS WAS THE PLAN STAY AWAKE The Right and Left TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN THESE GUN ATTACKS ARE HAPPENING NOW IN MULTIPLE STATES DRUMPF IS NOT YOUR FRIEND BIDEN IS PART OF NWO SYSTEM  WAKE THE F UP PEOPLE !
Well in that case Bass has those ambitions. She’s started promoting herself to labor unions and other progressive allies. This idea that Biden would be picking a subservient malleable woman in Bass is disservice to her. She’s a badass. Harris is not only ambitious woman on list.
It’s not a perfect comparison. But remember at the time of his selection as VP Biden had no intention of ever running for president again either. I’m not opposed to Biden picking someone with further political ambitions. But he’s not required too. I’d be happy with Harris too.
What Biden's whole racist career isn't enough to damage him?
Based on what?  What has Biden even run?
Biden in mid-November after Trump already won the GE: "I've got some great news folks we've narrowed down the list to a pair of excellent Vice President choices"
Whatever "big loud" October surprise Trump *may* have on Biden, I'm sure there are 10 times as many booming legitimate October surprises coming out on Trump. Voting Blue down ballot no matter how the cookie crumbles.
It wasn’t single-handed by any means. There were a bunch of hands from the House and Senate, including Biden’s. I get what you’re saying tho, and no one can argue the ‘94 Crime Bill didn’t dismantle generations of Black families.
Hunter Biden fathered child with woman while dating brother’s widow, DNA test reveals

joe biden trashed the italian healthcare system as part of his attack on medicare for all, but lo and behold, they did a good job. chances that will stop biden from spreading insurance industry propaganda about european healthcare?

Same goes for people in deep red states. I can vote for Biden all day but Louisiana electoral vote is going to Trump.  Also, I live in Louisiana, I constantly vote for people I out right hate since most state and local elections are Republican only ballots.
Biden should pick this man as his running mate.  .
Hidin with Biden, playing checkers and hashing over better days!
They look but Biden gropes. Take your pick.
Real Biden: It’s been over six years since the first confirmed case of COVID-69 in China, and President Reagan still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of lethal injection that costs little girls lives from running my leg hairs.
Steve what about all the things that cost lives? Disbanding the pandemic team. Not taking it serious enough to get the country prepared. We were way behind on both testing and ppe because of this. What about the failure to not encourage mask. Trump mocked Joe Biden for wearing 1.
Patriots SHARE 💯 Antione TY Friend Language Rough He  Speaks The Truth💥 Wake Up America Corrupt Democrats Destroying  America! Look What They Cost Us &amp; Did President Trump For 4 yrs Russia, Ukraine, Now BLM/Antifa Terriost💯Started With OBAMA,Hillary,BIDEN!
Obama - Biden had a gain of 15 million jobs. Trump lost 40 million jobs. By lying about this you’re only helping trump destroy america further.
The only thing keeping my abject fear at bay is imagining the Biden presidency as Obama part 3
That being said, Biden should be running ads that say: You in the Red State, Trump and your GOP Gov knew the virus would spread to your state and did nothing to get ready. The result? People are dying.
Ppl get mad at me when I say this though!!!  I get hit with how much more “tolerable “ they think Biden is.
He is there because he is their best chance. He is being directed by the group that will actually be the President if he gets elected. Obama, Axelrod, Soros. Susan Rice will be chosen as his VP mate and will become President when Biden steps aside within weeks of inauguration.
Harris.  Best-vetted by media (except maybe EW); statewide winner; prosecutor; good on offense; AA &amp; South Asian. Talk she offended Biden ignores that he’s a pro. Recall GHW Bush called Reagan’s plan “voodoo economics” - Bush’s best line ever.
Didn't she say voting for Biden is the same as eating "a bowl of shit?"  Why is she even in the goddamned room?
Is Biden's VP "short-lister" Rep. Karen Bass--the Venceremos Brigade organizer and powerful Democrat with many positions on Congressional Committees--STILL linked to Cuba's KGB-founded Intelligence Service? (We report, you decide.) -
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
First point of order for president Biden. Abolish DHS
Biden has a commercial/video about that which I saw this morning on Twitter.
Okay.    Biden doesn’t suck, hasn’t caused a new depression, hasn’t killed 150,000 Americans, doesn’t fuck and pay pornstars.
He might be sending a big check to the Biden campaign  this morning or starting to work on Trump's landslide election loss appeal!
Do people really believe your propaganda that he is a radical because it sounds absolutely stupid to me. We’ve already had eight years of Biden with Obama, and it was a hell of a lot better than it is now. If anything, Trump is a radical traitor.
I’m ridin’ Biden, dawg. I ain’t to no purity testing Bernie bro.   “Never allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good”
Hmm 🤔 don’t worry Biden will forget to show up
You misspelled “why should Biden interrupt Trump’s non-stop cycle of self-destruction when Trump himself is the best argument for a Biden presidency?”
I think progressives voting for Biden when it's clear dems  are structurally realigning with neoconservatives yo make leftists politics irrelevant again..are the dumb ones. Short sighted and nonstrategic. I hate trump,  but Biden winning will hurt the left far more
the bot. Stop piggy-backing my tweets. Learn when to place a comma and use parenthesis. Learn to spell. Communism!?! This. Is. Democracy! And yeah, piss-pot bot from another country, bring on three live debates. Biden’s not our ideal, but he’s coherent and sane.
Morning America🇺🇸MAGA BadazzPatriots,RunAways 1 More Day Twitter Jail! Never Forget BENGHAZI! LockThemUp⏬⏬⏬ Hillary💥Obama💥Biden Raise Your Hand If You Want JUSTICE🙋 NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI😫🇺🇸
Ridiculous,  45 is so jealous of Obama and Biden.  That is total BULLSHIT  VOTE, VOTE, VOTE
VOTE, VOTE, VOTE    45 is insane,  He is so jealous of Obama and Biden.  My dog could run the county better
Biden has not consented to a mental acuity test in years.
Trump is such a bad President, the Biden campaign is literally just making mundane promises and they sound good.
I’m tired of progressives saying they are not enthusiastic about Joe Biden. Are you enthusiastic about keeping America from becoming completely fascist? Are you enthusiastic about being able to pick RBG’s successor? This country has barely survived 3.5 years of Trump.
Biden can lead the country out of it and there are plenty of good people who ran for the nomination to help him.  This is really a choice between hope and doom and Biden, et al, need to start inspiring hope as was done at Lewis’ funeral today.
. It makes me chuckle when you refer to Biden as a puppet.
Thought dealing with the most on-line of the Biden and Kamala supporters had prepared me for Twitter stans, but the TSwift mob is TERRIFYING. And I LIKE folklore.  Also, I've been waiting for someone to connect "Slow Show" and "Call Me Maybe" in a piece of criticism for YEARS.
How? Biden won’t even be the President! His VP and the Democrats will occupy the WH!
I think it's insulting to Biden that he is forced to even consider the woman who attacked him in the first debate as a way to try to boost her own dismal numbers. Pick a winner Joe, not this anchor. #VPPick
Laughed At | Joe Biden for President  via
Trump Flips Out Over Biden’s Ad  via
Both of you need to endorse Biden. If you decide to keep quiet... based on some “party loyalty” bullshit... you will forever be viewed as one more Trump enabler. You can mount whatever defense you want, but that’s it. That’ll be your legacy.
Joe Biden is not racist.   Joe Biden is useless.   Don’t confuse the two.
Good night never Trumper. You were entertaining for a little bit. I noticed that you didn't include examples of what else could be done that he isn't doing.  And if   Biden is your choice you were never a republican in the first place.
will of the people?  Don't the people want medicare for all, job guarantees, unemployment extension.  All those things Biden is against?  No thanks.
It was just inappropriate. Bill Clinton and Joe Biden are a lot alike
Really then why r u all still so butt hurt about not being able 2 put him and his enabler wife back in the WH? Also so excited about putting Biden in after 8 years of  doing nothing against Epstein? Pick a lane.Barr is a lapdog but goes after JE if it could hurt trump. Idiots
I agree.   is the most qualified and has worked with Biden for years.  Harris for AG. Cuomo Chief of Staff.
Well tomorrow might be awesome, might absolutely suck, or might be a pleasant shocker... who knows? Either way, Biden will probably win in November so I guess I'm content.
the perfect valentine for President Biden!!!
If Biden is elected on a margin of mail-in ballots, the legitimacy of American democracy will be forever destroyed. You really really need to step back and see the damage you’re doing in the eyes of people who don’t share your politics.
I read it, &amp;heard it; thanks for the support. So many people play dumb these days! They act like Reagan wasn't the King of #MAGA in the 80s as if fools are living who don't know their past experiences. Now Biden's bold saying things he wouldn't have before South Carolina victory.
Here’s the Democrat’s play for 2020:  They set up a potential narrative of malfeasance.  If Biden wins : “look! We avoided a problem”  If trump wins: “see we told you so!!!”, And it’s another phony Russia-esq narrative for another 4 years.
He is a crook and is about as bright as poor, old lost Biden.
Joe Biden without a prepared speech
People are buying this garbage. Joe Biden is a demented fool.
And, the Bernie Bros and Bots went nuts. Joe Biden called this one CORRECTLY several months.
Lord, stay away from Joe Biden 🙃🙃🙃
When trump thought he would lose to Hillary in 2016, he said the election was rigged. When he shockingly won, we realized he was right. This time, Biden will win despite trump’s attempt to rig it again. We have learned.
Crooked Joe Biden honor dignity that’s most pathetic thing I’ve ever heard that racist POS called
They ignored Biden’s comments just like they accuse racist whites of ignoring racism. Amazing how much both parties have in common
I’m gonna vote for Biden but I don’t like it obviously
Bruh no but u can’t convince me that Biden is way better than trump we are not gonna get the change we need
Imagine believing Biden is better than Trump 💀 they’re 2 cheeks on the same ass honestly.
Yep. I think Pelosi would be better than Biden anyway!
If Biden wins(or when) we should start planning what a to do on Jan 20, 2021.  Without 45 to complain about, maybe we an do something joyous!
Barack Obama Just Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency
The DNC should be mortified that there is literally an organization called “Settle for Biden.”
Hmmm, didn’t Eric Holder declare himself to be Obama’s “Wing Man”?  You had no problem with that Sleepy Joe, or better said, Hypocrite Joe Biden!   VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
For once we agree. BIDEN will loose on Nov 3.
I’ve seen some well-informed tales claiming that it would still undermine a Biden or Democrat held election if half the electorate believed he was cheated, and I don’t know as much as those people do, but um...he doesn’t have half the electorate convinced. Which is why
Seems like Biden won another news cycle. Not good for Bridgegate Bill and his candidate.
Alyssa chill . I may not agree with you, but hell . Slow down. Enjoy 😉 that family. Live life. Our country will endure. Joe Biden will win. And after? Racism will vanish,Antifa will register to vote, women will be able to have abortions,there will be no poor. I hope u can chill
No doubt y’all will get a handle on it November 4th if Biden wins cause there would be no need to keep up the charade!
like bruh Ion call him Eric Biden and this the Thanks I get for being a good sport
You've really bought into the media hysteria haven't you? The system is fucked up. Trump is bad, but he's just the logical progression after years of shit leadership. Biden continues the same.
we really could’ve had this angel but the boomers said ✨biden✨
They need to collectively campaign for Biden!
The US if Biden gets elected
right thats why the fool wants to delay the election because Biden has 0 enthusiasm? btw Herman Cain died pushing the lies of the orange Cheeto.
I’M RIDIN’ with BIDEN 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸
Thanks for the kind words, President Bush. Now, if you believe in the words you delivered today, ... Endorse Joe Biden.
Don't worry about it. The Biden administration will take care of Germany. You're on your way out, thank God.
That’s too high! Biden’s win is going to be like Reagan’s against Mondale. Most of the country will go Blue!
Only if you are now Campaigning for Biden would that tweet be true. Infact; that tweet is so out any realm if reality it should be used as evidence of your mental instability.
Someone report Fauci to the FCC for making an illegal in kind contribution to the Biden campaign  Or please perform a Colonoscopy on MSM so we can find out what the hell he is talking about min to min  BTW ‘Dr’ Fauci I’m yet to see any of your proprietary data on your #Science 🤔
Inside the Beltway: Reality check: Trump has 5% lead over Biden #SmartNews   How about this fake news????
this is from Project Veritas. Right wing group known for making fake videos. I hate trump too but it's clear why they used a video of him in a mask so they could do the voiceover of him saying anything. Surprised they did it to trump tho and not Biden.
Can you please update us on how this article aged?? Was Biden totally wrong like you predicted?
Didn’t you just write an op ed about how ridiculous it was that Biden said Trump would do this?   How is the media so ignorant about Trump? Everybody schmuck who has been paying attention knew with 100% certainty that Trump would be floating the idea of delaying the election.
Biden crossing up fools needed
He might, but not because he is Biden.   Democrats could have run a wooden chair for president, and they would have voted for it only because it wasn’t trump.
It is fuck the dems on this side too though. If you're not progressive in your politics you're part of the problem. I'll vote for Biden because we sadly have a 2 party system and he's the less racist of the 2 options.
Or we could all just vote for Biden. 🤷‍♂️
🤣🤣🤣  Still trying to project Trumps dementia into Biden? That’s pretty sad.
Biden been in the mist of racist white men and supremacist. He knows it when he sees it.
Just realized that Trump and Biden are older than every living president except Jimmy Carter.
I don’t think anyone thoroughly weighed the consequences. It was truly a rejection election. I voted 3rd party out of protest for the disgust of what was presented to me. But I’ll Vote Biden all day long because I recognize the division and hatred being spewed. This has to stop
Wrong, Biden's staff is full of them. He will simply be a placeholder for these extremists.
I think so too, only way Biden can win I feel is if he get a black woman running mate. Then again it’s up in the air
2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump’s Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do - The New York Times
No comfort in this.
And Bernie would have needed the Progressive Congress to write the laws for #M4A and #GND. Instead of attacking Biden why not go support progressive candidates and elect that Congress still? Put those bills on Biden's desk.
Since Biden's cronies are backstabbing her for VP, here's hoping.
It’s kind of cool seeing people live in an alternate reality tho. Biden has maybe 2 or 3 policy disagreements at most with the republican establishment and they think he’s like inseparable from Fidel Castro
Please recognize the threat that trumps division, ideology, rhetoric, &amp; actions pose to the long term health of our democracy. Vote Biden, get this country back to some semblance of what we were - then we can go back our normal political theatre and nit-picking.
Nope. Remember Trump WANTS the kids back in school.  He wants people to also go out to vote. Biden and his people want the kids to STAY home and they want us to stay home and vote from home.
And the Chief sewer rat is non other than Fauci. Who’s approaching investigation status from the FCC for his in kind contribution to the Biden campaign  His hostility towards HCQ also coincides with his relationship with big Pharma and the many crooked deals with his NIH🤔
Hey Ari can you clarify this tweet? A conspiracy theory is like WMDs in Iraq, not Biden’s true prediction.  F’n hypocrite
WATCH LIVE: Biden gives remarks at the American Federation of Teachers’ ...  via
Oh but every pole shows biden winning, what a freaking joke
That would affect Trump’s voters more than Biden’s. No Democrats died from taking hydroxy pills, for example.
He’s not trying to suppress his own votes. He’s trying to get them front loaded on election night so that when the mail in numbers fly toward Biden he can claim fraud.
It's simple.  Biden has to meet her price but she's  not through figuring out how high she can go.
Here is worse then biden /Pelosi....    How about Biden /AOC.
Nobody cares about Hunter Biden anymore than they care about u. Hunter has a law degree from Yale. He’s qualified to sit on any board.  It’s you Eric who stole from a children’s cancer charity. It’s u who r banned from serving on the board of any charitable organization.
Trump calls for delay to election, falsely claiming mail-in voting will lead to fraud – live
Why use this faux handwringing language to justify an unprincipled opinion.  Yall aren't mad because he is saying anything you don't find truthful. You are mad because he saying something inconvenient to your goals of electing Biden. Nothing principled about demanding propaganda
Mr. Trump, you should know, presidential elections are set by our Constitution - you cannot change the date or the conditions of them. My guess is you are worried and hope to make an end run around the requirements set forth in that cherished document! Vote for Biden -he's smart!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins #SmartNews    Who gives a shyt what White supremacist Tucker thinks only the zombies for Trump
I think they found a way to rig mail in ballots and he is twitting such a nonsense so later Biden cannot contest the results.
Yeah, the democrats have been taking such a hard left they nominated Joe Biden to run for president
Speaking of in accurate let’s talk about your handling of #COVID-19, your the ONLY FRAUD #Biden #Biden2020
You might have a situation where Biden is legally elected in a special election next year but they’ll deem in unsafe for him to be in DC or transition into the White House
Joe Pedo Biden , hi I sniff and grab little girls and little boys and im running for president!
I could see him stepping down post-Election Day if he gets embarrassed to avoid any transfer of power to Biden. He'd let Pence do that.
No bitch, this election will NOT be “delayed” just because Joe Biden is kicking your deplorable ass in the polls. GOOD FUCKING RIDDANCE!!!
I seriously would finally up and leave this country. Election reform has to be a Biden priority. Which is why everyone needs to vote for the leading democrat in every single race, including anyone who hates “establishment” Dems—if you vote for them &amp; give us a majority,
to point out things that could lead to his ultimate demise, we are all eager for him to leave office, but honestly, I’d rather speculate on Biden’s pick for VP, and I am SO SICK of that conversation soooo...  Omg. I am so terrified of a future Ivanka or Don Jr presidency 🤢
Hiden Biden has Woken...
Hope all is well. Seems like everything will hit in 2020. Louisianians figure we’ll have at least one Cat five hurricane, blasting the heck out of us. No quakes no fires no hurricanes please. And a Biden win.
Joe Biden just upstaged Donald Trump - Palmer Report. Trump’s Flu
THIS is why I’m not I favor of ANY VP discussions amongst ourselves. We have 0 say in it and the discussion itself promotes division. We all must get on board w whoever Biden picks. Our job is simple. GOTV &amp; create enthusiasm. Arguing abt who’s the VP pick is counterproductive.
I’d prefer it if Biden didn’t pick a former prosecutor as VP, but ultimately his choice has zero impact on the fact that I am voting for Biden and against Trump.
That’s true ladies, your hair and inappropriate touching is not going to happen without Biden’s hand in it.
Imagine if Trump was to pay a foreign spy for a B.S. Dossier compiled in Russia on Biden...then have political cronies leak it &amp; pass it to the FBI, who knew it was B.S., then used it to mislead FISC, to illegally get a warrant to spy on Team Biden.  Obama/Biden did that shit !!
Hey y’all, Biden is holding town halls, Lincoln project is holding town halls, get out the vote, Michelle Obama,  When We All Vote and others are holding webinars asking for voting volunteers.  You can do this safely from your home w/o risk.  Please be a part of the solution.
Agreed!  Be a part of the solution. Biden is holding town halls.
Add to the ‘hatchet’ wound salt  BC passing Joe Biden as a  viable candidate, a man visibly infirm, is an unprecedented blotch in the history of our nation  We have had scoundrels, mediocre, salacious, deprave, incompetent and even corrupt presidents  But never one with Dementia
Will you work for President Biden? I'm putting you and Jon Favreau on my DreamTeam cabinet/staff...thank you for your service!
I wasn’t talking about VP’s becomin president because the president dies/steps down/etc - that’s actually happened 12 times (pretty sure anyway). I was saying that if Biden makes it to 2024 and doesn’t run &amp; we pick his VP in the primary - history says we very likely lose.
I absolutely agree re: Biden. There are other options. I will choose one of those options. But Shahid is a different matter. If I lived in that district, despite disparaging words against my preferred candidate, he has policies that benefit people, and I'd vote for him.
Joe Biden is no different than Trump.... Biden and Obama has done and will continue the trump policy... They are in fact the engineers of Trump policy.... These policies could have never happen without the good ole corporate Democrats...  it's ok to not support Biden
all i’m saying is y’all better be voting for joe biden this november. he is NOT who i want whatsoever, but we have got to get trump out of office and this is our most tangible way of doing so.
While I agree in principle the discussion seems to draw division &amp; others to pound their fists to announce they won’t vote for VP X which draws even more division. It’s a moot point. We need to get on board w Biden &amp; X whoever she may be &amp; create enthusiasm for the ticket.
Joe “everything but hang people for jaywalking” Biden. 👎
Silver Alert: Joe Biden. NSFC not safe for children
Doesn’t matter who Biden picks for VP or even if he runs again in 2024 - whatever the case there will be a primary from the left that will be just as hard fought as 2016 &amp; 2020. The left wing of the party is not going to just accept Status Quo Joe or his VP next primary season.
C murder whole case is crazy to me  There’s seriously no reason he should still be in jail  Maybe we can bully Joe Biden into looking into his case
Biden 2020: where am I and where did you put my shoes? My pancakes sit on my dashboard waiting to dress cereal bars .
Things are kinda just insane around here lately so I just wanna say once and for all; Kamala is my number one but I'm still gonna always root for everyone Black especially women so have a good night everyone. Hillary won. Vote Biden. Arrest the cops that murdered Breonna Taylor.
This is the only thing that matters: Stick together. Stick with the blue vote. Stick with Biden. Stick with the blue candidate. WE MUST MAKE THIS YEAR THE YEAR EVERYONE VOTES. We have to survive this year. The vote is life and death for hundreds of thousands of Americans. PLEASE!
I think they are on TV, altho I can’t say for sure. And a lot of these guys have been pretty against him from the get-go. This time, instead of backing a 3rd party run, they’re helping guys like Biden and Bullock. And giving cover to disenchanted Rs who have had enough of Trump.
I mean isn’t that the main reason why  would pick   BECAUSE SHE MIGHT NEED TO BECOME PRESIDENT!? JHC.  Time for Biden to get some new allies.
Biden has a island a couple of miles from Epstein island where ghislaine kept her submarine.
Hang on?  Now ignore the liberal media bullshits . Do you seriously think Biden has any chance of unseating Trump on Nov3?
If progressives  don’t vote for Biden because of Harris, then they were never going to vote for him anyway.  They’re looking for an excuse to vote for Trump.
Biden is not gonna win cause they censor- people have already decided!
Biden....yard....sign???
Betsy DeVos' family, Princes has been controlling pawns in the Senate &amp; Congress since '81. Now they want to elect Joe Biden but crickets when it comes to Betsy DeVos, &amp; her charter-school-to-prison-pipeline they all have been making money on as students enter mass incarceration.
On life support! Biden runnerup VP 😱
Sleepy Joe Biden is suffering from dementia and should be retired to live out the rest of his days in peace with his family.  VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What the USA really needs is for Sleepy Joe Biden to retire and go away!
I'm going to repeat the topic since you have a hard time keeping up. The current crime that's in his ads is trumps America Today.  not America in the 80s and not America in the 90's.   the only thing  Biden has shown is has a  record of not defunding police. which he's against
this is no Biden plan. creating another department within the police. by redirecting some funds and adding 300 million. if they meet federal mandates. it's Bidens plan. some people over on the democratic side have different ideas on how to achieve the same goal.
Ok, ok I’ll bite....who’s Joe Biden?
I BEG ppl to stop speculating abt Biden’s VP pick. We have no say in this. Our job is to #GOTV &amp; #VoteBlueNoMatterWho! That’s it. Biden is our candidate. There are plenty of positions for others in the administration. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Let's not worry about gossip about Biden's campaign. Biden will pick and amazing VP. If Kamala isn't VP surely she will head up a cabinet, or have a prominent role in the administration. I worry about negative posts about Biden when we have so much work to do just to get ppl vote
Meh. I like Harris but understand the concern. Biden never attempted to undermine Barack. He’s likely to enter office as a one term president because of his age. The 2024 campaign starts in 2022. It’s a legitimate concern IMO. Allies publicly expressing it is a different matter.
At least when he was young he was very good looking. Biden wasn’t good looking one day of his life. But good thing looks aren’t everything. Right Kathy?
This drama about closed door attacks on the possible VP choices is a storm in a teacup. Biden picked a committtee to help him select the right person. He is strong willed and independent minded: he is going to listen to the input, and do what he thinks is best. Period.
Yeah. The dems didn't learn. And don't forget how Obama/Biden treated protesters for occupy and standing rock....people have such short memories.
I think these Biden “allies” need to be named and then shown the door. This can’t be allowed to continue with only saying “allies.”
God bless whoever within the Biden team leaked that Dodd story...
Joe Biden is no different than Trump.... Biden and Obama has done and will continue the trump policy... They are in fact the engineers of Trump policy.... These policies could have never happen without the good ole corporate Democrats...  it's ok to not support Biden
Somebody is angry... wishing death on my mother, grandparents and brother. You Biden people....smdh.  They are all Democrats and they are all voting down ballot. I hope you have a wonderful evening Chris 💋
The objective is to keep every #Reaganite in place as they switch fools for the seat as potus. The objective is to be able to control the presidency as they thought they would w/ 45, but Putin changed that. Biden is weak upstairs, and they don't want no one who is strong minded.
So what you're saying is my vote doesn't matter, interesting coming from a resister. It's cool, my entire family lives in Florida, they aren't voting for Biden either
You can catch on YouTube. To paraphrase... she was asked why, if Biden is so great, she accused him of racing policies on stage in a debate (issues related to busing in 70s and 80s). She had no answer other than “it was a debate.” Decide for yourself- but for me it was craven.
Oh we’d sure as fuck see coordinated BS against Rice if she’s chosen. It’d be a bit tough watching Kamala play 2nd fiddle to friggen Joe Biden, but she’s still the best choice, IMO bc they’ll go after her prosecutorial record, crime lab scandal, and Willie Brown. But Rice?The 🌎
If Joe Biden wins it will by such a squeak and he’ll be an ineffective 4 year President who will restore a handful of programs to an Obama era flaw state before easily losing the 2024 election to Trump again or someone even fucking worse
If Joe Biden puts out any ad buys with a basic marketing ukelele track or strummy guitar as outreach to suburban white women we are well and truly f more than I thought. Just a thought.
Joe Biden doesn’t need one. Ridiculous shit doesn’t come out of his mouth When COVID comes to a town near you -you’ll think differently Factoid about John McCain, the VC was gonna let him go because he was an admiral ‘son He said NO not until all my guys go-Trump hates McCain ...
And honestly they are probably more influential VPs because the president trusts them more. No matter what you think of either, Cheney and Biden were most influential and powerful VPs in recent history.
Cool cool. What was Joe Biden’s last job again?
So was Biden a sycophant for Obama? He claimed no ambitions beyond VP and it’s why he didn’t run in 2016. Cheney for Bush? We’ve seen a trend of recent VPs being tapped for just this reason
Dr Immanuel is an  ‘Out of Africa’ movie I can watch on loop! Glad she has the testicular fortitude to take on snake oil salesman Fauci who speaks out of both sides of his mouth 24/7  The FCC should look into  what’s in appearance an in  kind contribution to the Biden  campaign
What I’m mad about is that Warren voters weren’t given the opportunity to show our  support in votes, bc of the way the Primaries are dragged out. LA just had our Primary &amp; that’s months after Biden became the presumptive nominee. I wish all Primaries were at the same time.
Shame on Jill Biden and all the fkn Democrats! Obviously this man can’t govern a nation!
If Joe Biden &amp; Dems were serious abt forming a meaningful coalition w/Progressives, then Nina Turner, an extremely qualified woman of the people, would be his pick for VP. THEN we could all move forward for an electoral win in Nov.    #DefundThePolice   #MedicareForAll
I want the candidate that will get Biden elected and Trump defeated.  Which VP nominee will ensure that?  That's the one I want.
Attention 🚨🚨🚨  Poor people....  This message from your president today is for the middle class only.....⬇️ you have been warned.  ....Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
Why are you here? Go to Biden. #GREAT2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden did terrible in the primary if I recall. More Bernie voters in Iowa then Biden. Plus Biden said he wants to give farms to blacks yesterday.
Sleepy Joe Biden has proven that he is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the far left extremists like AOC, Ilhan Imar and Rashida Tlaib.  Biden will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in the energy sector, crash the economy, and keep minorities dependent on govt handouts.
There's a reason  was afraid to run against   Biden's press conference demonstrated it:
If I were running Biden’s campaign I would take the “Sleepy Joe” nickname and run with it. After the last four years I’m pretty sure every American really just wants a nap.
Who is yelling? Am I or anyone here physically yelling at Biden over the phone?
What makes you think Joe Biden is committed to doing that? Also now you sound like a Republican here
Who's the moron who voted pedo biden?
No way! Maybe the ones who asked biden questions  should have asked Trump the same questions. Never gonna happen.
They're hiding this tweet. These evil freaking Nazis are really trying to control the flow of information even as they testify before Congress about censoring and sabotaging Conservatives to get Biden elected  PLEASE SHARE WITH ALL
What, do you think that this is the way to convince people to vote Biden? By calling them nazis if they don't support your guy? Do you see how horribly toxic this is?
Lol. The good ol Biden bros comeback. If you hold firm to left wing positions without compromise you all of a sudden become left wing. 🙄
Bernie wasn't even my first choice.   I despise Biden because at every opportunity he has proven to be a neoliberal right leaning centrist. He and Obama led us to trump. 8 years of Obama and we were barely better off.  No medicare for all. No Marijuana legalization. No thanks.
We need Sleepy Joe Biden to get a clue and wake up!  Vote Donald Trump for President 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hilarious... the democratic party has radicalized me. I'd rather see everything burn than vote another centrist milquetoast neoliberal into the white house, Fuck Biden 🖕
Yeah, Joe Biden sure did brag on his involvement publicly. He's one that'll throw that rock, and find some place to put his hand. He was placed as potential potus just like tRump was. America has been picking, and placing presidents in the shady way for decades.
Sorry guys, but you come off  sounding jealous than whatever else you're attempting to do. Sounding childish or maybe getting paid to tweet what you may think are insults.  Don't know, don't care, you are just bad for morale. I suppose loving on Joe Biden will do that to you.
Unfortunately, though I’m a strong proponent of mail-in voting, I think Ds, Indies, and Rs who intend to support Joe Biden in November need to consider taking precautionary measures and voting in person. Especially in the eastern time states of: NC, FL, GA, PA, and OH.
Joe Biden is no different than Trump.... Biden and Obama has done and will continue the trump policy... They are in fact the engineers of Trump policy.... These policies could have never happen without the good ole corporate Democrats...  it's ok to not support Biden

Hot damned  I won the #ShowMoreTweets Award. What are the chances Joe Biden is too scared, and intimidated to choose you or  If he wasn't chicken of women he would have been picked his VP. A potus should be bold, and brave; not wimp, and timid of VP choice!
Just responding to biden canvasers with hearty laughter
🙋‍♀️ vote Trump 2020 Biden is clearly showing signs of dementia!
And you aren’t concerned about what Biden’s son was doing?? There are real morons in this country.
Neither Joe Biden or Donald Trump are experts when it comes to COVID. The biggest difference between them is that Biden knows this.
Also Biden investing fully in GA will make a difference in turnout. He just hired 5 new full time staffers there, and his campaign has indicated if there is one state they will add to target list, this is it. Could have down ballot implications
GREAT QUESTION from  Mr. Biden is only a few months away from assisted living. He’s fading fast. It’s sad to watch.
Sooooo You are saying BIDEN is getting away without trying to answer questions?

Does anyone really believe that Biden will be in office for more than a year before he hands over the reigns to his VP? Seriously, he is just meant to be the foot in the door to get whomever the DNC really wants in office.
Biden isnt the best, but biden is all we got if we want a president who isnt a lying , backstabbing tyrant. Biden will listen to the issues at hand , he surrounds himself with educated and important people,not yes men and people turning a blind eye to trumps madness.
So Joe Biden needs a ‘Human Support’ companion?!  Hope she’s not chosen as  NSA 🤣
You left out Biden’s support to fight against school desegregation plans. . His actions post  these comments show a conversion. Let’s pray that the divider-in-chief will have one also before our country is destroyed! I earnestly pray that he does.
Joe Biden is more rightwing than you on so many issues.  Cut the bullshit

so what you're saying is the president doesn't have control over the cities? so why do you think biden will do anything again if it's up to the cities? especially when he didn't say he was going to cancel the police. has the police in New York been defused? quick answer no

I didn’t make a case for Biden. I’m just address the factual accuracy of your statement.
Look, I do not think anybody could do a better job. He has a crazy Democrat-Liberal - Progressive party trying to stand in the way of anything he does. But he has persevered. Do you really think Biden can do this job? NO way.
He is doing a good job. Do you truly think Joe Biden could do 1/10th as much? Get real.
So, in other words, he'll do exactly as Barrack Obama did...but worse. He'll push the harm to our nation even further. Got it. I will NEVER vote for Biden. I'll never vote for another Democrat for as long as I live!  #VoteRed #Trump2020
Incredibly, Sleepy Joe Biden is the best the dimocrats can offer up?!!  VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You mean compared to the death, turmoil, unemployment and raging pandemic we currently are experiencing? There is no doubt that Biden and his administration will get this under control. It will take months but they will do it. Trump has devistated our country.  #VoteBiden2020
Joe Biden barely knows where he is at, even in his home state, and he wants to be President!  LOL!  It would be a tragedy if he were to be elected for anything other than waste collector at a Coronavirus Testing Center.  VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Your voice gives me hope. I'm not a "praying" woman, but I "hope" President Biden chooses you for a spot in his cabinet. Possibly as AG? Wouldn't that be interesting with all the cases against the the Trump administration come 1/21?🤔    #AdamSchiffRocks
IGers, just sitting back thinking(yeah, it's not a crime, scary m.fers)and for the life of me, I'm trying to give ya'll the benefit of the doubt, with Biden, but shit just gets thicker &amp; thicker with this devil. So,…
I’m a Warren Dem. I will vote for Biden not matter who his VP pick is because right now we are on the Titanic and the iceberg is in sight.
Antifa are the Biden brown shirts.
That's a bold face lie. Many, including Biden,  were in the  gays should be jailed camp until the mid 2000s
Had to respond to prove not everyone named Jordan is an idiot, Kamala is extremely unlikable - it’s almost as bad as picking Hillary to be his running mate, most of the country is tentatively Biden right now, this could push a lot of them back the other way
Whoever it is will face a hell of a left wing primary challenge though, there will even be serious primary efforts against Biden if he runs again in 2024
There was only one irrrgularity for the fisa warrants. There are many that were fine. You know that you are reaching with the Biden issue. It was already determined he has done nothing wrong. And you know trump colludes, he is still doing it.
And they say Dems are the party of big government!   In a Biden administration, we'll bring police state repression of political dissidents back to local communities! Because who knows how to crack hippie skulls better than local cops who've targeted them for years?   #Biden2020

Summarizing  I don't know if hydroxychloroquine works though some say it does, but the demon sperm doctor would not be criticized if she hadn't criticized Fauci, and social media giants are like Chinese authorities, who just want Americans to suffer to help Biden.
No need to wonder. It’s a made-up figment of Joe Biden’s vivid imagination. Corn Pop is not real, but you probably suspected that.
Joe Biden Just doing what compassionate presidents too.
The president even acknowledged his situation in an interview  “Joe Biden is gonna be your president because some people don’t love me, maybe.” According  forecasting model, Trump has a one-in-nine chance of winning—down from one-in-five shot last month.'
Trump sending Blackwater to kidnap protesters in Portland is exactly the same as Biden's plans to force Republicans to... *checks notes*... have health insurance
Not sure this is the news maker people think. Wasn’t it just yesterday Chris Dodd seemed to speak out of turn that Harris couldn’t be trusted. This is Biden trying to clean up that mess, maybe in anticipation selections Harris, but maybe not.
What do you make of  latest thing about Dems voting overwhelmingly  through mail-in-ballots and how the states that aren't used to large numbers of such ballots will reject upwards of 7%-10% of those ballots. Thus, causing Biden to lose. a scary thought.
Seems more like a platitude to me. Joe Biden doesn't have the courage to name his VP yet.
Biden's notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris
joe biden is so stupid how did this possibly happen
What is a policy czar? Something made up for her to do all the work without the power or position?  Also, boo to those supposed Warren supporters who say they won't vote for Biden. They don't represent us. Polls show 96-100% of Warren Dems will vote the blue ticket.
Biden actually said that he was against it. lol
In Trump's America? so you mean he's scaring people that Biden is going to allow defund dispatchers...and Trump already did it?
With respect, my interpretation is that he was reminding the press that he (Biden) does not hold grudges.  If I am right, this was a way of knocking down the Dodd story from yesterday about the Biden-Harris debate exchange on busing.
show where biden said he wanted to defund the police.
People want #MedicareForAll and our elected representatives or not reflecting the values of their constituents. There will be a reckoning and the DNC is not going to like it. No one wants Trump but we don’t want Biden either. It’s their job to put out policy that actually helps.
No, I am Riding with Biden.

Joy asked a follow up question about Barr's conduct and instead of answering it, Kamala went straight into why we should vote for Biden. Two hours ago Biden said he will make his VP pick next week. Something is happening right now...
But they've to wait for Joe Biden 2b elected potus. They're hoping AG Barr gets impeached. Just stupid shit that has been pissing me off 4yrs! White ppl are very ignorant. There's no one else doing what I'm talkin about. Shit's just sad. Most ignorant ppl in office in US History.
Media looked the other way, Biden is their candidate
Anarchists have done more for this country than Joe Biden ever has or will
These committee hearings need to end.  Just an opportunity for both sides to vet.  Subject matter was all over the place.   When Biden gets elected, we will see the same.  Endless hearing.  Losers: American people

I had enough of the republicans when they all bent over and just took what trump said as gospel but trying to be a fan of democrats is so hard.  Between this and Biden never knowing where he is and Bernie getting cucked this all sucks!!  Like who is good anymore?

Joe Biden is a Reagan democrat.
I ask myself everytime I see Biden, how in the hell are Democrats gonna get him to the finish line?
you can tell Biden is really struggling and this is a staged press conference. Imagine him actually having to think dynamically. OMG
Biden looks like a staged medicated fraud at his "press conference".  Pre-selected questions, glazed eyes, and no doubt pre-medicated so his brain could handle the staged event.  Let's see Biden do a real event like the President does. All off the cuff.
Almost anyone is better than Mike Pence. So long as Biden’s VP choice has a spine, that person will do.
Biden just said when he's president "if it's a rape dial 1!"
Or Joe Biden knows that the Trump shit show is sufficiently disastrous enough that there is no need to interrupt his campaign’s implosion (although I’m sure you wish he would).
Someone get out the big hook. Pull Uncle Joe off the stage. Tell him he did a good job, give him his warm milk, a cookie and a few tablets of Aricept. #Biden

I've been thinking hard about election outcome, probs, and market reactions. Trump landslide, Biden landslide, too close to call election night either way.   Very few outcomes seem market positive, so putting on a few spy puts for Oct as portfolio protection.
You know Sherman’s March to the Sea?  Biden, Day One of presidency, needs to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Trump/Barr/GOP in same way.  Not some “honorable gentleman” like Mueller. If this person gets a hint of illegality, burn everything down to convict.

I don’t doubt Biden would do something similar except the media would ignore it because he is a “good guy” - like when Obama/Biden sent in bulldozers to crush the Occupy Wallstreet movement.
3 of the 4 articles you posted were about the same ABC poll. Swing state polls were much closer. This was a couple of outliers at a high water mark for HRC. Trump led at several points in 2016. Since clinching the nomination Biden has consistently been up by 8 to 10 on average.
Who's Joe Biden? What does he actually stand for? Can he say #Reparations, #CharterSchoolToPrisonPipeline? Has he ever said anything negative about Betsy DeVos as he stated he's going to erase Republican college students' loans by placing inexperienced teachers for culture shock?
That's apples to oranges. You're comparing individual polls with an average. There are polls now showing Biden up by 15 or more. You're a troll account that retweets debunked photoshopped tweets. Good day, sir.
Not being snippy or a smart ass, just relating the facts as they stood then, within the character limits of Twitter. Yes, she was ahead at times, but never as durably, or as widely, as Biden. I worried the whole time that she might lose, but Biden's lead seems much more secure.

Who are the people who voted for pedo biden? I want to see what morons look like !
I tired of these streaming committee hearings.  Not impressed with the Dems questioning and the Reps are pushing law and order.    Who's winning?    Nobody.  Same endless hearings will happen when Biden becomes prez.  Who wins...not the American people.
I don't know about the constant committee hearings in DC.  What does it accomplish?  Yes, it gives committee members an opportunity 2 vent their case, get under the skin of those testifying but rarely do we get a "gotcha" moment.  When Biden becomes president,GOP will do the same
Thing is I don’t believe Biden - I think his actions over his life in politics are a better predictor of what his administration would be like than his words now.

How when she would be in the minority for generations to come? Do you see the make up of SCOTUS and Thomas is going to retire before Biden is in office if he wins.
I think Joe Biden’s campaign should put out a video.  It’s a blank canvas. You hear Joe Biden’s voice.  “I got this ad so you could have 30 seconds. Close your eyes remember what it was like when Barack was President.“  The logo fades in.  “November 3rd, Check your registration.”

Love living in a country where what disqualifies Kamala Harris from getting the VP spot is the one good thing she ever did.  To be clear, I don't want her in power because of her record as a stooge for the neo-liberal police state, but apparently that's what the Biden stans LIKE.

and yet they don't do anything. Why would that be? Holding buying selling since before 2008 here. This thing will never end and they are banking on the election to go Biden's way and then all is done. this continues to be the earths biggest scam
My takeaway here: they're gauging public opinion, Biden like Harris, and Dodd does not.  She's the pick.
This is a norm that Biden has some control over, I'm very weary to have yet another one bite the dust. I would worry that if Biden makes stipulations like this one and Trump balks, we'd never have another presidential debate.   On that note, the debates are useless anyway...
Let's all tell him how to achieve that.
No way biden gets on a stage with him
No way in hell I won't vote for Biden, but I don't wouldn't trust her either if l was Biden. She seems to power hungry for me, can't turn on the TV without seeing her.
Oh please ! If they can protest non stop , have a week long funeral for racist old prune and a week long funeral for a thug then they can handle debates! They know biden can’t form a full functioning sentence lol
It’s a dangerous strategy. Most won’t recall that Carter’s central argument against Reagan was that he was insane. Debates helped cast Reagan as thoughtful, rational and warm to the public.   Biden isn’t senile. Consider this: most 77-year-olds don’t spend 12 hours on the trail.

The Democrats will use their mothers to acquire power  Just look how they’re using a clearly incapacitated Joe Biden with a straight face.   Unbelievable!
Among likely/registered voters Trump was,on March 26, 51% disapprove 46% approve,now Trump is at 56% disapprove,40% approve ( May 25, Biden was up 5.8% nationally, he is now up 8.2%.Protests have been happening in that time span (
I marry Joe Biden now.

Biden reluctantly agrees to appear on Meet The Press and is asked about the protests and regales the nation with an unrelated story about drinking sarsaparilla back in ‘58 then forgetting his train of thought and muttering to The Void for twelve seconds??
That’s ok. A *real leader*, Joe Biden, our next *legitimate* POTUS will pay his respects. Two friends holding the same ideals.
Of course you are centering an old white dude. Biden seems like the type who appreciates being challenged to be a better person.
Joe Biden would be THE worst President this country would ever have, worse than even Jimmy Carter, by far.  The only person that would benefit from his election, would be his corrupt son.
Listen, I don’t like Joe biden and I thought he wouldn’t win the election. Yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that he will most likely win this election since the polling data has been indicating trump is only losing supporters rather than gaining them.
is such a liar! Still trying that debunked lie of his.Biden stated he did NOT support defundng the police! Biden wants to give more money to help reform, educate, take care of police mental health, and give more training.
It's comedic that Chris Wallace thinks he asked 45 "tough questions". He asked his questions that any low-level dept director should be able to answer and 45 looked like he got hit over the head. Biden was VP ffs. He comes into this with more experience than 45 has even today.

The pearl clutching is hilarious.  "Romney didn't win, did he?" Reid said in response"  The only difference here is Biden won, Harris lost.
Yall say all the things about #Biden that you shoulda said about #Obama but were afraid too because he was (half) black with a dark skin wife. Now you're trying to look edgy and rebellious. You wouldn't even have known who he was without Obama.
Biden/ Democrats/ MSM= destruction of American freedom and ushering in NWO! Half the nation isn’t batshit crazy!
Watch. Enjoy. But don’t give them money.   Donate to a local race, to a senate or house candidate in a close race, or to Biden. They’ll be fine.
How???? Just look at our current President. Biden could have Alzheimer’s and still be more present than Trump

If #Biden becomes President, what will actually change?  You still have a Republican controlled Senate.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden support, Trump voters fervent
While this is pathetic, it’s even more pathetic if you vote based on who gets more big celebrity endorsements. Biden will have plenty of celebs lined up, Trump gets...whatever this is, but we won’t get anything but the status quo and a further dissolving middle class either way.
Looks very much like no matter which man wins there will be a civil war but Trump has a better chance of quelling violence than Biden!
I love my President!  Get Biden out of the basement!
When Donald Trump said Joe Biden wanted to "de-fund" police Chris Wallace jumped to his defense &amp; said that was not true, he just wanted to reallocate.  Now Joe Biden's handlers tell Wallace Biden is "unavailable" for an interview.  I'm guessing Wallace will defend that too. ;-)

Take this ballot seriously. Stop worrying about Veepstakes. Stop swishing around the bad taste in your mouth abt Biden—who cares if you don’t like him?? You’ll really hate the endless totalitarianism of Trump. It won’t be 4 more years. It will be Trump after Trump.
Check your registration and find out if/when you can vote early. It won’t matter how low his polls are or how good things look for Biden. We have to vote no matter how paranoid we are about the outcome. Democrats are concerned abt Trump contesting the election, but that doesn’t

This sounds no different than any other petty and vain things I read that happens amongst politicians, rather than some unique microagression against the women. They've all got big ego's. Difference is, Biden is the one who holds the cards.

I often chuckle at how abrasive and belligerent the Trump fundraising Emails are. Meanwhile Joe Biden continues to blow up my damn phone with emails and texts “humbly asking” for me to give “if I can” so we can beat Donald Trump, and I am OK with it.
If any Democrat is delusional enough to think Joe Biden or any Democrat will ever be able to work with Republicans in a post Trump era see "Trojan Horse Candidate".  They are so far passed the edge of reality and delusion bordering on authoritarian insanity.

I'm going to vote for Mr. Biden in hopes of seeing the return of a sense of sanity to the presidency!
Yes. We need to change a lot about our country.   The most important thing that needs changing right now is the President.   Either we stick with Trump or switch to Biden.   If we stay with Trump, we are fucked.   It is that simple.
Rupert Murdoch’s son and daughter-in-law drop more than $2 million to help elect Biden and Democrats
My perspective?  That we need reform, but Trump is actively destroying our country and a vote for anyone BUT Biden is a vote for trump?   You don’t even know my perspective.
I love how he thinks any of us actually care about biden. Lol
You are living in a dream land   That only happens if Biden gets elected and the crazy old man doesn’t have a chance.
Biden could bitch slap everyone there and wouldn’t lose a vote! You remember like when Trump could shoot someone on 5th ave &amp; still win except for the fact that he loses in the biggest landslide in election history! You know like what’s gonna happen on Nov 3rd pin head!
Why do you think I nominated Biden?  I’m just sitting through the shit like the rest of you.
Because I want real options instead of Biden sux and Trump sux?
1.) told ya so 2.) trump never gives direct orders, he'll use plausible deniability a la "who will rid me of this meddlesome priest" 3.) he'll dangle a pardon to whomever arrests biden and then slowwalk or delay biden's release and/or the election
With the state of his dementia, Joe Biden couldn’t pass a kindergarten basic skills test.
So you don’t actually believe change is possible?  I don’t give a shit what Biden does.  I want to know what the REAL progressive candidate does in four years.  Do you think Trump is going to fix it for you?
He said he left the Democratic Party and he would not vote for Biden unless he adopted the desired platform.  So, if Biden doesn’t, whose your next choice?
So, who is the unicorn you’ll be voting for that will grant all our wishes?  I agree with Ryan’s desire.  I disagree that anyone electable will come along.  So the choices are Biden and Not Fascism.
Biden’s Calvary is on the way, i can hear the ground rumbling, that’s them Biden horses coming to save the day!
No he’s telling people to vote for NOT BIDEN.  so who SHOULD we be voting for?
The internet is forever  Beijing Biden!!!
Who did?  Again, your ad hominem arguments have no value or weight here.  I am not advocating for Biden.  I’m just saying it’s too late to prop up an alternative and all you dipshits are going to vote for fascism by proxy
I agree with majority of Biden’s campaign but he’s a terrible person and also a pedophile. Honestly I wish Bernie didn’t drop out 😕
It’s totally the right time for that.  But Ryan wants NOT BIDEN to do it for us and that will not happen this election.
Does BLM and ANTIFA work for Trump? No they work for Biden and the Democrats! Why has not one Democrat denounced the violence being committed by these groups? 💥goes your premise!
Then SAY that.   You send some real mixed fucking messages.  And if Biden doesn’t?  What then?   You throw your vote into the wind?  I don’t like Biden, but I don’t like stormtroopers more.
No pep talk needed😡 Nov 3, VOTE BIDEN.  #makewhitehouseblue
is called the Lincoln Project because they are fighting to save the Union. Its political theory now - democracy v authoritarian dictatorship. Lets get Biden in so we can debate Democracy differences in 2024.
Senator, if you are not the VEEP candidate, I hope there is a high position of authority for you in the Biden administration.
SURPRISE SURPRISE! Sleepy, creepy Mr. Magoo is “ not available “ to do an in-depth interview with Chris Wallace, as President Trump did last week. Mr. Trump fielded all the tough questions. Biden can’t construct a sentence. He’s PETRIFIED.
Ryan is not calling for a Biden presidency.  He is calling for a new candidate altogether.
Ah yes.  That’s me.  I think the time is in 4 months.  But we won’t be able to change anything this close to the election.  Biden is not my choice.  But Trump has brought us to the brink of civil war.
You are absolutely correct.  And maybe Biden will listen.  But trying to jack someone new into the program at this late date will fuck us all in the ass.
Why would Biden suppress his own votes ?
This isn’t about voting for Biden.  Ryan is calling for something else entirely - a new candidate, a new system, and we need to stabilize before we can do that.
After the election.  Biden is a stopgap. But we can’t do 4 more years of Trump.  And it is far too late in the process to push a full change forward.
This isn’t a war.  Trump is a narcissist.  Biden is senile.  Covid is scary.  Quarantine is being mishandled.  Racism is real.  Protests aren’t helping anything.  This isn’t war.

Maybe these "moms" are all the suburban house wives of which he speaks. Maybe Joe Biden has turned them all against him already. Now if he can only find a way to blame Obama. 🤔
Hypocrites all?  Did I misunderatand that?  I am voting for Biden. I hope he choses a running nate he has confidence in.  That's his choice.
Warren has the highest negative rating of all potential picks. How is it hypocritical in politics? I'd love to hear your analysis of Warren's ability to increase the likelihood Biden's election relative to Harris' based on the data that is out there ----that's the qualification.

Biden has some questionable occurrences from his past that are very notable to be sure -- but Trump was NEVER QUALIFIED to hold the office to begin with, and he continually proves it time &amp; time again with each passing day  For me, November can't get here fast enough 😒

Y’all notice dems don’t ever be advocating voting for Biden..all they do is reinforce how bad we need to beat Trump   This is the impasse that I’m at   #NeverTrump though
People keep rallying for EW to be VP, but can never point to anything she’s done...for black people. Her supporters keep talking about her progressive policies, BUT it’s not about her policies! She would be there to support Biden’s policies. Harris is more aligned with him not EW
I was under the impression that it would not matter if he didn’t concede bc he ceases to be commander in Chief Jan 20, 2021, but apparently they anticipate violence &amp; warn that this could undermine Biden. Basically a final unraveling of rule of law, etc.
You don’t think Biden is senile?   Have you watched all his videos?
Biden already proved he can fix a country after a nepotist moron screwed it up. He can do it again. Biden is uniquely qualified to lead another national recovery.
Even when the hate is clearly disproportionate yo the accusation.  Even when the hate is disproportionate yo the hate we direct at say Biden for tara reade. The accusation against Shahid is essentially he flirted with me a couple times and I wasn't interested.
Please don’t list those people together in the same group again. If someone is endorsed by Biden or Harris (gag) it would make me less likely to support them not more.
I like it, but er have to get Biden out of the basement. Set the dates for the Debates!
Biden's will be a sailboat parade. Fuck stink boats!
But the problem is that so does the modern Obama/Clinton/Biden wing of the Democratic Party, there are plenty of examples that could have been used from the neolibs that would fit perfectly, this was finely crafted propaganda that Carlin would spit on.
And yes, I’ll vote for Biden in November because he’s all we have, but it is a terrible choice and both parties have sold out to corporations—Dems are just less awful in the way they treat minorities
Coronavirus US: polls put Biden ahead of Trump as deaths top 1,000 a day – live
Anyone using George Carlin to prop up Biden clearly wasn’t listening to anything Carlin said
Ted Cruz is “opposite man.” Whatever he says. Biden should do, Biden should do the opposite.
Everything Trump touches dies.   In #100days, we can choose if our country will go the way of:  🔘 Trump Casino 🔘 Trump Steaks 🔘 Trump Water 🔘 Trump University 🔘 The New Jersey Generals 🔘 The Trump Foundation  We can’t let that happen.   Vote Biden. No matter what.
Warren holds people accountable. Thats why I like her. If Harris isn't VP, she needs to be the next Supreme Court nominee, not AG.  And Biden loses a lot of black support going back on his promise to have a candidate who isn't ethnically like him, so I don't see it being Warren.
The problem with this video is George Carlin would have included Democrats in this as well - especially Biden types.
and I'm sure Warren will be part of that. I listened to a sorority call this week where Sen. Harris spokeabout "being at the table" .  Leads me to the conclusion that because Biden has committed to having a person of color and a female as his running mate, it's probably her.
Warren is amazing, I agree. Biden has committed to having a person of color as a runing mate, so my remarks are coming from that POV. Harris also helps more in the new swing states-Texas, Florida, Georgia. Biden gets to chose who he trusts to push the agenda and where +
I’m hoping it will be like the 1984 election landslide but the part of Reagan will be played by Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

First, I'm the wife of a retired paratrooper. Probably not the right one to ask that question to. Second, if you look at the bills she's introduced, they fall in line with the platform consistently Finally, I hope to God Biden chooses someone who disagrees with him sometimes.

This makes sense considering Warrens age and would pull some of the folks that didn't like Biden to him.
See how smart Biden is. What I really like is how quick he can admit he's made a mistake and change coarse . Everyone makes mistakes but some people have trouble admitting their mistakes so they cause more problems by not correcting their errors.

But why are you using stuff he said from way BEFORE he even ran for president and holding onto that 14/15 years later to dislike him? I’m looking at the now and Biden said his nasty comments about kids RECENTLY and keeps on saying dumb shit.
So sad. I applaud you, sir! But listen...you're not even going to believe this. Your grandma came to me in a dream and told me to vote Biden. And that is true because I say it is. I'll paint her doing so if need be. She also said, yikes on those unholy thoughts about Ricky Martin

WTF is going on,i hate trump and Biden
Also, if he doesn't pick her, expect a same day release from Harris saying she turned him down or chose to remain in the Senate and for her to then go on a swing for Biden through states where she's strong. And plenty of interviews repeating this. She's a respected player now
But I will agree with you on the candidates. But trump has at least kept his word on stuff he said he was going to do and he did it and is still trying to help this country. Biden is just all wrong on so many levels.Joe Biden is a demented old man, nothing personal but it happens.  Democrats could at least offer up someone who is not being lead off stage, by hand,  like a blind man. A person that is coherent

Ryan WTF the election is right around the corner. Your candidate didn't win. You flipped from Warren to Sanders, now you're just angry and want the entire party divided. Trump or Biden. What is it going to be those are your only options. Are you compromised.
Forcing Joe Biden to hold a coherent train of thought or force him into making an intelligible sentence at this stage is a form of elderly abuse!
Ryan you're not making alot of sense. I've been following you for about 4 years. You thought Elizabeth or Bernie was winning the nomination, so you didn't have these arguments. Now the Dems are so bad for you. Trump or Biden or your choices that's it. Supreme Court is at Stake.
That’s right, keep it up!!  Vote for Biden and in 6 months no one smiles except Soros.
Look at this picture of the union backing Biden that wants an overseas dimension to the industry!!  How very generous of y’all
I agree with Art about the elections, turn China flu back on the democrats and force Biden out of hiding!!!
After your candidates lost the primary, because you were pushing 2 of them. Now you have no party all of a sudden. Ryan the Supreme Court is at Stake. I'm Black I can't take these chances you are willing to take. Election around the corner your only options Biden or Trump.
I'm not trump, I'm a servant of JESUS and fyi Biden supports baby dismemberment and gay rights agenda..YAHWEH absolutely does not
What baffles me is in a country with supposedly 240 million professing CHRISTIANS.there's a debate as to who to vote for,not Biden.he's a pedophile, pro baby dismemberment, and pro perversion of God's definition of marriage and love.undoubtedly trump who regularly supports prayer

I know a bit of both.  Biden? Well let’s see, I have always personally liked him. I think he’s honest. I don’t see in him the cultish autocratic populist Trump embodies. The only thing Trump and I agree is Iraq. So this:
Joe Biden has surrounded himself with radicals who want to defund the police.  Don’t let him tell you differently: He won’t give law enforcement officers the tools needed to keep our communities safe.  I’m discussing that &amp; more with   WATCH:
Louisiana. The state will go with trump but trump will never get my vote. At least my vote will go towards Biden’s popular vote.
Good we need to hear Biden answer questions.
If Biden wins this country will belong to China . Biden has already sold America to China .  His son got paid already.
150,000 dead Americans but 1% have their priorities.   "Top CEOs ramp up GOP donations as Biden threatens to scale back corporate tax cuts"
Biden reluctantly agrees to appear on Meet The Press and is asked about the protests and regales the nation with an unrelated story about drinking sarsaparilla back in ‘58 then forgetting his train of thought and muttering to The Void for twelve seconds??
Yall say all the things about #Biden that you shoulda said about #Obama but were afraid too because he was (half) black with a dark skin wife. Now you're trying to look edgy and rebellious. You wouldn't even have known who he was without Obama.
‘President Trump is lost’: Former Navy SEAL in new Lincoln Project ad makes the conservative case for Biden – Raw Story. Trump Flu
If any Democrat is delusional enough to think Joe Biden or any Democrat will ever be able to work with Republicans in a post Trump era see "Trojan Horse Candidate".  They are so far passed the edge of reality and delusion bordering on authoritarian insanity.
Biden’s Calvary is on the way, i can hear the ground rumbling, that’s them Biden horses coming to save the day!
Maybe these "moms" are all the suburban house wives of which he speaks. Maybe Joe Biden has turned them all against him already. Now if he can only find a way to blame Obama. 🤔
Tell Trump: Authoritarianism has no place in America. Trump Flu
Biden has some questionable occurrences from his past that are very notable to be sure -- but Trump was NEVER QUALIFIED to hold the office to begin with, and he continually proves it time &amp; time again with each passing day  For me, November can't get here fast enough 😒
Here’s why everyone is suddenly talking about Karen Bass as Biden’s potential VP – Raw Story
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Riding with Biden!
If you’re that stupid to vote for him — if you’re actually black and dumb enough to still vote for him after that — then you’re on your own,” Beatty added.
“ Help Is On The Way”, new Biden campaign slogan thx to Jonathan Gaffney, USN
He lost me after I read I will beat Biden Off
OMG! Is this real? 😂🤣 Biden's gonna have to get extra funding for mental health facilities.
So in conclusion, he’s saying Trump is the first racist to be elected president. Why is it so hard to admit that Biden said something dumb?
So what the hell was that that Biden didn't say today?  THAT FLUNKY!  President.....Biden, yeah, right, in your and my nightmares!!! OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP 2002 &amp; BEYOND!👍✌
Bill Clinton &amp; Biden
Yes we need a better world. But Biden will lead us in a better direction then trump. Trump is the cancer that can ruin democracy. Biden will not be a 2 term president so let Biden rid us of trump and lead us more to the left.

Is he still on that?  Hasn’t Biden done other bad things to him?  MOVE ON trump. Find something new to bitch about. We can make a crime a day calendar for years with the illegal shit you do.
Exactly!  I mean no disrespect to Biden, but I would vote for a flip flop over your pappy.
You mean like what Biden does in his basement when he’s ask questions?
What’s happening in Ukraine with Joe Biden and Hunter
Y’all do realize Joe Biden has dementia and is in too far deep the dnc won’t let him pull out and are trying to figure out who to put as VP because will have to resign as president pretty much six months after and his VP will be President.
The Lincoln Project is a bunch of RINOS &amp; dems who worked on the inside to advance the left while wearing a veneer of conservatism. Now you're reduced to failing  and phony tweets.  Stay away from these miscreants who now openly call for Biden's election
I'm ready to STORM the castle. I've made plans to be available to celebrate a Biden win and if necessary, help drag THAT RACIST, LYING TREASONOUS CRIMINAL RAT BASTARD out of OUR WH if necessary! 😉 I hope I can rely on MANY to help! 😍 #StrongerTogether

Leo Terrell Rips Biden For Claiming Trump Is The First ‘Racist’ President: "Biden Is The Racist!"
My husband reminded me of that the other day. Even if Biden wins Nov 3rd, trump doesn't actually leave til the end of January. Do u know how much damage that maniac could do in that time?
I see it as a foreshadowing of Biden beating trump's fat ass!
Looking forward to President Joe Biden.
Oh I know and masks have stopped so much of the CoVid spread especially the cloth ones that say Biden 30330 🤣🤣🤣
Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer they all have one thing in common. They are all  incompetent!
When is Biden gonna apologize? Oh, my bad, that doesn’t count
So now we believing women again? I thought that stopped when women didn’t believe the lady that filed a sexual harassment case against Biden. So, it’s on again?
My 15 month old granddaughter could repeat that. So this proves he’s not declining???
How anyone could believe there's any redemption to be found for US in Biden is beyond comprehension. My goodness the man is a blabbering mess. He's not all there! He's literally a puppet.
Joe Biden said President Trump is the first racist ever to be elevated to the Presidency. But how many early presidents owned slaves? Doesn't the left constantly tell us how the country was founded by racists? Joe is far gone &amp; needs to step aside Liberals are demented
The way Biden deals with little girls!
I still watch them to find the "hidden agendas" in their 2020 reactions to Joe Biden. Leopards only change their spots when they stop being fed. And Trump gives them the fodder to keep the momentum going. We'll see once Joe Biden's campaign comes out full force.
Biden always forgets what city he is inJoe Biden won't remember you voted for him...he smirked for years as he and his mentor Robert Byrd (former KKK) segregated schools.  He won't support Charter Schools either...leaving black families in failing schools.
Holy sh*t!! Did we get the bastard NOW?? Come on!!
What a tool. Shame on him.
You are correct.... we must work together to bring back law and order.   A peaceful country.   Dems have never accepted America’s choice of Donald Trump.   Joe Biden and his chaos will not be the answer.
Class?? Really?  That is a joke. Obama is a money and power hungry loser! Used his presidency for his personal gain, and how classy was it for him to use a funeral as a platform to campaign for Biden abd also try to divide the country just like he did for 8 year, no class Obama
I just don’t understand how anybody with an ounce of common sense can vote for #JoeBiden? It makes no sense whatsoever. I knew we had a lot of morons in the USA but I had no idea how many. If Biden wins, our country will crumble. #Biden
Vote Biden and watch what happens to America..peasant
I Do Not Care what the Republicans' "October Surprise" may be. I Will Be Voting For Joe Biden. There is absolutely nothing they can bring out that will change my mind. #EvictTrump #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
It’s a mystery to me how ANYONE could support a Biden Presidency - I was an RN in another life and I’ve dealt with dementia patients. He certainly is well on his way. I’m 71 and I have my senior moments but OMG! Now I’m NOT a physician but I do have perception unlike liberals
We are not safe NOW!! I don’t want a dictator, I want a president! Biden has my vote!!
Oh no, doesn’t she know that this means Biden loses now ?? :((
I have a question. Since 2020, how many times have you asked to interview Biden?
Biden actually helped contributed to more African American men being thrown in prison unjustfully and Trump went in and undid all his policies.  He’s liberating people!  Don’t be the fool stuck in chains.
In the face of #TrumpThreatensAmerica it is good to know we have great foundations in America for long overdue honors that prove #NobodyLikesTrump because #DumpTrump is a given! So is #DumpMitch. #VoteHimOut #Trump #Biden
Trump is gonna win again ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Biden won't concede though and will claim voter suppression. In the end you will all be crying just like you did in 2016 because you're a bunch of babies!
Biden supported Robert Byrd and even cried at his funeral. Robert Byrd, grand wizard in the KKK Robert Byrd. Wake up. Biden supports segregation and locking up thousands of non-violent poc to harsher sentences. 52 years in government and you think he will change?
Everything the lunatic does is counterproductive and harmful. I like many of Biden’s ideas and platforms—but even if I didn’t, I would vote for anyone over this narcissistic, ignorant, wannabe dictator.
I’m a lifelong Democrat and I agree with you!  I just wish he’d pick someone so people can whine and complain about it  - then get over it  and vote for Biden!

Draft AOC for VP in 2020, then let Biden turn it over to her to be elected POTUS  in 2024. She would make a smart / real POTUS. It would be a honor to vote for her
No Joe Biden must win because he’s under criminal investigation in the Ukraine. Democrats will cheat right in front of our face in order to get Joe Biden to win because they know Ukraine is not going to indict a sitting US president
I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt as every American is entitled to their own opinion, however, how can anyone support #Biden and not  Joe would be a absent Potus run by the far far left. Can’t even the average IQ Dem see that? #maga #kag #usa

OMG, that has been running so often in Louisiana. People here are really their target audience, though. I do find that ad which is so dark to be a great contrast to Joe Biden's messages of hope.

Carter IS elderly and Clinton is obviously sick , weak and reedy voice and shaky hands. Invisible 2016? I am not liar. I was presumptive in dx him as there r many neuro that can cause those things but he is not strong and well. Why didn't he endorse on tv with hrc 4 biden?

“I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August," Biden said. "I promise I’ll let you know when I do."

One comforting thought for us dems is EARLY VOTING. As biden kicking pos ass NOW. So most of these early votes will likely be ours
Joe Biden is not writing this!!!!!!
We must hope biden continues to hold this wide lead in swing states over trump. That will be the only way to prevent pos from contesting, screeching about rigged elections, etc
All being considered seem to be capable. I am just unsure which can be  the most help to the ticket
with how viciously corrupt his cronies are that can affect the election should Biden accept if he loses? We all know Trump will steal this election. It’s a known fact that even he knows we know. What happens then? What’s important is who is the military loyal to?

Ryan, Bernie's not running for POTUS in 2020 and Bernie's endorsing Joe Biden for POTUS in 2020. Only choices left for a socialist in 2020 - other than Joe Biden for POTUS - are Donald Trump and a write in choice for POTUS which is a vote for Donald Trump, as well.

I’m sure the war machine is fighting any change, but that’s a huge change that Biden wouldn’t touch.  I’m going to follow your ass again, been seeing some good tweets lately. Don’t let me down.
Biden will resist social change and allow interventionism. Contrast with Trump pulling out of Germany to the chagrin of the establishment.  Didn’t the DNC/Biden have primaries during the peak of COVID?
If Biden picks a back of marshmallows...   "S'mores are a hate crime!"  "Trump put extra marshmallows on his ice cream last night.  Sexist or racist?"  "Nougat is for queers"  "You know who else didn't like marshmallows? Hitler"
Not any longer they don’t. The lack of Biden yard signs and bumper stickers across the Nation is evidence of that thank goodness! Lol

BO THEY WANT IT TOBKEEP GOING TILL NOV 3. ITS BEING DONE TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION TOWARD JOE BIDEN. EVERYONE BUT DEMS CAN SEE THAT JOE BIDEN CANT EVEN REMEMBER HIS OWN NAME MUCH LESS MEET WITH LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. MAYBE HUNTER CAN DO IT FOR HIM C
I don’t buy Biden’s lead for a second
Obama will select Biden's running mate!!!   Obama will be the acting president if, God forbid, Biden gets elected!
Biden VP pick: Top choices for a 2020 running mate - POLITICO
I hope biden is up to it
Yes. It will be Ronald Reagan unless someone tells Biden the man passed away years ago.
Oh look the left is gonna destroy a Doctor for being against what the media told them #Demonsperm well I got news for y'all #Biden says hes a Christian so he also believes in demons can y'all accept this? Or does it not fit with your agenda of evil shit that yall do?
No way Biden debates Trump. His deer in the headlights speaks volumes. Trump would destroy Biden in a debate. The left's only excuse is playing the Covid card and tying to keep him away from the public till November.
a white man weaponizing marginalized and colonized people and using them as props to try and get ppl to vote for biden.  classical liberal racism lmaooo
Neaux Sh!t Biden might fall asleep and hit his head on the Red button and everyone on the planet will be eliminated !!! And that is a serious situation !!!!!
Prepared questions. Biden is calling on specific journalists.
A presidential candidate has declared that he will force Americans to fund Planned Parenthood. This would undo a litany of reforms put in place by the Trump Administration.   We cannot afford to decelerate the progress we have made to protect life.
He also predicted (back in Feb) that Biden would be out in 2 week and to watch out for Bloomberg as a real disrupter to the Dem nominees process.  So yeah.  😂
Young Black people,whom you called super predators, have long been part of your voter suppression efforts. You and Biden spoke rhetoric &amp; created laws that systemic racism. The #1994CrimeBill was the epitome of it &amp; it destroyed lives. #AllLivesMatter
If biden 'wins' i pray Trump will find a way to stay in power.  Our buildings, statues and suburbs need to be protected from the antifa democrats
#clownshow #yesorno? #yes #swineflu ‘09 look it up #Obama #biden why did they stop #testing?
I've been wondering how Biden was going to avoid debates in this general election, but it appears liberal universities have stepped in to help and although we've yet to see it, the liberal media will help him avoid the debate process as well.
Biden being 100% more effective than Trump is precisely the problem.
That’s because Biden doesn’t represent progress. His entire campaign pitch is about going back to Obama instead of moving forward (you know...progressing) from Trump.
It would be well worth losing the Church’s tax exempt status to guarantee that Biden does not get elected. Especially to the unborn.
Biden has had 40 years to help women and hasn’t.  You are a fool to believe he will now.
Maybe Chris Wallace should put on a skirt &amp; a wig. I bet Biden would be sniffing him up in 2 seconds flat!
Wrong.  His numbers have surged in last 10 days.  What was a 10 point Biden lead is now a dead heat or slight lead for trump.

the dnc always knows how to get me  p u m p e d to vote for joe biden
No. There are actual party platform issues that get voted on. The committee meeting was streamed on YouTube today. Historically, moderate centrist like Biden have been president during times of economic growth. Progressive candidates are not new. JFK was considered progressive
its troubling to see Biden compaign going to side with a terrorist fstate. Anti india state will not help Biden in election. A democracy should side with etablished democracy. why Biden camp ails to understand this simple fact.
Sir, elections are nearing. Biden camp is siding more nd more with india's ememies. Need 2 correct anti india stand. We will lose votes here otherwise. As NY or any other state belongs to USA, so does kashmir to india. No one can question that nd win indians' support.
Any updates on RBG? Also, does Biden have secret service protection these days?
Elect me, I will only serve for a short time and resign for health reasons and make the black Vice President, President.  Joe Biden.
Meh, fuck voting. What a scam. Trump is just Biden’s stalking horse.
Why do u ???   Prepare urself - for some pretty bad things to happen soon - y u think Fauci is not in on the briefings - its slowly coming out - u think that is really Biden - geez it’s a clone
Believe what u want too - I’m not a fan of cutting children up  -eating their body parts - drinking their blood and torturing kids with sex - blame Obama - Clinton - Biden - Hollywood - Epstein - that’s who y’all want in charge of our world - not gonna happen
Anything to help Biden the moron.
If Charles Koch himself endorsed Joe Biden you can bet the libs would start bragging about it.
For an honest and unbiased poll, Compare President Trump's twitter followers with Joe Biden's twitter followers. Then you'll have a true sense of what the people think.
Yea, it is America’s Freedom at stake against Communist Traders like you, Joe Biden , and Nancy Pelosi.
Primarily, that he isn't tRump. He wasn't my first choice, but I'll vote Blue knowing that whomever replaces tRump will have a hard road repairing the damage, and Biden at least has the political knowledge to get it done.
Every time I hear the pros and cons of Kamala Harris as VP, I go from hellz yeah to no frickin way.   Or no frickin way to hellz yeah if the cons precede the pros.

“Nothing will fundamentally change.” -Joe Biden
You're more closely associated with a cult than I. You are so focused on the narrative they are providing for you that you can't see what's right in front of you. If you want to see an honest, unbiased poll, compare the number of twitter followers Trump has to Biden's followers.
Only according to the fake news. People are leaving the Democrat party in droves because of their blatantly criminal and un-American behavior. Biden, who now has serious mental deficiencies, has no chance of beating Trump fairly.
Hard to believe that Trump will lose to him.  How terrible do you have to be to get beat by terrible Joe Biden?
I agree. What if Jill Biden doesn't care for roses?
A bunch of low life unemployed scumbags have so much times for polling. Comes November? Biden will be dumbfounded!  Trump is losing big to Biden in voter polls. Here’s how this will likely play out on Election Day  via
A little more than a theory. Joe Biden has officially been named in a Ukraine criminal investigation into the firing of that prosecutor, Joe threatened to hold a billion dollars over. Ukraine is saying the investigation could end up including the crime of treason.
By Biden’s supporters....
Yes it is ! If he were white - they would be silent ! Maybe u should remember what Biden said if u ain’t black - well u know the rest !
No the Democrats made it public hoping to get Trump but it failed because he did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Biden told Ukraine that he and Obama would withhold a billion in loans from them if they didn't fire the prosecutor that was investigating Hunter, which they did.
2/2) Zelensky. And even Zelensky said that Trump did nothing wrong. Isn't it interesting that Trump was cleared of that but Biden was recently named in a criminal quid pro quo investigation in Ukraine?
1/2) Well see, you need it explained to you. He did NOT use his power to benefit himself. He is head of the U.S. government. A crime involving U.S. money was being committed by Joe &amp; Hunter Biden. Trump was well within his rights to bring it to the attention of President
Trump won fairly and legally. Had Hillary won in the same way, you wouldn't have a problem with it. Trump will win again. Biden is unfit and his popularity exists only in the articles of fake news outlets.
O but he does !  I’m not the least bit mad - just the fact that he’s never around - hiding - won’t do interviews- aren’t u a little curious !  Maybe just maybe he is a clone- would the real joe Biden please stand up !
Well u see Biden likes the underage ones !
so many biden simps showed up in my timeline today
Hahaha - Biden is a pedo - sweetie /  did u not know this and he owned Epstein’s island - oops that wasn’t out yet !!   We can’t have pedos in the White House or u into that too ✌️
If Biden gets elected the middle and upper class are gonna get taxed out the butt..
Two reasons you nominate someone as  pitiful as Biden:  1) You know Trump loses regardless of his opponent. You simply wouldn't risk rubbing a candidate with significant cognitive issues if you thought it was a close race.  2) You know Trump will win regardless of opponent.....
Biden hasn't done a thing in all the years he's been in office. Biden committed quid pro quo. Biden has basically been indicted in Ukraine. Biden doesn't know where he is or what day it is. Biden's people won't let him debate Trump. Nah, Biden will never be president.
"BY BIDEN'S BEANS" sounds like an amazing curse.   "By Biden's beans, we're in trouble now"

I’m not voting for Biden or Trump.
Trump is disliked by DNC and GOP. Biden is liked by DNC and neocon wing of GOP. Progressives didn’t recognize the opportunity presented by Gabbard and now they’re siding with the establishment. Y’all have been played.
Like I SAID, NO Biden signs or bumper stickers in Jersey BUT lots of Trump signs and stickers! Look around YOUR City and State and start counting the signs, many of them will look the SAME! 😂
Yeah, well, Arizona is a very conservative state. And that should tell you something about Biden.
Yes. That’s why Biden isn’t saying much (if anything at all) about it.
Biden has surrendered America to the enemy. Trump must be elected.
Well, that certainly wouldn’t be Biden!

JUST IN: Joe Biden reveals astonishing new plan for his first 100 days in office. He will benevolently ignore pressing issues in hopes they will go away or solve themselves. “It’s a bold plan, thing, to just sit there and do nothing. But someone has to do nothing”, he said.
This will be Joe Biden’s America. Scared yet libTURDS.
Confusing corruption for philosophy and blaming everyone else for the failures of your chosen ideology. You’re fighting for the wrong things.  If you vote Biden you’re really misguided. Despite his many flaws, Trump is more for the people than Biden has ever been or will ever be.
Biden will not be interviewed, debated, or allowed to govern if elected. He is the true Manchurian Candidate. We’d be better off with Chauncey Gardiner.
Y’all crack me up with the hillbilly references, etc.  go run and vote for senile Joe Biden.  You have to really be crazy.
He’d rather resign than sit through Biden’s inauguration.
He knows he will lose in an honest vote. Now begins the process of trying to de-legitimize Biden's win and cling to power.

A whole 3 of you? The photo is very obviously photoshopped. What I don't get is why if you went to the trouble to photoshop a photo, why not photoshop a crowd of supporters. Makes about as much sense as a Biden speech.

Clearly you're a comedian. I'll say this to you trumpsters &amp; call it a day. I voted for Obama\Biden, I didn't worship them. If either of them or ANY Democrat said; "as President, I can do ANYTHING I want". I would be the 1st one in front the White House demanding they resign.

This is incorrect. Here are the facts:  1. Biden has called for $300m in additional police department funding  2. Senate GOP blocked House Dem bill, HEROES Act, which gives $900 BILLION to state &amp; local governments  🚨3. Trump is proposing a 58% CUT to the COPS hiring program
The Great Recession started in December 07. Obama\Biden took office in January 09. The recession ended in June 09, that's a 5 month recovery from what was then the 2nd worst recession in USA history! Google it. It's the 3rd worse now that trump has the record worst unemployment!
Total agree with you EXCEPT for the fact if they have mail in voting they cheat, win, Biden incompetent-BAM Killary is President. WE MUST DEMAND #VOTERID 🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸

The more i read up on this man and how he has BEEN for the people the more it baffles me that y’all focused on Joe Biden
I'd rather see Susan Rice as SecState. Val Demmings as VP could help swing FL into the blue column...
Biden is the DNC. See what the DNC did to Sanders and his supporters in 2016 and 2020. See what the DNC did to Tulsi Gabbard. Andrew Yang.  With what some consider an existential threat in the WH, the DNC told the working class to fuck off and threw the primary in favor of corps.
The 2020 election might end up being a contest between Nikki Haley and whoever Biden picks as presidential candidate.
I am not from the USA but sometimes the Biden bros get angry because they assume there is only one country.

Or you’ve only started paying attention. Biden absolutely will be more tyrannical.
Biden would be more tyrannical domestically, but he’d be more polite about it and stab you in the back. CNN and NPR would run interference for Biden and those pulling the strings.  Biden is worse than Trump.
If you roll the dice on Biden you’ll lose. Third party is infinitely better.
If Joe Biden truly wants to become president, he need to stop pulling the Trump card. Leave all of that aiming low shit to 45. We all know you’re the better candidate...just show us why we should make you 46!!!

Will Joe Biden repeat Obama's mistakes? Because repairing our damaged democracy is critical
Biden is a product of the Obama regime, if you vote for him you’re an idiot
There's no urgency from congressional GOP leaders. It's as if they've decided Trump's reelection is gone, their Senate majority is gone with him, and so they are content to leave Biden with a depression.
Rust Belt: Wisconsin shows a similar pattern to other Rust Belt states: strength for Biden in cities like Milwaukee, but more donors for Trump in other areas. Biden also attracted donors in college towns like Eau Claire, La Crosse and Stevens Point.
And it goes the other way around, too. As he pointed out, the Biden campaign reached out for a PMT interview. I think Big Cat was right to decline. Same principle applies
For a much more realistic and unbiased poll, just compare the twitter followers of Donald Trump to the followers of Joe Biden. Of course Liberals will say something like "but that's not an ACTUAL poll, so it doesn't mean anything." Riiiight.
If Biden is really that weak that Ryan criticuzing him is “single-handedly” re-electing Trump, you need to start asking why you picked that weak of a candidate.

I think Susan Rice is the front runner at the moment for Biden. She's solid, has foreign policy chops to offset his deficiency in that area, and she's tenacious. Biden has also worked with her before. That familiarity will count for a lot with him.

Maybe you didn’t know that Biden was a stutterer when he was young. That’s huge to overcome! Plus lost his first wife and baby girl in a horrible car accident which the boys, Beau and Hunter were in as well. He was left a single parent raising 2 young sons.
It’s all according to who he picks for VP. If he chooses wrong, I will be writing in my own name because I am smarter than both Biden and Trump.
Biden will save America and bring all people back together.  All races will once again enjoy America’s democracy.  Biden has a plan to get rid of the trump virus.
Here's the problem. If the Biden wins, Conservatives will know it's because of fraudulent voting and the election has been stolen. Conservatives will not allow that. If Trump wins, Democrats will say that Russia hacked the election and threw it for Trump so they don't have to

Unemployment was over 10% when Obama\Biden took office. It was 4.1, when trump was sworn in. trump bragged of getting it down to 3.5, that a half point drop. O\B dropped it 6 whole points. In April it went to 14.7%, the highest in US history! What drugs are you folk on?
Ok how ?  Biden / Clinton and Obama hate Americans
They need to have fun with the virtual fan thing. Put Trump and Biden in the crowd sitting next to each other. Fill up the stands with celebrities. "Taylor Swift, Michael Jordan, Bill Gates and Prince Harry are all at tonight's game. Along with Elvis, Tupac and Jim Morrison."
Gotta love that. Biden has his issues but like,,, the alternative is so horrible
You voted for one of the others, but thanks to election fraud you voted for Biden.  😂
I noticed the exact same thing down South after a guy from New Jersey said he hasn’t seen a single Biden sign or sticker but Trumps were everywhere! 😂
I can’t help but laugh when I see your comment and the very 1st reply is a “genius” claiming a million Republicans will vote Biden and that THEY are the “silent majority” then look at the likes, yours are 20k &amp;theirs didn’t even top 50!!! 😂
The answer is why wouldn’t he? He’s not trump. And I’ll be working to make sure Biden is a one term as well. We have to get rid of the two party. Bigger picture.
90% of Trumps ramblings are mindless bullshit-full of lies and nonsense. That’s much different than Biden making a few gaffes, partly because he has a life long stuttering problem (which has nothing to do with his cognitive abilities btw) And viable? He’s kicking Trumps ass-so🤷‍♀️
Obama pardoned many more! Even his aunt who was ordered to leave years ago, he allowed her to stay. Biden, no way.
Joe Biden criticizes Trump? Be real because you know that’s a damn lie. Sell your soul for a job. Love Fox but you need replacing
Biden has always been the dumbest, most corrupt guy in the room. He will be kept hidden until Election Day.
If you vote for anyone other than Biden at this point you’re voting for Trump. I don’t get why it’s so hard to understand. One issue voting right now, get him out of the White House. Fuck that. We can’t do shit while he is on office.
Joe Biden calls Trump the country’s ‘first’ racist president.
I mean, there is a reason not to vote Biden, by that logic. It literally accomplishes nothing unless you live in a swing state. Vs. voting third party and getting them the 5% they need to make this country a real democracy.
Michiganders, only expect more of this insanity if Biden is elected. Get courage. Do what you have to do.
First of all, it’s nowhere near that dramatic. Both sides mean death and fascism, Biden’s just going to be slower about it. Second, 90% of the country has no say in this election because their state’s results (the only results that matter) were predetermined.
I wouldn’t vote joe biden not because of this but because on a spiritual level
Perhaps it's because they understand they will lose and are laying the groundwork to pin the deficit and the economy on Biden and his party.
Unfortunately, in the last 7 days race has closed to a dead heat.  Unfortunately for joe Biden.  Trump on a roll.
Platform contains language protecting Iran regime; Sanders staffers working on weakening Israel protections.  Tells you everything you need to know about the current Dem party.
The 2020 election in the USA is gonna be about Trump's ability to inspire liberal and leftist voters to get him out of office, competing against Biden's ability to depress the youth vote.
The fact that Biden is mostly missing in action means the Republicans will keep shaping the discussion in such unreal ways with little pushback.   Their goal is not to convince anyone, just to pander to their voting base to get them to vote, while depressing opposition vote.
Hard to keep up with cancel culture.  So, are Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, and Wilson now un-cancelled?
So you haven't heard about the Chicago mayor who ran police black sites where people could be held indefinitely without charges. That guy also happens to be one of Biden's top advisors.
They screaming because trump is coming.  10 Points made up in 10 days.  China, Biden’s cash cow has turned into consulates of crime, and anarchists have hijacked peaceable protests and Biden must abideThe former since the Democrats will do anything to get Silver Mane I mean Joe Biden POTUS.
I have only voted once in my 40 year life. Obama’s first presidency. I wanted to see a black man as President.   I will be casting the second vote of my life this year.   For Biden.
Excellent! Keep imploding.
Whom ever they pick for him. It will have to be a woman of color, or they will be all over him after saying that he would pick one. All that pandering and patronizing for naught.
If you’re willing to vote for Biden and destroy my community and the values of the people: WE AINT FRIENDS
You're welcome!  Now go vote for Biden! ;-}
Exactly my point. Let’s be quick to accuse but patient before exonerating anyone. Joe Biden, Donald Trump, not even Santa Claus has impunity.   Anyone &amp; Everyone Needs to be brought to Justice.
It's pretty sad when Obama has to use the funeral to campaign for Joe Biden.I bet John Lewis was honored to be  able to provide the spotlight for Obama to campaign for Joe Biden.I know the Dems are desperate, but this is disrespectful. Biden could not talk for himself?
Sad when they have to campaign for Biden at a Funeral.  I'm sure John Lewis felt so honored to be the spotlight for Joe Biden's Campaign.  Way to go you low life Demonrats.
He did that's why Mr.obama is the best president ever lived in the white House.And Biden will get his chance to do just that to be the Greatest
Tell me about Biden.
yea Biden is trying to steal it. Ass hole.
Don’t blame Trump blame the Communist who made us want change,you know one of them running for President this year Biden
I don’t worry about Biden one bit. He is a kind man who will surround himself with smart &amp; competent people with the common goal of putting America, her people and the environment first. Plus RBG can retire with peace of mind. I’m not worried AT ALL;I am happily in Joe’s camp!
Trump Keeps Attacking Biden For His Gaffes, But Has A Fair Share Of His ...  via
Biden touched his daughter too?? 😳😳😳
Mr. President  , any thoughts on corrupt, racist, slave-owning  as Biden's running mate?😂😂 #MAGA2020 #KAG2020
"Biden has officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person."
I think the correct word would be "Horrific", not historic. Biden and his little Socialist/Communist darling will put us back into the horse and buggy ages.
Remember this Biden and all you dumbass white people.👍
It’s unbelievable and will not get better until Biden takes office.  How many more will die?
Biden alone in his basement?👍😏
Democratic Congress is disgraceful dishonest worse than President Nixon! President Nixon paid his price but Democratic Congress never ADMIT ANYTHING like Joe Biden involved w/ Ukraine’s pocket for Hunter Biden’s B! Bill Clinton never admit 4 women sexual misconduct in Ar, Monica!
BS how that’s possible AD Barr told Jerry Nadler, Andy Schiff, Pelosi  been saying 3 years Ex FBI Peter Strzok find no evidence against Russia Collusion against President Trump! Ukraine, impeachment 4 years Zip! Democratic Congress broke dam laws! Joe Biden was involved Ukraine!
Jerry Nadler! AG BARR said you class act but USA people look at you as idiots and disgraceful dishonest liars plus you broke the laws as Ukraine, Impeachment plus ExFBI Strzok,McCabe, Comey tied up with President Obama’s also Vp Joe Biden written on January 2017! No evidence!?
I've long said I'd vote for a potted plant than Trump, so Biden and a rock sounds even better than that.
Oh, she has the edge alright. She's Hussein's ultimate flunky and she has the Dirt on Alzheimer's Joe. It is scary just to think if this sanctimonious, treasonous, seditious and felonious individual get's the nod.
That’s sad that you are Democratic Party! Democratic Congress don’t own our country! Democratic Congress changing became SOCIALIST! Look at Cuba, Russia, China is trying take over Hong Kong,  AOC, Bernie Sanders is influence Joe Biden’s ear plug! Joe Biden doesn’t how run USA!
Because his son Hunter Biden was involved marijuana and kicked out in Navy. I only support marijuana for medical reasons as ills,dying patients
Join Republican Party! Democratic Congress is disgraceful dishonest to USA! Medicare for all will kill 180 million private insurance jobs! Need rid of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe Biden!
Joe Biden isn’t leading and trumps 49% approval Rae agrees
Biden's Basement?
That's their Neferious Plan. He's being used like Patton was for D-Day. Biden is a diversion. All smoke and mirrors.
What do you think other's and "I" have been saying. We would become the USSA (United Socialist States of America) and "Soylent Green is People" would become a reality.
I just can't wait to see how liberals handle these protests when Biden is (potentially) in office.
Read this thread. Biden and Pelosi are trying to claim Trump is attacking peaceful protestors. Nadler says Antifa is a myth. They claim violent cities are a result of Trump’s Covid. Democrats are lying.  Here is the proof. See for yourselves. How can you trust these politicians?
neither do biden or trump

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.    DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU YET AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Tell me what's wrong with this headline when you read it?😂👍
I don't make more than $400,000/year, so my taxes won't go up according to Biden's tax plan.
Don't tell Pelosi or Biden...
He must be voting for Biden...
Concentrate not on Antifa; not China Virus; nor corrupt politicians; nor DOCA; those are merely smoke screens to alienate the voters that are on the fence; anyone that would vote for Biden, cannot be swayed. They are for socialism. Talk to True Americans and get them to vote.
Rumor has it Gov JBE could be up for a cabinet position if Biden wins. After shaming liberals into voting for an anti-choice Dem to keep the GOP out of the governor's mansion, he might be handing it over to them in a matter of months.   Politics is a game, and we are the pawns.
Not kidding ;-P  Biden isn't my first choice, or 5th choice, but he's someone who I think listens to his advisors, meaning he's more of a team player, which is what we need right now to build up our executive branch to where it should be.
If you look into the burisma scandal, it makes no sense that Biden or his son were involved in that company's corruption. Hunter was literally hired to make them seem more legit, so why would they involve him in the stuff that wasn't?
This is, honestly, where Biden shines over Trump for me.  I think he'd do a better job hiring good people into all those other positions.
You don't think the Trump family is doing that?  If you are going to reveal information about Biden to sway votes, then you need to pick something that your candidate isn't guilty of.
I'm not giving Biden or anyone a free pass to misuse their office, I don't talk like any one side is full of saints, I'm for ranked choice voting and getting corruption out of politics as best we can.
I suppose Trump thought racist dog whistles were too weak, he broke out the bullhorn for this one.   He’s trying to stoke fears in white suburbanites, that w/o him, they’re at risk of living in more integrated communities.
Biden wasn't involved in that and if Trump really thought Biden had done something wrong in Ukraine before, he would have gone about things differently. Such as asking for cooperation and coordination with a real investigation instead of asking for announcements.
If Biden wins the election who will rule the country.  He would forget he even won.
That quality may sometimes have that effect, but in his case it has shown that he puts himself before the country, such as what happened with Ukraine. He pushed too hard for them to announce investigations into Biden and it lead to further bad decisions and law breaking.
Good way to spread the virus and no telling what else.! Biden is the recipient - Nostrils!!Yuck!
If you are planning to just sleep through a Biden presidency, then you are doing this wrong. Biden is part of the political system that gave us Trump. THEY should be the ones worried about never sleeping well again.
Pres Obama’s 8 years and Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton’s broke the laws Clinton’s foundation, Biden’s Ukraine’s, Pres Obama release Muslim Terrorism! DACA, DAPA is illegal in Constitution laws! Immigrants get benefits while fixed income suffering, struggling cost of living!
Let's get this straight once and for all Alzheimer's Joe does not have any say or input in who will be the "Next President". Should they pull this off and the country collapses into the Socialist/Communist State they want.
