You spelled “Joe Biden” wrong... twice, actually.
Also important - The Ds have to take over all the state legislatures possible so, when the election gets to the Electoral College the Electors will vote for [hopefully] popular vote winner Biden - AND since this Admin has messed up the Census, to protect and clean up that fiasco
Here's a weird thought: what if Joe Biden is racist and that's why he keeps saying things that sound racist?
Joe Biden spent 4 decades SAYING he was defending the middle class but never accomplished it.  He was only productive in stealing speeches and being inappropriate with women and girls.

Dude, if Trump is Cancer, Biden is chemo. Not a great thing, as you're essentially trying to kill the cancer before the chemo kills you. But we still need it. At least Biden will know to pick competent cabinet members that won't kill their departments from the inside.

His face before he says it! 🤣 *Closes eyes... “Please God let me say this with a straight face...”
It looks like he had to try real heard before he said it! 😂😂
If elected president, Joe Biden says there will not be 'another foot' of wall constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending one of Trump's big campaign promises.
I didn’t want to believe it last time, but he also predicted you’d be impeached. Alan Lichtman always knows. Start packing.
That Joe Biden video about his Corvette really hits different when you read the anecdote about Biden seeing an alleged reckless driver near his home and chasing him across state lines to do a citizens arrest and then continuing to pursue charges until the guy begged him to stop.
Those are all conservative controlled, how do we implement? They have the military. Even the Democrats are controlled by conservatives. Hence Biden.
Yes but they are going tondona switcheroo sometime soon to somebody who can drum up enthusiasm... Biden is not going to be their candidate
Uhh, might want to check the polls. Biden is like +7 in AZ right now. Of course it will tighten, but it's going blue this year.
I don't understand why the Republican party exists? Conservatives already have the Gop, maga, freedom caucus, &amp; bought half the democratic party. Hence Biden. They are less then 1/2 of the population but get 75% of the representation. #TaxationWithoutRepresentation

Yeah for Joe Biden. Eric should be more worried about Cy Vance.
Why not just have Joe Biden take over now?
Biden is insinuating that the people in society with the least power are responsible for the problems in said society. Fuck that.

P.S.  If Biden can hurt God, wouldn't that make Biden God?  Also, I officially decree that all toilets are now called "Don".
I am not a #Republican or a #Democrat. I will not join any cult, political or otherwise. That being said, I will vote for #Biden. Not because I like Biden or his policies, I don't. However, trump is an existential threat to all human life.
If at this point you can't see that Joe Biden is a 100% Class A racist idk what he can do to convince you. He says these head scratching comments on national TV and doesnt realize theyre inappropriate until someone tells him they are.  This doesn't mean Trump isn't either btw

Joe must not be hanging out with the women I know. Don’t discount and belittle them Joe!
I could care less what that lady says... You're straying from the original point. Did Biden say that? No. He said ban assault weapons. Until he proposes a bill don't lump all democrats together. Not all democrats are the same just like all Republicans aren't the same.
As we argue about rather negligible things (who will be the VP choice by Biden, eg), people in Beirut are echoing what we did here after 9/11 -- desperate posts looking for lost family members, people frantically searching the rubble, needed aid not arriving from the USA. 😢😰

You are so ridiculous. This is right up there with saying that Biden is going to hurt God, but he's weak. So is he powerful enough to hurt God or not? You don't even recognize praying when you see it. You took a picture of Biden praying to use in your lying commercial. Enough!!!
Who needs debates when Joe Biden just keeps beating himself. That whole interview he did was filled with tons of Trump campaign material.  No wonder they have him locked in the basement
The Biden campaign announced it is adding four new staffers in Iowa who previously worked for Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
I mean; it’s a satirical account of Biden, how could I not boost it?! We all need a laugh and this will do nicely for just that! Show our comrade some love! 🌹✊🏻❤️
You know that's the plan because no way in hell they are really backing Biden
They are also going after high capacity mags and certain stocks. Don't lie and say Biden is going after AR15s because your false views of "libtards". I know this is hard to believe but there is such thing as being a moderate. You can support gun rights and have liberal views.
Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a plant, 'I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.'
#IMpotus is a desperately sick puppy.  As one who attended Marble Collegiate for show/to be seen, Trump has some nerve spewing against Joe Biden, a man of genuine and demonstrated faith.

Isn't Biden a Roman Catholic?
Aside from the obvious Trump-Biden stakes, it's important to remember that the winners of the down ballot races will dictate which political party in your state wins the right to attempt to gerrymander the other party out of existence in the upcoming redistricting cycle 👍

Surprising margin and I'm cautious, in the absence of other public polling on #IA01.  That said, I believe  has positioned herself well and Biden at top of ticket will help her in NE #Iowa (lots of older Catholics here). D voter registration edge now around 30,000.

Joe Biden won't be going to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic nomination, while President Trump's considering giving his acceptance speech at the White House.
They need to do it again over the video of Biden in a basement that includes altered photos used without the photographer's permission. The misrepresented and lied about the places and circumstances of the pics, too.
As if that somehow absolves you from guilt. Stop lying and there won't be a problem. Same with digitally altering Biden photo's and LYING about where they were or what was  happening. If Trump can't win fairly, he doesn't deserve to win. Full stop.
I'm voting for the lesser of 2 evils. Biden wasn't even in my top 5.

Trump is not a conservative under any circumstances.  He is all about himself.  Biden is more moderate. Besides we have bigger fish to fry then Green New Deals

Full disclosure to any fellow comrades giving me a follow:  I'm a former Bernie or buster who's voting for Biden. I think Biden is pretty terrible, but he (and by extension the DNC) are far and away better than Trump/conservatives in general.
WHY THE HELL NOT?
I’m channeling Ra’s Al Ghul from Batman Begins.  The Republican Party must be destroyed.  First, a landslide victory for Biden.  Then purge Trumpism.
Biden’s more than happy to debate you and he’s already agreed to do the three debates. Stop gaslighting your ignorant sheeple.   #JoeBidenForPresident2020
I'm actually surprised the campaign managed to get someone with some passable photoshopping skillz.  Normally it's just a stock photo with Biden's head pasted on it.
Again, the irony. I don't see any pictures of Biden with known pedophiles in there. In fact he's making most people smile and laugh.
You might as well vote for Trump if you are mad at the Democrats and can’t see yourself voting for Biden. At least your vote will count then.  Voting third party accomplishes NOTHING.

But that's what the corporate wing said the Republicans would call Bernie, thus Biden was the "safe" choice (nevermind the fact his numbers vs Trump were the lowest of all running at the time) if Biden is a socialist,  words don't have meaning anymore.
Your thoughts...?
Trump isn't doing anything about the bounty Putin put on American soldiers because Russia is trying to help Trump get re-elected! Russia is sending attacks on Biden through Congress like Lindsey Graham! Trump and his cronies are SO Corrupt!
I LOVE this headline: Trump’s ‘depraved incompetence’ has forced Biden to function as an ambitious president like FDR: columnist – Raw Story
Russia doesn't want Joe Biden elected, so Russia is sending attacks on Biden through the Congress like Lindsey Graham. That's why Trump won't do anything about the bounty Putin put on American soldiers, because Russia is trying to help Trump get re-elected!

Here are his exact words.  "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things," Biden said.
Opportunity zones, the funding for HCBU’s, prison reform, record low unemployment pre-covid, school choice, first black military chief. A racist has done more for blacks in 4yrs then Biden has done in 44yrs.
But even among them it's split on who the best choice is, so you can only get a few. And in what states, since electoral is what matters? Thousands, even hundreds of "bros" are going to be swayed to vote for Biden in Ohio.. by which VP choice?
I'd be really curious to see the profile of the voter who would have voted for Biden but doesn't because of the VP, or voters gained by the VP choice. Then, lay that against the fact that those answers aren't agreed on across the board and the numbers will be insignificant.
Trump would destroy Biden in any debate. Best for Biden to stay far away

Trumps, all of them evidently, are incapable of recognizing or telling, the truth.  On the flip side, even tho a loss is predicted, they can't risk their base thinking it's all over and staying home in droves, contributing to a landslide victory for Biden.  Trump's ego can't.

Yes he is afraid. That is why he will resort to anything to win. Lies about Biden, which will eventually include, all kinds of corruption, and I bet the fear of the Pope running the country because of Biden’s catholicism.

I sure hope Trump is spying on everyone in and around the Biden campaign as we speak.
Thank you for your continued efforts to put country over party. This has to be exhausting thank you for representing the people of America. (I am absolutely fine with President Pelosi, President Biden)
I get that. I wouldn’t be happy about it, yet my thought would be, If it’s Joe Biden vs a woman who represents what I think the Biblical model for government is, then I’m probably going to have to just vote for her and accept that God is shaming us.
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"

Also it give us more time to grow a new party or fix the DNC. I really feel this time around that a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. Our country cannot take four more years of this. I’m not sure the world can.

Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider
Right, he’s the candidate that’s sick and can’t talk properly. Ha! Your such a joker, Jon. 😜 Biden has dementia. Very sad, but true.
No VP announcement yet;  I guess Biden can't make his mind up

In Wild Rant, Trump Says President Biden Would ‘Hurt God’  #SmartNews

Apparently Joe Biden will #hurtGod  So any I .. Fuckin what? Who said tha.. Ohh right. Him.  Why does anyone listen to rhe walking orange push up? Did I miss a meeting?
If God can be hurt by Joe Biden then clearly Joe has not gotten nearly enough credit over the years.
Biden is a political disaster and needs to be replaced as the Democratic candidate.
What joe biden thinks of the black community
I would love for a moderator to ask them both to recite one verse from the Bible.  Guessing Biden would nail it and Trump would make some excuse as to why he couldn't.
DNC thought they were playing it safe thinking Biden would have the best chance beating trump. There were better candidates... let’s say dems win, what’s going to happen 3 years from now when he’s already this out of it?
Based Biden
Maybe but the point I was making is all the Dems pander and act like they are part of the "group" with their fake mannerisms and speech patterns are very telling. Hillary Obama and Biden -
Then you are idiot because the first one is automatically cancelled with Biden haha

America might have 1,000 Covid 19 deaths daily until Biden can take over in January!?!
God can take care of himself. God does not need Donald Trump to protect him from Biden. This is ridiculous. Trump protecting God from Biden?
Biden called black people stupid. Which is worse?
Biden will not “hurt God”. That is ridiculous. Did people break out laughing? What kind of audience was this? What can Biden do to God anyway? Were there any follow up questions? Is this the new Trump strategy? Protect God from Biden?
I think it’s safe to say that Biden is either losing his mind, or he’s a racist. Maybe both.
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews biden along with ABC. NBC, CBS, MSNBC. CNN A D THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, all racist.  The american people need to wake up.
Joe Biden after he sniffs some hair
Well the Left has certainly tried to get him out.They set up his campaign with false claims &amp; falsified evidence of Russian collusion, have screamed racism with no evidence except biased left media narrative while Biden shows racism “if you don’t vote for me then you ain’t black”
This is fear mongering. Why do you have to be so extreme? Just state the facts. There is plenty on records form Biden that sucks without making stuff up.
Maybe after we elect Biden.
Joe Biden, bruh.
Joe Biden can make God bleed. That's pretty bad ass.
Biden is all Powerful and able to control God. I say that is one impressive and strong person....
Biden says latinos think better than blacks, and Trump says Biden is hurting God.  Wow this #2020Election is crazy!  Or at least 2 old white men are...
Your tweet is exactly why a lot of people think the Republican Party is racist.   What you say and Biden say are the exact same thing back from a racist era.
people need to listen to all Joe biden's racist comments over his career. Thats fine if people want to vote for him BUT he truly is a racist in the old school sense not the new liberal definition of racist that includes everyone that disagrees with them.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden were having a push up contest, and Bill Brasky came in late, did twice as many push ups as both of them while taking a mental aptitude test, and got up and punched socialism in the balls. TO BILL BRASKY

Would you like to meet David Duke then? And you’re supreme leader claimed Mexicans are rapists, referred to people as “the blacks”, and told Jewish people he is a “negotiator like you folks”. But ok, Biden’s quote takes the cake
Biden is a racist and always has been. Stop making excuses and lying because he will keep making you look stupid.
If Biden was actually Catholic he wouldn't advocate for the systematic genocide of children, shutting down churches, and destruction of the nuclear family. But wait - he's not.
Joe Biden gonna drain the worlds oceans
Joe Biden is definitely a racist
Joe Biden is f***ing nuts!
Cognitive test question Biden said No I haven't taken a test Why the hell would I take a test? Come on man. That's like saying you before you got on this program you take a test were you're taking cocaine or not What do you think Huh Are you a junkie to a black journalist
How about somebody asks Biden what country he is in?Good luck with that.
Classic Biden behavior!!
wait!....what!?.........Did #biden just call blacks stupid?.....What a disgusting man....unfit for leadership......#nursinghomejoe
So...you're saying that some of your most vocal (or deplorable) supporters would actually vote for Biden based on his debate performance? If that were true, Hillary would have mopped the floor with you in the election, but instead she "only" won the popular vote by three mill.
YES! Vote Biden, but that is just step 1. The world does get better in many ways once he's elected, but we have to expect more of him than what he's shown us so far.

My hope, I’m not sure how confident I am, is that Biden will be largely center-left/neoliberal and tribalism will take over, redirecting left wing energy from dismantling the American project to explaining why hiking the top tax rate by 3.6% is a priority of historic importance.
You're not gonna debate You're gonna go up there and talk shit "wheres hunter biden joe" piss off

I will be voting for Joe Biden no matter who the VP is. I would like to see Kamala Harris as the VP!
To top that Bible stunt, he is showing photos of Biden praying to illustrate that he is unfit. He will be praying himself when he loses &amp; he can't use to presidency as a shield from arrest..big time prayers..unanswered?
Thats fine, but realize Biden made no decisions in the WH from 2008-2016, besides what women to touch and make feel uncomfortable.

Scum ball Clyborn  whh are you covering up for Biden and obama  they committed treason
Actually sad when you have gone through this with a loved one.  For the life of me, I can’t understand knowing Jill Biden is allowing this to happen.  She seems like a nice person but allowing this is far from nice, good or right.
What's that about the insanity of doing the same thing over &amp; over again, expecting a different outcome? Current time loop--Obama, Biden/Russia/Ukraine, now "hydroxy" again with Navarro (actually not an economist) playing doctor &amp; DJT claiming "only I can solve this problem."

That is not what that article says. Some Republicans are helping him get on the ballot in some states. That in no way is saying that his whole run is a "Highly coordinated Republican operation to suppress Black Vote for Biden"
Every one should stop calling Mr. Biden Jim Crow Joe and vote for him.

That Joe Biden video about his Corvette really hits different when you read the anecdote about Biden seeing an alleged reckless driver near his home and chasing him across state lines to do a citizens arrest and then continuing to pursue charges until the guy begged him to stop.
Those are all conservative controlled, how do we implement? They have the military. Even the Democrats are controlled by conservatives. Hence Biden.
Yes but they are going tondona switcheroo sometime soon to somebody who can drum up enthusiasm... Biden is not going to be their candidate
Uhh, might want to check the polls. Biden is like +7 in AZ right now. Of course it will tighten, but it's going blue this year.

If at this point you can't see that Joe Biden is a 100% Class A racist idk what he can do to convince you. He says these head scratching comments on national TV and doesnt realize theyre inappropriate until someone tells him they are.  This doesn't mean Trump isn't either btw

You are so ridiculous. This is right up there with saying that Biden is going to hurt God, but he's weak. So is he powerful enough to hurt God or not? You don't even recognize praying when you see it. You took a picture of Biden praying to use in your lying commercial. Enough!!!

You know that's the plan because no way in hell they are really backing Biden
They are also going after high capacity mags and certain stocks. Don't lie and say Biden is going after AR15s because your false views of "libtards". I know this is hard to believe but there is such thing as being a moderate. You can support gun rights and have liberal views.
Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a plant, 'I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.'

Debates are useless and should be abandoned. Just a bunch of try to be clever oneliners. Do a fact based interview like  does. You get all the information needed to vote for Biden
They still haven't answered my request for why FB censored a post I made about Trump while letting the other person's Biden post stand. In my opinion, they're interfering in the election by censoring out things unflattering to Trump.
True or False: Joe Biden will be the nominee on Election Day
Surely you jest!  Hahahaha You sure that's the hill your campaigns wanna die on? We've listened to Trump for 4 years. Biden is eloquent by comparison. How much did Trump understand yo-semite? Is Greenland for sale? What's covfefe? Who stormed airports in revolutionary war? ETC.
Yes we will: Joe Biden
I've never been more excited to cast my vote for Joe Biden as our next President! #VoteBiden2020
And they think they get to choose the moderators while asking for it.  Delusional. Biden should ask for Trump to release his taxes before any debate.
🌈 Don't forget, our next Rainbow Forum is today at 5PM on Facebook Live with  Joe Biden's Senior Advisor in Iowa!  #lgbtq
You have nothing on Biden so you have to invent shit. You incriminate yourself daily. You'll be in jail sooner or later.
Full disclosure to any fellow comrades giving me a follow:  I'm a former Bernie or buster who's voting for Biden. I think Biden is pretty terrible, but he (and by extension the DNC) are far and away better than Trump/conservatives in general.
WHY THE HELL NOT?
I’m channeling Ra’s Al Ghul from Batman Begins.  The Republican Party must be destroyed.  First, a landslide victory for Biden.  Then purge Trumpism.
Biden’s more than happy to debate you and he’s already agreed to do the three debates. Stop gaslighting your ignorant sheeple.   #JoeBidenForPresident2020
I'm actually surprised the campaign managed to get someone with some passable photoshopping skillz.  Normally it's just a stock photo with Biden's head pasted on it.
Again, the irony. I don't see any pictures of Biden with known pedophiles in there. In fact he's making most people smile and laugh.
You might as well vote for Trump if you are mad at the Democrats and can’t see yourself voting for Biden. At least your vote will count then.  Voting third party accomplishes NOTHING.
You should be concerned about the Biden's being involved with Epstein's Island.
Why are we not talking about the Biden's owning land adjacent to Epstein Island?
Never seen someone (especially running for office) get away with more racist remarks than Joe Biden. Let’s send him to the retirement center #VoteRed
Joe Biden will accept his party's presidential nomination from his home in Delaware.
Joe Biden will not go to Milwaukee for DNC
very funny watching these Biden attack ads claiming he’s adopted a radical far left agenda. unless he does a kickflip and starts pushing for m4a, that dude isn’t radical
Can you just take the red pill on Biden already.
Sorry,  If you need another Joe to go to Kopp's and eat cheese curds with this month let me know.
Report: Biden no longer coming to Milwaukee to accept presidential nomination
Things are changing every minute, but for what it’s worth, the novelty of Joe Biden’s running mate may have a bigger impact on fall college football than UConn’s cancelation:
..why do you think there's no Biden yard signs or bumper stickers out there...🤔
Visit DC when BIDEN is President!
Bankruptcy baby? Pfff that’s the dumbest response I’ve ever heard. Even job Biden could come up with something better
Joe Biden isn’t afraid of anything, but after the Johnathan Swan interview, Trump should be. I can’t believe you’re not embarrassed for him. And honestly after that dancing fiasco of yours, you should probably sit this one out. 👇🏼
Joe Biden: why do I need a test?
Biden's campaign is reserving airtime in 15 states and plans to launch an 'unprecedented' paid media campaign to educate Americans on their voting options.
Then we MUST Vote Biden to do so!
This is stupid. Joe Biden has already agreed to 3 debates, and I seem to recall him participating in about a thousand democratic primary debates. This crap is just playing into the GOP playbook.
I think she is more senile than Joe Biden... the left has drunk the kool aid and found it refreshing and now is trying to force their poison on us... all states that legalized marijuana is breaking federal laws
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Iowa Roundtable on Joe Biden's Latino Agenda with Congressman Ruben Gallego” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
You are better than everyone else in mainstream media.  Hopefully you get to interview Biden.  Presidential debates are not need just fact based discussions.  Keep going.
Joe Biden, who never eulogized anyone even remotely problematic, cannot be associated with this.
I'm gonna stick with Biden for 2020.
They are doing a great campaign for Biden! 😉
Joe Biden cares, Trump does not. “It is what it is” was his response to the death of Americans.
I LOVE listening to your interviews that are filled with lies &amp; falsehoods. YOU are helping Joe Biden's campaign with every interview you do. KEEP IT UP!!!!
Biden is gonna be your president on January 21, 2021 and Im going to spend the next 4 years reminding all the troglodyte MAGAts of that very fact.  Choke on it, Ernest.

Biden needs to be asked some tough questions
I don’t GAF if they switch Biden out for an oak chair. I’m voting for it.
Trump campaign messaging in Iowa is that Biden, under pressure, won't debate Trump. As  notes, Biden said in June he would participate in three fall debates:
But Biden can’t speak Ron. People will claim that this is how it should have been said originally anyways.
Tucker Carlson claimed yesterday that Biden choosing a black female VP was "probably illegal."  Looks like losing his openly racist show writer has not affected the show in any way...
Breaking: Joe Biden can correctly pronounce the names of many of the nation's national parks.   candidate, not so much.  #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden changed his name to "The Amazing Race" I'm pretty sure he could beat Trump.  Every damn time, right Donald?
But Biden has dementia
Nope. Not this time. “For the good of the country “ President Biden will most definitely NOT pardon Donald J. Trump if he gets convicted of anything.
And President Biden will NOT pardon him. Donnie is going down.
"And if YOU will stand with us and vote for Joe Biden in November, President Trump has PERSONALLY authorized you to get a small cut of his winnings!"
You may not like Trump, but the alternative is much worse.   Biden and the left-wing democrats will destroy America.  They want the end of our way of life.   Socialism is so fair it makes us the same, Bull Shit, it holds us down and keeps you in constant poverty, misery loves co.
It's Biden vs Trump
Yes, but how enthusiastic are voters to vote AGAINST the other candidate? I think a lot of Biden's supporters are thrilled to vote your guy out of office.
Yea but Joe has dementia.  For fucks sake people this guy is a complete and utter fool.  No sympathy or compassion for the people that died just spinning numbers in some weird way to say he is doing a good job, but please continue to tell me Joe Biden is creepy and has dementia
This kooky Trump lady may be lying about internal polls, but I wouldn’t be surprised if their camp has a stronger handle on their universe of likely voters than Biden’s camp does.
Back to the wake up call: I see no evidence of a Biden ground game that would establish a list of known supporters, the people worth pestering at GOTV time. 5/
But I have seen very little evidence of a Biden ground game in this highly democratic neighborhood of a swing state. No one knocks on my door on weekends. I don’t come home to find door hangers. In 2012, my neighborhood team would have been door knocking every weekend 4/
I don't want Biden either but to say he is no better than the Orange Abomination is ridiculous! Biden will not get us where we need to be, but at least this pitstop doesn't look like 1,000 tacobell explosions happened today!
lol it’s amazing seeing the hate anybody left of democrats get by the same group of people when they say anything remotely positive about Biden or even allude to supporting him
Imagine being excited about Biden. Guy can’t even remember which state he’s in
I am so pissed at the media. Just like that headline. Don’t report it like it may be true. It’s not. It’s a lie. Say “Tucker Carlson lies; claiming Biden’s choice of a Female Black VP may be illegal.” I just can’t w these complicit assholes anymore.
Because Trump’s Admin won’t be running the country. You know as much as I do that, IF elected, Biden’s mush-for-brains would turn the VP into the Presidency...
Imagine being excited about Joe Biden. Glad that’s not me
This is your best argument?  Say hello to President Joe Biden!!!
Hey  and  - why is the  doing more to elect Dems up and down the #ballot than you? I’m over this party. You’re more impotent than  110 year old dick. I’m voting Biden because Trump and then going #Independent or #Green.
Virginia Mayor Under Fire Over Racist Post Claiming Biden Picked Aunt Jemima As His VP
I said in April of 2019 that Biden would lose to Trump if it came to that and here we are!"If you don't vote at all or don't vote for biden, you're voting for Tr-  Me, in a Rick Sanchez voice:  "That just sounds like voter intimidation with extra steps"
Joe Biden could pick Adolf Hitler for VP and I would still vote for him.
Kanye was Trump's "secret weapon" to steal black votes from Biden.
When Trump says Biden is against God, it reminds me how Trump's daily behavior defies every teaching of Jesus Christ. He is the living embodiment of unrepentant sin that uses the Bible as a prop.   Trump is a desperate person, aside from a 'presidential' candidate.
What would happen if they banned an anti-Biden ad people would cry foul
Yeah. Take away the left part of the “center” button and that’s a lot closer to actual Biden
I’d actually consider voting for a democrat not named joe Biden, I’m legitametly concerned about how he can’t say a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about
The people that don’t want the debate know that Trump will make more of a clown out of Biden.  If you can’t see that then you’re a clown ur self.
Joe Biden is the next Marvel Comics super hero.
I need to be clear on the fact that nothing will have me vote for trump. If Biden come out and say “NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA” I just won’t vote at all. MAGA idiots think everytime Biden fuck up it’s a vote for their overlord
That said, and I agree with you, you must be absolutely disgusted by Joe Biden's comments today.
I'm a communist and I do NOT want biden as president
Typical that Biden can get away with implying the African-American reporter should be tested for cocaine use And President Trump’s economy brings about the lowest unemployment rates for African-Americans and he’s called the racist.  Something wrong with this picture
Sounds like he’s a racist to me.  He attempted to bully the reporter into not asking anymore questions about it. Same tactic he has used to belittle others who have asked tough questions on campaign trail.  Basically the attitude, “I’m Joe Biden..how dare you ask me anything”
Doctor on Hannity is suggesting Biden may have had a silent stroke.
As a fan of shit shows, I sincerely hope Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
Biden all the way.
Lol Biden’s going to blow a 200 - 0 lead
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Joe Biden eulogized Strom Thurmond, but you don't seem to have a problem with that. Your double standards and selective outrage are mind boggling
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Sad, but true.    I agree with the suggestion that every #CovidObit should include this: “In lieu of flowers please register voters, volunteer &amp; vote for Joe Biden and Democrats down the Ballot!”  #CovidObits
On this week’s On Iowa Politics Podcast: Decision time for Biden on a VP, Trump's tweet on postponing the election, and how Iowa is planning to come back to school. (Now with audio player attached!)
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
All the more reason to vote for Biden
Some major focal points this week will be an update on China’s import numbers &amp; the U.S. employment report on Fri. On the political front, Joe Biden said he will make his decision on his VP choice this week, but an announcement might not come until the week of Aug. 10.  #pfnews
I joined LGBTQ+ for Biden
I hope you are right! Where I live there are more Trump supporters than Biden supporters! I am so worried about the fate of our nation!
The country has just seen massive dysfunction in elections in which voting by mail played a big role.
I am voting for Biden.  Nothing can change my mind.  Just like nothing will change the minds of the idiots who support the racist, misogynist President...
I'm still planning on writing in Andrew Yang for President. Too many people are going to vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR someone they believe in. Joe Biden doesn't have too many years left, and it's hard to believe that he'll do anything impactful for the future generations.
I'm not going to lie... I'm starting to warm up to the idea of voting biden if he chooses kamala... Because you KNOW he ain't making it 4 years.
You can vote for whoever you want. Assholes on the internet like to guilt people into voting biden. "If you don't vote/vote for someone else, you're voting trump"  Rick Sanchez voice: that just sounds like voter intimidation with extra steps
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
On this week’s On Iowa Politics Podcast: Decision time for Biden, postpone the election, and back to school.
You’re right Biden’s tough on crime bills were atrocious for black communities because lots of crimes that were victimless got the maximum sentencing but whites in America get far less time in jail for the same crimes why hasn’t trump tried reforming that?
They aren’t allies then—I trust Biden to choose.
And this is supposed to be what America is supposed to be like when Joe Biden is President?Yeah, not our best running against each other. Hopefully this is the last election where Boomers have a large say in. See  Trump's interview on Axios? I'll still take Biden this time around. Then Mark Cuban in '24!
The absolute hilarity of #DonTheCon questioning anyone's faith is mind-boggling. This guy has to worry about bursting into flameif he goes near a church but Biden is going to destroy Christianity. But then people who think  somehow Trump is religious are the ones who will do that
Oh, from what little interaction I have to go on, Fives is certainly a douchebag. However the other post quoting biden by the other user is correct. Not to mention that literally yesterday he called the "African-American community" largely "less diverse" than the "Latino" one.
WHAT?SAME OLD SHIT &amp; I SAW HBO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE DC SWAMP IS &amp; BIDEN TOTALLY UNDERSTANDS WHO/WHAT GOD IS-YOU HOWEVER ARE THE ANTI CHRIST🤬YOU ARE KING SATAN🤬GOD IS WATCHING YOU/&amp; YOUR REPUBLICANS/YOU ALL ARE GOING TO HELL-that’s a given/FOR THE HARM ALL OF YOU HAVE CAUSED!
Trump has gone full Cam Brady with his recent claims of Biden being against god.
Wow... You were talking about Biden, in reference to a video featuring Trump not speaking in coherent sentences?  Isn't that a little like... saying there's too much water in your glass after looking at the ocean?
I'm confused.  Wasn't it always known that Biden would announce his VP pick at the convention?
Joe Biden will not go to Milwaukee for DNC
Nope, not just you.  I'm becoming more convinced that Trump, and the GOP, are campaigning for Biden.
It's all projection.  It's why you hear Trump sycophants floating that Biden wants to duck out of the debates.  Biden has committed to three. Trump's committed to zero.
With only 3 months until the election, today is a great day to order a Joe Biden yard sign.
Is it because Trump supports abortion and Biden is a Catholic?
Every staff meeting at   Producers: Remember all you reporters, ask every single guest about their thoughts on the Biden VP. And if they’re on the list, ask them if they’ve been picked.  Reporters: THEY ALWAYS NO COMMENT!  Producers: Everybody quiet or no more coffee!
Vote Biden He will make America Great Again.
I mean, right?  As if the pandemic, depression, race riots and wars isn't enough to lock in the Biden vote, how is destroying a business going to do anything?
For everyone who will be upset with Biden's VP pick...the Democratic party is not an airport, you don't have to announce your departure.
Absolutely Brutal Biden Ad Scorches Trump On Covid Failures  via
Umm, excuse me, what? And you think Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time? #SendHelp #TrumpHasLostHisMind
I just got here. Are they going to ask Lou Gossett who he thinks Joe Biden should pick?   #msnbc #thebeat
And when Joe Biden announces his pick, the entire news crew of  will sing a song  “There she is.... The VP Candidaaaaaaate...”  Probably with a video montage.  #maddow #inners #TheReidOut   #DeadlineWH
Isn't it great when the WH, the GOP and Trump's campaign come out in favor of Joe Biden?
It's like, you are campaigning for Biden.  Do you know something? Say something.
The news?? Since when is it the role of the news to present the detailed position statements and actual ideas of political candidates? Or is that just your admission that Biden needs that much help and support because he isn’t capable of handling it on his own?
Just being diplomatic. Maybe he could say "I'm glad that former President Trump is still here to help with the transition to the Biden presidency."
Why remove him from the premises? The Constitution doesn't even mention the White House.   Biden can just take the oath and set up shop with Trump still in there. He can call Trump an honored guest.  #thebeat
He WILL announce Harris. The Biden-Harris ticket has been what the DNC has wanted since he announced. It’s a given. But the problem remains that Joe is still top of the ticket. A wide field of very capable candidates and the absolute weakest is the default nominee. 🙄
And Biden would already be in a nursing home.
So clearly we have two presidential candidates who are obsessively focused on Donald Trump: Trump himself and Biden. Is there anyone out there willing to run and share their own ideas?
If you are a Democrat right now I feel sorry for you. Absent minded Joe Biden doesn’t stand a chance. Biden will feel like he’s been through a wood chipper On November 3rd.
Weekend at bernies Biden style.
Someone needs to make one of these with Biden’s picture and his handlersBecause the think Biden is going to hurt God. Trump said so
Joe Biden becomes totally incoherent during interview… spewing utter nonsense
This idiot from the Trump campaign had tweeted an article of a Trump supporter. He ripped on policies that said hurt American workers in the past that Biden voted for. Touting things that could improve with things Trump did. No improvements that Trump did.
Agree. But your former employer makes a big case of Biden gaffes and Biden’s mental health. When people talked about Trump’s mental health they would always say, well is that person a doctor? Did they examine Trump? But they make health analysis. Just hilarious I think.
Juliet it is interesting watching your old employer. Trump’s gaffes you see zero coverage. Biden’s gaffes and it’s on for a day or two. Thanks for posting it.
We are so screwed either way. Have you seen Biden’s latest interview? Asking a black reporter if he is on cocaine? And if he is a junkie? Then laughing maniacally? We have entered the Twilight Zone.
Kim Ah!! The savior Ah!! Of thee Black community Ah!!  The White folks of Biden Ah!!, will in Fact!!, free us from our chains Ah!!  Kim mind your own damned business. How can you say Biden isn’t racist!? We’re to white! I can however say, its is! It’s racial profiling. Fact.
Biden Campaign Announces Ad Buy Targeted to Black Voters
People laugh with Trump and at Biden
He has not. I’m a volunteer for NNU and I work statewide on M4A—- Biden has not budged from his plan that leaves 10 million uninsured with an additional 50-80 million underinsured.
Biden has been hiding out in a basement, so plenty of voters haven’t seen him lately. It’s possible some could have a epiphany watching him in a debate and change their minds
So now your scared? Biden’s double digit lead is wasting away. Maybe you should have put forth a decent candidate. Trump might be the worst candidate EVER and yet you Dems have fucked up the race so poorly you are hanging on by a thread.
What? Sorry, she is way to bias for Trump. She would be giving Trump softball questions the whole time. Then give Biden difficult questions. At one time I would’ve agreed, but not now.
No hoopla: Virus upends Trump, Biden convention plans
REMEMBER THIS VIDEO BECAUSE COME NOVEMBER 4TH IF BIDEN WINS..... AMERICA WILL BE NO MORE😪 STAND WITH TRUMP!  CITIZENS, NO MORE SILENT MAJORITY, MAKE YOUR VOICE SEEN &amp; HEARD! . #Revere #Trump #Trump2020Landslide #quotes #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
A Biden mimic. He will lose just as bigly as you did
talking about Biden’s mental state. How can you ignore these?
You are concerned about Joe Biden here is Trump. You aren’t concerned about him?
You find it concerning about Biden? Trump had said and tweeted ridiculous stuff in the past that  won’t ever cover or air on the network. Please.
So is anyone from your former employer going to ask anyone from the Trump campaign about Trump mental health or just Biden’s like  did yesterday to Dr. Jill Biden.
So Tuesday on  with  Dr. Jill Biden was on and Dana asked Jill about Joe’s mental health. How many times has  asked anyone from Trump campaign or administration about Trump’s mental health?
The postal workers just endorsed Biden for President  Let that sink in....  Do you think mail in ballots are a good idea? . . . . . . #LebanonExplosion #COVID19 #Israel #Trump #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
The CDC said not to wear a mask then changed their story. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden wanted the borders to stay open from China. That would have saved some lives!
The leader of the US Communist Party just endorsed Biden – and that should speak volumes
The Democrats don’t want a debate cause they know Trump would destroy Biden. They have been weaseling out of it for a while now.
. October surprise is Democrats finally admitting Biden is mentally not capable, replacing him with someone you can't debate because it's to late. Question is,  who will take his place? Michelle, Hillary? Some no name, mysterious person 2 give D's a second chance?
OH NO, JOE! Did Biden just have a stroke mid-speech?
If Biden loses, I can't wait to see how many friends I lose when I say "It wasn't the fault of the Bros. Biden just didn't have the support of the electorate. Oh, wait, that's what you all said about Bernie. Does it hold or not?"
The Postal Union endorsed Biden. Not as delusional as you think.
Not so sure this is a moment for Democrats to unite, I feel like this is a time to simply beat Trump. Biden is a joke. #SettleForBiden
Ok, Biden ain’t perfect either but the past 4 years have been a cluster fuck. Clearly we need to try something new. Trump isn’t doing much good at all, I’m not going to say he hasn’t done anything productive but the bad shit he’s done greatly out ways the small bit of good.
They should have listened to Biden and Pelosi and kept travel open from China. That would have really fixed it!!
If you are wise enough to have spotted his ambiguous statement, you should be wise enough to realize the effect this would have on the market as a whole. That said, Biden isn’t really considering this...the statement is intentionally provocative sure, but there is no chance...
Goodbye, Suburbia: If Biden Wins, Democrats Plan to Absorb Suburbs Into Cities  Part of "the" plan by the GL(Global Elite)is to urbanize us probably so they will be able to control us better.
Biden's search for running mate enters final stretch
He is a hero to every Biden supporter. A true hero to all Democrat Socialists. Created the blueprint for ANTIFA and BLM protests. One of Obama’s sons.
Joe Biden Declared War on Coal. But His Son Got Rich off Chinese Coal.
📌 Biden’s Anti-Woman Plan:
Cool—and Biden will pardon him.
You think electing Biden is going to force Trump into hiding? Dude isn’t going anywhere he has been in the spotlight since the 80’s.
📌 The Unconsidered Devastation of a Joe Biden Victory:
Don’t want Trump, don’t want Biden. So when do the British come back and tell us we’ve been punk’d?
Biden’s allies don’t want her.
Soooo, is the October surprise Biden's VP pick? There has to be a law when the deadline is. But I'm still thinking the October surprise is pulling Biden out (health) and throwing Obama or Hillary in. Maybe Bernie because they are just as Communist as he is now! .
Fox is good for that. They have Republicans talk about Biden’s plans or Democrats policies. Seen it also on  andAt least it’s not Biden sniffing it...
My sources tell me Joe Biden will announce a Vice President for the Democratic Party ticket. #election2020 #veepstakes
Hahahaha!! Sheeple are hilarious!!! Ohhh we're gonna die from a virus cause our government tells us so and they would never lie to us!! We all know they are gonna save us!! Bahahahaha!! Go hide in Biden's basement and wait for him to save ya!!
Biden is not conservative enough to be accepted into the current Republican Party which is very conservative right now.
Biden may be considered “conservative” but he is not a Republican. Conservative is a political bend, Republican is a political party. He is a moderate Democrat. He’s the nominee for the Democratic Party and he just isn’t on the progressive end.
Are you feeling the same about the Biden v. Trump commercials?  Or is it just the 'ladies' you dont like hearing from?  It's just the beginning of the political ad season so I suggest you get used to it, gentleman.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is radical. He was the farthest right candidate that the Democrats put forward this year. 10 years ago, based on current policy, you’d call him a Republican. Guess this is what happens when you have a politics that only moves farther to the right
I want to clarify, Joe Biden didn't write this tweet.
That's not true. Biden is a heathen, not catholic. Hes for abortion, same sex marriage and for antifa who are haters,destryoers,and murderers.
On the SEVENth of AUGUST Joe Biden will have an EPIPHANY and announce that Taylor Swift is his running mate come on you guys this is the final Easter egg
Can we acknowledge that the #veepstakes don't matter and move on please?
Imagine trying to vote for one of these people. I'm considering not voting. Trump and Biden are both terrible. Plus lets be honest, popular vote doesn't count anyway. Electoral college wins elections. We need to educate people on this.
Hey John if you continue to believe the Russian hoax, maybe you’ll also believe in the Easter bunny, Santa, Bigfoot and Joe Biden’s chances to win in November.
And then Biden will say that Trump will put Black people back into chains, like he said to the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
Exactly who could Biden pick that would force you to vote for Trump?
Will we be able to play as Joe Biden in the next God of War game?
Help save the Republican Party from this madman in office! Joe Biden will help bridge the partisan divide so that we can get back to normal civil disagreement and compromise between political parties
Joe Biden Hits Trump’s Biggest Boast With A Brutal Coronavirus Reality Check
It’s funny because literally everyday I see a new Biden interview and/or speech/appearance and everyday I also see Donald Trump say horrendously stupid and dangerous things.
I find Biden a neoliberal shill, but if I'm voting for him at this point, you better be too.
If Biden wants to send the nation into utter chaos he should nominate Hillary as his VP.
Neither can Biden.   I’m on the “please dear god vote for Biden if you’re in a swing state” boat, but to pretend like Biden is even at 80% of his previous cognitive capacity is naive and ignores basic observable behavior.
We probably should have foreseen that the end of the Boomers 50 year reign over America would come down to something like Trump v. Biden.
I've seen some people in replies talking about the possibility of Lincoln Project organizers (read: Bush advisors) gaining influence in the Biden administration. That, I feel, is a deal with the devil not worth risking. But if/when we win the Presidency and Congress, then we can
The more senile Biden gets the more “look how dumb Trump is!” stories we’ll get.
It's so cute when logicless people get argued into their sad corner and all they can do is pout and cry.  Again, it doesn't matter to you what Biden does or doesn't do. Because Trump. That's all you've got. Because Trump. Stick to that and you'll have a much easier time here.
I mean, it's a list of things you believe to be incrementally better than Trump.  Here's the deal: I agree with Biden that healthcare is a human right. The problem is that he wants to keep that human right from Americans. That's ghoulish.  And I know your response: BUT TRUMP!!1!
Guy making six figures who thinks he'll pay less under Biden than Trump.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
What some people don't realize is if Trump wins, it's not just Biden who loses.  It's the whole country losing against a person who only cares about having himself come out ahead.
Hahahahaha, so you are calling Biden, Pelosi, Waters, De Blasio and Beetlejuice Lightfoot Republicans?!?!? LMFAO!!!!! 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂
Conservatives really look at my Twitter handle and think I’m a Biden fan.
To be clear since you can’t operate in spaces that requires cognitive energy: Biden is a corporatist shill whom I hate (though the moral obligation to vote for him in a swing state is something I’ll still argue for).
BiDeN iS a RaDiCal LeFtIsT.  And you think I’m the parody account. Smh.
if that's the game, and it is, then trump should stop doing interviews altogether.  rely on social media, ads, surrogates highlighting his good works for the american people. compare/contrast to biden's dismal record.
- a clip of your  predicting and hoping that troops forcibly pull the president out of the white house should biden win, ending with "i cannot wait for that to happen".  you people are sick and if you condone her behavior you deserve this psycho.
HE'S not campaigning???!!!  i need to stop laughing.  it's biden who isn't campaining and these people can't even admit it.
Just find it kinda funny how the Trump ad with the tag line “You won’t be safe in Biden’s America” uses fires and looting footage from Trump’s America 🤷‍♂️☕️
#Trump isn't the one attempting to find an excuse to get out of debating. With how Trump crushed Clinton in the 2016 debates, it's no mystery as to why the left is afraid of letting Biden on the debate stage
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
If Trump and Biden are effectively the same, why do you care who people vote for.   Also, I understand that you will oppose them the same way, but I feel they aren't litterally the same policy wise. One of them ultimately creates better living conditions through policy.
Are Democrats Too Scared To Allow #Biden To Debate President #Trump?
Nah, like I said above, I am cool with critiques of Biden - I make them myself. I just dont want to be pushed into some totalitarian hive mind where if you vote x you are shit, rather than having an actual discussion on why you should or shouldn't vote x (or not vote at all).
So all people who vote for Biden are shit is not a "valid critique." I am fine with people not voting, I thought I wasn't going to for a while. When people bring up critiques of Biden I almost always agree with those critiques and my entire twitter has been anti-Biden.
I think it is a lot easier to push a Biden administration to do the things I want than a Trump one.
I hated it because it was a condescending slogan that libs threw at progressice trying to shame them into not speaking out against Biden. It was basically "shut up and take it, or else we will blame you guys for our loss."
Lol, I feel it's pretty hypocritical to vote shame people after hating on blue no matter who (rightfully) for months. There are a lot of valid reasons why Biden is better than Trump, and people aren't evil for making that calculation.
Show us yours!! Idiot, I'd rather see Biden's, Pelosi's, Schumer's, any and EVERY public SERVANT that became millionaires on our taxdollars!!!
No if he delays elections then again it should be automatic win for President Trump!! NOONE wants that idiot Biden in office!!!
You support Donald Trump. Everyone knows most of what you just said is blubber and nonsensical and 100% hypocritical because.. you support Donald Trump. Literally everything he claims about Biden is simply a projection of himself. He makes you look stupid and you willfully oblige
And what’s the unemployment at now? How many Americans are dead from the “hoax” Covid-19? What’s trumps approval rating right now? Why is he behind in every poll to Joe Biden? Do you really think everyone is this dumb?
they're not afraid of anything.  they're just doing biden's bidding.
Don't vote shame us, screams the lefty perpetually vote shaming people who hate Trump more than Biden.
I will not vote for Biden. Votes must be earned, not dictated.  These Dem worshippers are the reason the party is terrible. Don't let them continue to ruin the country!
You mean 30330 joe biden
Trump is out there floating trying to push back the election, and Biden is out there claiming the COVID vaccine, when it comes out, might not be "real."  They are both terrible
Encouraging people to vote for trump is voter suppression? By the way Biden did promise an African American VP.
I wouldn't say biggest issue,  but i would also say you can't minimize as nothing. If something were to happen to by Biden as president they would be the new president. People deserve to get to know who they are well in advance of election.
Now do Biden.
Here’s how to calm your nerves: just accept that jack squat isn’t happening until the media decides it’s time for Joe Biden or his VP to run for re-election. We’ll all be broke by then, but at least we know where the bottom is.
What if we don’t like Biden? Will you still call us out publicly?  Hope so...  I’m not a fan of baby murders, socialism, high taxes, riots defended as protests, Democrats money laundering schemes, his son, his rape of a woman, his creepy touching of little girls, should I go on?
Biden Faces Pressure From Left Over Influence Industry Ties - The New York Times.   Please Mr. VP- this resembles Trump’s swamp. #JoeBiden
Don’t look at it as voting “for” Biden. You are voting for Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s replacement.
one can only hope biden chooses this woman.
I probably wouldn’t have to worry about dying of the plague due to incompetence in Biden’s America.
Old white men need to step off. We need intelligent, ambitious women with leadership skills like Senator Harris. Joe Biden has said he’s a bridge to the next generation. His VP would almost certainly be the Dem nominee in 2024. Harris is qualified.
Excited that I don’t need to participate in the leftist convo on if voting for Biden is important, because I now don’t have an address and can’t vote anyways
"It's 50-3 in the 3rd quarter."   on where Biden vs Trump stands at the moment. Biden has 50.
youre definitely voting for biden
Joe Biden’s America is 1000x better than Trump’s America.
If you buy the argument that the virus is more likely to scare Biden voters from going to the polls than Trump voters there is no need to consider moving the election.
Yeah why didn't Biden assume control of our armed forces when this started? He's the worst 🙄
No, it won't.  He'll just enable it, which will cause it to get worse.  Look at the cities controlled by democrats.  We'll see a lot more of that under Biden.  Well, under whoever is controlling that puppet people call Joe Biden.
I think England will try to be but they are on the same path as the US so I’m betting on Canada, Trudeau is mostly popular internationally (with the people I know) even though he had obvious flaws. (Still would take him over Biden tho.)
Having thought things over, I've decided to support Joe Biden for president.  His values are the most in line with mine of any candidate that can beat Donald Trump and end the madness that currently is spreading throughout the country. #BlueWave
Are you going to vote for Biden or are you going to fuck over every single disabled American like me?  I say this as a person who fully supports Bernie Sanders. Unless we get Biden, the pandemic is going to end up killing millions of Americans.  Biden is better than Trump.
Join us in pledging to vote for Joe Biden in November, because it’s not just who becomes president that’s on the line, it’s the whole administration. I don’t know about you all, but I cannot handle another four years of Trump’s America.
"Joe Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0, the nation’s second domestic debacle in two generations." Nice qualifier,  that omits the international debacle of the GW Bush presidency &amp; the needless loss of 1000s of Americans &amp; Iraqis.
Lrt i dislike biden in most ways and he is barely better than trump in a lot of them but the environmental plan is whats making me feel less gross about voting for him.
thank you  ! you speak for many, if not most, of us.  we are not delicate flowers nor porcelain dolls. we've never had equal pay and biden did nothing about it with all of his turns at bat, since 1973. i'm more than satisfied with our president, he's a DO-er, TYVM.looking desperate when you have to use Biden's yesterday comment as 75% of your reporting today. #Biden2020  it's refreshing every once in awhile I get nervous that trump will scam his way to re election
RESISTERS, THIS HAS TO BE STOPPED SOMEHOW! ANY IDEAS?  Russia trying to undermine Biden in election, White House intelligence report says
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, while Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is a pedophile #JoeBidenIsAPedophile
Im on your side Joe, I understand what you meant! Biden 2020
So if you were in democratic politics you wouldn’t want to be on the VP list I bet people are begging to be included knowing they not getting picked. Y’all hate Biden so much y’all can’t think straight.
I don’t really agree that Biden is a bad candidate, relatively speaking. But assuming you’re right,  there’s nothing wrong with voting the lesser of two evils. Given the current state of affairs, we could do much worse than Biden.
No.  The Democrats built the economy.   Trump just rode what was in place, until he crashed it.  Now Biden will have to start over
I think this is the right way to go.  You can’t bully trump. He’s just gonna do whatever the fuck he wants. But we can bully Biden, break him down, and force him to adopt progressive policies. He’s already given a few conssesions. It’s obviously not ideal, but idk what else to do
IMO, There is only ONE who is BAD (Trump) and one who is GOOD (Biden) GO JOE GO!!! 😃👍🇺🇲🌎
It's literally what they do.  The norms of what are legit accusations to levy at your opponent are out the window with them.  I mean, Trump just accused Biden of trying to "hurt God" yesterday - and the ridiculousness of it aside, that's a really bad thing to say about any one
Your guns will be taken away immediately? By Joe Biden? Who is this raving lunatic? And let's hope the gullible rube in the White House doesn't watch his Fox show.
Don’t let 2020 be another Jill Stein moment. We must bring honor &amp; integrity back to this country. Vote for Biden no matter who!!!!
Yep. I'd like these people to tell me what, exactly, are Trump's policies? They seem to be 1) enrich myself, 2) racism, and 3) get re-elected. Biden may be seeking office when he should fricken and he clearly has racial bias he hasn't dealt with, but he's nothing like Trump.
I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks as a VP.
We've been told plenty of times to realize what Trump was trying to say as opposed to what he actually said. That being said, I claim the same rules for Biden.
so he was wrong you ever been wrong before these are just terrible examples especially when you put them up against Joe Biden who might literally have dementia
but again how does that relate to the KKK he is just increasing the livability in suburban areas which will raise property values and if we talking about black poverty pre corona I think Trump was beating Biden on that front
It literally says it in this the article you gave me
- Here is a clip of Biden saying the N-word multiple times just thought I would throw that in
- Ukraine phone call proving the quid pro quo   - Biden pushed it in the senate  - Biden on the crime bill actually kind of disturbing watch the whole thing  We all know he don't campaign
NAFTA and pro iraq war are documented  - Biden on Bird friendship  - Racial jungle and segregation   - Obama administration spying   - Isis and how Obama admin helped
How about Biden being pro Iraq war or pro-NAFTA or his best friend Robert KKKBird who also happened to be the person who filibustered the civil rights act in 1964 or maybe Joe Biden stating he doesn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle to why he likes segregation
I hope you ain't voting Biden atleast
Actually Trump has helped the black community significantly  pre-presidency and while president if you would like examples I would gladly tell you and Biden well he has done his best job to cripple the black community through his 50 years in politics
Biden didn’t write that! Catholics don’t believe in abortion!
It depends if they are black or white because a black antisemite would most likely be anti Biden and Kamala  a white antisemite is most likely a neo nazi version and they probably are pro trump
But I think those voters who are closeted antisemites are anti kamala and anti Biden they probably are going to vote with trump cause he is pretty  straightforward
Yes, by voting for Joe Biden on November 3rd
You are dead wrong.  That's what I have to say to you.  I have never, and WILL never, assert that any human being, much less any politician, is perfect.    Joe Biden is not.  But he's a good man-now supported by increasing numbers of conservatives &amp; GOP members who recognize it.
Biden said today that he would not stop a past president from being prosecuted. Today Trump said Joe Biden could hurt god.  Pretty good day for Biden.
Biden has bowed his head in prayer more times in the past couple of months than Trump has in his entire life.
Hell, if Biden’s that powerful, we better elect him or else. What’s he gonna do to God if he loses?!?!? 😮😱😳
If Biden had the power to ‘hurt God’ does anyone think trump would still be president?
As much as I want* to say Biden, all the ads from Biden start with “We’re down in the polls” and I’ve never seen a political campaign run on that platform before. Also, who is the running mate?  *I don’t want Biden, but, ya kno
Wait till he looses the election. The secret service will have their hands full protecting Biden from gin toting Trump guy.
There is nothing at all deranged about Biden. It sounds like he's the one who is deranged...IMO.🙂
Yes but those black voters that have tension with Jewish people aren’t voting for Biden anyway they have enough reasons his vote choice don’t matter to them if she was at the top of the ticket I could see how that could be a factor
Excited to work with this incredible team to win Iowa for VP Biden, as well as elect Democrats up and down the ticket!
How are you feeling about VP Biden’s ad buy distribution — $220 million for TV, $60 million for digital? Seems too heavy on TV?
I hope not and anybody that has a real problem with that isn’t going to vote for Biden anyway. Yes there is a lot of quietly bigoted people that it might upset but I think those numbers are negligible
So your not denying Biden is a racist?
We better start by electing Biden... then all of the other Good Trouble can happen...
I yelled at one of my close friends when he told me thats why he voted for dumbass in 2016. About 6 months in I got "you were right, he's an idiot." This year he's voting Biden.
The Trump campaign used an unauthorized and altered Gazette photo in an attack ad against Biden -
Adorable, and you should know that is actually Biden watching Iowa beat USC in the Holiday Bowl at a house party in Coralville (unlike what they say in the ad).
Me too! I'm sure Leslie, that Trump is using him to defeat Biden! That is why we must ALL vote for biden. It will take every vote out there.
Trump may think Biden praying in church makes him look weak and alone, but those of us who know God ourselves know the opposite is true.
Heres the link to the story.   And heres the contact link for the City of Luray VA.
I did.

How the hell is Biden going to. He needs to come out of his basement first
What about Biden kissing his grand daughter and sniffing enery little girl possible.
#LincolnVoter Supporter of the Lincoln Project, although not a Republican.  I'm voting for Biden because (as a professor of American history for nearly 40 years) I know that Donald Trump is the most incompetent, ignorant, dishonest, corrupt president in our national history.
Yep I was on the couch (in the Firefighters for Biden shirt) next to my daughter.  It was a packed room cheering on the Hawkeyes.
What is also hilarious about that Biden clip is that this is the first time we’ve seen Biden in months. Dude is AWOL until he comes back to accuse someone of being a cocaine addict
Biden did one thing in 50 years. Sounds like a great politician. He did a hell of a job with hunter.
Tell me anything Biden has done?
Stronger military. Tax cuts. Lowest minority unemployment. Bringing jobs back to America. China trade deal. Got rid of isis that Obama created. Now what has Biden done?
Now tell me what Joe Biden has done in 50 years?
One and the dude felt the need to show off his biden mask. Since i was working i had to restrain myself from comment.
Biden, Trump make opposite pitches to suburban voters on housing
BIDEN WILL COME OUT ON TOP.

Her constituents went overwhelmingly for Biden, so by your logic it would have been wrong to ignore how MA voted.
Happy Birthday    Wish President Obama a happy birthday by donating to Joe Biden
Did I hear #Biden agreed to an interview with   #wishfulthinking
So by using your generalized way of thinking, if you vote for Biden you are into pedophilia
I have kept a couple friends that voted for him, but quickly realized their mistake and are now very much in the Biden camp and vote blue down ticket too after seeing what the GOP has done. Some of the others that stuck with 45 throughout his term I have distanced myself from
BIDEN WOULD WIN!!!..IMO.👍
Joe Biden would WIN! HANDS DOWN!!!👍
I am sure Biden will win!
What do you think, resisters? Should Biden debate Trump? IMO, I think he should! GO JOE GO!!!👍 TEAR TRUMP APART!!!👍  Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
What gets under my skin is knowing even if Biden wins &amp; the fed courts/admin still get stacked with more neocons... all these two-bit liberal-centrist commentators will vanish before hearing the I-told-you-sos. They won't even listen to non-mainstream news to know its happening.
Warren for the best VP..  Biden make it happen!!!!
I don’t think it is. All Kamala has ever said in an interview is how she is willing to help Biden any way she can to become President. What is wrong with that?
Joe Biden holds a pretty commanding lead in the polls right now. So did the  in the Super Bowl a few years back. #vote

Here are the stories they got wrong totally. The Russian collusion hoax, the failure of the media to cover FBI and CIA corruption and even failed to investigate Obama/Biden role in setting up the spying of a political opponent.
I love the way you called Biden's vision as over arching themes. We need a big vision and many other people can fill in the details. We need a compassionate and empathetic person at the helm. It is having an idea of a better country for all. Even for those called despicable.
That’s what you did, don’t think Biden can make it worse
Biden needs to support #UBI. Pass it on. #UBIden
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals. No official time for revealing the pick has been set.
Not to let facts get in the way but Sanders endorses Biden BEFORE Warren did.
I don’t know that it could win, and priority one needs to be getting Trump out.  There was a reason Trump et al was singularly focused on preventing Biden from becoming the nominee.
I'm voting for Joe Biden because he is our best hope for a clean and decent future. #YesWeCanAgain
Only if Biden wins. If Trump wins, the epidemic begins again on the 4th.

Didn’t you call out Biden for his racism that personally affected you?
And we will vote President Biden and Vice President Harris into office! #WeWillVote
Vice President Biden wants to win the “mom vote” but has committed to:  - Eliminating Middle Class Tax Cuts - Healthcare for illegal immigrants  - Reducing funding for the police.   These policies are bad for Iowa families. I will stand against them. #IA01
it was utterly ridiculous the way Cavuto treated  he kept interrupting him when he had stats and proof that Obama and Biden’s economy and job loss stunk compared to  He needs to just state he hates Trump and is Democrat! crazy
Vot for Biden...and make Obama AG
then Biden has a “stroke” and abdicates his position to Kanye. perfect game theory
What’s most likely to happen is that Biden will win by a comfortable margin, Trump will vaguely say the election was illegitimate but leave the White House anyway, then transition into a Fox News fixture to gin up culture war bullshit

Hey,  ... remember April, when you called Joe Biden and the media crazy for suggesting Trump might want to delay the election?  Yeah, good times ...
It’s not about which candidate you like. Trump, as the incumbent, stands to gain more time as president if the election is delayed. Biden would lose potential time as president if the election was delayed.  (All assuming Biden wins. If Trump wins nothing would change.)
Hey first name bunch of numbers..... lol That makes no sense nobody said anything about Biden! Do you have any facts to substantiate your claims that Biden supports China or Wars? I'm feeling you don't but I'd be willing to look at any links you have.
IF YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO JO JORGENSEN, PLEEEEASE DO IT.  NO TRUMP. NO BIDEN. We need this.  All of us. Need to be. FREE.
how did Trump cause 9/11 Bin Laden literally said he wanted to kill Obama because Biden would take control and is to incompetent that he would destroy the country and he is your pick?
Idk i feel like same exact scenario, background, etc but she's male and Biden flatly doesn't want someone aspiring for the presidency as his VP then you might hear some of the same. I'm sure there are sexist smears being lobbed against her, but this didnt feel like that to me
My worry is the bar is being set soooooo low for Biden by Republicans/conservatives that when he’s able to string 3 consecutive sentences together he will look like a genius
We gotta vote for Biden to get trump out of here but we gotta change the leadership in the house they  don’t care about working people they Golding before negotiations even started
There isn’t the votes unity but we might be living in a economic depression if Biden wins and the republicans keep the senate cause they are going impose some austerity that is going to do real damage to working families budgets I think dems want it to happen this wayYou are way to funny. Your banner says "Russua wants Trump and China wants Biden"  You have the the clown Eric Swalwell on and don't even mention China
Could say the same about Biden
Woah the colors of America are red, white, and blue. Sometimes you can out these colors in a circlet. Holy shit, Joe Biden was destined to be president because of these very broad things than can happen!

Biden nor Trump are racists.
Not impossible, but most unlikely thing of this map (to me) is Arizona right now. While traditionally a red/purple state, every poll out right now has Biden and Mark Kelly with a high single digit to double-digit lead in AZ.
I don't want to tell anyone how to run their social media, but please remember how insanely important it is that we elect Biden and Democrats everywhere this election. Entertaining yourself by dragging them is going to discourage enthusiasm, support, and voting.
I've seen multiple people responding to articles saying "I need some context." Watch the fucking video! It's right there! Context doesn't help Biden's case!
You bring up China after ALL your years in office? Why haven’t you done something about it before? You will lose to Greenfield because you lie about her and I shall be happy you are gone. Comrade will lose to Biden and I shall be happy he is gone.
"He's against God, against guns..."
The really shit part is that if Biden wins (Big IF), it won't be because he was the best candidate, ran an inspiring campaign, or anything else positive. It will be because they managed to keep him hidden &amp; quiet while the current Twatwaffle-In-Chief imploded in grand fashion.
It’s all the more galling to write all that you have about the dangers of Trump, and that Democrats needed to nominate Biden, to now equivocate if the VP nominee doesn’t measure up to your faux conservative values.
She wears flamboyant hair colors and dresses all the time so I’m guessing she’s more risqué than Biden. But I don’t know that’s just my view as an outsider
You are not moderate if you’ve only voted republican or do not think Biden “respects the Constitution, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, national security interests, free speech and a free press.”
I’m voting for Biden and Greenfield from the People’s Republic of Johnson County Iowa - the bluest County in the red shit that is rural Iowa voting against their own damn interests when they kept voting for loser do nothing Steve King for example.

Biden doesn’t support any of these unfortunately lol
You are ridiculous, un-American, and extraordinarily entitled if you would choose Trump in the case you don’t love Biden’s veep pick.
“You can’t eat equality”-Joe Biden
I wish Biden were powerful enough to hurt God, but as a compromise I'll take him as is.
Hillary lost last time due to low Dem enthusiasm &amp; turnout. Biden is suffering from low enthusiasm w/ young &amp; independent voters, the same as Hillary - he’s actually slightly worse w/ that group. Warren does best w/ that group. It’s honestly a no brainer  pick
Right, Donald. Just wait until the votes are counted in November. I predict 95% African American vote will go to Biden. You may do marginally better with Latinos...you know, all those conservative Cubans in Miami!
What got tRump elected (other than help from Hillary, of course),was dissatisfaction with the status quo, economic stress, &amp; intense dislike of the establishment corporatocracy. Biden fixes none of that. He is a sedative, intended to put you back to sleep, nothing more or less.
In early Christianity it could be anti-Docetic rhetoric. Trump knows that Jesus had a REAL body which could in fact be injured. He's warning us that Biden denies Christ's corporeality and humanity, making him a Doubting Thomas and a heretic. Vote Proto-Orthodox Party 2020
That column was weak. You trot out every cliche quote about the office of vice president, you threaten to vote for Trump if Biden doesn't choose Harris, &amp; You don't say why Rice isn't up to your standards.  And yes, if you don't vote for Biden it's a vote for Trump.
It will be a public service to watch Joe Biden wipe the floor with you
i cant wait for elections to end so i can stop saying things like 'if media wants biden to win they should give him more media coverage instead of giving 95% of their coverage to trump' and 'every hate group in america became associated with republicans after trump got elected'
I know Joe Biden ain't go get the Popeyes chicken lady to voiceover his ad!

Gazette says photo they took of Biden airbrushed and used by Trump campaign without permission
Bernie was robbed (again). Biden won't save it. I am thinking.  I'm thinking of what actually *corrects the problems* that led to tRump in the first damn place, &amp; Joe "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden ain't it! Neither is whoever they intend to replace him with.
And Biden stops the fire? No, he just pulls a curtain over it. Trump is a symptom of problems that have existed, not their cause. If we allow nothing to change, we will end up with another "tRump" in 4-8, &amp; likely a more dangerous one. Green gets tRump out, too.
Then I'd suggest you get to phone banking &amp; door knocking for Biden, because he's going to need all the help he can get. There are millions of us that are done with the lesser-evilism bullshit.
'No such thing happened': Former acting AG Sally Yates says Obama, Biden did not urge Flynn inquiry  via
If the Dems gave us literally *anything* to vote FOR, they might stand a chance. Obama won Iowa. But then failed to deliver much in the way of actual change. Joe Biden isn't even pretending he'll change a damn thing to help people.
Joe Biden will bring lobbyists &amp; bankers to the table, the same as both Clinton &amp; Obama did. At this point, they're literally trying to lose. They have given the People nothing to vote for. All they have is "better than Trump"; a bar so low I'd have to dig a hole to trip over it.
It's not what they see in him. It's what they don't see in Joe Biden or the Dems; any real substantial difference. The Dems are just as dedicated to the corporatocracy as the GOP. They're doing precisely nothing to earn votes or change minds.
If #BlackLivesMatter movement has made a difference in our attitudes one must wonder if Biden heard the calls?

Dear campaigns: Do not do this.
I’m cool with Biden acting cautiously in a pandemic.  And FYI this pic of Biden was taken in my hometown Coralville IA watching an Iowa football game not hiding.
I’m from Coralville Iowa where this picture of Biden was taken with my state Senator Zach Wahls. #SuburbsForBiden #NoComradesUnder1k
I'm not saying Biden loses (I don't know who will) I'm saying I'm confident that Iowa is going Red this year, and probably in all subsequent election years. Biden is really unpopular here even among Democrats (see: caucuses), let alone swing voters.
Biden has always been really unpopular here, even though Obama is popular (Illinois). We almost killed his campaign in the caucuses. Another Dem (Sanders, Warren, Pete) might have had a chance to beat Trump but once Biden was nominated that notion went 100% out the window.
Hate to say it, but Biden ain't the answer. He &amp; the Dems work for all the same Big Money interests as the Republicans do. If you're serious about seeing real change, there's 1 party in this election representing policies that help, &amp; are favored by, the People, &amp; that's Green.
Biden? Yes he is going to win!!

Biden and Greenfield are tied to eachother in Iowa, which i long suspected. If Biden wins, Greenfield wins. If Biden loses Iowa, Greenfield loses.
Let’s remember who encouraged Americans to drink bleach; that guy had to take a test! Biden was right to laugh the question off,
"The campaign is now in methodical mode as it talks to finalists one-on-one. ... In third place is Rep. Karen Bass, who had a faltering performing on the Sunday shows after revelations about her past views on Cuba and Scientology."
Biden, i am told, cannot pardon state charges. Or civil litigation. 😉
Great interview, but Jill Biden is as delusional as her husband.
Kind of required given the bullshit they regularly pull, wouldn't you think? I mean Trump, Cruz, Cotton, Graham, McConnell, Clinton, Pelosi, Schumer, Biden... All just a bunch of useless clowns!
He could be Joe Biden? 😂  Honestly? Inspiring is nice, but in the end it's just a bonus. Howie &amp; the Greens are willing to earn our votes by backing/pursuing policies favored by a majority of Americans, that serve our interests over those of the Donor Class. They'll work for us.
...Biden supporter. - Facts don't matter - Only official narratives approved by the Almighty Party are to be accepted/discussed - Anything not fitting said narratives is either "fake news" or "a misunderstanding" - Any failure to engage in unquestioning worship is to be shamed
Not much. It's basically been SSDD. - Trump's still an unhinged, narcissistic twatwaffle - #MAGAts still think he's the 2nd Coming - Biden's still a corporate puppet that's being gifted the nom to stop Bernie, &amp; still pandering - #BlueMAGAts still think he's the answer
I would love to visit the Deep South right after Biden wins
Competent national leadership would keep Obama Biden programs like PREDICT which had scientists in Wuhan working on finding and slowing epidemics. Trump cut that program and got rid of other Pandemic Plans and Trump and GOP are responsible for these deaths.
I assume it's going to be Harris. I could be wrong, but it seems unlikely that Biden has actually waited till the last minute to select his running mate. I just wonder what point is served by all this veepstakes political theater, if that's what it is.
Biden is far left? In what universe? I can’t imagine what your sense of the “middle” is
The beloved coffee and lunch spot in Cedar Rapids has been a frequent stop for presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, Carly Fiorina and Rick Perry.
It’s just so damning. He truly isn’t capable of doing the job. This is why Joe Biden can skewer him in a debate.
Because it would be the conservative Dem thing to do. Lines up perfectly with everything else Biden has said like considering a republican VP.
Even if Biden wins AND gets inaugurated, Biden will pardon him as show of reaching across the aisle and to "put it behind us" 🤮
The key of this turd statement is "most people I know". Ask yourself, who are the people that Kellyanne Conway knows? I am pretty sure they aren't the folks who will be voting for Joe Biden in droves.
Just remember, if Trump can do anything he wants under Article II, so can President Biden.  Imagine the possibilities!  Part of Trump's family can be deported, his businesses forced to divest, his associates jailed (or re-jailed!).  Tread carefully!
Here's a good reason not to debate:  Trump will not agree to having his microphone shut off when it is Biden's allotted answer time.  Everyone witnessed his constant interruption of Hillary Clinton's answers during their debates.  Trump thinks it's a game show.
What makes it dumb is that early voting is usually underway before debates or the occasional "October surprise." Using it as an excuse to skip debates this time is silly and suggests a fear that Biden wouldn't do well.
But we both know that Joe Biden is not the answer. You're still my fave, &amp; I appreciate all you've done throughout your career, but I simply cannot follow you down this road to nowhere.  #NoToJoe #GoingGreen

Well, suh, I do not read every Tweet on Twitter. But I do read many, as evidenced by my response to you. So I can only say what I have seen -- which is ZERO Tweets about Bernie buoying Biden.  I have seen multiple Bernicrats switch to supporting Trump, though.
Congratulations Theresa! Iowa Democrats have some great women on the ballot. I get to vote for Theresa Greenfield and Rita Hart along with Joe Biden. #WomenAgainstTrump
Biden is better on: healthcare, nuclear proliferation, climate change, corruption  Trump wants to slash SS/Medicare &amp; pre-ex cond protections during a pandemic, not to mention how bad he's bungled the coronavirus response Biden expands Medicare to 20mil .
Except that they will use Biden to secure the nomination, complete with a VP pick, &amp; THEN hand it off to the VP (my bet is Hillary). DNC is never going to allow anyone like Bernie to be the nominee. They have already shatered their own rules to prevent it twice.
If Bernie were to get back in as an Independebt or leading a 3rd party ticket, yes, I would absolutely be on board. But, no, I am not supporting Joe Biden, or whoever they switch to after acknowledging Joe's decline. The Democratic Party has made it very clear they don't rep me.
Has Biden considered picking Michelle Obama as his VP?
Unless Joe Biden actually adopts policies like M4A, GND, and marijuana legalization I along with millions will not consider voting for him
Well why the fuck are you supporting Biden then. Why aren't you fighting for us?
Your description of Biden has no basis in reality and isn’t his perception in the general population. Dumb comment.

Our highly scholarly, carefully crafted tweets thus reflect some difference in views.   But they're close enough that we can reply to each other in a positive way because we both believe the 2016 riots won't be repeated if Biden wins. 2/2
claims that Article II gives the President unrestricted power.  This would be true of President Biden.  If Biden wanted to act like Trump, can you imagine the laundry list of Executive Orders he could issue?  Starting with the legal status of Trump's in-laws?
"If you elect Donald Trump, there will be no smart people. I have spoken to the smart people and they have assured me that they will only produce smart people for a Joe Biden administration.."
So you can't refute the logic of my argument? Just "can't happen". That's the best you've got? In the example I laid out, who's winning, Evan? That you won't stand up for the policies that benefit you is not my failure, it's yours. Biden is not even "objectively better". (1/2)
But young people won't vote for Biden! Said people who don't know what they're talking about.
Klobuchar knew that no matter what the truth, her position was untenable. My bet is she was the frontrunner and now Biden is trying to make a second choice.
I hate everyone responsible for making Biden the nominee
The Biden joke was stolen from Twitter also
Does Joe Biden know where Joe Biden is?
still placing bets on Biden/Loebsack
My guess is it's part of the general strategy of not making waves while Biden has a comfortable lead. No rush to mess with the race while they're winning. But who knows if that's the case.
We've never had one, they've all believed in some kind of woo woo bullshit spiritual nonsense -- but even Biden's Christian delusions pale in comparison to Trump elevating a psycho that believes demon jizz causes illnesses and that hydroxychloroquine snake oil crap.
Biden's first Executive Order should be to close every single educational institution you attended.  Notice they're not bragging about having you as an alumnus.
I never thought Biden or anyone else should debate Trump.  If you review the debates with Hillary,  Trump kept interrupting her answers, and she couldn't properly make her points.  If there is a debate, his mic needs to be shut off during Biden's answer time.
Very hard to campaign on “If you elect Biden, what will happen with him is already happening with me.”
You need to vote for BIden then.
I really want to find a way to move forward without locking down, but it’s starting to feel inevitable that we will at some point. Probably in January when/if Biden takes over. Hope we don’t have to.
At this rate, I hope to get to a actual bar or restaurant to sit down in about 2022 if Biden wins and 2026 if Trump wins. #covid

All this shit is silly and I'm just happy to see Democrats get frustrated and eat each other, but I love how establishment libs love to call people childish and then do petty childish shit in the same moment. I bet these people are terrible parents.
If Joe Biden was President we wouldn’t have over 155,000 dead and more still dying from a Pandemic because Biden and Obama hired scientists to look for early warnings of pandemic that Trump defunded. Biden wouldn’t have lost 1/3 of our GDP by bungling Covid19 response.

Joe Biden rallied Iowa Democrats at Sunday’s Hall of Fame Celebration, saying the state is critical for his campaign and flipping the Senate in the general election.
Yes it's awful. And it makes me wonder what Trump will do around vaccination efforts if he loses to Biden.
Also was supported in the Black community is my understanding. I like Biden I just don’t really see who Kamala would be scaring away. But what do I know
If Trump can shut down a business without due process, then Biden can shut down Trump hotels.  Might not stand up in court, but courts take time, and that if you accept the court's decision.  Might be an abuse of power, but removals via impeachment are difficult.  Let's play!
A coworker tonight told me it’s imperative to vote Trump out because of what he represents. I said I won’t be voting because I don’t think Biden represents anything better. He had no response. This is no revelation, I just wanted to document this real life interaction.
Thanks so much for helping with the Biden momentum by lying to pollsters and making Trump look even more unpopular!
Isn’t that just rounding out his campaign? The idea of a fighter/someone that can excite many Dems while allowing Biden to continue to keep his hands clean  Plus you need someone recognizable to the general public. At his age people need to know the VP can take over. My 2 cents
PolitiFact - No, Joe Biden will not ‘abolish’ police or prisons, as Donald Trump said
But also we don't want biden to decide who we nominate in 2024, in 2020
I hate that Biden is taking his time but also it's probably a good thing lol
Okay but even that is a benefit to a biden presidency. The normalcy of biden allows those of us on the left to have actual energy to focus on policy advocacy not just surviving the day

He literally endorsed Biden so yes he would
An hour after the polls open, major networks will call the election for Biden.  Journalistically, it wouldnt be right to call it before the polls open.
Let’s say Trump does agree to leave office after he loses the election. What’s the percentage chance he’ll attend Biden’s inauguration? We’re talking more or less 0%, right?
Isn’t this your home state?  Poll: Biden leads Trump by 4 points in Florida -

Why? She shouldn’t be near Biden. She promoted military action in Libya &amp; was responsible more than anyone for our weak response to Russian election hacking.
You are not just voting for Biden in November. You’re voting for democracy. You’re voting for the legacy of heroes like John Lewis. You’re voting for the future they envisioned, that they suffered and bled for. For a more perfect union.
If football gets cancelled and presidential debates happen, Biden should absolutely point out that many of the viewers would be watching football instead if a Democrat had been in office.  Football fans will be pissed and I'd use that, if I were him.
Wouldn't there normally be presidential debates by now? Campaign ads? I'm seeing none of it. I haven't heard anything from Biden about running for president in months.
Oh, JFC. 🙄 Are all of you people so brainwashed by propaganda that you're no longer capable of critical thought? I'm not for Biden, so the only possibility that exists in your empty minds is that I must be for tRump? Tell you what, #FuckTrump &amp; #FuckBiden! Who am I voting for?

Thanks Pres Narcissist, because every day you make sure I remember to Vote for Biden, Vote for Sanity, Vote for Morality and Vote to reject you.
Soooo many conversations just like this! 😂  For  the  &amp; Biden supporters: You want my vote? Fine. Earn it. #GND &amp; #M4A: full versions, not watered-down corporate-friendly neolib knockoffs. That's my price. Meet it, you get my vote. Ball's in your court. I'll wait.
Kamala wouldn’t be my first pick b/c there are more experienced people on the list (Rice, Warren) and I don’t love her prosecutorial record. But “ambition” is a stupid reason to disqualify her. Biden has called himself transitional. We need someone thinking about the next step.
I don’t know if Kamala should be VP. That depends entirely on her and Biden and their relationship and their respective visions. But I absolutely know this is stupid, sexist, insulting reasoning that would never be aimed at a male VP candidate, period.
In 2016, we pretty much knew  was gonna pick  Nobody else on the short list stood out and the search leaked like a old row boat. This time around, atm I don't know who Biden's gonna pick. I imagine we'll see a narrowed list in the next few days
No hc professionals questioning Biden's mental health? Seriously? You have really bubbled your information, haven't you? Of course you won't see such questions on any of the DNC's MSM allies (propaganda only on there), but I've seen dozens just on here.
I'm learning that. Slowly. On November 3rd, we'll take our final exam to see if we learned anything.  Spolier: I'm voting for this fellow "Biden".
Nope, sure won't
We got an ad that was like Joe Biden KNOWS someone who TALKED TO someone who PROBABLY THINKS we should DEFUND THE POLICE   🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
So, what does it tell you that you recognize so many descriptors of tRump in a list about Joe Biden?  Or do the bad things only matter when it's the "other side"? 🙄 (there's only really one side, anymore, the corporate one)
Kamala is a long-standing friend of the Bidens; and she’s worked with Beau and Dr. Biden. She’s had a longer personal and work relationship with the Biden family than Susan Rice. Rice is going to have to answer-rightly or wrongly-about Benghazi which won’t be pretty.You spelled “Joe Biden” wrong... twice, actually.
Also important - The Ds have to take over all the state legislatures possible so, when the election gets to the Electoral College the Electors will vote for [hopefully] popular vote winner Biden - AND since this Admin has messed up the Census, to protect and clean up that fiasco
Here's a weird thought: what if Joe Biden is racist and that's why he keeps saying things that sound racist?
Joe Biden spent 4 decades SAYING he was defending the middle class but never accomplished it.  He was only productive in stealing speeches and being inappropriate with women and girls.

I didn’t want to believe it last time, but he also predicted you’d be impeached. Alan Lichtman always knows. Start packing.
That Joe Biden video about his Corvette really hits different when you read the anecdote about Biden seeing an alleged reckless driver near his home and chasing him across state lines to do a citizens arrest and then continuing to pursue charges until the guy begged him to stop.
Those are all conservative controlled, how do we implement? They have the military. Even the Democrats are controlled by conservatives. Hence Biden.
Yes but they are going tondona switcheroo sometime soon to somebody who can drum up enthusiasm... Biden is not going to be their candidate
Uhh, might want to check the polls. Biden is like +7 in AZ right now. Of course it will tighten, but it's going blue this year.
I don't understand why the Republican party exists? Conservatives already have the Gop, maga, freedom caucus, &amp; bought half the democratic party. Hence Biden. They are less then 1/2 of the population but get 75% of the representation. #TaxationWithoutRepresentation

Yeah for Joe Biden. Eric should be more worried about Cy Vance.
Why not just have Joe Biden take over now?
Biden is insinuating that the people in society with the least power are responsible for the problems in said society. Fuck that.
The first debate should just be questions about policy for Biden and identifying pictures of animals for trump.  Biden will still win.

You are so ridiculous. This is right up there with saying that Biden is going to hurt God, but he's weak. So is he powerful enough to hurt God or not? You don't even recognize praying when you see it. You took a picture of Biden praying to use in your lying commercial. Enough!!!

They are also going after high capacity mags and certain stocks. Don't lie and say Biden is going after AR15s because your false views of "libtards". I know this is hard to believe but there is such thing as being a moderate. You can support gun rights and have liberal views.

Joe Biden is drawing from the caucus teams of some of his former rivals to round out his senior Iowa staff three months to Election Day. Some familiar names here:
Joe Biden's mental ability is a campaign issue that can't be ignored  via
Part of getting older is understanding what battles to choose and also the art of compromise. Is Biden a compromise from Bernie or Warren or Yang? 100%. But it doesn't mean that a Biden admin wouldn't be vastly different from a Trump admin.
I understand the perspective of my young progressive friends who feel like voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump. I encourage you to think about what the next four years will look like under the current administration and ask yourself honestly if you believe that.
Trump campaign uses unauthorized and altered Cedar Rapids Gazette photo to criticize Biden | The Gazette
Trump said he wasn't doing debates. So Biden doesn't have to do jack - except letting Trump implode.
There’s a lot that got us to this point, no question. I hope that people realize if Biden wins, it’s not over. The work to deal with why we got here and prevent it from happening again is just starting.  Otherwise we could end up back here again.
has been debating since he has been elected. The media is the voice of Biden and has been attacking Trump since day 1. The great thing is the more they attack him the more support he gets.
Joe Biden won't be going to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic nomination, while President Trump's considering giving his acceptance speech at the White House.
They need to do it again over the video of Biden in a basement that includes altered photos used without the photographer's permission. The misrepresented and lied about the places and circumstances of the pics, too.
As if that somehow absolves you from guilt. Stop lying and there won't be a problem. Same with digitally altering Biden photo's and LYING about where they were or what was  happening. If Trump can't win fairly, he doesn't deserve to win. Full stop.
I'm voting for the lesser of 2 evils. Biden wasn't even in my top 5.
We're done answering our phones. My who street is lined with Biden and BLM signs.
Must be Trumps fault... I suppose he made them stupider by making them watch Biden speak
I agree!!! I've sent a few tweets toward Biden, letting him know he's badly under-represented on TV here. He needs to remember rural areas rely on TV quite a bit still.
Hilarious. 🤦‍♂️ Biden forgot more than Trump ever knew. And didn’t even have to be a criminal to get there.
I know it wasn't Biden, because you're pissing and moaning like an 8 year old about him being the nominee.
You REALLY think Biden is afraid of debating the stupidest, most corrupt, pathological lying faux president in history? How do you people believe this idiot?
Joe Biden probably doesn't even have a drivers license.  Did we ever see Obama's birth certificate? Hehe 😉
The  really should be stopping Trump from using fake photos of Biden in tv ads.   Here are some of the REAL photos that Trump's minions altered:
If you thought the ‘Defund the Police’ movement wasn’t coming to the suburbs, think again.   This is what folks in Eagan can expect to see if Joe Biden and his Democrat friends in the House and Senate have their way. #mn02
As your President I'll say  F the Constitution.  Little by little we'll tear it apart.  And with the Police defunded. Have fun keeping your family safe and your stuff, well, yours.    I'm Joe Biden, and I'm not sure where I'm at, but I love corn pop.
Trump is not a conservative under any circumstances.  He is all about himself.  Biden is more moderate. Besides we have bigger fish to fry then Green New Deals
Debates are useless and should be abandoned. Just a bunch of try to be clever oneliners. Do a fact based interview like  does. You get all the information needed to vote for Biden
They still haven't answered my request for why FB censored a post I made about Trump while letting the other person's Biden post stand. In my opinion, they're interfering in the election by censoring out things unflattering to Trump.
True or False: Joe Biden will be the nominee on Election Day
Biden is doing it while sitting on the crapper...or while skinny-dipping in front of the Secret Service.
Surely you jest!  Hahahaha You sure that's the hill your campaigns wanna die on? We've listened to Trump for 4 years. Biden is eloquent by comparison. How much did Trump understand yo-semite? Is Greenland for sale? What's covfefe? Who stormed airports in revolutionary war? ETC.
Yes we will: Joe Biden
I've never been more excited to cast my vote for Joe Biden as our next President! #VoteBiden2020
And they think they get to choose the moderators while asking for it.  Delusional. Biden should ask for Trump to release his taxes before any debate.

You have nothing on Biden so you have to invent shit. You incriminate yourself daily. You'll be in jail sooner or later.
Full disclosure to any fellow comrades giving me a follow:  I'm a former Bernie or buster who's voting for Biden. I think Biden is pretty terrible, but he (and by extension the DNC) are far and away better than Trump/conservatives in general.
WHY THE HELL NOT?
I’m channeling Ra’s Al Ghul from Batman Begins.  The Republican Party must be destroyed.  First, a landslide victory for Biden.  Then purge Trumpism.
Biden’s more than happy to debate you and he’s already agreed to do the three debates. Stop gaslighting your ignorant sheeple.   #JoeBidenForPresident2020
I'm actually surprised the campaign managed to get someone with some passable photoshopping skillz.  Normally it's just a stock photo with Biden's head pasted on it.
Again, the irony. I don't see any pictures of Biden with known pedophiles in there. In fact he's making most people smile and laugh.
You might as well vote for Trump if you are mad at the Democrats and can’t see yourself voting for Biden. At least your vote will count then.  Voting third party accomplishes NOTHING.
You should be concerned about the Biden's being involved with Epstein's Island.
Why are we not talking about the Biden's owning land adjacent to Epstein Island?
Never seen someone (especially running for office) get away with more racist remarks than Joe Biden. Let’s send him to the retirement center #VoteRed
Wow... You were talking about Biden, in reference to a video featuring Trump not speaking in coherent sentences?  Isn't that a little like... saying there's too much water in your glass after looking at the ocean?
I'm confused.  Wasn't it always known that Biden would announce his VP pick at the convention?
Joe Biden will accept his party's presidential nomination from his home in Delaware.
Joe Biden will not go to Milwaukee for DNC
Joe Biden will not go to Milwaukee for DNC
very funny watching these Biden attack ads claiming he’s adopted a radical far left agenda. unless he does a kickflip and starts pushing for m4a, that dude isn’t radical
Can you just take the red pill on Biden already.
Sorry,  If you need another Joe to go to Kopp's and eat cheese curds with this month let me know.
Report: Biden no longer coming to Milwaukee to accept presidential nomination
Things are changing every minute, but for what it’s worth, the novelty of Joe Biden’s running mate may have a bigger impact on fall college football than UConn’s cancelation:
..why do you think there's no Biden yard signs or bumper stickers out there...🤔
Visit DC when BIDEN is President!
Nope, not just you.  I'm becoming more convinced that Trump, and the GOP, are campaigning for Biden.
Bankruptcy baby? Pfff that’s the dumbest response I’ve ever heard. Even job Biden could come up with something better
Joe Biden isn’t afraid of anything, but after the Johnathan Swan interview, Trump should be. I can’t believe you’re not embarrassed for him. And honestly after that dancing fiasco of yours, you should probably sit this one out. 👇🏼
Joe Biden: why do I need a test?
Biden's campaign is reserving airtime in 15 states and plans to launch an 'unprecedented' paid media campaign to educate Americans on their voting options.
Then we MUST Vote Biden to do so!
Biden didn't say any of those things.
This is stupid. Joe Biden has already agreed to 3 debates, and I seem to recall him participating in about a thousand democratic primary debates. This crap is just playing into the GOP playbook.
I think she is more senile than Joe Biden... the left has drunk the kool aid and found it refreshing and now is trying to force their poison on us... all states that legalized marijuana is breaking federal laws

You are better than everyone else in mainstream media.  Hopefully you get to interview Biden.  Presidential debates are not need just fact based discussions.  Keep going.
Joe Biden, who never eulogized anyone even remotely problematic, cannot be associated with this.
I'm gonna stick with Biden for 2020.
They are doing a great campaign for Biden! 😉
Joe Biden cares, Trump does not. “It is what it is” was his response to the death of Americans.
I LOVE listening to your interviews that are filled with lies &amp; falsehoods. YOU are helping Joe Biden's campaign with every interview you do. KEEP IT UP!!!!
I'm seeing lifelong Republicans say, "Biden feels like a breath of fresh air."
Biden is gonna be your president on January 21, 2021 and Im going to spend the next 4 years reminding all the troglodyte MAGAts of that very fact.  Choke on it, Ernest.

But definitely keep going on about Biden’s cognition...
Biden needs to be asked some tough questions
I don’t GAF if they switch Biden out for an oak chair. I’m voting for it.
Trump campaign messaging in Iowa is that Biden, under pressure, won't debate Trump. As  notes, Biden said in June he would participate in three fall debates:
But Biden can’t speak Ron. People will claim that this is how it should have been said originally anyways.
Tucker Carlson claimed yesterday that Biden choosing a black female VP was "probably illegal."  Looks like losing his openly racist show writer has not affected the show in any way...
Breaking: Joe Biden can correctly pronounce the names of many of the nation's national parks.   candidate, not so much.  #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden changed his name to "The Amazing Race" I'm pretty sure he could beat Trump.  Every damn time, right Donald?
But Biden has dementia
Nope. Not this time. “For the good of the country “ President Biden will most definitely NOT pardon Donald J. Trump if he gets convicted of anything.
And President Biden will NOT pardon him. Donnie is going down.
"And if YOU will stand with us and vote for Joe Biden in November, President Trump has PERSONALLY authorized you to get a small cut of his winnings!"
You may not like Trump, but the alternative is much worse.   Biden and the left-wing democrats will destroy America.  They want the end of our way of life.   Socialism is so fair it makes us the same, Bull Shit, it holds us down and keeps you in constant poverty, misery loves co.
It's Biden vs Trump
It's all projection.  It's why you hear Trump sycophants floating that Biden wants to duck out of the debates.  Biden has committed to three. Trump's committed to zero.
Yes, but how enthusiastic are voters to vote AGAINST the other candidate? I think a lot of Biden's supporters are thrilled to vote your guy out of office.
They guy is not smart.  I’m not saying Biden is a genius but at least I understand the guy has some compassion and caring.   This guy has zero
Yea but Joe has dementia.  For fucks sake people this guy is a complete and utter fool.  No sympathy or compassion for the people that died just spinning numbers in some weird way to say he is doing a good job, but please continue to tell me Joe Biden is creepy and has dementia
This kooky Trump lady may be lying about internal polls, but I wouldn’t be surprised if their camp has a stronger handle on their universe of likely voters than Biden’s camp does.
Back to the wake up call: I see no evidence of a Biden ground game that would establish a list of known supporters, the people worth pestering at GOTV time. 5/
But I have seen very little evidence of a Biden ground game in this highly democratic neighborhood of a swing state. No one knocks on my door on weekends. I don’t come home to find door hangers. In 2012, my neighborhood team would have been door knocking every weekend 4/
I don't want Biden either but to say he is no better than the Orange Abomination is ridiculous! Biden will not get us where we need to be, but at least this pitstop doesn't look like 1,000 tacobell explosions happened today!
lol it’s amazing seeing the hate anybody left of democrats get by the same group of people when they say anything remotely positive about Biden or even allude to supporting him
Imagine being excited about Biden. Guy can’t even remember which state he’s in
I am so pissed at the media. Just like that headline. Don’t report it like it may be true. It’s not. It’s a lie. Say “Tucker Carlson lies; claiming Biden’s choice of a Female Black VP may be illegal.” I just can’t w these complicit assholes anymore.
Because Trump’s Admin won’t be running the country. You know as much as I do that, IF elected, Biden’s mush-for-brains would turn the VP into the Presidency...
Imagine being excited about Joe Biden. Glad that’s not me
This is your best argument?  Say hello to President Joe Biden!!!
Hey  and  - why is the  doing more to elect Dems up and down the #ballot than you? I’m over this party. You’re more impotent than  110 year old dick. I’m voting Biden because Trump and then going #Independent or #Green.
Virginia Mayor Under Fire Over Racist Post Claiming Biden Picked Aunt Jemima As His VP
I said in April of 2019 that Biden would lose to Trump if it came to that and here we are!
But they censored out 2 pics of Trump with women and his daughter, while leaving pics of Biden with women up.
" is making big gains on Biden in “toss-up” states across the board, from AZ to MI, PA, WI, and FL— states Biden led by a considerable margin just 2 weeks ago."  One of many reasons why: Democrats are encouraging lawlessness and violence.
BOZO is just pissed off that he can’t get any traction. A televised event would give him some kind of credibility.  Joe Biden doesn’t really have to do any debates.
It would be any trump shit show. If it were a real debate Joe Biden would humiliate him in two minutes. I don’t think Joe has to debate him at all.
New Polls Show #Trump Gaining Ground On Biden In Battleground States
Yeah, I see that too. I think the message is referencing the Democratic leadership in the city and states that are experiencing the problems and extrapolating it by implying that they will be more magnified under a Biden presidency since he’s also a Dem. I’m not sure it would.
For a few days this should sooth the fragile ego of a temper tantrum throwing Trump who is getting his ass beat by Joe Biden all over the country!
Time for Germany and the rest of our EU allies to send Biden’s campaign all the intel they’ve collected on Trump and the GOP.
Trump approval back to 51% and supporters 70% more enthusiastic than Biden’s
This is stupid. The polling was actually pretty right in 2016, she was just in the margin of error. Biden is not. And now they do better at weighing by education. Don’t believe me? Look at how accurate the polls were in 2018.
They are not, in fact, FSCKING KIDDING YOU.  I guess Biden can just kiss his shot at the Presidency goodby. I don't know how we can even HOPE to overcome a success like that.  #TrumpIsLosing
Joe Biden won't even move left enough to be in the same neighborhood as Warren, much less Sanders. He is not on our side!
With only 3 months until the election, today is a great day to order a Joe Biden yard sign.
I will be voting for Greenfield, Axne &amp; Biden. Also, I really really miss having you as my president.
For “Biden” see also: Biden’s VP choice
You are not voting for a candidate in this election, you’re voting against a candidate.  Nothing more or less.   “I can’t let Biden win” or “I can’t let trump win”.   There aren’t solid candidates.   Choose your stop-gap and move on to 2024
I wish this was scandalous among our national leadership. I wish our politicians were so honest that these actions would make Biden stand out like a sore thumb.
Biden Increases Edge Over Trump In NPR Battleground Map : NPR  #SmartNews
"It's hard to believe that the hole President Trump dug for himself could get deeper, but it has,"  writes in  latest electoral rankings.   Iowa leans R: "This is another state Trump should win, but one where his advantage has declined."
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in White House if he loses election, says House majority whip  #SmartNews
Until Trump came along, I'm not sure *anyone* was aware that Biden was a Senator from Delaware.  *Finally* we have a President who can correctly, and fearlessly identify a Senator's home state. In fact, Trump was the *first* President to notice that there are a *LOT* of states.
Is it because Trump supports abortion and Biden is a Catholic?
I wish Joe Biden was as drastically left as  the conservative movement pretends he is 😞
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in White House if he loses election, says House majority whip
Joe Biden has been “nearing his final decision on VP” for what seems like the last 300 years.
Biden is not Hillary. She had too much baggage.  Trump now has a poor track record to run on (or run away from).
Biden can chill out in the basement. Trump is doing all the work for him.
just came across this IG art project for 2020, pretty much banking on a Biden victory (if not, it ain’t gonna age well).
I’ll take my chances. Vote for Biden!  #JoeBidenForPresident2020
They already started censorship. I got censored for the 1st time ever. Someone posted a meme of Biden with kids &amp; women. I answered with two of Trump with women &amp; Ivanka. They said mine violated community standards for showing nudity or sexuality(none). Not so with the other one.
Actually, it could. Pence was chosen to calm the evangelicals that thought Trump was not a true conservative. So the VP pick could have pushed Trump to win.  For Biden, it could play too. But, Trump is so bad that most may just not care about the VP pick.
You should be more worried that 46% of the right wing crazies that Breitbart targets still think Biden is a better option
Joe Biden is not competent enough to lead this country. Not strong enough to fight for our country and he is a child sniffing creep who let's children sit on his lap and rub his bare legs in the pool. Vote for the right Jo. Jo Jorgensen is the most qualified candidate we have.
No one has yet seen a Biden yard sign or bumper sticker.. There's a reason for this.. They're not being produced.. Why? Because he's not going to be on the ticket in November.. #Election2020
Trump energy policy key to reviving economy — Biden plan would destroy jobs, raise energy costs  #FoxNews

The Allamakee County Democrats printed their own Biden yard signs. I kinda love the idea.
I can do anything but follow once I get up to ~5,000.  I can unfollow people, which allows me to follow different people up to that number again.
I didn't mean for that to sound as 'mean' as that was when I re-read my post.  Just trying to figure out how to surpass the 5k wall that I seem to be at.
This post is about the 400 limit per day, but I am at the 5k wall.  😬
He struggled to pronounce words at a rally, snorted + stumbled across words. At least you actually know what Biden says
While President Trump Leads The Coronavirus Response, Biden Spreads False Claims
Perfect illustration of the secrecy of this administration &amp; why to not vote for them. Hold a Biden town hall during the time. He wants to get his message out, even if Trump doesn't.
Yep.  On November 3rd.  When Biden becomes President.
Yes, Biden's eating Trump's Rust Belt base because folks no longer have that economic anxiety we've been hearing so much about.
Is it?  Everyday I see tweets asking “If Biden chooses _____________ as VP will you still vote for him?”  Questions like that would make me cautious about my choice as well.  And your tweet doesn’t help
Nice ratio you got there, ma'am.  I find your insinuation that Mr. Biden is doing anything other than executing a plan alarming. Do you have any evidence, at all? Or are you just pulling shit out of the far end of your alimentary canal because the NYT wants Trump to win, again?
I don’t know why Joe Biden even needs to debate him. It would be a trump shit show. If it were a real debate BOZO it would be absolutely humiliating for him.
Every staff meeting at   Producers: Remember all you reporters, ask every single guest about their thoughts on the Biden VP. And if they’re on the list, ask them if they’ve been picked.  Reporters: THEY ALWAYS NO COMMENT!  Producers: Everybody quiet or no more coffee!

Dude your going to need more the just a handful of racist to win good luck cause the rest of us good people will be voting for Biden
Dirty Rice!
it’s not “Biden’s” pick. It is the DNC’s pick, and I hope delegates make a wise choice instead of placing a rubber stamp on Biden campaign opinion.
Trending way up toward Trump in the last week and I personally have record 6 calls this week and said I would vote for Biden BC the left is so dangerous.
Medicare is the only reason I have a roof over my head. He owes me an explanation on why he doesn’t support  I’ve been through hell and I deserve answers. Someone get me Joe Biden. Right Meow. He can poke me in the chest all he wants, I’ve been through much worse.
I’ve lost everything due to the American Health Care System. I demand to speak with  I was homeless 2X under the Obama/Biden presidency &amp; lost everything. Still digging our way out of debt, will always be digging our way out of debt.
Majority won’t vote for Biden.   But Biden only has to win among those that actually vote. That is going to be Trump’s problem. Trump is not inspiring his base.
We will after Joe Biden is elected!   #JoeBidenForPresident2020 🇺🇸
For everyone who will be upset with Biden's VP pick...the Democratic party is not an airport, you don't have to announce your departure.
It's bizarre that this virus has basically put everything on hold until 2021 and we have an election coming up... which hopefully Biden wins, but if he does... it's not like he is gonna airdrop vaccine on all of us. We are still going to be pretty fucked for months to come. 😢
should hold a Town Hall at the same time and invite all the press. If Trump doesn't want his message to get to the American people, Biden does.
The fact that “settle for biden” is joe’s strongest platform is hilarious
And how many Trump supporters are there? Biden supporter
Vote for Joe Biden in November! Undo the nightmare.   #DumpTrump #VoteBlue
You are correct -- a Biden win would require Trump to leave office. That's how elections work.
I'm so glad  is banning the reporters. That frees them up to have a Biden Town Hall while Repubs are having their convention. They can cover Biden the entire time the convention is being held. Woohoo!!  Reporters won't see Trump nomination
Okay,  Someone posted. Collage of pictures of Biden with kids. This one.
I may have miscalculated.  Do I need to get to 5k followers to follow back people?  If so, this is more ridiculous than I though.
I got to see her in a living room in Des Moines Iowa, and I’ve never fealt more hopeful in my entire life.  belongs in the White House. Something tells me Biden doesn’t want the right kind of strong black woman, he wants a complacent one, an Ivanka/Donald type deal.🤮
I've been surprised to see no one point out that this has all worked out as if planned to benefit Harris.  Not to say she had a direct hand in pointing reporters to "Biden allies" who would say stupid, incendiary things about her.  But at that level, the candidate rarely needs to

BERNIE LOST. TWICE.  He gets no say in anything. Biden was extremely polite in allowing Bernie to join him in creating a platform. But that's more than enough kowtowing to Bernie freaking Sanders.
Imagine the only way you can achieve orgasm is seeing someone vote for Biden. What a cursed existence
Joe Biden? He did after all he was friends with Sen. Bird.
It’s like they are trying to sabotage Biden with these VP choices!

As the former Vice President nears a final decision on a running mate, he is expected to announce a pick the week of Aug. 10.
I'm going to vote for Biden and then push as hard as possible to get as many progressive ideas passed into law. Step 1 is having a Democrat in the White House.
I have no problem eating my words if I'm wrong, but it wouldn't even surprise me if Biden's VP pick is finally unveiled and it's, like, Joe Manchin or some shit.
Thank you for the shout out.  I need 60 more followers before I can follow back again.
in an unprecedented move, joe biden announces he won't be naming his vp pick until after the election.
All you “Hunter Biden” made money while his dad was VP, might want to check this out.  Serving in official capacity in the White House and made how much????
Got super furious about Joe Biden in the middle of the night and now I can't go back to sleep. He's gonna fucking lose like the fucking eternal chump he is
Umm, excuse me, what? And you think Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time? #SendHelp #TrumpHasLostHisMind
terrified no matter who biden picks as his vp. itll either be the scientologist or copmala and i dont know which is worse
Biden was not president. The comparison doesn't work. You would need to compare a president with another president.
FYI this is a Chinese/democrat virus... thank joe Biden
We do!  Look for it on Kickstarter next month.  It’s the nominees from this election cycle. I know Biden is the candidate but I think the artwork and the historical significance is still there!
Here’s hoping Biden has a place in the administration for Walt next January
Absolutely agree..the 2party system is always a race to the bottom.  We need a transitional period to fix this system because it doesnt deal with a corrupt president.  BBC said it best...Biden is smooth jazz in the background. Trump is heavy medal screaming at you every damn day.
Biden quotes his wife quoting Kierkegaard:  "Faith sees best in the dark"
Everyone pretend you don't see these polls. Pretend Trump is ahead and we have to do literally everything possible to gather votes for Biden. Complacency could be devastating, and we CANNOT do 4 more years of Trump. It has to be a MASSIVE loss to deliver the message to Trumpism.
Do you think Biden can do better? 🤔

Imagine thinking this would tank Biden.
Biden hit his peak about two weeks ago.  Trump is closing the gap now.
Not big on conspiracies, but the best way for a Harris supporter to force Biden to tap her is: Send reporters to donors/associates who you know have shitty opinions on Harris.  Pushback inevitably falls against Biden himself &amp; can only be redressed by putting Harris on the ticket
BLUE WAVE 2020!  94 days 7hrs and 35mins until election day!   #Resist  #BlueWave2020  #Biden
I don't understand why otherwise intelligent people are letting terrible headlines convince them that Biden / his campaign staff think Harris is 'too ambitious'.  *Every single article* attributes those opinions to "Biden allies".  So in other words: NOT BIDEN &amp; NOT HIS CAMPAIGN.
Bro, you’re going to lose to Joe Freaking Biden
Biden will do the right thing here. The stakes are too high now.
Focus first on voting out every R member of every office throughout the country  and replacing them with Biden &amp; Ds down the line == then get behind them and push them to legislate what you want = it’s not enough to win elections, need to govern too
You heard it from the leader of the Squad: Joe Biden has the most progressive (socialist) platform of any candidate ever. #mn05 #stribpol
This was the most smooth brained thing I've read today. Why did the other countries ban it then? Why did Joe biden force his staffers to delete it?
Many other countries have banned it already. Shit Sleepy Joe Biden forced his staffers to delete it off their phones.

You are the president we need now. And Dr. Biden is the First Lady we need ❤️ stay healthy Biden family!!
It's like, you are campaigning for Biden.  Do you know something? Say something.
The news?? Since when is it the role of the news to present the detailed position statements and actual ideas of political candidates? Or is that just your admission that Biden needs that much help and support because he isn’t capable of handling it on his own?
Don't listen to Obama and Biden.
Obviously Bush v. Gore happened and could happen again. For that to happen, the election has to be very close *and* it must make a difference in the outcome. It's a rare combination of circumstances, though serious enough for Biden to have a staffer game it out.
Oh bullshit...Trump is gonna squash Biden....he hasn't  a snowballs chance in hell!!!!!
Oh yeah he’s fresh out of viable plans. There also way to defeat Joe Biden and he knows it.
I'm a mom who would like school to open *when it's safe* (which it's not), and I support Joe Biden. Your tweet makes no sense.
I love how the main line of attack on Biden is he's a doddering old man who can't remember anything, like anything this doddering old man says registers in his own head
Just being diplomatic. Maybe he could say "I'm glad that former President Trump is still here to help with the transition to the Biden presidency."
Why remove him from the premises? The Constitution doesn't even mention the White House.   Biden can just take the oath and set up shop with Trump still in there. He can call Trump an honored guest.  #thebeat
I’m voting for Joe Biden! We need to bring integrity back to the Oval Office. #JoeBiden2020
Trump has become so anti-democratic and authoritarian that I’d take nearly anyone over him at this point, and that includes Biden.
Biden is old... 🤔
Wear a mask, wash your hands, and don't vote for Biden.  Okay, sounds easy enough.
It made sense before it was 1on1, You vs Biden. I mean,  was literally sending voters out to die to stop #Bernie from being nominated. Perfect time!  In fact, I tweeted it to you Donny! Fairly early in the year too...  I'm starting to wonder if you even read my tweets?!
Oh God, here we go again. Biden was reading what’s called a direct quotation. All you heard was the “N-word.” Listen to EVERYTHING and not just the parts that you think prove your “point.” Prior to saying what someone else said, he says, “quote.” How’s Remedial English going?
Biden supporters?  Both of them?
Trump should, not Biden.
Romney can't even commit to voting for Biden. Unbelievable.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I guess he would resign and then ask Dense to pardon him or he wo ih ld Hitler himself. My question is, if he resigns and gets pardoned, can President Biden remove that pardon! I'm just wondering.
Is it just me, or does it kind of feel like right now Joe Biden could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and still get elected? #YesItsThatBad
IA3. It was Trump +3 in 2016 and Cindy Axne won by 2 in 2018. So I guess Biden+ 2  but I am not an expert so maybe other people have a better idea.
OMG, you think people are just going to write "Biden" on a scrap of paper and send it in, don't you? I guess that's what happens when you swear in a president who doesn't have the slightest idea how government works.
He can’t get it done.  He is just trolling the Biden campaign.
He WILL announce Harris. The Biden-Harris ticket has been what the DNC has wanted since he announced. It’s a given. But the problem remains that Joe is still top of the ticket. A wide field of very capable candidates and the absolute weakest is the default nominee. 🙄
You want to give Biden bedbugs?
Yeah before the debates and Biden can’t remember what year it is
You actually think Joe Biden is going to win? Everyone knows the left is dangerous and the right doesn’t give an an accurate response on the poll phone calls because of it. Biden is literally pooping in diapers. No chance
Joe Biden is pooping his pants. Let’s watch the debates and see
And Biden would already be in a nursing home.
Joe Biden laying the groundwork for prosecuting anarchists:
Lmao with Joe Biden! Your kidding right?
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have very different plans for the next four years.
After the election, if Biden wins. If trump wins we'll have a "2nd wave"
2/2 Towns that refused wound lose federal aid. This rule was one of the worst abuses of power in the Obama/Biden administration.  A raw power grab masquerading as racial justice.
Is says Biden works for Iowa in the back this is definitely before the Iowa caucuses lol
Had this program been allowsed to stand (Biden will double down) towns everywhere would have to scrap zoning, build bigger water and sewer lines to make room for high density living, expand schools and social services.  Thus would lead to massive local taxes increases.  1/2
So clearly we have two presidential candidates who are obsessively focused on Donald Trump: Trump himself and Biden. Is there anyone out there willing to run and share their own ideas?
Oh.....so your voting for Biden then?
Don’t worry. America, not Joe Biden, will keep her from becoming VP.
Biden is going to beat that man like a drum. I can't wait.
I’m thinking Biden will be loyal to the constitution as well.
I suppose that makes sense. I’ve just never seen it. Everyone I know irl who “supports” Biden will tell you they really wanted someone else but he’s better than trump so he’s all we’ve got now. I don’t think I’ve even read anything online expressing actual support for Biden.
Just witnessed Fox News say that at some point Biden is going to have to stop calling people names...... ummmmmm. Huh? #irony
Joe Biden is ambitious.  47/48
If Kamala Harris Is ‘Too Ambitious’ to Be Joe Biden’s 2020 VP Pick, Then So Is Every Woman With Ambition
All Ryan wants is for Biden to push some good policy that is very popular and he would jump on board. Why don’t you ask Biden’s campaign why they arent reaching out to the left wing of the party?
We sell more Ag when Biden is President includes ethanol 😂😂😂
Do Biden supporters actually exist?  I legitimately do not know of a single person who isn’t just settling.
If you are a Democrat right now I feel sorry for you. Absent minded Joe Biden doesn’t stand a chance. Biden will feel like he’s been through a wood chipper On November 3rd.
Did you see Cory’s reaction last night on The Last Word when Lawrence told Sen. Booker about Biden’s note with Kamala at the top? I think the word I’m looking for is “giddy.” What a good guy to show real enthusiasm for his colleague. #NoPokerFace
Weekend at bernies Biden style.
Biden demands Trump stop retweeting unfounded coronavirus claims from 'crazy woman' | TheHill
How is anyone assuming Biden can make it 8 years?
Can you say "culture war"? The POTUS again uses Twitter to support a doctor who has no credentials when it comes to COVID! He is now in Texas to raise $$$ for his campaign instead of doing his job to deal with the Pandemic.The election can't come soon enough. GO JOE BIDEN!!!!

Note to self: “Do not hold grudges.” Really?
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves: The president has started spending more money in much smaller states like Iowa [Argh!] and Nevada, and in recent days has stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely
At this point, it's Biden's VP vs Trump.  #2020Elections  #VPPick
I wonder why trump is saying this?
Nope. The investigation more than paid for itself with fines and forfeitures. And, it's been standard to not charge a sitting president. Mueller clearly said it didn't exonerate Trump. And, you return to your original lie that Biden hasn't answered questions in 2 months. He has.
Billionaire George Soros Gives Whopping $50M to Help Biden and Other Dems Win US Elections
Don't forget  she was giddy at that presser about dirtying up Joe Biden.
Someone needs to make one of these with Biden’s picture and his handlersFriday afternoon? #God is probably out picking up groceries for the Sabbath, and #Biden is right behind Him, "accidentally" ramming his grocery cart into the Lord's Achilles' tendons every chance he gets. #HurtGod
Biden could pick Jesus Christ Himself as his VP and Chuck Todd &amp; Andrea Mitchell would be on camera in 5 minutes to criticize it as the worst decision of all time.
you are my new hero.  Pussy Lips Pelosi  is not out for “We the People” she is for herself.  Pelosi has no integrity, morals or ethics. She is eat up with hate, towards POTUS &amp; his supporter, that she is mentally unstable like Biden. #VoteDemsOut2020
Biden was denied Catholic communion for supporting baby killing. What kind of a "good Catholic" is that?

Listen um um um look... that’s what Biden says in every interview. He sounds coherent for about a minute and then it all goes to hell. Biden supporters should NEVER bag on anyone about their ability to speak these days 🤣
You will not take away my weapons! They are the last defense for myself and family. PRO2A.  #Iowa
wait, but isn't Donald J Trump President here in 2020??  so Barack Obama and Joe Biden need to do what exactly??  I'll concede the argument if in 2021 and Joe Biden is President and murders increase under him as well. then, yes, Joe Biden needs to fix it.
All you responding that Joe can fix this are clueless. Look at H1N1; it was far less contagious and 60-80 MILLION were infected under Obama/Biden. The mortality rate was lower because it affected younger people. Biden won’t change anything just because you hate Trump.
What in God’s name are you talking about and what news stations are you watching? Three debates have been agreed upon and Trump is requesting a 4th. Nobody on the planet would be afraid to debate Joe Biden!  He was a disaster in the primaries and has declined further since then
Probably waiting to hear if Trump will accept Biden having a teleprompter with them telling him how to respond. Or MAYBE they’ll just have a TV on his stool and he can debate virtually from his basement 🤣
Biden no longer coming to Milwaukee to accept presidential nomination
Classic Biden.
Trump wants to deliver convention speech from White House and Biden will hold a virtual convention...but school children must go back to school!
You forgot to mention she also said that:  OBAMA AND BIDEN DIDN’T TRY TO INFLUENCE THE FBI INVESTIGATION!  FLYNN’S LIES TO THE FBI WERE ABSOLUTELY MATERIAL TO A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION!
Senator Kennedy just said Biden wants to be Bernies and Sandi Cortez’ second cousin.  😂😂.
Joe Biden is very much looking forward to debating the president  He just said so today.. So why is everyone telling him not to do it You don't trust his judgment whether to debate or not How can he run the country
This Is The New normal. Congratulations Vice President Biden on your nomination.
Joe Biden, also a private citizen, is doing what he does best, just sitting back and letting you and your boss look and sound dumb.
You're not very good at your job, are you? Hunter Biden what-about-ism is long past it's expiration date, and just so you know, the location of any private citizen at any given time is none of your business.
He tweeted a photo of Biden “alone” and “hiding” in “Delaware.” A) this is in Coralville, IA and B) there’s clearly a knee in the photo.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Oh would they have? Glad you are a mind reader! Don’t act like Biden would have been better! He’s done nothing for 40+ years why would he change that now?
Hunter Biden isn’t running for President...
I agree with you. I just don’t understand it. It’s not like they are going to vote for Biden.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.

I’m sorry where is it in court or anywhere that Biden has raped children!?  #biden2020 forever!  I just can’t believe some of you women support that racist rapist Oompaloompa! I’m just shocked!
The Democrats' No. 1 job is to restore constitutional rule to this country by ridding it of what Schmidt calls this “illiberal, dishonest, vile, corrupt and galactically incompetent president.” Republicans can help with that.
You could tell that Biden really had to focus on listening to him
Biden came up with several steps to fight covid last week... They ALL have already been done. He has nothing ... His campaign should've made him aware of it...  He'd be embarrassed if he was in possession of any of his faculties
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
I hope Biden chooses a slay queen as his VP
I wanted Biden to announce Kamala back in January. The way he's handling it may be criticized as clumsy or irritating, but "indecisiveness" is the wrong word. As a journalist, Drew has no evidence that Biden is still in a quandary over what to do.
I will happily vote for Biden id vote for dog vomit over trump
More likely Trump will not go against Biden in an actual live debate.  Trump is an uneducated loud mouth who cares nothing for the truth. Biden actually knows what truth is.
There is a real possibility that, this coming week, Joe Biden will be selecting the 47th president of the United States.
So, has any women gotten up there and got a suit against him?  Maybe Obama and Biden have been to Jerry Upstiens nice little villa in the Virgin Island?  Your President Clinton has, Kennedy was play boying around in the White House or dont you know all of this either?
Id vote for a flaming bag of dog shit vs Trump.  So yes.  Id still vote biden if he didnt debate him.  Id be very surprised if he didnt id see trump try to get out of debating biden but thats me
Rest assured there will be no large scale wave of voter fraud sweeping Joe Biden into the White House. Just the Republicans trying to usurp the will of the people.
Not until President Biden becomes responsible, so they can blame him.
Joe Biden is the farthest thing from a real president 😂

okay but how in theeeee fuck is joe biden ab to save us🧐
I can't vote, but with our choices in at peace with that. I'm a conservative, but I don't care for how Trump treats women. And at the same time every time I see Biden groping and sniffing little girls my skin crawls. I don't know how one of those dad's hasn't knocked him TF out.
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Just like Joe Biden was today huh!
Video debate where Biden is a deepfake imposter
👍 on  If Biden picks Kamala, TRUMP WINSThat's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump’s behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don’t have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
I am with you but Biden will make it even harder for me to vote for him if he picks Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I might have to get drunk and stoned before I fill out my ballot if they are on it.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO IT
Obama fucked up by not endorsing AOC. I don't think I can vote for Biden now. I am totally over these neo-lib corporate class Democrats.

Joe Biden has a big heart and an addled brain.
Aw crap. I didn't even know this was possible. If Biden stops talking in public, he's going to get elected, and then we're screwed. I'll miss God and the Bible. And guns... wait, does this count airsoft?
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as his VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
I'm in the same mind set. I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as the VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. And I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.
Oh trust me... I have never said any candidate is non flawed!! But if any other politician had said what Biden has over the last few days .. it would be headlines ... but it’s crickets
Oh and I am sure that Biden personally wrote the tweet or even told someone what to write!! Really? You heard this interview didn’t you? You heard his tone ? And how he spoke to the reporter ? We have a President who speaks for himself and owns it!! #CheckItOut
Ummmm you actually believe that Biden copped to this ??? Now that’s funny!! And because you believe it... you are part the problem!! SMH
If Biden is faking his dementia. how does he get his eyes to appear dead, zombie-like?  Are you saying he faked his two brain aneurysms also?
So, according to Mr Bunder Biden, ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE SAME! No diversity exists among them? It wasn’t long ago he touted this insult:”If you ain’t black you ain’t voting Democrat”.
Where does he go after this with his smears? What’s worse than God hates Biden?
How does he escalate this? Biden can blow up the planet with just one look?
But don’t tell us what Biden said about Blacks this morning.  Probably not important to you but maybe to a lot of blacks
The dead people that will vote for Biden won’t care what happens in the debate
From CNN: Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement Fact check: Trump ad edits out microphone and trees from Biden photo to make him seem alone in basement (Trump tries everything )
Today, if you can't decide between Joe Biden and Pres. Trump, stay home on Nov 3.
You’re not concerned about Biden at all? Like not even a percent? Have you seen... anything he said? Let’s go back years upon years ago when his brain was fine and he said “We already have a nigger mayor, we don’t need another nigger big shot”. Why on earth is that okay with u??
All the things you just mentioned will definitely happen when Biden's radical woke progressive leftist female PoC VP becomes President the first week after Biden is sworn into office.
He's the best the Dems could nominate in order to secure the Black vote.  Because if you don't vote for Biden then "you ain't Black!"
That looks like Trump mocking someone in a debate.  If he and Biden end up debating (and I think it's doubtful) then we'll probably get to see much more of this when Biden stumbles all over himself.
I apologize if I sound angry, but I'm so tired of people picking on Bernie. I'm disappointed that they conspired against him and crushed His campaign. But I in no way blame him for anything. I am sick and tired of people trashing Bernie for Trying to work with Biden.
I don't give a crap about either Biden or Trump.
This has been the only sign I’ve see supporting trump but it’s spelt trunp.  Quad cities not looking great.   #Trump #trunp #Biden
Biden is an elderly man who had two brain aneurysms in 1988. One on the left side, one on the right side. Long-term affects of aneurysms include mental confusion and trouble articulating words. Maybe it’s not dementia, but the result of a “silent stroke(s)”
I mean to be fair I’d have a similar stance of opinion on what I said if it were Biden, or Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, getting interviewed in such a disrespectful and badgering manner. It’s just plain bad journalism.
Biden leads by 40 points 🤡🤡🤡
It seems likely that the Republicans are trying to draw Biden out by making it seem like he’s in a basement. The truth is they don’t have enough B-roll footage they can use to demonize him, so they need him to be out in public more
So Biden gets to ask a black man if he is a cocaine using junkie and the Left pretends it is nothing.  Hypocrisy at its finest.
We would get to see Trump's thoughts without the chain link fence filter that precedes his tweets and Biden would forget what's going on after 10 minutes   It would be such great content
(I don’t think Biden gets the nomination, citing Cognitive decline, which is honestly a smart move)
Biden isn’t going to Milwaukee to accept the DNC nomination due to COVID (You know the surging COVID numbers in Milwaukee) and will instead accept it at a speech in Deleware later   Sounds like the DNC is buying time to me
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Oh, you all forgot that Joe Biden is actually not very good at running for President?
Because him running is gonna draw people that would otherwise Vote for biden not Trump supporters
And Biden has lost touch with everything going  on around him...great choices we have!
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
Our Hispanic farmers work hard to grow their businesses and help put food on America's table. It's time they got a level playing field.    will build on the progress made under the Obama-Biden Administration, and will work to #BuildBackBetter for our Hispanic community.

You didn't beat Obama. I think you have dementia not biden
Yes! If they debate, Trump will just spew more lies. I’ve already heard enough to make my head explode. Biden all the way, debate or no debate!

I'm going to hold my nose and vote for Biden except if he picks Warren or Harris. Then I'll write in Bernie on my Iowa Ballot.
Mostly KHive people were cutting down Scientology because they're jealous Karen Bass is being seriously considered by Biden too.  Picking on candidate because She's even trying to get Scientologist to vote for her is GROSS! If she excluded them she lose her seat.
I am a Dem Socialist &amp; I am NOT Antifa. I DONT EVEN GO TO PROTESTS. I am a healthcare worker. I love Bernie. Hated Hillary so much I voted Trump. Now I hate Trump more than I dislike Biden....so I'll vote for JB as long as he doesn't pick Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris as VP.
Isn’t Biden supposed to announce his running mate today?
Karen Bass is a better person  than Kamala Harris will EVER be. She is an excellent choice as VP for Joe Biden. Harris is a back-stabber and a Hillary Clinton clone. She would stab Biden in back just to be President.
YOUR DOING THE SAME THING WITH BIDEN SSKSSKSHSHSKS
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I’ve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn’t happen. We’ll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Mainstream media can’t promote Bill or Hillary endorsing Biden for President if they bring it up. Especially with Creepy Uncle Joes history.
trump is our national embarrassment. VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!!
So, we’re all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I’m really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. 🙃 I’ve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.
I am an Iowan for Biden but good luck!
Voting for Biden in one election doesn’t absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I’m more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it’s going to happen. And the cockiness I’m seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you’re right it’s not 2016. It’s an even worse situation where most people don’t even want Biden. That’s a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn’t run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.
Joe Biden? More like McDoesn't know where the fuck he is half the time.
Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris’s new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
The proverity level where we live.  You have done many hurtful things to me personally. I have taken it personal. I don’t love Biden but the hate you have showed to me gives me more motivation than I have ever had to vote. I went from being a strong Republican to now
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can’t afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn’t cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We’ve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden’s already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit now"If you don't vote at all or don't vote for biden, you're voting for Tr-  Me, in a Rick Sanchez voice:  "That just sounds like voter intimidation with extra steps"
Yeah. Take away the left part of the “center” button and that’s a lot closer to actual Biden
I’d actually consider voting for a democrat not named joe Biden, I’m legitametly concerned about how he can’t say a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about
The people that don’t want the debate know that Trump will make more of a clown out of Biden.  If you can’t see that then you’re a clown ur self.
I need to be clear on the fact that nothing will have me vote for trump. If Biden come out and say “NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA” I just won’t vote at all. MAGA idiots think everytime Biden fuck up it’s a vote for their overlord
That said, and I agree with you, you must be absolutely disgusted by Joe Biden's comments today.
I'm a communist and I do NOT want biden as president
Typical that Biden can get away with implying the African-American reporter should be tested for cocaine use And President Trump’s economy brings about the lowest unemployment rates for African-Americans and he’s called the racist.  Something wrong with this picture
Sounds like he’s a racist to me.  He attempted to bully the reporter into not asking anymore questions about it. Same tactic he has used to belittle others who have asked tough questions on campaign trail.  Basically the attitude, “I’m Joe Biden..how dare you ask me anything”
Biden all the way.
Lol Biden’s going to blow a 200 - 0 lead
Joe Biden eulogized Strom Thurmond, but you don't seem to have a problem with that. Your double standards and selective outrage are mind boggling
Sad, but true.    I agree with the suggestion that every #CovidObit should include this: “In lieu of flowers please register voters, volunteer &amp; vote for Joe Biden and Democrats down the Ballot!”  #CovidObits
All the more reason to vote for Biden
Some major focal points this week will be an update on China’s import numbers &amp; the U.S. employment report on Fri. On the political front, Joe Biden said he will make his decision on his VP choice this week, but an announcement might not come until the week of Aug. 10.  #pfnews
I joined LGBTQ+ for Biden
I'm still planning on writing in Andrew Yang for President. Too many people are going to vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR someone they believe in. Joe Biden doesn't have too many years left, and it's hard to believe that he'll do anything impactful for the future generations.
I'm not going to lie... I'm starting to warm up to the idea of voting biden if he chooses kamala... Because you KNOW he ain't making it 4 years.
You can vote for whoever you want. Assholes on the internet like to guilt people into voting biden. "If you don't vote/vote for someone else, you're voting trump"  Rick Sanchez voice: that just sounds like voter intimidation with extra steps
He also admitted to me it was mainly about hurting Biden, I know Kanye himself said it, but it's wild how these guys have zero concience, promoting a Trump admin through sheer manipulation.
I’m proud of Virginia. Looks like it will go to Biden. Wish I could say the same. My state is so close it’s embarrassing. The criminal actually leads the polls🤬
I do not disagree with you. That person is clearly a fanatic, so I would challenge her to explain why she thinks her 401k will go to crap if Biden wins. My point is that the person is just parroting what Trump says.
There's like a 5% shot Biden even knows who this is, right?
I've noticed SO MANY as I've ridden my bike around DSM this summer and they're usually in clusters. I wonder if they're waiting until Biden accepts the nomination, and then they'll accept reality?!

The VP came to Iowa in the middle of a pandemic and after a major storm. Meeting with Iowans and farmers in person. That’s leadership. When is Biden coming to Iowa besides by Zoom?

Reminder: President Trump carried Iowa by 9 points in 2016. Some counties voted twice for Obama and then flipped. Republicans swept the state legislature that year, too.   Now polls show a tight race here between Trump/Biden. This is Pence's third trip to IA since May.

So if Biden says I am against abortion, but I am not for forcing my belief on this subject to others (pro choice) is he excommunicated?  Or is ok for all religions to mandate and force their beliefs on others?
She's not my favorite choice and neither was Biden. But everytime the president doesn't like a woman Rep or Dem he calls her nasty. Its obvious :Nasty"means bitch. If she was a man we wouldnt be having this conversation. This isn't presidential.

I’ve seen a couple castrate/kill pedophiles posts circulating here and on Facebook in the past week and I’m sorta wondering where that came from. I feel like it’s a 2 part interactive social campaign and the next part is evidence that Trump or Biden are pedos.
Hillary Clinton or her good family friend and donor Donald Trump were not acceptable options in 2016 and voted 3rd Party.  Seeing what Trump has done the last four years it’s apparent he is not a choice this time around either. I’m voting Biden/Harris in November. #LincolnVoter
That’s a good thing, isn’t it?  “Tucker Carlson warned his viewers last night that if Biden is elected, everything Trump has done to this country will be reversed! 🤷🏻‍♂️”
running Biden and Harris because Sanders or hell even Warren are too "extreme" meanwhile media has already painted both Biden and Harris as revolutionary Marxists
I heard Beau Biden speak in an Iowa backyard over 10 years ago introduced by  and I thought he would run for president one day. After today's speech by  he is on the ballot in a sense. Photo for  in 2019.
You would think all Biden/Harris would need to do would be to just give speeches that are inspirational and coherent a few times a week with decent coverage and that should nail the win. #BidenHarris2020
All of the women on Biden’s potential V-P candidate list have outstanding credentials. All of them are a major improvement over what’s been going on with the executive branch since 1/20/2017.
That was a great get-together.  Biden and Harris are definitely on their A game.
Our power is out so I couldn’t watch the rollout but it sounds like Biden’s speech went well.
No crowd, plenty of history as Biden introduces Harris  (from
I agree with most of what you said. But, dems made her ethnicity and gender an issue when Biden said he would pick a black female.  They grandstanded on the importance diversity and promised to represent black Americans.  That goes out the window when they pick an Indian/Jamacan

Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
I just said she's not "helping with the progressives" - because most of the progressives I know (Warren supporters) are not thrilled. But they also were (for the most part) determined beforehand to vote for Biden regardless of who he picked. I can't speak for Bernie fans.
I like the Kamala Harris choice because I feel like if Biden fucks up and does something creepy she'll throw his ass in a retirement home and get the job done herself.
Okay, I fucking hate Biden and Harris but you know that's the pair I'm voting for. I'm sad too but can you stand another 4 years of whatever the fuck THIS was?
Far from my first choice for the ticket but this video has me hyped to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
as someone that has not been hyped to vote for Biden this announcement and video has gotten me hyped
If biden were to adopt these 2 bills as planks in his platform it would garauntee him the election
That right there, tells you everything you need to know about   party. Not being sarcastic, just literal. Oh, &amp; shut up about joe, of course we're voting for Biden. Quit being dicks about it, you're scaring potential votes away. Honey not vinegar.
Also pretty surprised at Gov. Kelly's approval compared to Biden.
Biden being perceived as moderate gives cover for his campaign to move left. In the way that some said only Nixon could go to China, Biden may have room to welcome in the more progressive wing as he keeps the party together.
The annual event will be adapted to meet social distancing guidelines, and masks are required to move outside vehicles.
"Biden’s biggest advantage over Trump is the perception that he can bring people together. I suspect the Harris nomination is designed to help him make that case more strongly," writes
Dude, I wish Biden/Harris were as radical left as they’re being made out to be in these ads. Direct action in the streets is still our best option for progress &amp; change in this country. Keep electing true leftists into office, &amp; continue the fight regardless. The people will win.
Biden wasn't even in my top ten Democratic candidates. I'm not saying he's a great or even a good candidate. It's a binary choice now and for me the choice is easy. You may prefer to indulge a sense of moral superiority. Remember RBG will not make it through another four years.
It's not an excuse to point out that Bernie was wrong to it vote for it (especially because he said at the time he disagreed with the vast majority of the provisions of the bill) but Joe Biden is more wrong for writing, championing, and bragging out the bill.
If you can't see why Biden is the lesser evil then I can't help you. Enjoy your feeling of superiority when Republicans keep packing the courts.
I'm saying "it's ok" in the sense that many many many many many Bernie fans make excuses for that vote. Yet for some reason it's a deal breaker and they are too morally pure now to support Biden against fascism.
Republicans want to help a black guy who has admitted he wants to hurt Biden. Keep up.
It's not okay! He has faced a lot of criticism for his vote and he has always acknowledge that it was a flawed vote for a deeply troubling piece of legislation that Joe Biden *wrote*! No one gave him a pass for it!
I'm voting for Joe Biden because I have to but I'm Voting for Kamala Harris because I want to
It's a bait and switch. Biden will step down sometime in his first term, and Harris checks the right identity boxes to carry the left's agenda forward as president.
You got us fucked up if you do... he admitted he was running to divide Biden votes giving his best friend TRUMP votes... smh you feeding into his delusion and gonna fuck us over more than we are rn
This article helped me understand some of the issues people are having with Kamala re transgender rights.
I’m so pumped for Biden/Harris!!! Most progressive ticket ever! #VoteBidenHarris2020
Lol the Dems really think we’re all going to get cozy with them &amp; be complacent if Biden/Harris wins in November. A rude awakening is heading their way; these protests won’t stop, the movement won’t slow. We’ll just fight that much harder for progress. We gotta put the foot down.
I literally LOL when people assume that liberals think Biden will be a good president. We know he’s shit, love. Literally nobody has any genuine support for him. We think the whole system is trash. Find a different argument.
I understand what you’re saying - but if elected she’ll be in position in 2024 to be at the top of the ticket. Personally I don’t see Biden running for a second term.
“When I vote for Biden and Harris, I’m voting for my family to securely continue our long lineage as family farmers. Biden and Harris have a vision for rural America that I’m proud to embrace.”
We don’t know. We have to wait until November 3rd to find out. I think Trump could win another term and I also think Biden could beat him. We won’t know for certain until it happens.I'm taking bets, debates don't happen!
Postal workers' union endorses Biden, calling him a "defender of the U.S. Postal Service"
The more pressure we can put on him, and make him understand the consequences of what’s he’s doing, the better. He should know that a Biden admin will prosecute him. He should be famous. He should have the full wratch of democracy at his doorstep. I think we are getting there
Rejecting Biden's Threat of a Nationwide Mask Mandate, Trump Suddenly Respects Limits on Presidential Power  #SmartNews
Biden's campaign is actually worse because his only argument is "I'm not Trump" and that's not even true. Trump and Biden are both racist Republican sexual predators, there's no difference between the two.
Joe's exactly like you, what do you expect? Both Hillary and Biden are deeply unpopular among their own voters, so that's not really different
Have to also credit the Biden people for obfuscating the search just enough to make Harris seem like a surprise pick as well.
There's no path to victory for Biden. Even without GOP shenanigans, he'd still lose. Hell, Biden couldn't win the nomination without DNC shenanigans. The progressive votes Biden needs to win are gone to Howie Hawkins (I know, I'm one of many)
What did your model show for 2016? Did you have Trump beating Clinton? If you did, which I’m sure you didn’t, I’ll believe Biden wins
I think women in this country, no matter their political affiliation, should be pleased with Harris being selected as Biden's running mate. It is cool that an articulate and smart woman has worked hard to place herself in such a position. Awesome.
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris

It’s the truth...he has. What Kamala &amp; Biden done for black folks besides besides mass incarcerations?
No. The problem is not the USPS and its problems. The problem is TIMING. Trump isn’t talking about USPS problems; he’s talking about restricting voting. Let Biden fix the USPS.

Shame on all of them for using Kanye, knowing he is not mentally healthy at this time.    And how racist the Trump campaign is to assume that Kanye will pull black voters away from Biden?!

I am so sick of the lying deceitful mean spirited unprofessional press. I can't stand watching it. Shame Shame Shame. Let's see when someone piles on Biden how you all react. Disgraceful
I don’t care about the color of her skin or her family’s. I care about her qualifications and she is severely unqualified to be president. If elected I see Biden quitting do to health reasons.This all a sham to have our 1st female president be a woman of color.
Biden/Harris (resisted the urge to say HOJO, cause I used to live close to a Howard Johnsons) should concede now. Only way for the ticket to win is massive mail-in ballot cheating/harvesting. Need to see RECORD voting for  in Nov!
Oh sweet. I wasn’t planning to vote Biden but if it’s actually a vote to destroy America that’s very compelling. You have given me a lot to think about here.

Mr.President. So I watched,Joe Biden's  announcement to K Harris. He had his phone upside down. My biggest fear, is that if Joe Biden wins he won't make it four years and them Kamala Harris is President. I think it's going to be another Reagan Landslide for you!  Good Luck! Sir..
Biden resigns with dementia. Harris appoints Hillary VP. Harris commits “suicide”. Hillary is President. 😳
Kamala bedded down with influencial politicians and cheated on her husband to get ahead!! She is perfect for a slime ball like Biden!!

Where is the science that wearing a mask, outside , in the fresh air, walking or otherwise saves lives?  There is non because it doesnt.  Biden is a moron who read this , barely, off a piece of paper he was given by his handlers. So feable he has no original thoughts.
I hope I can go canvassing for Biden soon. I want to do something soon for them this is a team we can me proud of #BidenHarris2020

Dems want mail in votes bc they can rig a piece of paper but they can’t rig a debate where Biden would get absolutely shit on

Dems want to avoid debates bc they know Biden has no shot against Trump. Biden couldn’t answer a question w/o it on paper or someone else answering it for him
Y’all don’t have to like trump, you just have to know what’s best for America...and that’s definitely not Biden

Biden has a 25 point lead in New York according to the latest polls. This is Trump just saying shit. Because in fact, he's terrified and wants to pretend he's confident. Unfortunately.
Let's see, obama wins Nobel prize for peace when he was elected, didn't do anything. Trump gets a major peace deal done and biden wants credit for it, now he wants to mandate what we do, and he's not elected. Stupid biden

America This Week: United We Stand takes a look at Joe Biden's VP announcement and President Trump's reaction.
I expect him to get some largely ceremonial Cabinet post in a Biden administration.
This public speaker starts his talk on a treadmill on stage. It’s an effective and unexpected opener. I’d pay to see Biden use one at a debate and crush Trump.
If someone can convince me Biden &amp; Harris's policies and actions throughout the years, haven't had a worse effect on black men compared to Trump's admin than I might vote for them. If not then MAGA all the way.
Kamala has done more public speaking in 2 days than Biden in 2 months. Why?  #BidenHarris2020
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

Joe Biden says no one should go outside without a mask for the next three months.  If you water your lawn you better have a mask.  Wow.  What a cutting edge idea.  I’m gonna vote for Joe.  He is sooooo smart.
At 19 weeks, 6 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes, it’s not a human being but at 20 weeks it is? Regardless of that illogical train of thought, dismemberment abortion rips apart a child limb by limb. You are okay with that? Joe Biden’s Democrat Party I guess!
And please explain me what ”science” is mandating mask wearing outside! 🤣🤣 Must be the Democrat 5600 genders science. BTW .. Did Joe Biden stop being a racist and a grabber to Kamala as soon as she got picked for VP? Miracle!
Joe Biden’s Democrat Party — they think ripping a human being apart limb by limb is a human right.
Possibly the best reason to vote for a Biden/Harris ticket
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Did you really think they answer any unscripted questions. Biden will only do a debate if moderators only ask him questions that his handlers provide. It’s amazing the protections being provided by the left wing media mob. Biden sold his office, and will sell out America #sad

Why no news coverage and panic when the swine flu hit in 2008? Because the dems were in power. They will wreck the country to get trump out of office. If biden is elected, the virus will be forgotten. The deep state is real folks.
I understand not wanting to vote for Biden but last election showed not voting had a lot to do with Trump winning too. If Biden is willing to have someone as his right hand who is more for the people, I think he’ll be influenced to do more good AND if his health declines she will

Hey  even ACLU of Nebraska says "one-size-fits-all laws have no place in healthcare." Yet your plan would strip 180 MILLION Americans of their private healthcare and force them onto a one-size-fits-all plan that even Joe Biden said would bankrupt the country.
In her first remarks as Biden's running mate on Wednesday, she spoke of her mother's Indian roots but described herself as the "first Black woman" to be nominated for the vice presidency on a major party ticket.
But don't just get carries away with the Trump-Biden battle. Senate races are just as important.
Part of a Biden win would mean that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party would have an up tick in influence. The question is how much. Probably not a lot, but more than now. Obviously. This is not a radical liberal ticket.
I think a Biden-Harris ticket has great potential. If voted into office, I will watch how they address funding for the military-intelligence establishment, tax cuts going to corporate America and the 5%, the ongoing saga of Palestine, and Social Security and Medicare funding.
What will brain dead Biden and pelosi have to say ???50 yrs in office and the dumb asses could not do this!!
Even funnier...Biden pronounced it the same way as Tucker did during their joint appearance
Biden will never know the difference.
Donald Trump’s daily briefing on Coronavirus never mentions any of the basic facts such as numbers infected and more tragic numbers of people dead of Coronavirus. President Trump  is now focused Kamala Harris and accusing Biden of attacking God.
Listening to Biden and Harris talk yesterday I felt instantly better. Then I listen to the orange baffoon talk I had nothing but pure rage running through my veins.

Wrong and wrong again, Trump’s deregulation is the only thing that saved our economy.  Ask yourself why in 8 yrs Obama and Biden could’nt accomplish what Trump did in 6 months?  I’ll wait...

The October Surprise will be some new language around the same old “Obama / Biden spied on Trump Campaign” narrative. The difference this time will be timing and it will be cloaked in absolutes from Barr.

The reason why Democrats push so hard to make it easier for voter fraud is on a straight up and up election, they will always lose. You have an open racist such as Biden, and you have a descendant of slave owners as his VP.   A time where people demand reparations from Democrats?
It was the Obama administration that caused all the issues we have now. The Democrats now stand behind open racist such as Biden, and a woman whose family were slave owners, Just more of the pro racism shown by Democrats.
Innocent thought my ass. You know as well as the rest of the United States that Biden would embarrass himself in a debate against Trump. I say skip the VP debates and have four presidential debates.

The only reason this election will be close is Covid. Otherwise Trump trounces this weak candidate. Kind of surprising, the only thing that could have given Biden a fighting chance is a  pandemic originating in China 🤔

Oh, by the way! 46 days ago, Kamala nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies — noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden’s racist actions were thrown out the window...
Biden and Harris spoke Wednesday at a high school in his Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
Makes us wonder how many of these Biden/Harris bashing accounts are fake
If you vote for Joe Biden your Voting for Communism In America , Which is very Disrespecful to our Vets ,  can back this up and   am I right #Trump2020
How many of those has Joe Biden “sniffed”? Of those, how many did you SAY you believed and then discarded when they had no further political value for you?  Asking for a Nation...
It is true tho. Biden and Harris both 🚮 but ima vote for em as well. #lrt
Martha &amp; Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party but it’s just creepy Biden feeding Kamala roofies and unwanted butt pats.
The Joe Biden campaign said it more than doubled its previous one-day fundraising record after announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate.
He better hope he doesn’t get elected - if he does he won’t last a month. Actually, after Trump is elected, Biden will immediately disappear.  They will find him in a nursing home somewhere.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Amen! Go team Biden/Harris! I am so excited, I am counting the days.
YOU are lower than whale poop on the bottom of the ocean floor. YOU are trying to make that postal service less efficient with the hope of the many votes for Biden/Harris don't get counted. YOU and Pence have your hands full w/ Harris. She will eat you guys up!!!
Tronsot should run the Biden campaign
Biden wins by doing absolutely nothing!
I hate Trump so much but Biden is such an easy victim
I've seen 2 Trump signs. That's it.  One was on a farm fence. The other was a Trump flag across someone's front door. But, I've seen a lot of Biden signs.
This. Is. Brutal.
I had such hope for Beau Biden being President in about 2032. Damn. SUCH a loss to all of us!
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Biden goes to church on Sundays &amp; prays, Trump golfs! Then there was this too...when asked if that was his Bible he was holding he just replied "it's a Bible"
If you aren’t excited about the Biden/Harris ticket, then just understand that trump MUST lose!
I enjoy watching the right pretend Trump is not President. How about this? You were given 4 yrs to show you could handle important business and you messed up-AGAIN. You offer nothing but excuses. Biden-Harris in 2020.
Some of y’all really see people criticizing Biden/Harris and the first thing that comes to your mind is “so you’re telling us to vote for Trump”..............
1) Biden/Harris announcement  2) Scotland train derailment 3) 1100 new cases of COVID-19 in NC 4) return to learn impacts.   That’s just the A-Block
So if Biden says I am against abortion, but I am not for forcing my belief on this subject to others (pro choice) is he excommunicated?  Or is ok for all religions to mandate and force their beliefs on others?
She's not my favorite choice and neither was Biden. But everytime the president doesn't like a woman Rep or Dem he calls her nasty. Its obvious :Nasty"means bitch. If she was a man we wouldnt be having this conversation. This isn't presidential.
-AOC given 60 seconds to speak -Andrew Yang not given speaking spot -denied Young Turks press pass -Kasich has speaking spot -Harris/Biden ticket
I’ve seen a couple castrate/kill pedophiles posts circulating here and on Facebook in the past week and I’m sorta wondering where that came from. I feel like it’s a 2 part interactive social campaign and the next part is evidence that Trump or Biden are pedos.
Hillary Clinton or her good family friend and donor Donald Trump were not acceptable options in 2016 and voted 3rd Party.  Seeing what Trump has done the last four years it’s apparent he is not a choice this time around either. I’m voting Biden/Harris in November. #LincolnVoter
That’s a good thing, isn’t it?  “Tucker Carlson warned his viewers last night that if Biden is elected, everything Trump has done to this country will be reversed! 🤷🏻‍♂️”
running Biden and Harris because Sanders or hell even Warren are too "extreme" meanwhile media has already painted both Biden and Harris as revolutionary Marxists
I heard Beau Biden speak in an Iowa backyard over 10 years ago introduced by  and I thought he would run for president one day. After today's speech by  he is on the ballot in a sense. Photo for  in 2019.
You would think all Biden/Harris would need to do would be to just give speeches that are inspirational and coherent a few times a week with decent coverage and that should nail the win. #BidenHarris2020
All of the women on Biden’s potential V-P candidate list have outstanding credentials. All of them are a major improvement over what’s been going on with the executive branch since 1/20/2017.
That was a great get-together.  Biden and Harris are definitely on their A game.
Our power is out so I couldn’t watch the rollout but it sounds like Biden’s speech went well.
No crowd, plenty of history as Biden introduces Harris  (from
I agree with most of what you said. But, dems made her ethnicity and gender an issue when Biden said he would pick a black female.  They grandstanded on the importance diversity and promised to represent black Americans.  That goes out the window when they pick an Indian/Jamacan
“Whining is what Trump does best”~Joe Biden                                      #TrumpWhining
Am I happy that the dem ticket is Biden/Harris? Absolutely not. Will I still vote for them? Looks like I don’t have a choice. I’m voting for them but don’t expect me to slap a sexual predator/cop bumper sticker on my car lmao VoTe BlUe No MaTtEr WhO 🙃
This is Joe Biden's party now. No one should be surprised.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
I trust the Biden/Harris Ticket. I am voting a straight Democratic We need it.🗽🦅🇺🇸🙋
I just said she's not "helping with the progressives" - because most of the progressives I know (Warren supporters) are not thrilled. But they also were (for the most part) determined beforehand to vote for Biden regardless of who he picked. I can't speak for Bernie fans.
I like the Kamala Harris choice because I feel like if Biden fucks up and does something creepy she'll throw his ass in a retirement home and get the job done herself.
Okay, I fucking hate Biden and Harris but you know that's the pair I'm voting for. I'm sad too but can you stand another 4 years of whatever the fuck THIS was?
Far from my first choice for the ticket but this video has me hyped to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
as someone that has not been hyped to vote for Biden this announcement and video has gotten me hyped
If biden were to adopt these 2 bills as planks in his platform it would garauntee him the election
That right there, tells you everything you need to know about   party. Not being sarcastic, just literal. Oh, &amp; shut up about joe, of course we're voting for Biden. Quit being dicks about it, you're scaring potential votes away. Honey not vinegar.
Also pretty surprised at Gov. Kelly's approval compared to Biden.
Biden being perceived as moderate gives cover for his campaign to move left. In the way that some said only Nixon could go to China, Biden may have room to welcome in the more progressive wing as he keeps the party together.
The annual event will be adapted to meet social distancing guidelines, and masks are required to move outside vehicles.
"Biden’s biggest advantage over Trump is the perception that he can bring people together. I suspect the Harris nomination is designed to help him make that case more strongly," writes
Dude, I wish Biden/Harris were as radical left as they’re being made out to be in these ads. Direct action in the streets is still our best option for progress &amp; change in this country. Keep electing true leftists into office, &amp; continue the fight regardless. The people will win.
Biden wasn't even in my top ten Democratic candidates. I'm not saying he's a great or even a good candidate. It's a binary choice now and for me the choice is easy. You may prefer to indulge a sense of moral superiority. Remember RBG will not make it through another four years.
It's not an excuse to point out that Bernie was wrong to it vote for it (especially because he said at the time he disagreed with the vast majority of the provisions of the bill) but Joe Biden is more wrong for writing, championing, and bragging out the bill.
If you can't see why Biden is the lesser evil then I can't help you. Enjoy your feeling of superiority when Republicans keep packing the courts.
I'm saying "it's ok" in the sense that many many many many many Bernie fans make excuses for that vote. Yet for some reason it's a deal breaker and they are too morally pure now to support Biden against fascism.
Republicans want to help a black guy who has admitted he wants to hurt Biden. Keep up.
It's not okay! He has faced a lot of criticism for his vote and he has always acknowledge that it was a flawed vote for a deeply troubling piece of legislation that Joe Biden *wrote*! No one gave him a pass for it!
I'm voting for Joe Biden because I have to but I'm Voting for Kamala Harris because I want to
It's a bait and switch. Biden will step down sometime in his first term, and Harris checks the right identity boxes to carry the left's agenda forward as president.
He will get my vote given the alternative, but I just can’t get excited about Joe Biden being the democratic nominee... I would love to hear honest opinions from legit Biden supporters on why he’s their guy?
You got us fucked up if you do... he admitted he was running to divide Biden votes giving his best friend TRUMP votes... smh you feeding into his delusion and gonna fuck us over more than we are rn
This article helped me understand some of the issues people are having with Kamala re transgender rights.
Democratic Debate: Kamala Harris Blasts Joe Biden Over Busing Stance | N...  via
I’m so pumped for Biden/Harris!!! Most progressive ticket ever! #VoteBidenHarris2020
Lol the Dems really think we’re all going to get cozy with them &amp; be complacent if Biden/Harris wins in November. A rude awakening is heading their way; these protests won’t stop, the movement won’t slow. We’ll just fight that much harder for progress. We gotta put the foot down.
I literally LOL when people assume that liberals think Biden will be a good president. We know he’s shit, love. Literally nobody has any genuine support for him. We think the whole system is trash. Find a different argument.
I understand what you’re saying - but if elected she’ll be in position in 2024 to be at the top of the ticket. Personally I don’t see Biden running for a second term.
“When I vote for Biden and Harris, I’m voting for my family to securely continue our long lineage as family farmers. Biden and Harris have a vision for rural America that I’m proud to embrace.”
We don’t know. We have to wait until November 3rd to find out. I think Trump could win another term and I also think Biden could beat him. We won’t know for certain until it happens.

Feel like I really missed out on the VP discourse because my fucking power has been out for 2 days now but I just wanted to say fuck kamala harris fuck joe biden fuck and fuck the democratic party that’s making me vote for them
No matter how much you Bernie Bros may not like Kamala Harris because she can't pass your precious purity tests you have to concede at least one point: Joe Biden is much worse.
Yesterday, Democratic nominee Joe Biden chose Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP for the November ticket. Find her bio, voting records, positions, ratings &amp; endorsements, statements &amp; funding HERE:  #KamalaHarris
My number 1 hope for a Joe Biden administration is cross-country high-speed electric trains. Let's make this happen. #zeroemissions #noplanes #seethecountry
Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden’s Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
The problem with electoral forecasts is that it can't take into account late-breaking events such as Clyburn endorsing Biden. You always need to bake in some uncertainty for those situations.
I really like Joe Biden's choice for a running mate!
Hi Gabrielle, hope all is well ma’am.  Saw the discussion on SWs reacting to Harris as VP for Biden. There won’t be a sweeping roundup of SWs, the issues we are facing right now are far more pressing. Besides, Trump has done far more damage.
I stand behind my assessment that Joe Biden will not be on the final ticket in November - and that Hillary is out there waiting in the wings #Election2020
Joe Biden being “Joe Cool” 😎
Shout out to  who on Monday morning submitted a post on how VP picks affect presidential races. I was copy editing when the derecho hit and we lost power. Dan revised the text to take into account Biden's pick, &amp; I'll publish in a few (from outside a coffee shop).
I posted an 18 minute video of Biden’s gaffes
Biden can’t go 2 minutes without being racist or coherent
I did answer. He makes an occasional gaffe but he isn’t completely demented like Biden. He can speak on stage for 2 plus hours. Biden can’t go 2 minutes
Might be meh about Harris; still going to vote for Biden. Also: I’m not suddenly wearing a MAGA hat because I’m not ecstatic about our Democratic candidates.  Absolutism is the language of the party we’re trying to beat, and it’s disgusting when I see it in our own.
Yeah I don’t see anyone switching from Biden to Trump. But I can see people who were going to vote for Biden no longer vote at all bc of Harris. I hope not tho
I don’t think it’s so horrible, but I do believe enough of these tweets gon lead to mfs not voting at all. Bc not everyone can think for themselves. I have seen people already saying they not voting at all(and they HATE trump) so in some cases, it can work against Biden/Harris
I’d prefer to judge her on what she can bring to the table as VP instead of racial background.  Considering that is competence and intelligence, it just further cements I’m voting for Biden and her.
and a majority of Americans know Joe Biden is who we need as President to repair the damage of the last 4 years
Whataboutist much? Fuck Biden
Hell no I want to see Joe Biden DEBATE TRUMP
Watching this put into words why I was so emotional when Biden announced his VP pick. My eldest son couldn't contain his joy &amp; I fought back tears becuz I am a strong woman in a male dominated field &amp; had been thrown under the bus at work and was needing a reminder of my strengthDo you want a president who spends his time tweeting or golfing or holding press conferences which actually are a campaign rally...or would you like a president who is empathetic, engaged in the good of the country and focused...vote Biden. You may just need some help..
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake

#Covid19 wearing a mask is not about Politics. It's not Trump v Biden or whether you like the British Conservative party or not. IT IS A HUMAN HEALTH CRISIS. Human health comes first. Lockdowns and masks are not conspiracy theories. It is critical to Human Health around the world
I’m not telling you to vote for Biden I don’t think I mentioned Biden I’m telling you to vote period Vote when the choices aren’t Biden vs trump  vote for cori bush vote for Bernie vote for AOC but vote and out vote the old people and you might actually see some change
If young people actually voted Bernie would have won in 2016 and we would have Medicare for ALL and free college and this pandemic wouldn’t be kick this country’s butt like it is right now so if you didnt want Biden or Hillary the time to vote was January
That makes no sense.   If you would rather have a racist, misogynistic, inept criminal who is murdering 1,000 Americans every day with his incompetence in the White House than Biden and Harris, then I feel very sad for you and for our country.

Kamala Harris receives strong marks as Joe Biden's VP: POLL - ABC News
I agree  : “He’s so full of it y’all” Drumpf said he heard KH doesn't meet requirements referring to lawyer who raised issue in Newsweek ChapmanU professor John Eastman as "very highly qualified” then said he has "no idea" whether it's true🤬
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don’t miss it.  #DemConvention
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Dear Sir, I'm a democrat n wanted to  mail in my vote for Biden/Harris, but will go vote at the polls since you've rigged the post office system.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
The status of race for the White House based on polls. Biden leads by about 12 points on average:
Ernst digs in with her party. Says her opponent Theresa Greenfield is full of "cheap talk" "Hidin with Biden" is Ernst's catchphrase for Greencield. Slams former Pres. Obama saying he was bad for IA farmers.
when Obama...O I mean Biden squints his eyes raises his chin and gives his best presidential gaze of fortitude just doesn’t drive the momentum that Trump gets with some off the wall bizarre rant Obama...oops I mean Biden has noooo energy
She already sold out, but they still consider her a risk because she isn't far right like hillary or joe biden.
The Chair of Iowa Republicans is the first one to bring up Biden/Harris, calling them a “dangerous duo.” #Decision2020 #iapolitics
That's your takeaway? Did you even hear the very real audio of Biden?
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
presidential elections are always about a symbol a statement momentum Biden literally represents someone else’s symbol someone else’s vision and it’s a black guy how ironic a white guy taking credit for a black man’s accomplishments Biden is a fraud
Whatever “racial gaffe” Biden made pales in comparison to  decision to attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa with no mask and no social distancing
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
So Biden just gave the presidency away. Calling it now he wins the the popular vote in a landslide. IF he wins its gonna be close. But the man did say all black people think the same......  Or are we gonna ignore that?
Joe Biden or Donald Trump vs "Titan" or "Gemini" would liven things up this coming political season to be sure
Of course they will. Joe Biden would force them all off their land
As a born and raised Buckeye, the smartest thing that Democrats can do is to nonstop connect Trump’s handling of the Coronavirus to the loss of OSU football. That will guarantee a win for the Biden Harris ticket.
He goes even lower by accusing her of ignoring the debunked false charges against Biden. (The fact he would go THERE blows my mind!)
The Oval Office occupier accused  of treating  badly during the contest for the Nomination. He claims she "mocked" VP Biden. He is trying to tear her down by throwing around accusations about what her policies will be.
The fact they keep saying we can push Biden/Harris farther left afterwards is absolutely childlike naivety, and really quite insulting, as if the Democratic Party hasn't been telling progressives to fuck off for 4 years.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I completely agree with you Sam. The only rational thing to do is vote for Biden. That being said I think there are a good amount of actual criticisms one can make against Biden and Kamala, but I’m still voting for them.
What? You chose Biden, that has to tell you how insane this statement is.
The way you phrased it seemed like you were you blaming people who aren’t involved in politics for the ticket. Any democrat with half a brain is going to vote for Biden. I assumed you were talking about people not being actively involved and not just like people tweeting lol

After the "If you don't vote for me, you ain't black!" comment, Joe Biden goes full "I'm not racist, I have a Black Friend!" for his VP pick.  Raise your hand if you saw this coming... 😒
Yea, drain the swamp. Vote Biden.
I am beyond grateful to the  campaign for affording me the privilege of working, and representing this campaign during the Iowa Caucus. My role going forward may not be needed as much as before, but one thing that’s for certain is Biden/Harris has my vote &amp; full support.
Very confused. I thought there was nothing wrong with Joe Biden 😂😂😂
'Well now I'm definitely not voting for Biden" says person who wasn't going to vote for Biden regardless.
Biden has broken Cinnamon Bun. Fucking Biden...
Congratulations, Biden. You've made Cinnamon Bun angry and swear on the timeline, you asshole.
One: Being better than the nazi candidates is a VERY low bar to meet  Two: There were far more options than just senators.   Biden's biggest weakness is his stance on progressive issues, and he picked the least progressive running mate of the ones being vetted

Woohoo!!!! Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
Joe Biden about to pick who will be president if he's elected.  Stay tuned...
Karen Bass was contacted by Biden to let her know that she was NOT selected.   I'm guessing an announcement will come at the 5pm EST news cycle for max exposure.  #JoeBiden
Reporters were stationed outside Biden's house (and I think Bayh's house) and there were minute by minute updates on what they were doing in their personal lives.
I am amazed at the response of voters in my state of Iowa. Every week I pass by a house of a person who has always been a staunch Republican. Their yards are always plastered with R. Yard signs. Yesterday I drove by, and saw a United for Biden sign. ❤️ America is ready for change
I think, should VP Biden win, that he will have a cabinet opportunity
Russia is trying to denigrate Joe Biden?  No, Joe Biden is denigrating Joe Biden.
I do not need to know who his pick is and I don't care.  I'm voting Biden no matter what. ❤️

All this because I suggested multiple Biden race related gaffes points to something deeper.
In my personal conversations with the VP during the Iowa Caucus journey I can say  has a genuine &amp; enthusiastic heart for the AA Community. The many AA staffers on his campaign proves that. Don’t believe the hype. My people are riding with Biden.
Just a reminder   That you cosigned a letter with then VP Joe Biden to fight corruption in Ukraine. #RussianAsset Stop this madness and follow your oath to the country
Its a long way till Biden takes over and he will say and do anything to hang on to the presidency
We will have to push Biden to act on Climate Change immediately. #ClimateChange  #ClimateAction
When Trump says Biden is against God, it reminds me how Trump's daily behavior defies every teaching of Jesus Christ. He is the living embodiment of unrepentant sin that uses the Bible as a prop.   Trump is a desperate person, aside from a 'presidential' candidate.
What would happen if they banned an anti-Biden ad people would cry foul
Yeah. Take away the left part of the “center” button and that’s a lot closer to actual Biden
I’d actually consider voting for a democrat not named joe Biden, I’m legitametly concerned about how he can’t say a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about
The people that don’t want the debate know that Trump will make more of a clown out of Biden.  If you can’t see that then you’re a clown ur self.
Joe Biden is the next Marvel Comics super hero.
I need to be clear on the fact that nothing will have me vote for trump. If Biden come out and say “NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA” I just won’t vote at all.

Lol who said Biden chose Obama?  Like Kamala, Biden undergo thorough background check  to prove he’s worthy to be VP.  The president chose his running mate not the other way around.

I’m gonna cum big league when daddy Biden wins
Praise Joe Biden and the Democratic Party establishment
Your President is endorsed by KKK.  When he close the borders it was too late, it’s already pandemic. It’s already in the country .  Biden,  racist,  serve as the VP of the first black president . How can the Obama staff overlooked that one  detail.
I took exception with something posted by a FB friend recently and was piled on by him and another person that I am part of the sheep that follow the communist liberals basically and how Biden will destroy America. No chance of talking reality or logic with some of them.
Just watch the debates.  Anyone who says Biden is in cognitive decline must have skipped the debates this spring.
Tucker Carlson endorses Joe Biden!

This is your choice Trump or Biden ? The change comes from all of us . Vote the responsible people in the congress.
Joe Biden is a radical leftist? And yet he’s opposed to Medicare for All?  Show your work and back up your argument because it’s doesn’t stand on its own.
Obama/Biden?
Same boat, but in reverse.  I think my initial excitement/relief was that at least Biden didn't pick Rice.   Now I'm thinking about her record.   The ticket isn't the one I would have preferred and pragmatism isn't much of a balm.
What's shameful is someone who literally lived in an american concentration camp fighting tooth and nail to protect a system that regularly murders minorities and extorts the poor for basic healthcare. Biden would gladly put you in a private prison if you sneezed on a cop.
Too bad Biden just nominated one to be VP 🤷

Happy to hear Biden went with Harris. She was one of my favorites during the primaries and the dynamic is an interesting echo of that between Obama and Biden insofar that she was a tough critic.
Is the next Biden commercial going to be like "We could have had college football if Biden was President, but Trump treated it like a hoax"
No  Just like that. I brought up an ignorant/ridiculous TDS statement you made. You respond with a weird deflection to Biden and a stupid meme. Do you even have original thoughts?
Loving Jill Biden. Can the First Lady be secretary of education?
Sleepy Biden’s America
Fun fact: today is a great day to order a Joe Biden yard sign.
Damn Joe Biden, you’ll be the next president . Wear the freaking helmet.
Yeah, not our best running against each other. Hopefully this is the last election where Boomers have a large say in. See  Trump's interview on Axios? I'll still take Biden this time around. Then Mark Cuban in '24!
The absolute hilarity of #DonTheCon questioning anyone's faith is mind-boggling. This guy has to worry about bursting into flameif he goes near a church but Biden is going to destroy Christianity. But then people who think  somehow Trump is religious are the ones who will do that
Oh, from what little interaction I have to go on, Fives is certainly a douchebag. However the other post quoting biden by the other user is correct. Not to mention that literally yesterday he called the "African-American community" largely "less diverse" than the "Latino" one.
WHAT?SAME OLD SHIT &amp; I SAW HBO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE DC SWAMP IS &amp; BIDEN TOTALLY UNDERSTANDS WHO/WHAT GOD IS-YOU HOWEVER ARE THE ANTI CHRIST🤬YOU ARE KING SATAN🤬GOD IS WATCHING YOU/&amp; YOUR REPUBLICANS/YOU ALL ARE GOING TO HELL-that’s a given/FOR THE HARM ALL OF YOU HAVE CAUSED!
Trump has gone full Cam Brady with his recent claims of Biden being against god.Ya, also on  today  and  also criticized Biden for suggesting the mask wearing. Thanks for acknowledging what Fauci said in this tweet.
Do I need to remind you that Obama/Biden stayed silent as private military contractors were infiltrating Standing Rock? Did Ferguson happen under Trump? The ruling class always uses violence against the masses—Democrats and Republicans. SMDH.
This one poll revealed what’s next for America now that Joe Biden has announced his running mate
Biden on grooming??
Honestly who is voting for Biden 😂😂😂
You &amp; Biden spied on the Trump campaign before he was elected &amp; after he was elected. That's Treason.   if you had a choice on how you die,  which would you prefer? Lethal injection? Or one of the 30,000 gulitines you ordered when President? Tic Toc.
That seems like a stretch. We can find plenty of ppl in the world far more evil than trump.   Either way, Biden could be considered “evil”. His own VP said she believes his rape accusers and she also called him racist. His VP believes he’s a rapist and racist. That’s pretty evil.
This morning I seen  have a video of her tearing up over Biden picking Kamala Harris. I heard other people tearing up. When Kamala gave that speech with Biden Wednesday night I almost had tears in my eyes. That was awesome speech.
I knew when Biden mispronounced Kamala Harris’s first name I was wondering who was going to mention it. Katie doesn’t disappoint.
I know you do lol and that’s okay. Everyone can have their opinion and dialogue is so important. I question whether or not Biden could be any better, that’s all. I don’t want our generation to continue on with this “lesser of two evils” crap
That’s your opinion. Can you tell me how Joe Biden is going to make that any better? The man is an outspoken racist and is trying to cover that up to win the black vote.   And I’m not trying to encourage you to vote Trump lol. I’m just saying you don’t have to vote Biden
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
So then Pelosi becomes President if Biden is removed.
I've gotta' give Biden credit. He's really good at reading a teleprompter.
So when Biden says something that is unpleasant to her to the black community she mentions it. Trump made comments about African Countries S holes and when Trump made comments about Omarosa Harris said nothing. So, ya bias.

Choice between Biden and Trump. No choice is Biden. Even with the help of  Trump is a terrible President. When foreign leaders are seen laughing at our President, United States isn’t respected around the world.
Doesn’t think he is a racist, even  had to admit she didn’t call Biden a racist.
Quote of the night "Joe Biden was two insults away from needing to select Maxine Waters as his running mate"-  Larry Elder.
The question to answer for Biden’s selection of Harris is: does she move the needle enough to get Biden in? Obviously through and through Democrats will vote for them, but does it get moderates enough to get over the top?

Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Remember that time  could have literally picked any progressive woman and united the party but instead picked  who dropped out after attacking Biden, and realizing she only had the support of California?
She wasn’t my first choice, but Biden/Harris has my vote, hands down.

I genuinely believe that Biden wanted Leslie Knope to be V.P unaware she is a fictional character; that is the explanation of this delay.

Well you sure af won’t see Biden bashing from the likes of you. You can’t stop kissing ass enough. How do you explain all the incredulous cringing looks from you guys (CNN)  when Biden can’t complete a 4 word sentence? You should be ashamed that you DON’T discuss his dementia.

Joe Biden becomes totally incoherent during interview… spewing utter nonsense
This idiot from the Trump campaign had tweeted an article of a Trump supporter. He ripped on policies that said hurt American workers in the past that Biden voted for. Touting things that could improve with things Trump did. No improvements that Trump did.
Agree. But your former employer makes a big case of Biden gaffes and Biden’s mental health. When people talked about Trump’s mental health they would always say, well is that person a doctor? Did they examine Trump? But they make health analysis. Just hilarious I think.
Juliet it is interesting watching your old employer. Trump’s gaffes you see zero coverage. Biden’s gaffes and it’s on for a day or two. Thanks for posting it.
We are so screwed either way. Have you seen Biden’s latest interview? Asking a black reporter if he is on cocaine? And if he is a junkie? Then laughing maniacally? We have entered the Twilight Zone.

Between Joe Biden having to write his name on his hand so he doesn’t forget it and you spewing garbage like this, you don’t have a chance of November
I guess it doesn’t bother you that Joe Biden groped several women. Didn’t you say you believed all of them? You are a hypocrite in every sense of the word
Blow me biden
We must understand Nov is not a slam dunk. In my family there are six of us voting for Biden. There are 11 voting for Trump. We can’t afford to believe only what we see from Biden supporters. 3rd party vote results in 4 more Trump#TheLincolnProject
Been without power since storm hit on Monday. In that time #Biden chooses worst VP pick so bad it's like not even trying to win while #Trump made major progress towards middle East peace with treaty between UAE &amp; Israel. Where is #Trump's Nobel Peace Prize?
Land of the Free Home of the Brave.  Biden /Harris
can you even get over this?  disgusting.  start questioning biden you creeps.
You know this shit will not stop as long as  is in office! When will you endorse Joe Biden?
I will continue to resist a Biden admin and critique his decisions if elected. His positions have moved left due to Bernie and his movement, whereas Trump will never make the same concessions. I really don't want to martyr the country in the name of purity tests.
Undeniably true. The left has been far more effective working within the Democratic party. As someone who doesn't like Biden but will vote for him, this video resonates a lot with me.
Joe Biden is teaching Alex to blow up my car
And Biden is correct.
i sure hope the biden team saw this
If Biden wins and Dems get the senate GND has a chance. If that doesn’t happen it dies. Idk man, you all are staking yourselves on some moral superiority that I think is not worth or time or is fruitful.
And I’ll defend that statement. Hate the people, hate their politics, wish it would’ve been different, but here we are. There are serious material consequences to boycotting the vote and giving Trump a greater chance to win. At least Biden is malleable on climate change.
take a look at biden
get a load of this guy, calling the president "this freak".  let's apply his rules to biden and call it a day.
and this is more nonsene.  trump's hats are made in the USA. lots of knock-offs and they're clearly made in china.  also, glad biden ripped off trump's hat idea, shows he doesn't have an original thought.
You belong in the Democratic Party. It’s a big tent. Just because Biden and Harris aren’t extremely progressive doesn’t mean the Democratic Party as a whole will ignore you. Please vote.
Well that's why CNN and Lockhart said Biden shouldn't do the debates is because he lies too much   ...
Biden/Harris combo is an absolute joke.
Trump is nearly the same age and weighs at least 70 lbs more then Biden.
I’m half Hispanic. White passing sure, so I have to check my privelage a lot, but I would argue we need leftists need to check our privelage on this particular issue (voting for Biden/Harris if you live in a swing state).
Additionally if we want any of our policy ideas to make it in the next decade or so, we have to push Biden and the Dems. I don’t want to play their game either but it’s what has to be done.

The notion that Harris is radical in any important way is ridiculous. If Trump wants to win re-election, he should focus on the fact that his opponent and his running mate represent the status quo and elitism. Running on Kamala and Biden being radicals is so out of touch and dumb

Tbf, I think Biden would win the election if it were held today, and he is a favorable pick over Trump. I just don't think this locks the election down for him. The only argument I see for this is that Biden had to pick a big name because no one is excited to vote for him.

I know in my area of iowa the biden campaign isn't giving out the free signs until after the convention. Could be due to them wanting the signs having the VP on them maybe?

Riding a bike, while it seems simple, takes more motor skills than you would think. That he didn’t put on a helmet means he is also confident in that ability. Biden has a life long stutter. That’s it. Trump is simply just stupid.

We all don’t like Trump and we know Biden is racist. Consider Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian for president #LetHerSpeak #LetHerDebate
Most democrats will openly admit that getting Biden elected is just a facade to replace him with whoever “his” VP is. They just need Biden’s face to win election then he’ll either be incompetent or resign on his own accord. I can’t stand that... it’s wrong and manipulation. 😔

Biden is not conservative enough to be accepted into the current Republican Party which is very conservative right now.
Biden may be considered “conservative” but he is not a Republican. Conservative is a political bend, Republican is a political party. He is a moderate Democrat. He’s the nominee for the Democratic Party and he just isn’t on the progressive end.
Are you feeling the same about the Biden v. Trump commercials?  Or is it just the 'ladies' you dont like hearing from?  It's just the beginning of the political ad season so I suggest you get used to it, gentleman.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is radical. He was the farthest right candidate that the Democrats put forward this year. 10 years ago, based on current policy, you’d call him a Republican. Guess this is what happens when you have a politics that only moves farther to the right
I want to clarify, Joe Biden didn't write this tweet.
That's not true. Biden is a heathen, not catholic. Hes for abortion, same sex marriage and for antifa who are haters,destryoers,and murderers.
On the SEVENth of AUGUST Joe Biden will have an EPIPHANY and announce that Taylor Swift is his running mate come on you guys this is the final Easter egg
Can we acknowledge that the #veepstakes don't matter and move on please?
Imagine trying to vote for one of these people. I'm considering not voting. Trump and Biden are both terrible. Plus lets be honest, popular vote doesn't count anyway. Electoral college wins elections. We need to educate people on this.
Hey John if you continue to believe the Russian hoax, maybe you’ll also believe in the Easter bunny, Santa, Bigfoot and Joe Biden’s chances to win in November.
And then Biden will say that Trump will put Black people back into chains, like he said to the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
Exactly who could Biden pick that would force you to vote for Trump?

I’m sorry but the Democratic Party isn’t a person it’s just a faction of individuals with different interest and concerns and those base voters choose Joe Biden the problem is progressives have more disdain for the base than moderates which why they keep losing primaries
This is what happens when one lives in the extreme: the mean is seen as the opposite extreme. Something slightly more moderate than your extreme is seen as the mean. Thus, Biden is the exemplar for devout Catholicism.
Look at the Russian bots out here  talkin that joe Biden is racist  talk. Like black people don’t know a old white dude might have been racist (could still be) like that’s a surprise. All U gotta do is see, who is on who side, and that will tell you who is for U, and against U

No.  Its because Biden is stable.  tRump is unstable and somehow his negotiations with China always leaves his own company  without the tariffs he brags about.
GOOD: Biden showcases how wearing a mask doesn't stop you from doing recreational things such as riding a bike.  BAD: No helmet?  I'll admit, I never wore a helmet in my youth, but times  change.  And I guarantee when my wife sees this that'll be the first thing she notices.
Still 55 million less cases than H1N1 during Obama/Biden admin!

I don’t really agree that Biden is a bad candidate, relatively speaking. But assuming you’re right,  there’s nothing wrong with voting the lesser of two evils. Given the current state of affairs, we could do much worse than Biden.
No.  The Democrats built the economy.   Trump just rode what was in place, until he crashed it.  Now Biden will have to start over
I think this is the right way to go.  You can’t bully trump. He’s just gonna do whatever the fuck he wants. But we can bully Biden, break him down, and force him to adopt progressive policies. He’s already given a few conssesions. It’s obviously not ideal, but idk what else to do
IMO, There is only ONE who is BAD (Trump) and one who is GOOD (Biden) GO JOE GO!!! 😃👍🇺🇲🌎
It's literally what they do.  The norms of what are legit accusations to levy at your opponent are out the window with them.  I mean, Trump just accused Biden of trying to "hurt God" yesterday - and the ridiculousness of it aside, that's a really bad thing to say about any one
Your guns will be taken away immediately? By Joe Biden? Who is this raving lunatic? And let's hope the gullible rube in the White House doesn't watch his Fox show.
Don’t let 2020 be another Jill Stein moment. We must bring honor &amp; integrity back to this country. Vote for Biden no matter who!!!!
Yep. I'd like these people to tell me what, exactly, are Trump's policies? They seem to be 1) enrich myself, 2) racism, and 3) get re-elected. Biden may be seeking office when he should fricken and he clearly has racial bias he hasn't dealt with, but he's nothing like Trump.
I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks as a VP.
We've been told plenty of times to realize what Trump was trying to say as opposed to what he actually said. That being said, I claim the same rules for Biden.
so he was wrong you ever been wrong before these are just terrible examples especially when you put them up against Joe Biden who might literally have dementia
but again how does that relate to the KKK he is just increasing the livability in suburban areas which will raise property values and if we talking about black poverty pre corona I think Trump was beating Biden on that front
It literally says it in this the article you gave me
- Here is a clip of Biden saying the N-word multiple times just thought I would throw that in
- Ukraine phone call proving the quid pro quo   - Biden pushed it in the senate  - Biden on the crime bill actually kind of disturbing watch the whole thing  We all know he don't campaign
NAFTA and pro iraq war are documented  - Biden on Bird friendship  - Racial jungle and segregation   - Obama administration spying   - Isis and how Obama admin helped
How about Biden being pro Iraq war or pro-NAFTA or his best friend Robert KKKBird who also happened to be the person who filibustered the civil rights act in 1964 or maybe Joe Biden stating he doesn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle to why he likes segregation
I hope you ain't voting Biden atleast
Actually Trump has helped the black community significantly  pre-presidency and while president if you would like examples I would gladly tell you and Biden well he has done his best job to cripple the black community through his 50 years in politics
Biden didn’t write that! Catholics don’t believe in abortion!
It depends if they are black or white because a black antisemite would most likely be anti Biden and Kamala  a white antisemite is most likely a neo nazi version and they probably are pro trump
But I think those voters who are closeted antisemites are anti kamala and anti Biden they probably are going to vote with trump cause he is pretty  straightforward
Yes, by voting for Joe Biden on November 3rd
You are dead wrong.  That's what I have to say to you.  I have never, and WILL never, assert that any human being, much less any politician, is perfect.    Joe Biden is not.  But he's a good man-now supported by increasing numbers of conservatives &amp; GOP members who recognize it.
Biden said today that he would not stop a past president from being prosecuted. Today Trump said Joe Biden could hurt god.  Pretty good day for Biden.
Biden has bowed his head in prayer more times in the past couple of months than Trump has in his entire life.
Hell, if Biden’s that powerful, we better elect him or else. What’s he gonna do to God if he loses?!?!? 😮😱😳
If Biden had the power to ‘hurt God’ does anyone think trump would still be president?After Trump got elected in 2016, I knew everything would get worse. It certainly has. I have way more confidence in Biden leading our country now than Trump. It isn't close. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
What’s wrong with you?? I’m going to vote for Biden and the majority of people from Cedar Rapids sure as hell didn’t vote for Trump. Even if they did would you want their kids to suffer? Would you say the same if Katrina victims?

Dan, the people holding out have made it very clear that if Biden admin even symbolically adopted just one of the (massively popular) major policy platforms: M4A, GND, debt-free college, legal weed, etc he'd win by 10 million votes. Joe is the one who won't budge.
South Korea &amp; US had their first documented case on the same day. They had 300 deaths, we'll have 300k by November if people don't start following mitigation strategies. You know what I think about Biden and Harris, but we've failed at every level so far.
Yikes. There is no way the Biden campaign has lawyers working on potential election controversies.
“Not my first choice” is primary talk. The primaries are over. Vote for Biden/Harris and every down ticket Democrat like our survival depends on it, because it does.
Meh.  I’m still voting for Biden!
This is so deeply depressing, but I also understand the Biden team’s logic here, given the kinds of crazy right-wing judges we’ve got all over this country right now. (Though by this logic, Ted Cruz would be just as ineligible for the Presidency)
Biden has been a staunch drug warrior his entire career and I would be embarrassed if I didn’t know that. But you do you.
I don’t know which would be more embarrassing, actually not knowing Biden has been a drug warrior his whole career, or thinking nobody else would know that
I was born in 76, I have a functioning memory, and you need to do your homework:
Joe Biden wrote the law that funded the “street crimes” team that kicked in doors in my city for weed smells. GFY, Karen. You couldn’t sound more white right now.
There’s a shit-ton of spite towards leftists in this thread. I don’t begrudge you for voting how you will vote; I won’t vote for Biden because he fucked up my and many of my friends lives with the war on drugs. So he can go to hell.
Radio said this perfectly regarding Biden/Harris.  "They're a little more centric than what some people want but it's better than what we have."  Aka: Democrats dropping the ball to make actual change once again.

Yeah WTF why is Joe Biden in the Democratic party? Oh because it's a party for corporatist sellouts to rake in campaign cash, not a party to protect human rights, working people, or democracy.

Just for clarification: - Since I'm not voting for Biden, I'm giving a vote to tRump. 🙄  However...  - Since I'm also not voting for tRump, I must be giving a vote to Biden. - I'm giving a vote to Hawkins.  So, to sum up, I am voting 3 times at once. Damn, I'm good! 😂
Yeah, Biden himself doesn't seem enthusiastic about it. But many "progressive" types will push for it.
Political prosecutions will be great again, if Biden wins.

Wow, are you ever in for a surprise if you actually start paying attention! 😂 Biden/Harris is a Republican ticket from the Reagan era, fully conservative &amp; in service to the moneyed minority. Just because you've embraced an actual fascist wannabe dictator doesn't make them Left.
I would note that, when defenders of Joe Biden attempted to deflect attention from the Reade accusations by trying to dummy up very similar claims against Bernie, I openly called for a public investigation. The accusations never caught on, however, &amp; simply disappeared.
President Joe Biden is ON IT:
Biden did call a member of the kkk his friend and mentor. So does Hillary. research the democrat party history, instead of watching too much your news who spoon-fed you lies.
can any of you name a single one of Joe Biden's policies without looking it up

A “Club for Growth Action” political slander ad states “hundreds of thousands of schools have closed indefinitely” and that “four years under Biden is a lost generation.” Can you please fact check before you attempt hyperbole? Another need for #newsliteracy in this nation.

Can’t wait Yang! You’ll be a great part of Team Biden.
I sure have fun offending people on the far left and far right by showing my support for Biden/Harris 2020. These people are excellent for our country. I love Kamala Harris. She deserves to be leading our nation.
You've lost more jobs in three months than Barack Obama and Joe Biden did in 8 years. Unemployment rates are at levels not seen since the Great Depression and nearly 170,000 Americans are dead because of your administration's failed efforts at containing Covid-19

I’m happy too!!! For the people! Wealthy and poor. This is why I like Kamala.
I sure can. Heaven forbid a natural disasters distract us from Biden's VP rollout.
For Biden/Harris? Why bother? 🙄  For a ticket that actually represents the interests of the People? Hell yeah!  Face it, the DNC doesn't care if Joe loses, so long as their status quo grift games are safe. They're rich. Trump isn't hurting them.
I’d like to say, i’m disappointed about the VP choice. But, I’m also disappointed about Biden. Both seem like half-assed attempts at being a democrat. I’m done with the party, they’ve failed me, &amp; others.  That DOESNT mean I won’t vote for them. I am not stupid. #SettleForBiden
this ad suggests that Joe Biden is capable of operating a hand crank train car at a speed comparable to an actual train, but he respects the town center enough to lower his speed while passing through.
Being against protecting child molesters is humorous? She’s an awful pick with a track record probably worse than Biden’s. Because picking between the lesser of two evils has done so much good. It’s not perfectionism to not support terrible people.

Haven't watched CNN/MSNBC/FOX or any other MSM in years now, so not really sure what they're babbling on about, but I imagine it's probably about how Biden/Harris will "save the country" from the Orange Menace. Propaganda is propaganda. I'd imagine it wouldn't take long to spot.
Really glad I watched the Biden/Harris event - it’s a great pair of speeches, especially from Kamala, and it made a nice, neat case for why they work well together. Neither were my first choice for either role, but I feel really good about this ticket.

Joe Biden says some sus stuff sometimes but isn’t it because he has a speech impediment?
As a member of the lgbtq+ community having Donald Trump as president is hard. Having an outwardly homophobic Vice President it’s very hard as well. I ask for those that follow me and are old enough to vote to vote for Biden. A vote for trump is a vote against me.
Well, now I’m more excited about Joe Biden.

my main hope with this administration is that Biden picks some kickass cabinet members and let’s them do most of the work. also, good thread
If you’re excessively tweeting about Biden-Harris, I want to know how many times you’ll volunteer between now and November. 🤔  This election is too important to be a pundit on social media and not do what it actually takes to win. ✅
It's so nice hearing Biden and Harris speaking like real leaders rather than ranting about toilets and endorsing food products.
Biden and Kamala are nailing this event IMO. Very, very excited for their White House.
why must joe biden have press conference while i am trying to watch jeopardy????? i am OPPRESSED
Or when they try to say Biden isn't mentally competent. Meanwhile, their guy can't form a coherent thought.
Biden is so much better when he gets mad. It clearly focuses him and reminds him of the stakes of the situation. Even in this speech he improves the second the topic turns to trump. I think he’ll kick butt in that debate.
Biden kind of has the founding father look going on with the white hair.
Same for Biden. Says a new racist thing every week. Black people ain't black, poor kids are just as bright as white kids, etc.
Why won't Biden debate Trump?
Voting for Biden/Harris is like paying an insurance bill. You don’t WANT to do it, cost is high, payout is low, the ppl in charge are rich corrupt sleaze balls, you know it’s a scam that only makes THEM richer, but if you DON’T do it, ur fucked. This is democracy/capitalism 🙃
I didn’t vote for Kamala. I think some (not all) of the critiques of her track record are warranted. That can be true AND I can be happy Biden picked her over others. I can think critically about her politics (as we should for all politicians) AND appreciate this historic moment.
Yeah, that's gonna be a 'No' from me, brah. I can't vote for Biden if he won't debate Trump.
Still not voting for Biden, but this, this, this. The two can coexist. ✨
Can’t wait to see the duality of Dems this fall simultaneously supporting BLM and the Warden Biden and Officer Kamala ticket. Pure aneurysm material 💥🩸🧠💀
Crazy how Biden was able to take the time out of his busy schedule of sucking on raw hot dogs or whatever to pick a cop/warhawk as his vp. Really thought we were gonna have to wait a bit longer
the candidates need to earn the vote of the ppl then. instead of ppl shaming those with criticism of the candidates. we should show them how they have changed. but ignoring criticism adds to toxic rhetoric. i already plan on voting for biden/ harris.
Once Biden wins office, this virus will disappear and so will i.
Let’s do this for our country, too! Biden/Harris 2020!!!!!
I’m seriously keeping a fucking mental note of every dumb liberal who posts some positive shit about Biden picking Copmala as his VP. Y’all are all dead to me.
Biden  -opposes universal healthcare -supports and is supported bypredatory banks -is an architect of brutal racist law enforcement policy and friends with segregationists -was literally picked to be VP to appeal to white racists.  But go off I guess...
It’s hardly the number one reason to vote for them, but Biden-Harris is one of the most religiously diverse tickets ever. Harris is Christian but grew up with heavy Hindu influences and her husband and children are Jewish. Biden would be the second Catholic President.

It’s ridiculous that we actually have to make a law like that. Trumpmerica Gone Wild. Biden/Harris.
You should know by now that politicians will say whatever they think will gain votes. What they do with power is the true test. Both Biden and Harris failed those tests.
This is why Biden/Harris 2020 is the deal. They will be able to be held accountable in ways Trump (so far) has managed to run away from faster than we can sue him.
LOL. Biden also believes in jailing nonviolent drug offenders. What do you say to those people?  Regardless, both admins will continue bombing brown people across the globe. Supporting the USA empire is immoral. Undermine it instead, through agorism.

For example - Trump may try to declare victory on election night even when there are many absebtte ballots left to be counted in key states. But that will be much harder to do if those states with outstanding ballots are already reporting for Biden.
Plus she and Biden despise each other
It's never been a binary choice. Your lazy acceptance of such does not make it fact.  You claim you supported Bernie. Why? Policies, right? (Just like rest of us) So how precisely does Biden benefit you? He doesn't. Electing Hawkins gets rid of Trump, too, &amp; gets the policies.
I'm gonna listen to my Black, queer, fat,  nonbinary, deeply informed friend on this one, but I guess y'all progressives who think you know better, go off. 😂 Biden ain't great, but at least he listens to the country. Kamala is a solid pick, and either way, Trump is outta there.
There should be a reporter in the same room as Joe Biden sleeps in tonight. When he first wakes up, the reporter should ask him if he remembers who he nominated as his VP today. Would he answer correctly?
Is that seriously all you people can do? Spew Party propaganda &amp; talking points? Let's try something. WITHOUT MENTIONING TRUMP, tell me what a vote for Biden/Harris is actually a vote FOR (not against; for). They've already turned down every policy that the People support.

The only thing conceivably better than this country getting to tell  "you're fired" in November is doing so with a landslide victory for Biden &amp; Harris with a margin so large, so huge, so beautiful.  The biggest margin.  Man.  Woman.  TV.  Camera...
For everyone on the left saying Ds should just nominate whoever b/c look Rs are calling Biden and Harris socialsts etc. anyway - the problem isn't what Rs say but how it sticks. And it doesn't stick for either candidate (esp. while trying to paint Kamala as a cop also)

Settle for Biden and you will lose the respect of myself, and countless other freethinking black people in the world. Stop.
If you vote for Biden/Kamala. You are not allowed to vocalize support or allyship towards BLM or any other people of color. You are on the same level as those who vote for Trump/Pence. Please vacate.

Class act. I hope President Biden makes you his Secretary of State.
Biden didn’t pick her.
Republican ads out here talking about how the “radical left” controls Joe Biden. Bitch we fucking wish LOL.
I can't say I'm surprised by Biden's pick of Harris for his running mate, but I don't think it was the pick that would be the best for his campaign.
Of all the possible people he was looking at down the final stretch, I think this was probably the right pick - she’ll be a great campaigner, a good VP, and she’s well positioned to pick up the torch when Biden’s gone. I’m happy with this.
I love the Kamala Harris running mate selection from Biden
My hot take: The benefit of electing "mainstream" or "centrist" Democrats is that if you've pushed the party left in the meantime they'll tend to reflect the work that you did, and their reputation can serve as cover for your agenda. Thus Biden running left of Obama, Clinton, etc
Gentle reminder that either Biden or Harris would’ve let fewer than half as many citizens die since March
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be a solid team and a necessary counterpoint to 'Starchy and Husk' aka Trump/Pence.  It has been an exceptionally long few years and government doesn't work when  authoritarians are at the helm. A good team is neded.. Harris is a very good choice.
i'm ecstatic to vote trump out, not ecstatic to vote biden in.
voting for joe biden is like getting a flu shot  nobody wants to do it, but in order to protect yourself and those around you, you bite the bullet do it anyway.

This is about the normal time a VP is announced.  But this isn’t about that. The only thing that matters is the math. Biden’s got scoreboard. Jorgensen’s got excuses.
So how many of the silent majority are going to take part in these polls? Of course Biden is leading in every poll, no republican is picking up the damn phone 🤣
Couldn't care less. There is not a single thing the media can bring out about Biden that will be even come remotely close to the least-terrinle thing Trump has done.
Of course, that assumes Biden wins.  Being the VP candidate on a losing ticket might not do much for career advancement, so it depends a bit on how confident one is of victory.
Brown's basic argument in this article is that the VP is a dead end job and Harris could do more as AG or some other cabinet position. It's possible, however, that Biden's VP might be a more important job than many expect.
Donald Trump &gt; Joe Biden. Is it really much of a compliment? I don’t care. They both suck.
Also how are your states being run? Look at the southern states. They take more money from the federal government than California. Also why are your states always ranked lowly? Biden most definitely knows where he is. He might just misspeak, but he’s very intelligent.

Were there any Biden boat parades today?  I didn’t think so.
Biden's been touched by these issues personally, having lost his first wife and daughter to a car crash. Based on that and his record, I'm optimistic about what his administration would do on auto safety.
The Sting Ray is sweet, and the ad is cool. While Biden can drive stick, can Trump even drive?  The Sting Ray predated NHTSA; we can't hold classic cars to the safety standards of today. Of course, no one does—but nor do they try to shame those who drive them. Worth pondering.

It’s all the more galling to write all that you have about the dangers of Trump, and that Democrats needed to nominate Biden, to now equivocate if the VP nominee doesn’t measure up to your faux conservative values.

You are not moderate if you’ve only voted republican or do not think Biden “respects the Constitution, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, national security interests, free speech and a free press.”
I’m voting for Biden and Greenfield from the People’s Republic of Johnson County Iowa - the bluest County in the red shit that is rural Iowa voting against their own damn interests when they kept voting for loser do nothing Steve King for example.

We're in the car and I was telling my husband about Trump's comments on Biden and God...my 5yo interrupts with a drawn out groan and goes, "Ohhhhhh, I hope next year is not this baaaaaddddd."   Wish I'd recorded that! Big. Mood. Kiddo.
Biden doesn’t support any of these unfortunately lol
You are ridiculous, un-American, and extraordinarily entitled if you would choose Trump in the case you don’t love Biden’s veep pick.
“You can’t eat equality”-Joe Biden
I wish Biden were powerful enough to hurt God, but as a compromise I'll take him as is.He also admitted to me it was mainly about hurting Biden, I know Kanye himself said it, but it's wild how these guys have zero concience, promoting a Trump admin through sheer manipulation.

I’m proud of Virginia. Looks like it will go to Biden. Wish I could say the same. My state is so close it’s embarrassing. The criminal actually leads the polls🤬
OBVIOUSLY JOE BIDEN &amp; AMERICA’S DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE DID NOT BY YOUR ATTEMPT AT CONSPIRACY LIES 🤬
I do not disagree with you. That person is clearly a fanatic, so I would challenge her to explain why she thinks her 401k will go to crap if Biden wins. My point is that the person is just parroting what Trump says.
There's like a 5% shot Biden even knows who this is, right?
I've noticed SO MANY as I've ridden my bike around DSM this summer and they're usually in clusters. I wonder if they're waiting until Biden accepts the nomination, and then they'll accept reality?!

Fuck Biden
Oh no

Biden, aides say, didn’t get why that was funny. Biden wrote in 07 memoir “the single most important piece of advice I got in my career” from Sen. Mansfield (D-Mont.) Your job here is to find the good things in your colleagues—the things their state saw—and not focus on the bad.”

Your President is endorsed by KKK.  When he close the borders it was too late, it’s already pandemic. It’s already in the country .  Biden,  racist,  serve as the VP of the first black president . How can the Obama staff overlooked that one  detail.
Climate change alone should honestly compel you to vote. Is Biden’s place perfect? No. Is it more progressive then we have ever seen before? Yes. The next four years will determine our fate, if we haven’t already reached the tipping point. Trump guarantees extinction.
By wearing a mask outside? King Biden wants power!!
I took exception with something posted by a FB friend recently and was piled on by him and another person that I am part of the sheep that follow the communist liberals basically and how Biden will destroy America. No chance of talking reality or logic with some of them.
The VP came to Iowa in the middle of a pandemic and after a major storm. Meeting with Iowans and farmers in person. That’s leadership. When is Biden coming to Iowa besides by Zoom?
But can your 7 year old answer questions after a press conference? Biden can’t apparently

Funny you mention Cake- I've been on a couple of their posts recently. They like Biden for some reason
And then she'll immediately file for divorce immediately upon Joe Biden taking the oath of office.
Pence really threw down the gauntlet. I have no idea how Biden/Harris respond to this.
"literally senile" I don't think you've spent time around senile people nor do you seem to remember how much of gaffe machine Biden has been throughout his career.

VP Mike Pence is up at this Heritage Action event in DSM focused on the Trump admin's support for law enforcement. He reads off crime statistics in major cities. “They’re just a preview of Joe Biden’s agenda for America. The truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America."
The entire MAGA cult voted for a pussy grabber...but they want you to think Biden is the one with the problem while alienating women by asserting they’re...what? Easy? “Smart”.
Just watch the debates.  Anyone who says Biden is in cognitive decline must have skipped the debates this spring.
One more reason to vote for Joe Biden. We've had enough crazy. Time to get serious again.
Never Trumper who's voting Biden-Harris here, but this isn't about the base. It's about reasonableness. Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh.
Let me catch you up to reality. 30% of Republicans are joining Biden pre election, while 90% of Dems will vote for Biden. 45% of dems are leaving the party after the election to form an actual progressive party. Trump is going to prison.
Why do we even need DNC speakers other than Biden &amp; Harris during a pandemic?
Today Iowa surpassed 50,000 confirmed COVID cases.   Mike Pence &amp; Kim Reynolds are attending a Heritage Foundation event.  Joe Biden announced his support for a nationwide mask mandate.
Just where are the battle lines...I want to be on the Biden side of the line.  They talk a tough game but they are all chicken shits’
The good news is, is that non bernie or busters like me, on day one of a biden administration will be making fun of and shitting on them

How are we doing right now? Basically Trumps only message is that if we elect Biden the country will still be better off than it is under Chump? Works for me and 70 million others.

Looks like Biden-Harris are locking down the Hindu vote
Reminder: President Trump carried Iowa by 9 points in 2016. Some counties voted twice for Obama and then flipped. Republicans swept the state legislature that year, too.   Now polls show a tight race here between Trump/Biden. This is Pence's third trip to IA since May.
And I’m not excusing Biden but when someone only hammers one side I feel the need to point it out
When  is too scared to tell Iowans she supports her own Dem ticket, I guess that should tell you just about everything you need to know about how well Joe Biden is doing in Iowa.
One more thing;  Establishment conservatives/liberals. We have seen your hand. This poker game is over. You win. However, It has cost you the future. A real progressive party is coming after election.  I will vote Biden, stop asking for $, go ask your criminal corporate donors.

Do they think this will be a negative to anyone who was considering voting for Biden, or is it just more drum up the base?
Kellyanne Conway complained yesterday that instead of criticizing Trump’s handling of the pandemic he should share his own plans. Biden has done so repeatedly:  facial coverings, social distancing, unified messaging from the WH and ample testing. He repeated it yesterday! Duh!

YOU said that Biden choosing Harris as VP would insult men. Are you kidding me? This is another sexist statement out of your mouth. Real men will not say this.

I'll tell you what's nuts.  The ghost of Herman Cain is tweeting about the Biden/Harris ticket.  That beats Mr. President yelling at cable news all morning, and Betsy DeVos ordering her yacht crew to fire up her internet machine.  Herman Cain is tweeting from the great beyond!

He better hope he doesn’t get elected - if he does he won’t last a month. Actually, after Trump is elected, Biden will immediately disappear.  They will find him in a nursing home somewhere.

I enjoy watching the right pretend Trump is not President. How about this? You were given 4 yrs to show you could handle important business and you messed up-AGAIN. You offer nothing but excuses. Biden-Harris in 2020.
Some of y’all really see people criticizing Biden/Harris and the first thing that comes to your mind is “so you’re telling us to vote for Trump”..............
1) Biden/Harris announcement  2) Scotland train derailment 3) 1100 new cases of COVID-19 in NC 4) return to learn impacts.   That’s just the A-Block
So if Biden says I am against abortion, but I am not for forcing my belief on this subject to others (pro choice) is he excommunicated?  Or is ok for all religions to mandate and force their beliefs on others?
She's not my favorite choice and neither was Biden. But everytime the president doesn't like a woman Rep or Dem he calls her nasty. Its obvious :Nasty"means bitch. If she was a man we wouldnt be having this conversation. This isn't presidential.

I’ve seen a couple castrate/kill pedophiles posts circulating here and on Facebook in the past week and I’m sorta wondering where that came from. I feel like it’s a 2 part interactive social campaign and the next part is evidence that Trump or Biden are pedos.
Hillary Clinton or her good family friend and donor Donald Trump were not acceptable options in 2016 and voted 3rd Party.  Seeing what Trump has done the last four years it’s apparent he is not a choice this time around either. I’m voting Biden/Harris in November. #LincolnVoter
That’s a good thing, isn’t it?  “Tucker Carlson warned his viewers last night that if Biden is elected, everything Trump has done to this country will be reversed! 🤷🏻‍♂️”
Joe Biden is a radical leftist? And yet he’s opposed to Medicare for All?  Show your work and back up your argument because it’s doesn’t stand on its own.
running Biden and Harris because Sanders or hell even Warren are too "extreme" meanwhile media has already painted both Biden and Harris as revolutionary Marxists
I heard Beau Biden speak in an Iowa backyard over 10 years ago introduced by  and I thought he would run for president one day. After today's speech by  he is on the ballot in a sense. Photo for  in 2019.
You would think all Biden/Harris would need to do would be to just give speeches that are inspirational and coherent a few times a week with decent coverage and that should nail the win. #BidenHarris2020
All of the women on Biden’s potential V-P candidate list have outstanding credentials. All of them are a major improvement over what’s been going on with the executive branch since 1/20/2017.
That was a great get-together.  Biden and Harris are definitely on their A game.
Our power is out so I couldn’t watch the rollout but it sounds like Biden’s speech went well.
No crowd, plenty of history as Biden introduces Harris  (from
I agree with most of what you said. But, dems made her ethnicity and gender an issue when Biden said he would pick a black female.  They grandstanded on the importance diversity and promised to represent black Americans.  That goes out the window when they pick an Indian/Jamacan

Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
I trust the Biden/Harris Ticket. I am voting a straight Democratic We need it.🗽🦅🇺🇸🙋
I just said she's not "helping with the progressives" - because most of the progressives I know (Warren supporters) are not thrilled. But they also were (for the most part) determined beforehand to vote for Biden regardless of who he picked. I can't speak for Bernie fans.
I like the Kamala Harris choice because I feel like if Biden fucks up and does something creepy she'll throw his ass in a retirement home and get the job done herself.
Okay, I fucking hate Biden and Harris but you know that's the pair I'm voting for. I'm sad too but can you stand another 4 years of whatever the fuck THIS was?
Far from my first choice for the ticket but this video has me hyped to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
as someone that has not been hyped to vote for Biden this announcement and video has gotten me hyped
If biden were to adopt these 2 bills as planks in his platform it would garauntee him the election
That right there, tells you everything you need to know about   party. Not being sarcastic, just literal. Oh, &amp; shut up about joe, of course we're voting for Biden. Quit being dicks about it, you're scaring potential votes away. Honey not vinegar.
Also pretty surprised at Gov. Kelly's approval compared to Biden.
Biden being perceived as moderate gives cover for his campaign to move left. In the way that some said only Nixon could go to China, Biden may have room to welcome in the more progressive wing as he keeps the party together.
The annual event will be adapted to meet social distancing guidelines, and masks are required to move outside vehicles.
"Biden’s biggest advantage over Trump is the perception that he can bring people together. I suspect the Harris nomination is designed to help him make that case more strongly," writes
Dude, I wish Biden/Harris were as radical left as they’re being made out to be in these ads. Direct action in the streets is still our best option for progress &amp; change in this country. Keep electing true leftists into office, &amp; continue the fight regardless. The people will win.
Biden wasn't even in my top ten Democratic candidates. I'm not saying he's a great or even a good candidate. It's a binary choice now and for me the choice is easy. You may prefer to indulge a sense of moral superiority. Remember RBG will not make it through another four years.
It's not an excuse to point out that Bernie was wrong to it vote for it (especially because he said at the time he disagreed with the vast majority of the provisions of the bill) but Joe Biden is more wrong for writing, championing, and bragging out the bill.
If you can't see why Biden is the lesser evil then I can't help you. Enjoy your feeling of superiority when Republicans keep packing the courts.
I'm saying "it's ok" in the sense that many many many many many Bernie fans make excuses for that vote. Yet for some reason it's a deal breaker and they are too morally pure now to support Biden against fascism.
Republicans want to help a black guy who has admitted he wants to hurt Biden. Keep up.
It's not okay! He has faced a lot of criticism for his vote and he has always acknowledge that it was a flawed vote for a deeply troubling piece of legislation that Joe Biden *wrote*! No one gave him a pass for it!
I'm voting for Joe Biden because I have to but I'm Voting for Kamala Harris because I want to
It's a bait and switch. Biden will step down sometime in his first term, and Harris checks the right identity boxes to carry the left's agenda forward as president.
He will get my vote given the alternative, but I just can’t get excited about Joe Biden being the democratic nominee... I would love to hear honest opinions from legit Biden supporters on why he’s their guy?
You got us fucked up if you do... he admitted he was running to divide Biden votes giving his best friend TRUMP votes... smh you feeding into his delusion and gonna fuck us over more than we are rn

Lol the Dems really think we’re all going to get cozy with them &amp; be complacent if Biden/Harris wins in November. A rude awakening is heading their way; these protests won’t stop, the movement won’t slow. We’ll just fight that much harder for progress. We gotta put the foot down.
I literally LOL when people assume that liberals think Biden will be a good president. We know he’s shit, love. Literally nobody has any genuine support for him. We think the whole system is trash. Find a different argument.
I understand what you’re saying - but if elected she’ll be in position in 2024 to be at the top of the ticket. Personally I don’t see Biden running for a second term.
“When I vote for Biden and Harris, I’m voting for my family to securely continue our long lineage as family farmers. Biden and Harris have a vision for rural America that I’m proud to embrace.”
We don’t know. We have to wait until November 3rd to find out. I think Trump could win another term and I also think Biden could beat him. We won’t know for certain until it happens.

No matter how much you Bernie Bros may not like Kamala Harris because she can't pass your precious purity tests you have to concede at least one point: Joe Biden is much worse.

Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden’s Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
The problem with electoral forecasts is that it can't take into account late-breaking events such as Clyburn endorsing Biden. You always need to bake in some uncertainty for those situations.
I really like Joe Biden's choice for a running mate!
Hi Gabrielle, hope all is well ma’am.  Saw the discussion on SWs reacting to Harris as VP for Biden. There won’t be a sweeping roundup of SWs, the issues we are facing right now are far more pressing. Besides, Trump has done far more damage.
I stand behind my assessment that Joe Biden will not be on the final ticket in November - and that Hillary is out there waiting in the wings #Election2020
Joe Biden being “Joe Cool” 😎
Shout out to  who on Monday morning submitted a post on how VP picks affect presidential races. I was copy editing when the derecho hit and we lost power. Dan revised the text to take into account Biden's pick, &amp; I'll publish in a few (from outside a coffee shop).
I posted an 18 minute video of Biden’s gaffes
Biden can’t go 2 minutes without being racist or coherent
I did answer. He makes an occasional gaffe but he isn’t completely demented like Biden. He can speak on stage for 2 plus hours. Biden can’t go 2 minutes
Might be meh about Harris; still going to vote for Biden. Also: I’m not suddenly wearing a MAGA hat because I’m not ecstatic about our Democratic candidates.  Absolutism is the language of the party we’re trying to beat, and it’s disgusting when I see it in our own.
Yeah I don’t see anyone switching from Biden to Trump. But I can see people who were going to vote for Biden no longer vote at all bc of Harris. I hope not tho
I don’t think it’s so horrible, but I do believe enough of these tweets gon lead to mfs not voting at all. Bc not everyone can think for themselves. I have seen people already saying they not voting at all(and they HATE trump) so in some cases, it can work against Biden/Harris
I’d prefer to judge her on what she can bring to the table as VP instead of racial background.  Considering that is competence and intelligence, it just further cements I’m voting for Biden and her.
and a majority of Americans know Joe Biden is who we need as President to repair the damage of the last 4 years
Whataboutist much? Fuck Biden
Hell no I want to see Joe Biden DEBATE TRUMP
Biden is not anti integration today.  Doesn't respect women? Writer of the VAWA?  🙄🙄🙄
There's progress forward with Biden who would be tougher on tackling pandemic &amp; he would listen to progressives.  Trump won't do either.  Everyone else is not in a position to make a difference.
Same boat, but in reverse.  I think my initial excitement/relief was that at least Biden didn't pick Rice.   Now I'm thinking about her record.   The ticket isn't the one I would have preferred and pragmatism isn't much of a balm.
Watching this put into words why I was so emotional when Biden announced his VP pick. My eldest son couldn't contain his joy &amp; I fought back tears becuz I am a strong woman in a male dominated field &amp; had been thrown under the bus at work and was needing a reminder of my strength
What's shameful is someone who literally lived in an american concentration camp fighting tooth and nail to protect a system that regularly murders minorities and extorts the poor for basic healthcare. Biden would gladly put you in a private prison if you sneezed on a cop.
Too bad Biden just nominated one to be VP 🤷
Trump, Biden who cares? Two bowls of dried out old shit the only difference is the smell.  I thought Vixen was talking Trump.   Even if Repubs lose the house and chunks of the senate, Washington will still drag it's bloated ass to get ONE thing done. NO THING.  Stimulus 2 anyone?
More tangibly, suppose (pulling this out of thin air) that "Joe Biden" is more common on adversarial writing, "Biden" on neutral writing, and "Joe" on friendly writing. The form you limit yourself could exhibit such biases.
If you just use [last] or [first], you might run into misattribution and other biases. For instance, Biden is usually referenced by last name but Harris by first name. There could be a bias behind the reason or behind using the less common form.
As we get closer to debate season, I want to remind everyone of this article. Say what you want about Joe Biden, but think about if what you’re saying may be deragatory towards the stuttering community. Also it was so cool to meet  via zoom yesterday with  :)
I’m not asking about trump. We shall see in the debates
Here's an inside look at the vetting process that led to Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
All of these racist Joe Biden comments that he’s made has made America crazy
Biden and his racist comments have imboldened the racist left
I don’t like Biden. I don’t like Harris. But it’s fuck Trump so here we are.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
I didn’t get to go to my grandpa’s funeral and I literally have nightmares about going to the grocery store, pls vote for Biden and contribute to or volunteer with local candidates or organizations you like more!
The people had her and went with.... Joe Biden
Fair enough. Neither she or Biden were in my top 5 of the field.
hey, you can like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or you can not but please vote for them in November because I am at least optimistic enough to believe they care if the pandemic keeps killing us all and it’s clear that Trump doesn’t
It’s lies like these that make me feel sick to my stomach. Derecho happened yesterday but lies are being told that it happened as soon as Biden announced his VP?! Like some sort of Biblical warning?? You are a false prophet ma’am.
Joe “What Are We Doing With Our Hands?” Biden
Any Biden supporters/Anti-Trumpers wanna explain this one, or we just gonna stick with “Orange Man Bad” all the time? Call it both ways, and demand better candidates.
I’ve been so zoned in on storm coverage that I didn’t even notice all of the Tuesday news dump around me   -no big ten football - as Biden’s VP pick  Did I mention today is TUESDAY and this week has been as long as 2020 has
Joe Biden would be a better President than the current ONR. That’s the choice you have before you.
This is delusional. Biden May well be a one term president. To ignore the incredible damage a second Trump term would do so you MIGHT get a candidate you like in 4 years is immoral.
There is no progress possible in the current structure. Biden is a better chance. These things aren’t easy. Do the politics but sitting on your hands at this point is a moral choice. Too much is at stake.
Sure. He said that in the primary. And his decades long career has been about making deals. You’re not going to get M4A from Trump. If you want it, get Biden in office with a Democratic majority in both houses, and apply pressure. Do the politics.
With a gun to my head I'd vote for Hillary before Kamala Harris.   She's a wannabe tyrant who will do anything for power.  Biden better hire a food taster.

Joe Biden selects Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate today
Joe Biden could have picked John Kasich for VP &amp; called it a “unity ticket” and the Trump team/Republicans would have said it represented a radical socialist takeover of the USA. They’ve got nothing. #KamalaHarris  #BidenHarris2020
Pro tip: with a Biden/Harris 2020 ticket, the Dems have effectively said NO to cannabis legalization.
Jill or Hunter Biden
take: The selection of dynamic and path-breaking Kamala Harris shows Biden is confident in his own skin.
I’m so disgusted and torn over this whole thing. For all the obvious reasons. Only time Kamala shined was her grilling of the piece of hair encrusted shit, Kavanaugh. She’s still a fking cop and Biden is expertly using her as a pawn to keep the status quo bc she’s a Black Woman.
She’s not going to help you outlaw abortion or gay marriage, so you would never vote for her anyway.  Don’t worry about it.  If Biden loses, it won’t be because of her. It will be because of the American voters.
I pledge that I will commit to do WHATEVER it takes to putting Biden/Harris in the PEOPLE’S HOUSE.  Who’s with me?
And to think she accused Biden of being racist and out of touch...🤔
Lol...please Mr. Russian bot. Quit passing yourself. Biden picked the woman who beat him in a debate. That tells you what kind of person they both are.
In a time with black lives matter saying defund the police. Biden chooses a cop as his VP. Really stupid.  Should have been    But.... Biden would never choose Nina Turner as VP. That would make too much sense and get Bernie people to vote for   #BidenHarris
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.

So it begins...! Trump attacks Kamala Harris over Kavanaugh hearings in first remarks since she was named Biden's running mate
When was this? Biden certainly never nailed anything in 8 years with Obama....
When was this? Biden certainly never nailed anything in 8 years with Obama....
Also, I do think it’s important to draw this distinction: Kamala Harris never accused Joe Biden of anything. She said she believes the women who have done so. Might seem like a small difference, but it leaves quite a bit of grey area where they could have found common ground.
Influential Iowa activist (obviously  calls Biden-Harris ticket historic
So it's Biden/Harris vs TP.
Biden didn’t even recognize his sister and wife.
Not to delegitimize your anger, but a lot of people have it far worse than you and their situation will be made no better and possibly worse under Biden.
I understand the mentality of the lesser of two evils that we keep getting stuck with. I’m also genuinely worried that if Biden somehow wins, social movements will be pacified and it’ll be just as hard to enact change that positively effects the people. We’ll be back in the loop.
She’s not Saint Bernie and will never be Saint Bernie and Biden also is not Saint Bernie. We all get it.
Biden: Just raise your hands and look to the sky Harris: No, Joe, I have my own style
Congrats to Kamala Harris, great pick Joe Biden! A historic day for the Democrats and America!
It’s now time to unite, work, support &amp; vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!

I cannot believe Biden actually picked Copmala as his VP... 2020 is truly unreal
A Biden administration would not be better for the people.
yeah he’s not great in lots of ways but i would rather organize against biden than trump.
if y’all think a biden administration wouldn’t be easier to win demands against you need to really reevaluate what trump has done in response to movements.
Ask your self if the system will actually change for the better under Biden and Harris. Plug into a community and build power and safety outside of the fucked up system, if we really want to change the way America works and treats people we have to stop playing its game.
After this year, I’m glad we can say our family knows where Biden and Harris stand. Never be afraid to use your voice for issues you care about. #CancerVotes

FWIW I’m not interested in whether or not you like a Biden/Harris ticket.  That’s the ticket.  If you aren’t for #BidenHarris2020  then you’re for trump and you can block me now.
I hope to see you in Biden’s administration Ambassador Rice.
Did she not vote for Biden or something?
As a life long Catholic, this is fucking enraging. Joe Biden is a devoted baptized Catholic you can't take that away from him because you dislike his politics.  come get your boy Providence, RI needs a new Bishop.
Has he heard what he has said about Joe Biden?  Seriously, can some journalist please ask him why it’s ok for him to say the stuff he says about Biden but somehow Kamala Harris is nasty for saying far, far less?
Nothing says Catholic hierarchy more than thinking child sexual abuse is totally fine, but then slandering a devout Catholic like Joe Biden because of politics. This bishop is the embodiment of everything wrong with the Catholic Church. Sad.
talk is cheap. did you vote for McCain/Palin or Obama/Biden?
I’m so hyped, going to put a Biden/Harris bumper sticker on my car which thus far in my 66 years has only been honored with a herkey!
For those who say don’t vote for Biden. Who am I supposed to vote for then? You realize it’s him or trump.
Spend some time and drive around the Midwest. Let me know how many Biden signs you see lol. Trump isn’t losing Iowa, Mo, Kansas, or Wisconsin
This is such a rewrite of history. Joe Biden was in 1st when all the other candidates dropped out. He had a deafening victory in SC and most of the candidates that subsequently dropped out didn’t even reach the delegate threshold there. 😂😂
Trump or Biden
Do not fucking vote for Joe Biden.
Biden committed to a woman vp, there is organization in Iowa, I have written lots of emails and made lots of calls about UBI to all my representatives.
Who y’all voting for now that Biden has an evil cop as vp?
Very motivated to support the Biden/Harris ticket. Senator  is an experienced leader, and a first-class, delightful human being. Well done, Joe Biden! Can't think of anyone more qualified to help cart the entire Trump enterprise to the curb.
Let’s see...it’s been 30 hrs without power, my dad’s corn crop was flattened by a hurricane in fucking Iowa, my work increased but my pay was cut, I can’t find childcare for my daughter this fall, and my grandfather died last week. And I should be worried about Biden’s America?!
Congratulations!   I’m so excited for Biden/Harris.  You’re going to absolutely kill it as VP.  I need a yard sign and bumper stickers!!!
Where did Biden say that?
The activist left would've found anything to bitch about the VP pick. You said it yourself, Biden didn't get this far by taking the ineffectual whiners of the activist left 100% seriously.
It is official! Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential pick. Here she is meeting Griff on our very own campus!

biden picked kamala to appeal to blue lives matter fuckfaces let’s be real
Biden is probably really glad he picked an articulate woman like Tulsi as his running mate...OH&gt;&gt;&gt;WAIT....#nevermind
I picked up a night time 12 hour shift at work last night, and then came home to nap. When I woke up, I saw all the posts that Biden had picked Harris to be his running mate.   BahahhaahHhHHahahahHhahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahah
Made it before 5PM Central...  The Business News Headlines: Mortgage issues. More of these are closing but nobody knows how many. Former Vice President Biden names his running mate. What happened on Wall Street and more:
So I’m guessing the Biden/Harris campaign slogan is gonna be:   “Bailing out one ‘suspect who shot at police, a woman accused of killing a friend, and a twice-convicted sex offender’ at a time.”
How many middle fingers does the DNC &amp; Biden campaign even have?? I’ve lost count at how many they’ve thrown up towards the Left.
“Biden Taps Kamala Harris” may be the most truthful headline the MSM has published all year.
Question why vote for the same ppl who have kept minorities down for years with there policies? Do you really think anything’s gonna change? It didn’t get any better under obama and Biden was a part of that train wreck. The real question is do you want change or more of the same
I am happy with Biden’s selection. I really like her! Now let’s rally around the ticket. Be nice, be supportive, be focused. Be ready to 🗳 🌊 ￼#BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
My fondest political wish is for Biden to win and immediately retire, because fuck yeah president Harris.
If I'm a Trump supporter, I'm thrilled with Biden's VP pick...but that's because I'd be a freaking idiot.
All I gotta say is don’t stop rallying in the streets, we will have to ramp up the fight ten-fold if Biden wins. Keep your anger, hold that rage in and use it to mobilize for actual systemic change. We can’t let the establishment win &amp; put us to sleep again. #VoteThemAllOut
I think the big win here is that this meme can make a comeback now that Biden chose her as his runningmate. AMIRITE OR AM I RIGHT?
How do you feel about Biden's VP choice?
I’m not shocked at Biden’s pick. This country is a hell-scape after all; but it’s just sickening the disdain corrupt, corporate &amp; establishment ghouls openly have for any sort of progress in this pathetic excuse of a “developed” nation. It’s beyond infuriating.
CONGRATULATIONS 👏👏👏👏👏I am SO HAPPY!! You were my first choice for our caucus! I know what you did for California/prop 8/ etc/having spent 20 yrs on the central coast-I know AMERICA/President Biden &amp; you will get us back to land of laws-our Constitution🇺🇸👏
It’s beautiful Trump doesn’t need to figure out new campaign ads he Biden Harris already made all the henwill ever need
Too bad Biden openly said he isn’t going to reign in any fracking.
Watching #Rosetwitter and #Maga react identically at the news about #BidenHarris reaffirms my hatred for both groups and the fact Biden made a good choice.  #Rosetwitter meltdowns give me life.
Biden Chose Harris. Let the gate keeping by white peoples begin.
Ya mean hold Biden’s hand
Never forget #Kamala  #Biden
Joe Biden made a really strong choice picking #TulsiGabbard as his V P Nominee....OH...WAIT A MINUTE!!!   #nevermind
This is literally my stance.  I'm gonna crack jokes. I'm DEFINITELY going to listen to all of the POC &amp; other disenfranchised voters who have valid criticisms of both Biden &amp; Harris' voting records.  But we need AT MINIMUM a reset. And this is the only viable option now.
And here’s the one  and I did with  in September 2019 for that same series.
Lmao people really thought Biden would be different than Trump.
Progressives: ACAB  Biden: you mean "police officer"
gonna enjoy the tidal wave of “ACAB! but we stan our woke poc kween! biden/harris 2020!” posts. im gonna have to go offline permanently
Honestly though, they think the Left will get complacent and quiet if Biden wins; like during the Obama years. They’re in for a rude awakening, these protests &amp; direct actions will only continue and ramp up further the longer we go without change. We can’t give up the fight now.

Don’t get me wrong I’m not voting third party but before all of you fake BLM supporters get excited about the Kamala VP pick, remember she and Biden both are a huge reason there is a police brutality and private prison problem.
Initially, my desire to see Joe Biden elected was based on reversing the ugliness and stupidity of the last four years.  The possibility of four years of   sketches is now a very close secondary motivator.  C’mon America - let’s make this happen!

Is anyone else beyond caring who the VP selection is?  Yes, it is important. But I've spent all the emotional energy I care to spend on it. Biden, you've strung me out about a month too long on this.
Great return on investment for endorsing Biden. Just well done man
Lol exposed what? Nothing he said or did was new. Just so we're clear, I voted for Obama. Did not vote for Hillary. Don't even necessarily like Biden. Trump wasn't well received before '16 either. If you kneeled at a game, he would cuss you out. If you tried to rent, he wouldn't.

"This is not about rights. It's about responsibility"  Biden says that every governor in the nation should put a mask mandate into effect to slow the spread of the virus and open schools faster.  What's your take on this?
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Insane....  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks

You would say that about any pick that Biden made for VP.. Biden will be his own man, doing what's best for THE PEOPLE.. Which is a stark contrast from our current pile of shit leadership

Biden could pick Jesus Christ Himself as his VP and Chuck Todd &amp; Andrea Mitchell would be on camera in 5 minutes to criticize it as the worst decision of all time.
you are my new hero.  Pussy Lips Pelosi  is not out for “We the People” she is for herself.  Pelosi has no integrity, morals or ethics. She is eat up with hate, towards POTUS &amp; his supporter, that she is mentally unstable like Biden. #VoteDemsOut2020
Biden was denied Catholic communion for supporting baby killing. What kind of a "good Catholic" is that?

Listen um um um look... that’s what Biden says in every interview. He sounds coherent for about a minute and then it all goes to hell. Biden supporters should NEVER bag on anyone about their ability to speak these days 🤣
wait, but isn't Donald J Trump President here in 2020??  so Barack Obama and Joe Biden need to do what exactly??  I'll concede the argument if in 2021 and Joe Biden is President and murders increase under him as well. then, yes, Joe Biden needs to fix it.
All you responding that Joe can fix this are clueless. Look at H1N1; it was far less contagious and 60-80 MILLION were infected under Obama/Biden. The mortality rate was lower because it affected younger people. Biden won’t change anything just because you hate Trump.Joe Biden is a good and decent man &amp; has many other qualities needed in a POTUS. trump is everything we never want to see again in a POTUS.
Trump just lost the support of the USPS union. They have officially endorsed Biden. Trump isn’t doing himself any favors by alienating voters.   those are voters in Iowa that  will be losing too. #BidenHarris2020
I thought “held accountable” is a better term for Biden procecuting Trump
This ad was ran by a Trump Super PAC. I lost my job from an economic disaster and Biden is the real threat???!? Get the fuck outta here lol
Uhmmmm no Kanye. Joe Biden should not be take seriously and claud Anderson probably taking financial advice from Trump
This still does not solve the fact some states do not count the absentee ballots until the next day and allow votes to trickle in.  If he goes to bed thinking he won bc fox tells him he did, yet the actaul vote is Biden due to absentee, he will not accept it. YOU KNOW THIS.
honestly i just think biden andvtrump are crazy
Biden is a racist!
Vote Biden. Any other option (including not voting) is as good as voting for Trump.
Joe Biden Releases List of Trump's 152 Coronavirus Lies
Idc what he says. It's all stupid or false, let's shift the convo to Biden and Harris. Stop feeding the fire.
Some did. And some wanted it to be open to everyone - even women.  To blanket everyone is like saying everyone who votes for Biden is a commie and everyone who votes for trump is a fascist.
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate.

TECHNICALLY Biden opposed Reagan's nom of Robert Bork, but yes he's supported virtually every other conservative appointment. A real sAvIoR to us all.
Biden helped usher in the conservative Supreme Court majority. Anyone vote shaming "to prevent a 7-2 Republican swing" is going to be in for a rude awakening.
I'm the CFO of Antifa. I tried to warn the chairman that we simply cannot afford Joe Biden at this time, but I got overruled. 🤷🏼‍♂️📉☄
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Biden is one sick fuck!!!
If Joe Biden doesn't speak out against Palestinians having their lands stolen from them by Israel and UAE, then Progressives will NEVER vote for him.  We believe Palestine has a right to exist and decide it's own fate there should be no peace and no negotiations without them.
We are fucked Democracy stolen from us with Trump and we are doomed to poverty, starvation, high medical costs and low pay with Biden.   I can't see how any of this is good. Best option,   Move to Europe, Canada, or New Zealand. I'm already looking of ways to move to NZ.
So is the left wing going to sit it out or write-in Bernie or Warren just to ensure Biden Harris don’t win and prove a point?  Progressives stand a better chance in 2024 then if tRump is re-elected bcz more rt-wing policies / judges will be in place.  Better to work with Dem
Crickets from the left...they have no idea what Biden will do because he won’t do anything to make the country better. Maybe he and Harris will improve on the crime bill he championed back in the 90s and jail even more POC. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
It's not like you made some great assumption or inferred something. The words came straight from Biden's mouth. He is not being unclear about his intentions.
But they have no problem using his Twitter account to attack Biden and Harris.
Nobody is melting down just exposing the Stupidity of Joe Biden on his selection.!!!!!

Here's my FUCK YOU JOE BIDEN text.
BIDEN/ HARRIS 2020. Vote blue all the way down the ticket.
I actually like Biden a fair bit and I still can’t help but laugh my ass off at 90% of the memes surrounding the ticket.
The Dems have sold out to China; just ask Hunter Biden about that $1.5 Billion he received when daddy was VP!

I’m conflicted - I know I’ll vote for Biden because he is by far the better option. But I’m not enthused. I don’t want to be disingenuous and aggressively promote him BUT we desperately need him to win. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Lmao the electability is just oozing off of her and Biden 😂
News: OMG Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick!!  Iowa: A little help maybe?
what a disaster you are.  VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!
Question for those of which this applies:  What do you like about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?
Hide ya kids, Joe Biden is raping everyone up in here
My take:  biden says:  no debate neccessary, we’ve seen what you have done.
Harris talking about Biden's deceased son is kinda hard to watch
Joe Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris is all about Obama's legacy &amp; less about beating Trump. What it ignores, Harris is not liked by young black voters &amp; MOST Latino voters.    Why is this an issue? Latinos are the largest minority voting group in America.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.

You aren't the base. You were never the base. You're a shit stirring interloper who works for losers.  You have a choice in November. Trump or Biden. If you can't figure that out then as far as I'm concerned you're fully behind Trump and are an enemy to progressives everywhere.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
You're acting like you were the only one that has a lot to lose if Trump becomes president.   The only reason I live is for my Trans daughter and get Social Security. Biden and Trump will ruin our lives.  I have to make a stand somewhere I hate Trump and I hate the Dem Party.
someone came less than 24 hours after they announced the vp and wanted a biden harris sign   i love the enthusiasm
I agree.  VP Biden does not need the debates.   Demand he released his taxes,  an on site fact checker,  &amp; if he interrupts,  he loses his response time.
Exactly my sentiment! Besides—with the clusterfu tRUmp will be leaving—- They’re going to need a BIG crew!! Jobs for everyone in the Biden/Harris administration!😉🌊💙🌊💙☮️❄️
For the 1st time in there will be more Latinos eligible to vote than ANY OTHER minority group. 32 million voters that the Democratic Party &amp; Joe Biden have largely ignore.   Bernie Sanders was one of the few who worked hard to earn votes of millions of young Latinos. #nastywoman
It should be clear to all that this country is beyond repair and will need to be rebuilt from the ashes.. A Biden presidency is simply delaying the inevitable.. I know that’s a tough pill to swallow.. but hey.
So fucking what if Trump wins again.   I am dead if Biden wins and I'll be dead if Trump wins. After five damn years fighting inside the Dem Party and on Twitter, I AM OVER CARING!   I DON'T FOCKING CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
You should be in that Biden spot.  You should be our next President, but I guess I will just have to look forward to 2028.
Stop saying she's progressive. Hillary tried to pull that shit and we destroyed her argument and exposed her for the filthy Neolib she is. Kamala is a Hillary clone and is as neoliberal as they come. Joe Biden is worse. He is a Conservative Dem. Progressives are Dem Socialists.
And  does a great Biden impersonation. Get ready.
Chairman Allen West's Statement on Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's Running Mate - Republican Party of Texas
I am not French. BIDEN IS GOING DOWN. Biden said “You’ve got the 1st African American who is articulate bright and clean.” Referring to OBAMA. Biden &amp; Obama are CRIMINALS having spied on Trump b4 &amp; after he took office. Corruption SO deep they’re drowning in it.
Don't tell me I'm being a dick after you say I'm being dense. If you can accept Biden for as flawed and awful a candidate as he is then you shouldn't have any issues with Kamala.
I would like to believe he is smiling down at Biden/Harris.
The rest of the world didn't stand still yesterday as those without power in the Quad-Cities waited in long lines for gas, fast food and chainsaws. The Big Ten football season was postponed until spring, Joe Biden announced his running…
Harris gets her moment
#BidenHarris2020 Biden should flood the airwaves with ads in the South addressing the needs of the poor. Kamala should flood the airwaves with ads addressing the Midwest working poor and lower middle class hardships. And both should push for equality all across America. #Vote2020
WRONG. Trump turned anybody with a respectable bone in their body Biden voters. Harris is a very moderate person. She is a former AG that is respectable. Trump can't compete. Keep spreading your LIES and FAKE NEWS. Nobody believes you.
She is a former AG that served real law &amp; order. She doesn't spend her time wasting away bitching and moaning on twitter. Good for her. Biden/Harris 2020
Biden/Harris over here serving that election erection.
I don’t think they gain any votes on the ticket with this move The kids that hear “free college” were already going to vote for Biden, and this move doesn’t do anything to gain the middle aged that actually understand what it takes to give free college, and Kamala doesn’t do that
Obama / Biden were in office for 8 years, and your organization continued to make it possible for disturbed teen-agers and abusive men to get guns and shoot innocent people.
I was a super fan of your Facebook page. A way for me to stay in touch with the news in my state’s capital.  Your followers’ outright racist, sexist comments to the news of Kamala Harris being named as Joe Biden’s running mate is a disgrace. Moderate your page.
Biden choosing Kamala for VP means two things: 1. He’s targeting the woman vote b/c he knows the rape allegations against him will soon come to fruition.  2. He’s targeting minority vote because he’s a liberal &amp; CAREER liberals take marginalized communities &amp; further marginalize.
I'm so happy biden picked harris im ordering my biden harris 2020 sign asap
Didn’t  call Biden a racist and say she believes his rape accusers??? Interesting choice
Joe Biden had a number of Midwest options for VP. Ultimately he chose a liberal career politician from California. Who’s standing up for our Midwest values? The #GOP team is committed to protecting what’s most important to maintaining our quality of life in America’s heartland.
Senator Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s VP nominee. Let’s get to work!
Only in the fucked up politics of the US are Biden and Harris considered left. In every other democracy of the world they are CENTER RIGHT politicians. Try expanding your knowledge a little bit and stop swallowing what a fascist party wants you to believe.
Biden is a TURRIBLE pick.  But Better than Trump

Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden’s mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!
Donald Fucking Trump, I will be glad when you are dead and gone! You are a worthless piece of shit! Joe Biden is going to kick your worthless ass!!!!  You are a sorry excuse for a human being!!!!!   When you die I will piss on your grave, maybe shit on your tombstone😂😅🤣🕷☠️💀
The Democratic Party has an embarassment of riches. I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what. All of the women floated as potential VP picks are outstanding. ❤️
Shapiro did a whole show on Covid, shreds Trump regularly, and says Biden should keep doing what he’s doing. Questioning his competence is out of line? This is a lie just like everything else said about Shapiro.
Biden: Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.
I'm not voting against donald. I am voting for Joe Biden because I value all life. I value the rule of law.  I value our constitution and I value myself.  Btw, there are no Republicans in congress.  There are no Republicans in the White House either.
Hillary was a dumpster fire. Biden’s better but my post was more or less saying that Polls don’t matter. At all really. It’s happened before and overconfidence is a dangerous game.
People like her turn a blind eye to Biden’s racist past and his inappropriateness with little girls. Orange man bad!! Love to know how Trump supports racism...I’ll wait.
Gonna be real weird when Kamala starts trending and everyone thinks Biden’s chosen his running mate.

#WashWeekPBS: Joe Biden nears a decision on his vice presidential pick  via
It has come to my attention that the Biden campaign is using the slogan “Build Back Better.” As a person who over-relies on alliteration in my own article titles, I generally like it, but I feel sad that they didn’t use what I consider to be his signature word: Malarkey.
Do you want to know what Biden stands for?? Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.

I just about had enough of the DNC. Can't wait to keep on destroying them by helping to fund progressive primary challenges of Neolib incumbents.   Special note: My anger doesn't mean I won't vote for Dementia Joe Biden because Trump is an insane maniac that needs to be in prison
Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It’s insane that Biden’s bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.
JOE  BIDEN  needs your help. The United States Needs Your Help.
Rates have nothing to do with the ACA. Republicans refuse to cap premiums.   Trump cannot get rid of the ACA and then Rename it as Trumpcare. He is such a total insecure loser.  FYI - I'm not a fan of Barack Obama, Joe Biden or any Repub or Dem. I don't like either party.
Joe Biden should pick Lori Lightfoot as his VP so she can just yell at us and shame us into making better decisions.

Joe Biden's dangerous liberal agenda would upset god and bring a plague upon the earth. And you are helping it CNN so shame on you.
That's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump’s behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
When Joe Biden loses in a landside and the Black vote for Trump is 90%, I wonder what their excuse will be
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don’t have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
I am with you but Biden will make it even harder for me to vote for him if he picks Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I might have to get drunk and stoned before I fill out my ballot if they are on it.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO IT
Obama fucked up by not endorsing AOC. I don't think I can vote for Biden now. I am totally over these neo-lib corporate class Democrats.

Aw crap. I didn't even know this was possible. If Biden stops talking in public, he's going to get elected, and then we're screwed. I'll miss God and the Bible. And guns... wait, does this count airsoft?
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden as long as his VP isn't Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I don't care what anyone thinks of me because of my refusal to vote for Biden if he picks either of those two women.

Oh trust me... I have never said any candidate is non flawed!! But if any other politician had said what Biden has over the last few days .. it would be headlines ... but it’s crickets
Oh and I am sure that Biden personally wrote the tweet or even told someone what to write!! Really? You heard this interview didn’t you? You heard his tone ? And how he spoke to the reporter ? We have a President who speaks for himself and owns it!! #CheckItOut
Ummmm you actually believe that Biden copped to this ??? Now that’s funny!! And because you believe it... you are part the problem!! SMH
If Biden is faking his dementia. how does he get his eyes to appear dead, zombie-like?  Are you saying he faked his two brain aneurysms also?
So, according to Mr Bunder Biden, ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE SAME! No diversity exists among them? It wasn’t long ago he touted this insult:”If you ain’t black you ain’t voting Democrat”.
Where does he go after this with his smears? What’s worse than God hates Biden?
How does he escalate this? Biden can blow up the planet with just one look?
But don’t tell us what Biden said about Blacks this morning.  Probably not important to you but maybe to a lot of blacksDo you want a president who spends his time tweeting or golfing or holding press conferences which actually are a campaign rally...or would you like a president who is empathetic, engaged in the good of the country and focused...vote Biden. You may just need some help..

If young people actually voted Bernie would have won in 2016 and we would have Medicare for ALL and free college and this pandemic wouldn’t be kick this country’s butt like it is right now so if you didnt want Biden or Hillary the time to vote was January
That makes no sense.   If you would rather have a racist, misogynistic, inept criminal who is murdering 1,000 Americans every day with his incompetence in the White House than Biden and Harris, then I feel very sad for you and for our country.

Dear Sir, I'm a democrat n wanted to  mail in my vote for Biden/Harris, but will go vote at the polls since you've rigged the post office system.
when Obama...O I mean Biden squints his eyes raises his chin and gives his best presidential gaze of fortitude just doesn’t drive the momentum that Trump gets with some off the wall bizarre rant Obama...oops I mean Biden has noooo energy
That's your takeaway? Did you even hear the very real audio of Biden?
presidential elections are always about a symbol a statement momentum Biden literally represents someone else’s symbol someone else’s vision and it’s a black guy how ironic a white guy taking credit for a black man’s accomplishments Biden is a fraud
Whatever “racial gaffe” Biden made pales in comparison to  decision to attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa with no mask and no social distancing
Joe Biden or Donald Trump vs "Titan" or "Gemini" would liven things up this coming political season to be sure
Of course they will. Joe Biden would force them all off their land
As a born and raised Buckeye, the smartest thing that Democrats can do is to nonstop connect Trump’s handling of the Coronavirus to the loss of OSU football. That will guarantee a win for the Biden Harris ticket.
He goes even lower by accusing her of ignoring the debunked false charges against Biden. (The fact he would go THERE blows my mind!)
The Oval Office occupier accused  of treating  badly during the contest for the Nomination. He claims she "mocked" VP Biden. He is trying to tear her down by throwing around accusations about what her policies will be.
The fact they keep saying we can push Biden/Harris farther left afterwards is absolutely childlike naivety, and really quite insulting, as if the Democratic Party hasn't been telling progressives to fuck off for 4 years.
I completely agree with you Sam. The only rational thing to do is vote for Biden. That being said I think there are a good amount of actual criticisms one can make against Biden and Kamala, but I’m still voting for them.
What? You chose Biden, that has to tell you how insane this statement is.
The way you phrased it seemed like you were you blaming people who aren’t involved in politics for the ticket. Any democrat with half a brain is going to vote for Biden. I assumed you were talking about people not being actively involved and not just like people tweeting lol
After the "If you don't vote for me, you ain't black!" comment, Joe Biden goes full "I'm not racist, I have a Black Friend!" for his VP pick.  Raise your hand if you saw this coming... 😒
Yea, drain the swamp. Vote Biden.
I am beyond grateful to the  campaign for affording me the privilege of working, and representing this campaign during the Iowa Caucus. My role going forward may not be needed as much as before, but one thing that’s for certain is Biden/Harris has my vote &amp; full support.
Very confused. I thought there was nothing wrong with Joe Biden 😂😂😂

One: Being better than the nazi candidates is a VERY low bar to meet  Two: There were far more options than just senators.   Biden's biggest weakness is his stance on progressive issues, and he picked the least progressive running mate of the ones being vetted

Reporters were stationed outside Biden's house (and I think Bayh's house) and there were minute by minute updates on what they were doing in their personal lives.
I am amazed at the response of voters in my state of Iowa. Every week I pass by a house of a person who has always been a staunch Republican. Their yards are always plastered with R. Yard signs. Yesterday I drove by, and saw a United for Biden sign. ❤️ America is ready for change

Yeah. Take away the left part of the “center” button and that’s a lot closer to actual Biden
I’d actually consider voting for a democrat not named joe Biden, I’m legitametly concerned about how he can’t say a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about
The people that don’t want the debate know that Trump will make more of a clown out of Biden.  If you can’t see that then you’re a clown ur self.
I need to be clear on the fact that nothing will have me vote for trump. If Biden come out and say “NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA” I just won’t vote at all. MAGA idiots think everytime Biden fuck up it’s a vote for their overlord
