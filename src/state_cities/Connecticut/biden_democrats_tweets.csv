Biden's entire Senate career was defined by support for conservative causes like opposition to bussing, cutting social security, balanced budget, harsh penal system, Patriot Act.   FDR was nothing like that. He had what used to called a sense of noblesse oblige. FWIW.

I wish Michelle Obama would just surprisingly Pop on stage and say she was running with Biden

Biden is creepy. But I'd vote for mickey mouse at this point. Anyone but trump.

People better do there homework on Biden because he locked millions of black men up when he was in office

Yes, anybody who criticizes Biden MUST be a "secret Trumpster." That is literally how it works. Biden must never, ever.... EVER be criticized under any circumstances!!! Even if he was to walk down the street and murder 50 ppl, we must not criticize, or it means we are Trumpsters.
Exactly. Plus the worse biden has ever done in his life is probably no way even close to what trump does daily. And pulling the hunter biden thread isn't wise when trump has his 3 stooges +1. Dems may not want to throw feces but plenty of never trumpers would gladly step up.

Lincoln Project co-founder says if Trump loses he‚Äôll ditch Biden‚Äôs inauguration and regard it as ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô
Was just saying this yesterday--though I *do* think the govt needs to take some enforcement steps, I'm not sure "Dems/Biden want to break up big tech" is a good message for marginal/moderate voters to hear with Nov approaching. (Just wait until after the election right?)
eulogy and talk that I have heard from you. We really need you on the campaign trail to be sure that Biden wins this presidency. I am so afraid that something is going to happen to prevent this election. I want to do everything humanly possible to win
Is it cynical to say a 1/3 of America wouldn't mind if Covid-19 wiped out the other 2/3? Perhaps. I think it's important, however, to recognize that Biden's election won't end the "long national nightmare," as George Will said. To do that, we must change the electorate. THREAD
1. The Post‚Äôs George Will gave voice to an opinion I‚Äôve heard a lot lately‚ÄîJoe Biden‚Äôs victory over the president would mark the end of our ‚Äúlong national nightmare.‚Äù
No, Biden‚Äôs election won't end the nightmare by
The Peter principle is real.
RUSH: Politico yesterday ran a story claiming that Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick. And then they scrubbed the piece. They scrubbed the story. Now, how does this happen?
And from a purely materialist point of view, I find it very hard to believe that capitalists are going to be willing to countenance a coup in the middle of a pandemic just to keep Joe Biden out of office.
a Biden moment?
‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can‚Äôt be held,‚Äù Biden said, according to a pool report of an online campaign event. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only way he thinks he can possibly win.‚Äù ‚Äî Seems vindicated, no?
Who will serve as a democratic check on Trump? i) Republicans who will vote for Biden instead of Trump (vote-switching); ii) Democrats who will turn out for Biden instead of abstaining (backlash); iii) Republicans who will abstain instead turning out for Trump (disenchantment).
This "opinion" by  does not age wellü§™
Biden called it in April.
Meanwhile, your ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù is to tell voters that they can‚Äôt have the things that they want, and expect them to vote for you anyway. What‚Äôs to stop Trump from offering those same things in order to win the election? You‚Äôre not very good at this, are you? #Biden
2020 polls: Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
We are about to experience a depression we haven‚Äôt seen in almost a century, millions have no jobs, millions lost their healthcare, mind you, during a fucking pandemic, and what does he do? Yells vote for biden over  and over again. There is no left in this country.
Yeah I supported him, but so what. Bernie Sanders is a freaking weak little ghost of the man he was or we thought he was. He should be calling out joe Biden daily, and calling out Pelosi and Schumer daily .... for giving us nothing we the people want and for failing during corona
Democratic leadership: *** votes down Medicare for all **                                          Bernie Sanders: hewoo pwease vote for biden he is da most pwogwessive puhson to wun In da histowee of amehwiccah ***bwink bwink***
What the actual f.
Like I get it, Biden is pretty bad and the lesser of two evils is not a moral argument, but this mo‚Äôfucka just has gotta go. The way he others whole communities is outrageous.
Hmm.  So a person with ambition shouldn't be VP?  It's hard for me to believe that anyone would say this about a man.  At all.  Did anyone say this about Biden? Who...ran for President in 1988 and 2008?
Again you can insult all you want or hurl names but you can‚Äôt even construct an argument. Democrats are not Marxist‚Äôs. They‚Äôre just not. Democrats are political correct and some are SJW but this is not the same at Marxist. Biden is the architect of mass incarceration lol
Imagine thinking biden is going to do left wing things when he doesn‚Äôt want to legalize marijuana or enact Medicare for all Two **checks notes** CENTRISTS things since the MAJORITY of the country wants them. But yeah here comes antifa joe LMAOO
To get the ‚Äòthoughtcrime‚Äô reading out of what Biden said, you gotta really *want* to get it. That‚Äôs kind of my point.
That Gorsuchian reading of the quotation aside, it‚Äôs just so clear in context that what Biden is actually saying is, ‚Äúif you destroy stuff or light stuff on fire that isn‚Äôt yours, that‚Äôs bad‚Äù‚Äînot, ‚Äúwe should arrest people based on what books they own.‚Äù
more Biden- with a nurse?
No, it‚Äôs disheartening how many people are pretending to believe that Biden was truly saying ‚Äúthinking about anarchist principles without any illegal actions is thoughtcrime,‚Äù when obviously he wasn‚Äôt.
I will vote Biden just because even if he not my best choice he is better then u u think cause u give a couple dollars to the people u are gonna when votes üó≥ wrong thank you but no thank you
You are the person in America you‚Äôre the most racist person you are not fit to be the leader of the people your trying to start a race war a vote for Biden is a vote for hope cause with you in power we are DONE. Out with Trump
Whilst Minnesota has seen a tad more polling, with three in the last month, the latest poll from  only has Biden up three points, down from seven points in the corresponding survey in May. 2/n
Both Nevada and Minnesota remain relatively under-polled,  with the former having seen only one poll in  database since Biden became the presumptive nominee, and could blindside Democrats come November. 1/n
What if we all just unfollowed joe biden on social media, refused to interact with anything he posted, promised not to vote for him until he had a Medicare for all plan as a part of his campaign?
‚ÄòThis is health care moonshot time‚Äô: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left
NOPE...THAT IS BIDEN WITH THE COGNITIVE DECLINE! Hmmm where is Stormy Daniels &amp; her great attorney today? ü§î Is Michael Avenatti still in prison? What a farce that was!! Biden Likes little kids rubbing the hair down on his legs and jumping on his lap...his words! ü§Æ
Wel right, but an ideologue doesn‚Äôt tend to invite people who disagree with him onto his councils and then move towards their positions.   Like I said, if Biden were motivated by ‚Äúmoderateness‚Äù above all, he‚Äôd have said ‚ÄúI won, you lost, go away.‚Äù But he didn‚Äôt.
I guess I‚Äôm just not following what we‚Äôre talking about anymore.   ‚ÄúBiden is acting like a party leader, not just an ideologue.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually, the reason cops are disappearing people under Trump is because Biden said protest is good and arson is bad.‚Äù  Huh?
Biden says he'll name a running mate next week - Axios
This is the argument that Trump is making. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs America is horrible, and it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault!‚Äù Super weird.
You‚Äôre having a different argument. You have reasons not to like Biden, which, like, fine‚Äîso do I. But they‚Äôre sort of not relevant to the point you‚Äôre responding to, which is just that Biden acts like a party leader.
Alright. This doesnt prove he has dementia because he hasn't come out with any cognitive results, but this video shows that he is exhibiting clear signs of dementia. Watch this:
In my original reply, I never said that Joe Biden 100% has dementia. I was making of fun of him because he has been showing signs of cognitive decline and dementia. There is no solid proof that he has dementia, but I believe that he does have it due to the symptoms that he has
There's clearly something wrong with him mentally though. Why do you keep denying it? Are you a Joe Biden supporter?
Let‚Äôs get Tlaib up outta there!  ‚Å¶ !
This just seems like a bad-faith reading of Biden‚Äôs comment (that doesn‚Äôt actually intersect with my original tweet at all). Biden‚Äôs point, pretty clearly, is: ‚ÄúPeaceful protest is good, violence and arson are bad, and presidents shouldn‚Äôt have goon squads.‚Äù Uncontroversial.
Guess this means Biden will win ME-2
No, it‚Äôs a question. You mentioned anarchy not being a crime, so again the question: do you, with 100% sincerity, believe that Biden is saying anarchist principles are punishable thoughtcrime?
In all seriousness, just to know which conversation we‚Äôre having here, do you in 100% sincerity believe that Biden is saying ‚Äúanarchist principles are thoughtcrime, regardless of actions‚Äù?
Joe Biden will announce who his VP will be next week.
How that headline should have read: EXCLUSIVE: Atlanta Biden voters Embedded Nails into Fireworks, Leaked FBI Document States
You just might be IF she is Biden‚Äòs running mate! Whoever his VP is will be the new president if God forbid Biden is elected! Let‚Äôs face it he can‚Äôt put too letters together to form a word yet complete a freakin‚Äô sentence! You know you know...that thing!!
Again, Biden acting not like a moderate ideologue but as a party leader.

Important. Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy.
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
On Middle East Policy, on health care, on the military - the DNC under Biden looks to be shaping up as an epic neo-liberal war mongering disaster.
Also, I never resorted to chilidish insults. All I said was that you must live under a rock if you don't know that Joe Biden isn't all there in the head. It has trended a lot. It has been covered in the news. There are memes and jokes everywhere. Not my fault you weren't paying
It isn't my job to prove myself to you. You chose to reply to my tweet. I was going to ignore you, but I replied because you asked me to prove something that has already been proven. I thought it was hilarious. You are one of the very few that doesn't know that Biden is unfit
The "protesters" are "Joe Biden Voters" which he cannot deny....
Lets agree to call them who they are "JBVs" or Joe Biden Voters - lets put the hook in the DNC for all this.
Joe Biden Voters get violent? go on
Lets agree to call them 'Joe Biden Voters' (JBVs) instead of protesters, no sense missing an opportunity to piss off a democrat.
Conversely, Symone Sanders was probably the Biden campaign's single best hire.
This is so incredibly petty, childish, and crude.   Can you imagine any other chair of a losing Democratic campaign making condemning the Democratic nominee for President in such vulgar terms? 98 days before Election Day?
Lets all change the narrative- don't say "rioters" use "Joe Biden voters" let the DNC handle that.
Lets call them by their rightful name- JBvs - Joe Biden Voters.
Lets call her by the rightful name- JBv - Joe Biden Voter.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
It's not up to anybody else to educate you on something like this. It is up to you to look into these things yoursslf. It is common sense that Joe Biden is very forgetful. You must live under a rock. Try paying attention and keeping yourself updated.
Really? The women that came out against Biden of course were all liars...is that what you‚Äôre saying? Quite a few Women came out against him this past year &amp; they were brushed under the rug because Democrats don‚Äôt want to hear anything against another Democrat! That‚Äôs the Truth!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Earnest Q: how possible is it that Biden is ‚Äúmoving left‚Äù w/ Task Forces primarily cuz he‚Äôs more afraid of Bernie voters not turning out, than he is of winning swing voters or suburban voters?   We should have more skepticism before assume this is his actual governing agenda.
Democrats that spend all their free time bashing Biden on twitter, we have no other option. It‚Äôs him or Trump. STFU.  Just go vote Biden.

My read as well: Dodd is Biden's Falstaff.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
I will say, I would appreciate Biden more if he picks Harris after Dodd came out against her -- Biden needs to repudiate Dodd's corruption and coziness with the banks -- and, frankly, this is a good way of doing it without going with Warren.   1/
I do not believe any polling. If you want to defeat Trump in Nov. ‚Äî VOTE!   Doesn‚Äôt matter what state you‚Äôre in. Do not leave it to others. Biden needs to win electoral college decisively and crush him in the popular vote.
Biden would do well to take Dodd's recommendations and do the opposite: they guy is as bad for Biden as Rev. Wright  was for Obama.  2/
I have to say, Chris Dodd's reappearance has the uncomfortable impact of reminding me that  got his reputation as (D-MBNA), the senator for MBNA bank.    There are a lot of things I respect about Biden, but his cooperations with Dodd generally went the wrong way.  1/

A Public Option would be cheaper too.   But unlike Bernie's Medicare For All bill - which doesn't even include a funding mechanism - a Public Option can actually pass the Senate in 2021.   This is why Democratic voters voted for Biden, because we want real solutions, not slogans.
If Trump wins it won‚Äôt be because of Kanye taking votes from Biden. It‚Äôll be because the left cancels everyone the moment they don‚Äôt fit their exact political views and conservatives stick with Trump even when they don‚Äôt completely agree with him
I‚Äôm voting for Biden in November too.  His VP pick determines whether my wallet is open or closed.
Will Biden - can Biden - get in the muck and mire when debating Trump? Will he "go there" if needed? Cause you know Trump will - we've seen it
And if Democrats take back the Senate, and pass ACA 2.0 with a Public Option, and President Biden signs it into law, one day in 2022 both me and Briahna Joy Gray will be able to buy into Medicare.   This is what Normie Democrats want, Medicare as Public Option.

if you're trying to frame me as a defender of the status quo, you're being grossly dishonest. I'm very much a critic of the health insurance market as it presently exists.   And that's why I'm voting for a candidate who wants to transform it.
Biden said he would announce his VP selection around 8/1.  So maybe another week or so?
Biden like so many others were misled by another POTUS about WMD in Iraq, but they believed back them, they has no reasons not to believe, we were attacked. Sadly afterwards the truth came out... but it was to late.

‚ÄúPoor kids are just as smart as white kids‚Äù. -Joe Biden
Good. Shes not a gutless Biden lover.
Many of the leaks and articles about Harris have really not shown the Biden camp in a good light. The implications that Harris wasn't allowed to fully compete or hasn't shown enough deference come off as sexist to me too.   I'm surprised Biden hasn't shut this down.
This is not a good look for Biden
All the frantic anti-Harris leaks and articles of the last three days has made me think Biden has either settled on her or is very nearly there
You sound desperate. Almost pleading.   Is it because Biden is ahead of you in the polls IN TEXAS?
No it's not! What until Biden get in. That's what you'll get.
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong. The video seems ok and yesterday he answered all the questions asked by the reporters in a very intelligent way. This is trump campaign‚Äôs strategy. Sleepy Joe, Hunter etc didn‚Äôt stick. They invent new ways to discredit Biden #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

How can anyone vote for Biden after that deplorable display of desperation by the Dems at the Hearing of Barr
brought up a great point regarding Bidens poll numbers: why isn't he up by 50 instead of 9? Why was Biden ahead by 5 points back in February when things were good? Bottom line: dont trust polls.
150K w/Cuomo &amp; other dems forcing nursing homes to accept Covid+ w/boats Trump sent unused &amp; the mobs of anarchist Marxist Biden supporters clearly spreading Covid, assaulting/murdering business owners police Trump supporters&amp; many others, arson, looting, destroying. Biden rapist
no assaults, arson, looting, murder, or spreading Covid much unlike the Marxist anarchist mobs of Biden supporters in several dem cities. Rapist dementia ridden Biden"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean &amp; you aint black if you vote Trump"
Indeed.The evil deeds committed by Obama run govt, that DC swamp mindset is sick &amp; surely w/start back up w/Biden win. Nadler was more concerned w/Trump ads than federal property/workers.This mindset is corrosive to the US &amp; in turn the world. Russia, China &amp; Iran love it though.
The democrats/Soros/MSM/etc. are emboldening the anarchist Marxist Biden supporting cancel mobs as the mayhem could hurt Trump. The endless assaults of police, business owners &amp; workers, &amp; innocent civilians are merely collateral damage. Sick ideology will divide &amp; re-elect Trump
appropriate due to anarchist mobs of Biden supporters assaulting police &amp;stopping/damaging NYPD marked cars. The minivan has a far larger and more comfortable back seat. "nobody is above the law". pre-op TS clearly needs mental help with living on the street spreading Wuhan virus
#Trump2020  Rapist dementia ridden proven racist Biden has groped so many little prepubescent and other girls/women over the years. Biden-‚Äúthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy‚Äù &amp; "you ain't black if you vote Trump".
this type evil rhetoric from left is assuring a Trump 2020 over dementia ridden flip flop rapist Biden. The cancel mob of anarchists (Biden supporters) much like the Russia hoax are also helping the independents and minorities make an easier choice in Trump. Keep it up though.

Biden just lost a whole bunch of anarcho-liberal votes
The notes on Harris, who is a vice presidential contender, may be in response to a seminal moment in the first presidential primary debate last year.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. He might as well pick his nose. #Hannity
You have them confused with Nina Turner. With friends like her, Dems have it made. Remember it was the voters who chose Biden, not a deep state conspiracy.

Absolutely  I will remember on Nov 3rd pulling the lever for Joe Biden and screaming Fuck you Trump!!!!
Lol  Biden calls for violent protesters to be 'found, arrested and tried'
It's actually  Biden isn't the president yet
Fox is not admitting the collusion between the press &amp; .Biden. For Biden to win, he‚Äôll need a Watergate!
doesn‚Äôt Fox realize Biden colluded with the press. He,pathetically, had a list of reporters 2 call
Even more pathetic than the AG hearing was Biden‚Äôs press conference. Press collusion with Biden.
THIS ANTI AMERICAN ATTACK ON OUR WHOLE SYSTEM MUST END.  BIDEN IS CRAAZY !! OOOPS HE JUST LOST HIS MIND. THIS IS PATHETTIC TV.
It is absolutely paramount that Biden's team keeps him in the basement as much as possible before November
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Joe Biden
Ya no way Biden carries ME-2, or keeps it even, and she holds on.
Between she , Biden and the rest of the Dems . No brain is firing on all cylinders  !!!!!!
The House Dems are trying the Biden technique. They‚Äôre not letting Barr talk or he‚Äôll make them look stupid. So glad I #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
We‚Äôll get something similar in November unfortunately. Biden gets the popular, Trump the college.

Next year? We need to defeat Biden and Trump *this* November!
I would think Chris Dodd wouldn't speak that openly about the VP vetting process without permission from the campaign. If that is not the case, that is a bad look for the Biden camp in another way.
Preach üôå...when has a VP selection ever mattered? Can't wait for Biden to give the White House back to Wall Street like his former boss did!
These are some of the worst state polls Biden has gotten recently and represent an EC wipeout
I am not even a Kamala Stan but it read that way to me to. Biden should not have let that man go talk to Politico like that.  And CT politicians need to learn to STFU when they leave office. They are gone for a reason
Rapist Biden clearly has dementia and the middle road flip-flop dem was so easily hijacked by the Marxist/Socialists. Biden is even making HRC look good now. Trump is a big guy and has some belly fat as does most of the US even HRC
Both Mike Pence and Joe Biden are expected to visit the late congressman as he lies in state.  # via  Pres. Trump always declines to do things before its made public that he was never invited.
While I don‚Äôt believe this, there is no reference, nothing to tell us where we might confirm its existence, it is 43 years ago. I‚Äôll give benefit of the doubt and say it‚Äôs legit. Biden has changed since then, acquiring wisdom with age. I dare you to tell me the same about Trump.
Brandon Judd: Joe Biden‚Äôs Support for the Defund Police Movement Will Hurt Arizonans
I like Harris - and I think Dodd made a fair statement. Harris went after Biden in the debate. Whether that's politics, is fine. The article wasn't about more than one Dodd reaction, before concentrating on the candidates. I didn't read it your way, at all. Pretty sensitive, no?
Mr. President, I know exactly what you‚Äôre saying! I defended you then I had to delete and block all these morons that were buying any fans! Joe Biden can‚Äôt put one sentence together! He‚Äôs not capable of being our president! You are The President.
That's also not really a strength of Kennedy's. Maintaining multiple homes is easy to do when you inherit several and have access to an unending stream of cash.   It's not the same as Biden taking the train home to Delaware every night even though he tried to play it that way
Omg üò≥. But those bailouts tho??? I might have to delete my Twitter bc it really just makes me sad to know what is going on. And I don‚Äôt trust the corona numbers anymore, now that he won‚Äôt have them sent to the CDC. It‚Äôs a scary scary time, praying for Biden to win.
Yes, america is so racist that millions of POC flock here and find any way they can to get in...to live in a racist hell hole.  Sure, that sounds right.    and also, you think racist joe biden can fix it lol
All of the  gang members and cult followers are in full effect today...no policies or plans...hating Trump is not a strategy. Biden will just hand the White House back to his wall street buddies. Nothing will change but at least you liberals will feel good inside!
Is anyone surprised by Biden‚Äôs refusal to be interviewed by Wallace. Biden is weak physically &amp; mentally!
You can be a debbie downer or think positively and work to elect Biden. I choose the former
I am guessing this does not represent Biden‚Äôs thinking but rather someone advocating for another VP nominee.  I still go with Harris
I think an Electoral vote total for Biden of around 350 will work just fine
tho that story's probably the reason he's on Biden's VP committee

There is a direct line between the version of the suburbs Biden and others advocated for, one that's free from the troublemaking minorities in the city, and what Trump tried to invoke with tweets about (ironically Biden) "destroying" the suburbs by promoting integration.
This smells a little like Trump demanding Romney apologize to him during the Secretary of State vetting.  Not a great look for Biden or his team. Kamala was running against him, and everything she said was true, even if Biden thought it was unfair framing
No. He‚Äôs gonna pitch. Right after he shows his tax returns &amp; debates Biden.

Oh, right...that one tweet destroyed america,   bidens are very divisive too  It's funny how politicians who have been in office for 30 to 40 years, like biden and pelosi blame a guy who has been in for 3 years.  also, you didn't answer me as to which state rights he has violated

According to the Tax Foundation...Model, Biden‚Äôs tax plan would reduce the economy‚Äôs size by 1.51 percent in the long run. The plan would shrink the capital stock by 3.23 percent and reduce the overall wage rate by 0.98 percent, leading to 585k fewer full-time equivalent jobs.
And the fact that the dems are beholden to china.  Trump at least puts their feet to the fire.  With biden, we are chinas country.
Biden's plans will be about $10 trillion btw
Biden‚Äôs tax increases would up taxes on middle-class families by over $2k/year, with a $1.3k annual tax increase on a median-income, single parent with one child. Repealing Trump‚Äôs tax reform will cut in 1/2 the child tax crdt and strd deduction, which help lower-income the most.
President Trump is man for job  I stand by me 100%. God-bless America and God-bless Donald Trump. And Mr. Biden should resign because of his problems the Democratic Party is using me. The clintons Obamma and other people in a Democratic Party and CNN is no good.
Honesty and decency.... let‚Äôs pump the breaks a little bit. Less rapey, sure. The only motivation I have to vote Biden is to get spray tanned raccoon eyes the fuck out of here.
&amp; we can only imagine what the establishment DC swamp/Soros/HRC/MSM honchos/Dems/Obama regime gov agency leftovers have in store this time. Perhaps a Biden bombshell is needed to sway independents/women/minorities/young. The swamp's traitorous acts are becoming worrisome. #Trump
Government Of The US‚Äôs Biggest Ally Is Reportedly "Desperate" For Trump To Lose The Election To Joe Biden  via    Trump losing support by a large margin across the World,this may be due to the continued Chaos in the U.S. and the Middle East.
Biden also mostly pulled from lower income households when he won.   Wealthy liberals mostly went for Warren, Pete, Amy.  As you can see, the split doesn't seem to be ideological so much as stylistic
Buried lede in here is Biden winning on the question "Who would keep Americans safe?" with women in all three states. Trump has made that the central pillar of his re-election message since the bottom fell out of the economic argument.
LOL #TRUMP2020 for re-election &amp; to keep draining the democratic DC swamp. The Marxist cancel mob hijacked rapist Biden who clearly has dementia. The majority of the US wants law and order not mobs of terrorists asserting mob justice. Many blacks voting #Trump.

This sums it up quite nicely.  Or as Biden says - We have a chance to transform America!

And no small thing: Biden was on the 2012 ticket. So they were mainly voting for Barack, but they were also partly voting for Joe. And when they vote for him now, they‚Äôre also partly voting for Obama. Not just party line version, reverting to voting for the same ticket a bit.

The first half of this is good/damning, but the 'Biden Plan' is pretty thin; 'accelerate the development of vaccines' is maybe setting him up to claim credit for a subsequent vaccine but it's not something either of them would actually have that much to do with.

America is already 244 years old. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden have been in government for more than half that time (150 years).  If things are so terrible, 149 years seems like a long time to spend planning a new direction.
Donald - thats BS and you know it. Your father‚Äôs tax cut went 85% to the very rich. Joe Biden will NOT raise taxes on working class people like this video. In fact, he will give them at least as much tax cut as your dad. He will raise taxes on the super rich no doubt about that.

Even if off a few decimals either way, why do we have a President who is making decisions about the livelihood and well being of the People based on righting his own sinking financial ship?  Is Biden or has any other Prez/candidate ever looked at the Presidency quite this way?
But this is why Biden was the safe ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù choice. He doesn‚Äôt make anyone face any uncomfortable truths they aren‚Äôt willing to see... because he doesn‚Äôt see them either.
Do you share my fear that Trump will try to use DHS and rogue elements of our armed forces to seize control of the government when he loses the election to Biden?
I have never been so excited to cast a ballot as I am for Joe Biden and he wasn't even in my top five choices from the field of candidates.
can you see that Biden is impaired?
Looking at the chart, the 2 groups in which Biden has the biggest lead are with the younger generations.  The problem is that often they have preferences but do not vote. We need to get out the youth vote!!

What is Trump doing to keep us safe? Here‚Äôs his plan for Covid - Do less testing &amp; it will magically disappear. Here‚Äôs his plan for re-opening schools - Most children will not die. Here‚Äôs his plan for investigating Hunter Biden - Unlimited time &amp; resources to be spent to get dirt
Trump is the President.  This is his mess.  Don‚Äôt even try to pin this on Biden.  You look like a fool.
I miss my President.  I am looking forward to my next one, President Biden.
The people that support this person reply with LOL DIMENTIA every time Biden says something. I mean.
If the virus wasn't scary enough, the federal troops that trump is sending into the streets is also terrifying. I live in a small city in CT and I doubt they are coming to my town, but I'm thinking of the big picture and the election and how badly we need Joe Biden to win.
Yo‚Äîthis is actual footage of the situation of TRUMP‚Äôs America. Biden not the current Pres:  this is what Trump is responsibke for. Loser!

Well, Nixon didn‚Äôt, though he should have. But Trump‚Äôs crimes are legion and far worse. At least Nixon never sold us out to Russia. Of course Nixon was pardoned by Ford, a Republican. I doubt Biden would be so generous. At least I hope not.

Was just saying this yesterday--though I *do* think the govt needs to take some enforcement steps, I'm not sure "Dems/Biden want to break up big tech" is a good message for marginal/moderate voters to hear with Nov approaching. (Just wait until after the election right?)
eulogy and talk that I have heard from you. We really need you on the campaign trail to be sure that Biden wins this presidency. I am so afraid that something is going to happen to prevent this election. I want to do everything humanly possible to win
Is it cynical to say a 1/3 of America wouldn't mind if Covid-19 wiped out the other 2/3? Perhaps. I think it's important, however, to recognize that Biden's election won't end the "long national nightmare," as George Will said. To do that, we must change the electorate. THREAD
1. The Post‚Äôs George Will gave voice to an opinion I‚Äôve heard a lot lately‚ÄîJoe Biden‚Äôs victory over the president would mark the end of our ‚Äúlong national nightmare.‚Äù

RUSH: Politico yesterday ran a story claiming that Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick. And then they scrubbed the piece. They scrubbed the story. Now, how does this happen?
And from a purely materialist point of view, I find it very hard to believe that capitalists are going to be willing to countenance a coup in the middle of a pandemic just to keep Joe Biden out of office.
a Biden moment?
‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can‚Äôt be held,‚Äù Biden said, according to a pool report of an online campaign event. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only way he thinks he can possibly win.‚Äù ‚Äî Seems vindicated, no?
its the ruling class vs the people .. same shit happend under Obama/Biden .. we live under an oligarchy not a democracy #UnitedCorporationsOfAmerica
Who will serve as a democratic check on Trump? i) Republicans who will vote for Biden instead of Trump (vote-switching); ii) Democrats who will turn out for Biden instead of abstaining (backlash); iii) Republicans who will abstain instead turning out for Trump (disenchantment).
This "opinion" by  does not age wellü§™

Biden has 7 million followers and Trump has 80 million followers yet the media states Biden will win this 2020 election. What do I not see in these numbers of votes vs followers? Am I seeing fraudulent support for the Demorats!
#Conservatives, Republicans, and white people are evil!  Segregation and reparations will be placed on these people! Karen Bass,a supporter of Castro , Farrakhan, Black Islam against whites &amp; Jews! A Biden VP pick!
Meanwhile, your ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù is to tell voters that they can‚Äôt have the things that they want, and expect them to vote for you anyway. What‚Äôs to stop Trump from offering those same things in order to win the election? You‚Äôre not very good at this, are you? #Biden
I wish. But they‚Äôve also called Biden and the Democrats Marxist-Leninist. Anyone to the left of Mitch McConnell is Marist-Leninist to them

We are about to experience a depression we haven‚Äôt seen in almost a century, millions have no jobs, millions lost their healthcare, mind you, during a fucking pandemic, and what does he do? Yells vote for biden over  and over again. There is no left in this country.
Yeah I supported him, but so what. Bernie Sanders is a freaking weak little ghost of the man he was or we thought he was. He should be calling out joe Biden daily, and calling out Pelosi and Schumer daily .... for giving us nothing we the people want and for failing during corona

Like I get it, Biden is pretty bad and the lesser of two evils is not a moral argument, but this mo‚Äôfucka just has gotta go. The way he others whole communities is outrageous.
Hmm.  So a person with ambition shouldn't be VP?  It's hard for me to believe that anyone would say this about a man.  At all.  Did anyone say this about Biden? Who...ran for President in 1988 and 2008?
Again you can insult all you want or hurl names but you can‚Äôt even construct an argument. Democrats are not Marxist‚Äôs. They‚Äôre just not. Democrats are political correct and some are SJW but this is not the same at Marxist. Biden is the architect of mass incarceration lol
Imagine thinking biden is going to do left wing things when he doesn‚Äôt want to legalize marijuana or enact Medicare for all Two **checks notes** CENTRISTS things since the MAJORITY of the country wants them. But yeah here comes antifa joe LMAOO
To get the ‚Äòthoughtcrime‚Äô reading out of what Biden said, you gotta really *want* to get it. That‚Äôs kind of my point.
That Gorsuchian reading of the quotation aside, it‚Äôs just so clear in context that what Biden is actually saying is, ‚Äúif you destroy stuff or light stuff on fire that isn‚Äôt yours, that‚Äôs bad‚Äù‚Äînot, ‚Äúwe should arrest people based on what books they own.‚Äù
Biden bringing nothing but fastballs
more Biden- with a nurse?
No, it‚Äôs disheartening how many people are pretending to believe that Biden was truly saying ‚Äúthinking about anarchist principles without any illegal actions is thoughtcrime,‚Äù when obviously he wasn‚Äôt.
Democrats love it when Trump speaks. Another thousand votes for Biden every time.
I will vote Biden just because even if he not my best choice he is better then u u think cause u give a couple dollars to the people u are gonna when votes üó≥ wrong thank you but no thank you
You are the person in America you‚Äôre the most racist person you are not fit to be the leader of the people your trying to start a race war a vote for Biden is a vote for hope cause with you in power we are DONE. Out with Trump
Whilst Minnesota has seen a tad more polling, with three in the last month, the latest poll from  only has Biden up three points, down from seven points in the corresponding survey in May. 2/n
Both Nevada and Minnesota remain relatively under-polled,  with the former having seen only one poll in  database since Biden became the presumptive nominee, and could blindside Democrats come November. 1/n
What if we all just unfollowed joe biden on social media, refused to interact with anything he posted, promised not to vote for him until he had a Medicare for all plan as a part of his campaign?

Wel right, but an ideologue doesn‚Äôt tend to invite people who disagree with him onto his councils and then move towards their positions.   Like I said, if Biden were motivated by ‚Äúmoderateness‚Äù above all, he‚Äôd have said ‚ÄúI won, you lost, go away.‚Äù But he didn‚Äôt.
I guess I‚Äôm just not following what we‚Äôre talking about anymore.   ‚ÄúBiden is acting like a party leader, not just an ideologue.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually, the reason cops are disappearing people under Trump is because Biden said protest is good and arson is bad.‚Äù  Huh?
Biden says he'll name a running mate next week - Axios
This is the argument that Trump is making. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs America is horrible, and it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault!‚Äù Super weird.
You‚Äôre having a different argument. You have reasons not to like Biden, which, like, fine‚Äîso do I. But they‚Äôre sort of not relevant to the point you‚Äôre responding to, which is just that Biden acts like a party leader.
Alright. This doesnt prove he has dementia because he hasn't come out with any cognitive results, but this video shows that he is exhibiting clear signs of dementia. Watch this:
In my original reply, I never said that Joe Biden 100% has dementia. I was making of fun of him because he has been showing signs of cognitive decline and dementia. There is no solid proof that he has dementia, but I believe that he does have it due to the symptoms that he has
There's clearly something wrong with him mentally though. Why do you keep denying it? Are you a Joe Biden supporter?
Let‚Äôs get Tlaib up outta there!  ‚Å¶ !
This just seems like a bad-faith reading of Biden‚Äôs comment (that doesn‚Äôt actually intersect with my original tweet at all). Biden‚Äôs point, pretty clearly, is: ‚ÄúPeaceful protest is good, violence and arson are bad, and presidents shouldn‚Äôt have goon squads.‚Äù Uncontroversial.
Guess this means Biden will win ME-2
No, it‚Äôs a question. You mentioned anarchy not being a crime, so again the question: do you, with 100% sincerity, believe that Biden is saying anarchist principles are punishable thoughtcrime?
The majority chose Bernie Sanders. The DNC Party Insiders installed #StatusQuoJoe. "Nothing will fundamentally change."  ~ Joe Biden
In all seriousness, just to know which conversation we‚Äôre having here, do you in 100% sincerity believe that Biden is saying ‚Äúanarchist principles are thoughtcrime, regardless of actions‚Äù?
Joe Biden will announce who his VP will be next week.

Again, Biden acting not like a moderate ideologue but as a party leader.

Important. Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy.
Real T, y‚Äôall got mad at Biden for saying ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote for Trump in 2020, when metaphorically, he‚Äôs not wrong. Y‚Äôall are just as blind as Clayton if y‚Äôall think voting for a white nationalist will help to improve your life.
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
On Middle East Policy, on health care, on the military - the DNC under Biden looks to be shaping up as an epic neo-liberal war mongering disaster.
Also, I never resorted to chilidish insults. All I said was that you must live under a rock if you don't know that Joe Biden isn't all there in the head. It has trended a lot. It has been covered in the news. There are memes and jokes everywhere. Not my fault you weren't paying
It isn't my job to prove myself to you. You chose to reply to my tweet. I was going to ignore you, but I replied because you asked me to prove something that has already been proven. I thought it was hilarious. You are one of the very few that doesn't know that Biden is unfit
The "protesters" are "Joe Biden Voters" which he cannot deny....
Lets agree to call them who they are "JBVs" or Joe Biden Voters - lets put the hook in the DNC for all this.
Joe Biden Voters get violent? go on
Lets agree to call them 'Joe Biden Voters' (JBVs) instead of protesters, no sense missing an opportunity to piss off a democrat.
Conversely, Symone Sanders was probably the Biden campaign's single best hire.
This is so incredibly petty, childish, and crude.   Can you imagine any other chair of a losing Democratic campaign making condemning the Democratic nominee for President in such vulgar terms? 98 days before Election Day?
Lets all change the narrative- don't say "rioters" use "Joe Biden voters" let the DNC handle that.
Lets call them by their rightful name- JBvs - Joe Biden Voters.
Lets call her by the rightful name- JBv - Joe Biden Voter.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
It's not up to anybody else to educate you on something like this. It is up to you to look into these things yoursslf. It is common sense that Joe Biden is very forgetful. You must live under a rock. Try paying attention and keeping yourself updated.
Really? The women that came out against Biden of course were all liars...is that what you‚Äôre saying? Quite a few Women came out against him this past year &amp; they were brushed under the rug because Democrats don‚Äôt want to hear anything against another Democrat! That‚Äôs the Truth!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Earnest Q: how possible is it that Biden is ‚Äúmoving left‚Äù w/ Task Forces primarily cuz he‚Äôs more afraid of Bernie voters not turning out, than he is of winning swing voters or suburban voters?   We should have more skepticism before assume this is his actual governing agenda.
Democrats that spend all their free time bashing Biden on twitter, we have no other option. It‚Äôs him or Trump. STFU.  Just go vote Biden.

Biden should agree to debate only if Trump (1) releases his tax returns and (2) presence of fact check panel to provide periodic impartial verification of candidates assertions.  Tom Friedman's proposal.
My read as well: Dodd is Biden's Falstaff.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
I will say, I would appreciate Biden more if he picks Harris after Dodd came out against her -- Biden needs to repudiate Dodd's corruption and coziness with the banks -- and, frankly, this is a good way of doing it without going with Warren.   1/
I do not believe any polling. If you want to defeat Trump in Nov. ‚Äî VOTE!   Doesn‚Äôt matter what state you‚Äôre in. Do not leave it to others. Biden needs to win electoral college decisively and crush him in the popular vote.
Biden would do well to take Dodd's recommendations and do the opposite: they guy is as bad for Biden as Rev. Wright  was for Obama.  2/
I have to say, Chris Dodd's reappearance has the uncomfortable impact of reminding me that  got his reputation as (D-MBNA), the senator for MBNA bank.    There are a lot of things I respect about Biden, but his cooperations with Dodd generally went the wrong way.  1/

A Public Option would be cheaper too.   But unlike Bernie's Medicare For All bill - which doesn't even include a funding mechanism - a Public Option can actually pass the Senate in 2021.   This is why Democratic voters voted for Biden, because we want real solutions, not slogans.
#Joe Biden will not allow School Choice for even the children in underperforming schools. Biden is bought &amp; paid for by these Corrupt Teacher Unions!
If Trump wins it won‚Äôt be because of Kanye taking votes from Biden. It‚Äôll be because the left cancels everyone the moment they don‚Äôt fit their exact political views and conservatives stick with Trump even when they don‚Äôt completely agree with him
I‚Äôm voting for Biden in November too.  His VP pick determines whether my wallet is open or closed.
Will Biden - can Biden - get in the muck and mire when debating Trump? Will he "go there" if needed? Cause you know Trump will - we've seen it
And if Democrats take back the Senate, and pass ACA 2.0 with a Public Option, and President Biden signs it into law, one day in 2022 both me and Briahna Joy Gray will be able to buy into Medicare.   This is what Normie Democrats want, Medicare as Public Option.
Trump: Biden wants to Defund the Police!  Trump: No Covid Bills unless Social Security is Defunded....   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Biden said he would announce his VP selection around 8/1.  So maybe another week or so?
Biden like so many others were misled by another POTUS about WMD in Iraq, but they believed back them, they has no reasons not to believe, we were attacked. Sadly afterwards the truth came out... but it was to late.

As far as I can tell, Biden's platform really only touches on improving commuter rail to the Suburbs, building more apartment-style housing and affordable housing near train stations.   Biden is running on making the Suburbs more affordable, more sustainable, more livable.
There are in fact plenty of federal policies here, but I just have a very difficult time imagining that when voters go to the polls in 100 days, the big issues weighing on their minds are going to be Joe Biden's position on minimum lot sizes and the SALT deduction.
THANK YOU. How is it that Trump did horrible in a pandemic and the points are still too close. JB has 45% in Texas and DT has 44% Like what?? So people are coming for me when I‚Äôm asking legitimate questions. I don‚Äôt want Trump to win so we gotta push Biden to be better.
Exactly. I agree Biden is not the man he used to be. But we had 8 years of the VP and staff running things for George W. I think I'll trust Dem advisers to do better when they run things for Joe!
Obviously, I know about judges appointments which is the only reason I‚Äôm getting up to vote for Biden. But what about other people who aren‚Äôt us? I‚Äôm simply making the argument that Biden needs to provide more for people to get up and vote for him.
I am SO proud to root and vote for Joe Biden!

Are we suppose to just let Biden come in office and it‚Äôll be another four years of same ol establishment? If that‚Äôs what y‚Äôall want, fine. But people are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
For the people replying are missing the entire point. Another four years of Trump will be bad, we know. So are we not allow to make sure Biden is the best he can be? So indigent people can have fair wages, health care, talk about climate change and police brutality?
I get that, I had family members affected by the virus. But Biden does not have that much great of a record. Social security, Iraq War, money from corporations, not wanting to legalize marijuana. These are issues that are important and he refuses to acknowledge that.
I don‚Äôt remember anyone else apologizing for this shit either lol yet here‚Äôs Biden aplogizing for making ppl uncomfortable
By the way I will still be voting for Biden as I would like the next supreme court member to be democratic. I'm just not going to acknowledge him as some kinda of champion or direct counter part to trump. Or that these things are going to be handled SO much differently.
Nothing wrong here either lol Biden is just a creep
Also the war on drugs is a fucking sham that just puts minorities in prison at a higher rate then yt people for the same crimes, without lowering drug use or sale. Miss me with the Joe Biden wouldn't do this. He's not that much of a better option then trump.
Okay. But acting like Biden a firm supporter of the police who's literally said " I don't want my kids to grow up in a racial jungle " wouldn't react in a similar Manner just seems like a joke to me
Literally though trumps leadership has led us to this positionüòÇ not that I like Biden but to act like trump getting re elected will make this better is a joke üòÇ it will only get worse
You mean the same Biden the authored one of the main bills letting police act like this?
Can we stop saying we need to get Trump out of office using it as an excuse to not criticize Biden? If his policies are bad, we have to call him out so he can do better and people will vote for him. Otherwise, people will just stay home and Trump will get another 4 years

It‚Äôs unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn‚Äôt chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it‚Äôs one of the few things he‚Äôs said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can‚Äôt think of a time better suited for a delay. I don‚Äôt even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don‚Äôt even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden‚Äôs plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.

Technically joe Biden has 40+ years old bad policy Trump has 3.5 yearsk
Now that Biden is quoting the Koran in his campaign ads and appearances, I guess the left-coasters like them.
Thank you Jim! I‚Äôm a moderate democrat and I know Joe Biden will do his best to get us where we need to be ... and beyond.
That‚Äôs all the choice you got. Go with Biden!!
Has anyone seen a Biden bumper sticker or yard sign?   Seen plenty of #trump2020 flags waving proudly. Heck, I haven‚Äôt seen a campaign TV spot from Biden either. What‚Äôs the DNC doing with all that campaign $$?  Bail $$ maybe?
A tough ad from the left would end up being ‚ÄúBiden wears leather belts‚Äù
Teach your children well  I guess you didn't listen to the song. You failed. BIDEN 2020
John it comes down to that the criminal corrupt democrats are very very afraid of what hes going to come out with all the   Corruption in the Obama  a ministration all of it FBI all of it    Spying and doing what they did to General Kelly got it Joe Biden!!
For VP ! We need Biden who knows the ropes right now! Then come 2024 we shall see. Just want that ü§° OUT of office period üëçüèª
She does have bigger balls than biden
What was ridiculous about my comment? You said only republicans have to use state media. Do you think the media is not nosed towards Dems? Your the one in denial my friend. I honestly wasted too much time with you so have a great day. Good luck with Jo Biden as your nominee!!
And again we may disagree on politics but hopefully all of us agree this country needs to come together.. I'm not a big trump fan but I'm not of biden either... Both parties are at this point, incompetent
You may wanna start looking at people who got rich while in office and not before. Pelosi, Biden, Obama. All millionaires after being in office.
I think the only thing that prevents Biden from doing 8 years is his health. He would be 85 or 86 at the end of a second term. A healthy 77-year old has a remaining actuarial life expectancy of 10 years so you can‚Äôt rule out two terms.
I was looking at Joe Biden conference until interruption please fix
NADLER IS A PUPPET PUT HIM WITH BULLY JOE BIDEN THAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC MARXIST PARTY. TWO WHITE MEN BULLYING BLACKS WOMEN AND SENIORS. SUPREME LIARS WHERE'S HUNTER. UNDER YOUR MASK
JOE BIDEN THE PUPPET LOVES MAIL IN VOTING . THIS IS THE DEMOCRAT MARXIST PARTY AT ITS BEST LIEING BULLYING DISOBEYING THE LAWS IMMIGRANTS CAN VOTE DEAD PEOPLE CAN VOTE DOGS AND CATS CAN VOTE CROOKED DEMOCRATS FAKE POLLS . THIS IS DEMOCRAT PLAYBOOK ALL ELSE FAILS RACISM. RACISM .
Cool I could show you 100s of fringe groups that support Biden and Democrats...
Same thing with Biden then right? If we are holding people to certain standards....
JOE BIDEN LIEING AGAIN CAN'T DEMOCRATS DO BETTER THEN LIAR JOE BIDEN
NADLER IS NOTHING BUT A YES BOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATS MARXIST WHO WEARS A SWIM SUIT UNDER HIS SUIT SO HE CAN SOAK IN THE SWAMP WITH PELOSI AND LOSER JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN IS NOT A LEADER HE IS A LIAR BULLY. WHERE'S HUNTER WITH ALL THE PEOPLES TAXPAYERS MONEYS????
I do too but still not voting Biden or Trump
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
This is why its worth betting on a Biden win this November:
How come all Trump and Biden tribute songs seem like parodies from SNL
Remember  making fun of VP Biden for wearing a mask?
Such BS. Enough politics.  If Biden gets elected and the markets tank, know that you contributed MW.
Seeing Speaker Pelosi with the Bidens paying respects to John Lewis is very comforting to me  Peaceful and reassuring  We need to get Joe Biden into the White House  We have to work together  We have to make it happen  #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I love that you are a Democrat and I also love that the Biden campaign is canabalizing itself. Love, a man.
Trump will be getting a one way ticket back to Margo Florida after he loosesin a landslide to Joe Biden and Susan Rice
JOE BIDEN HAS THE SAME WACK JOBS SUPPORTING HIM WHICH IS 5 PERCENT.  PELOSI AND BIDEN HAVEN'T EVEN TRYED TO CALM HEADS OR UP HOLD THE LAW . PELOSI AND JOE BIDEN WANT MORE PEOPLE TO DIE .   KNAPP TIME JOE NAPA NANCY.
THIS IS THE JOE BIDEN CLAN DEMOCRATS RUINING THE COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE YOU HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK.
Because Wallace is a straight shooter, Biden can‚Äôt fake his way through the interview
I‚Äôve around a long time and I‚Äôm trying to remember that support for white supremacists in the last sixty years? You want to refresh my memory? I do remember lots of Democratic politicians in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs that were very racist. All friends of Joe Biden‚Äôs.
Take a pic next time you see a Biden yard sign.... you won‚Äôt see any.....this is manufactured enthusiasm
That was actually far more coherent than any Biden speech I've ever heard
Most people just want Trump outta the White House so they're going to vote for Biden just because. Both Biden and Trump are creepy and sexist in my opinion both have no interest in helping black people but Biden is the lesser of two evils kindaü§î!!!
Can't declare bankruptcy on student loans no matter what.  WTF are you talking about.  It's not Biden's fault.
It doesn't really matter, the bigger problem is Biden
Biden voters have jobs.
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Pay attention: This is the personal responsibility of every single Biden voter  #100DaysToGo
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Howie Hawkins polling double Joe Biden
With you all the way,  If Biden wins by an electoral college landslide, trump will have nothing to contest. We must ignore the polls and vote like our lives depended on it.
This is Joe Biden.....prostitute
It was funny and showed trumps humor and cognitive skills that people should compare biden to..
Yes, we should all be concerned  But we need to channel the worry,  frustration and fear into action now There is something that each of us can identify to contribute to a Biden landslide  And now is the time to figure out what our personal roles are and do it!
Maybe he will take into his thought process the suffering of the people in this country and help them out.  What if he gave us everything Biden said no to or would veto....
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I feel at least there‚Äôs a conscience there... unlike Biden or Trump
The pic you labeled ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù is Trump‚Äôs America. Trump supporters are already blaming the next administration for Trump‚Äôs fuck-ups.
We all know Biden is a sniveling creep living in his basement like a rat.
And BIden has the nerve to say that Trump only cares sbout himself! This is a perfect example of the left NOT CARING ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS. TRUMP DOES CARE AND WANTS TO HELP!!
I‚Äôd say good predicting especially since Biden yard signs are as rare as the horned hooter owl
It would be reason #157 not to vote for Biden
I actually had to tell someone Biden had a plan today. Please of Please   please have a plan!!
the Biden stutter
Why is Biden‚Äôs 50 years of fucking bills better than Trumps four years of fucking bills
I'd rather vote for Koko, except he died in 2018...oh well...I guess it's Biden then.
If Biden wins but there are widespread allegations of voter fraud, should  refuse to concede?
Biden- makes deals with corporate America for political funding, lined the pockets of Democrats for decades, thinks ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you don‚Äôt vote for him. Trump- gave up a ‚Äúdream life‚Äù to help people, doesnt take pay, brought the economy to the best it has been in years
I have been saying the same thing since Joe Biden was nominated! Another woman with the ideal credentials to assume the Presidency!
THOUGHTS?? We all know that China would love to have a Biden Presidency! It seems very suspicious to me that they could have stopped the virus but chose not to! WHY do the Dems defend China! Think about it. If the country shuts down it shuts down our economy ! Works for the left!
Biden says he wants to redirect funds from the police, well in my book thats just another way of saying DEFUND!! YOU MUST DEFUND TO REDIRECT!!! Don't play word games!!
Biden gets more cash, Trump has as many donors in the state
So you are admitting it was completely wrong of Trump to mock Joe Biden and the Democrats for canceling their convention because it was obvious it could not be done safely. Trump canceled because nobody was going to go anyway.
How can investors hedge funds against potential Biden Presidency? If Biden wins, we can expect 2 trends in long-term: the price of oil and gas will definitely rise first of all, because he wants to limit drilling; 2nd, only oil companies on state territory will be exempt...
Crazy that this is happening with a Republican President in office. And they worry about Biden.
‚ÄúHey  I hope you score a lot of touchdowns and win the Stanley cup this year!‚Äù  - Joe Biden
Isn‚Äôt creepy a matter of opinion.  I‚Äôd like to know more about the creepiness....is it Joe Biden creepiness?
This election isn't about Biden, it's a referendum on Trump. You saw that in Obama's reelection in 2012, W's reelection v Kerry in 2004 Clinton in 96 and HWs loss in 92. These elections are always about the incumbent
Biden campaign goes on offensive against Republican Senator Ron Johnson‚Äôs Burisma probe  via   Go Joe! #ONEV1
This but unironically  But I‚Äôm not voting for Biden
Biden and Obama say TRUMP refuses to take responsibility for the CHINA virus! Well guess what, He's not responsible! He is however responsible for fighting it even though he was left with a depleted medical PPE by your administration! DO YOU TAKE RESPONISBILITY FOR THAT!!??
Biden will be our FIRST president entering the White House with dementia  but he won‚Äôt be the first leaving with it
That there is nothing to find is just incentive to make shit up. Dirt on Biden doesn‚Äôt need to be true to be an effective smear; it just needs to be believable by a few swing voters who are inexplicably still on the fence.
Democrats love to tax corporations and force them out. Trump lowered the corporate taxes to bring companies back. Biden will raise them right back up and encourage the corporations to do business in China
I am gonna retire with a big fat pension and 401k. Good luck accomplishing that in Biden‚Äôs America. You know what a pension is right. Something your generation will never have
the Democratic Party has lost every attempt to overthrow this presidency Legally or otherwise. They‚Äôve come up with Joe Biden who hardly has a grasp on what day it is. They know they‚Äôre gonna lose the election so they have resorted to violence through the Antifa group.
I have listened to the first Biden podcast three times and I‚Äôve never done that for a podcast before
That's it, the election is over. With the Iranian endorsement, there's nothing to stop Biden. üòÇ
Like, hypothetically, sure. Biden has been consistently pro police violence over the last several decades and would likely continue Trump's policies on how to deal with the protests.  But, at the moment it is Trump's, not Biden's, policies being enforced.
Should apply to Biden
Its simple, liberals aren't voting FOR BIden , they're voting against Trump!
Also Biden competing in Texas and Georgia gives the Democrats more avenues to retaking the Senate these all matter
I think 4 parties is the right number... being as honesty Biden running would be in my opinion a moderate vote Bernie being the progressive... Trump being trump... and then a guy like Rand Paul/Mike Lee/ Ted Cruz being a hardline Conservative or NeoConBiden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week

Which conjures a great image of an irate Biden wrestling a gun away from an apologetic would-be assassin in order to kill himself.  "Fuck you, I would make a great assassination victim. You put me on that list. YOU PUT ME ON THAT LIST!"
Remembering back to that time when Osama bin Laden told every global jihadist to try to kill Obama or Patraeus but not Biden because 'Biden is so unprepared for the Presidency' that he would cause more harm alive than  dead.

Today is a dark day in the US Government. Democrats reemphasized that they are a bunch of #Bullies, and also am wondering if #ValDemmings gave up her chance to be VP for Biden.
You'd figure after month and months of not answering questions, after his speech. He would have been good at it. NOPE, My we present Joe #MajorGaffe Biden at your service. I am waiting for his coined phrase "You know the Thing"
I think the only thing that prevents Biden from doing 8 years is his health. He would be 85 or 86 at the end of a second term. A healthy 77-year old has a remaining actuarial life expectancy of 10 years so you can‚Äôt rule out two terms.

Look up bigot in a dictionary Biden‚Äôs picture will be there What are blacks thinking ?
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
.      Should start preparing for the conversation that dems will force trump to either debate kamala harris or no one at all. Joe Biden will never get on a debate stage with donald trump
I hope with all my heart that this is a harbinger of Michigan voting for Biden and not Trump this November.
Kamala Harris' selection proves Dems know they have ZERO chance of beating Trump in 2020.  No moderate will ever vote for a CA rep with Biden's dementia.
When Biden announces Kamala Harris as his VP next week, it will be the greatest gift for Donald Trump that you can imagine.  No moderate voter will vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.   CA is not the way to run this country - and Harris will wear that moniker the entire campaign
I also heard you can watch the submarine races from BIDEN ISLAND to EPSTEIN ISLAND.
It is the greatest gift to Trump and the GOP if Biden picks that lunatic from CA
She does have bigger balls than biden
And again we may disagree on politics but hopefully all of us agree this country needs to come together.. I'm not a big trump fan but I'm not of biden either... Both parties are at this point, incompetent

Yes, I think we really have! Hopefully, we come out winning. For the health of the American people, social justice &amp; so much more, we really need Biden to come out on top.

We being Democrats.  Sorry Alec - 1/3 of ALL voters don't believe the coronavirus numbers.  1/2 of voters believe Biden has Dementia
It sure did become available. Doesn't change the fact that obama/biden totally fucked up the response. Bidens own chief of staff said at the time "we did everything wrong." But hey, no matter, no need to destroy the economy
I'm agreeing with you Ulysses. My comment was made in jest - Obama/Biden were a disaster on H1N1
President Joe Biden - that's a good one
I make light of his ignorance &amp; lack of intelligence. That doesn't mean that I'm not aware of the damage he's doing. We Americans have 1 chance to get a competent POTUS on Nov. 3rd. I pray we can get Biden in ofc.

Look up bigot in a dictionary Biden‚Äôs picture will be there What are blacks thinking ?
Harris is not my fave. I actually am not a fan. But, in terms of enthusiasm, she‚Äôll bring it. I love Bottoms, to me she has it all! Also, those talking about Rice? Seems no one remembers The Benghazi hearings. Biden has tons of foreign policy cred, he doesn‚Äôt need her.
I don't follow the NHL so I can't speak to that. As for Biden, I can tell from your tweet history that you are a big Trump guy but many smart rational people think Biden is the best guy for our country. It's ok that you have a different opinion but don't be obtuse about it.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said
Yup.  Biden/Clinton

No it's not! What until Biden get in. That's what you'll get.
Joe Biden made his children multimillionaires by selling his political office. My children should be multimillionaires too.
fuck biden
You cannot say that voting for Biden is "voting for the lesser of two evils" and then turn around and insist that Biden will make things better.   That's not what evil people do. So either you say he's not evil, or that we're actively making things worse.
What alternative does Biden offer? He proposes more lockdowns and viewing America through racial lens.   Implication this case Trump leaving office would make racism and covid no longer apocalyptic crises.

Under no circumstances can the left allow Biden to to interviews that are not pre scripted for him. The truth about Bidens diminished mental health must be kept hidden at all costs!
Joe Biden has dementia and people like you love that so you can manipulate him. Chris Wallace who did a fantastic interview with Trump has repeated ask Biden to do an interview with him - repeatedly gets a NO! And the rumor is that Biden will not do any debates - why is that ??
We need passion and compassion in the White House like never before. Policy matters, but sometimes implementation matters more. By electing Biden we will be bringing compassion back to politics.
President Trump is man for job  I stand by me 100%. God-bless America and God-bless Donald Trump. And Mr. Biden should resign because of his problems the Democratic Party is using me. The clintons Obamma and other people in a Democratic Party and CNN is no good.

Nothing wrong here either lol Biden is just a creep

We gotta hope he picks her. I like Joe Biden but I will be Really voting for her.

In 1994 JOE BIDEN WROTE A BILL CALLED THE THREE STRIKE BILL.   Then President Bill Clinton signed the THREE STRIKE BILL INTO LAW.  With Hillary Clinton calling African American Youth ‚ÄúSUPERPREDATORS‚Äù, Democrats rammed the bill through the House of Representatives and Chuck Schume
Susan Rice Wants to Run for Office. Will Her First Campaign Be for V.P.?
Exactly. It wouldn't be a debate.  No policy would be discussed. Just Trump name-calling, lying and mugging for the camera. If Biden really wants to push it, just say release your tax returns, and we'll talk about it.
The though of Biden in office is terrifyingüòÇ
Joe Biden should stop cow towing to the left wing of the DEM party...they don't care what you do; they are haters...and their leader Bernie does nothing to stop the likes of Tlaib or Turner
Pollak: Joe Biden Thinks the Rioters Are Very Fine People
Joe Biden was one of the last ppl on that stage that I wanted to win the nomination...I will vote with him ... we need to get the horror of the last few years behind us...but I do not forgive him, the media, the Democrats, the squad for what they continue to do to this woman.
Dr. Biden :)
Its sad that you both support tyrants and think there a different in the 2 party systems. Atleast he isnt voting for a demantia victim. You are an asshole if you vote for biden
Biden doesn't need enthusiasm. We just want you gone--forever.
I have an idea. Biden only has 7.2 million followers. What if everyone told all their followers to follow  right now? And shared everything on his feed. I bet we can make him louder than Donald on Twitter. You in? #ResistanceTaskForce
Joe Biden will reform the police. Not defund them.  Spread the word.
Sooooooo show the disaster that is Trump's America and say that would be Biden's America. Only a trump supporter would see any login that as there is none.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I'm not PFT, but to be fair... interviewing Joe Biden is different than interviewing the President of the United States outside the Oval Office. PFT also did interview most of the democratic candidates.
EXCELLENT!!!!  Now Biden doesn't have to hang a painting of the RacistImpeachedOrangeAssClown!!!!  #Resist #RacistInChief  #FailedLeadership
Because things were just so horrifically terrible when Joe Biden was vice president under Barack Obama for 8 years.
here are some of those great things: - golfed and held rallies for two months - called the virus a hoax - promoted an untested drug - made fun of Biden for wearing a mask - sidelined the experts - made governors compete for resources - ignored the playbook - told a ton of lies
Biden is nothing but a pandering fool
Biden: why would I debate you if you won't put up Obama's portrait?
Biden needs a history class.
I‚Äôm so happy Mr President. I had a lot of things that I disagree with you, but now I miss you.  Hope Biden is our next POTUS. I‚Äôm happy you are more involved now. PS despite I disagree with you, I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump.  Hope the best for AmericaWhy doesn't Biden just pick up some girl from the local convenience store as VP? She will be so overwhelmed I am sure she won't "rub anybody the wrong way"
I forgot to add ‚ÄúBiden with Backstreet Boys‚Äù and of course: #KenteCringe
Even Rice who has notable baggage wouldn‚Äôt blow it for Biden. Every choice comes with some risk. However, not enough to swing an election like this.
The incumbent president is on pace to lose in a landslide, and people think a pretty anonymous congresswoman who went on a trip 50 years ago to Cuba and had one ill worded quote is going to blow it all for Biden.
Isn't that what you are complaining about? That capital gains taxes will match the earned income tax rate?
I‚Äôm betting Obama, Radical Do-Nothing Democrats, Biden, ANTIFA, and the Lamestream Media will also be on the list.
I really think it will easily come off as a fishing expedition considering this was nearly half a century ago. She‚Äôs admitted to the Biden campaign that it would come up and even Annette Taddeo said it might cause some problems, but that it certainly wasn‚Äôt cataclysmic.

Never said that.  I'm clearly stating what many people are feeling. Fyi 77% of Democrats are voting against trump, not for Biden.
It‚Äôs unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn‚Äôt chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it‚Äôs one of the few things he‚Äôs said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can‚Äôt think of a time better suited for a delay. I don‚Äôt even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don‚Äôt even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden‚Äôs plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.
I agree, Donald Trump is not a great guy, but look at our current options. Joe Biden? Dont use the word decent. We had an opportunity to get creative bu the party is being run by the crazy far left. They have zero perspective on what it takes to run an economy.

Not me. Biden was a terrible candidate in 1988 and 2008. He‚Äôs worse now. A puppet who was rescued from the scrap heap by Obama, he‚Äôs an absolute moron. If virtually anyone else was running for the DNC, no problem. But with Biden, I‚Äôll take a hard pass.
Hey Bama. I keep missing you. Hope you‚Äôre well!

Interfering with an election? Trump literally accuses him and Biden of corruption every other day. About time these punch him back.
would be better as Treasury Sec. Too white and too close in age to Biden. My fav VP picks - Demming and Rice.

This is how it's gonna be - and worse, all the way through Biden's inauguration.  Buckle up, donate, volunteer and make sure EVERYONE you know is registered and ready to vote (however they can).  Respond with action.  #vote
Exactly!  I got a good chuckle when Trump gave the same answer he gave to HRC in 2015 -- We'll see what happens.  If there are enough idiots to vote for Biden this country is doomed.
Tax Hike Under Biden Poses Bigger Threat to Tech Than Hearing
Mr Biden let‚Äôs face it. If we don‚Äôt think for ourselves and mask up and ‚Äúbite the bullet‚Äù here, were doomed. He‚Äôs never gong to do anything, he‚Äôs in a world of his own misery. We need you, we need you bad!

According to this ridiculous line of argument Reagan should not pick HW Bush for VP because he attacked him in the primary?  And Biden should pick an unqualified black woman for VP because Kamala is too ambitious and would run for President.... LIKE EVERY OTHER VP IN HISTORY
I don‚Äôt know if you saw Barbra Streisand‚Äôs stupid little sermon. She actually thinks people give a crap to what she thinks. Biden is honest. What a joke!!

If anything those who vote shame make me not want to vote or make me despise their candidate even more. My choices something like this: 1. Yang  2. Tulsi 3. Bernie 4. Warren  The rest were a no. I absolutely hated Biden, Buttigeig, Harris, and yes, especially Bloomberg.
I don‚Äôt agree with you but, I really appreciate you not vote shaming. I‚Äôve encountered a handful of Biden supporters that do everything they can guilt me into saying yes. You don‚Äôt seem like that.
Maybe you should put your energy into convincing the party to drop Biden, who is functionally one of the most significant structural racists IN AMERICAN HISTORY,  before  nomination is officially set, instead of this sad passive struggle for a symbolic appointment.
If Biden wins, his VP is going to be the presumptive nominee after his term, whoever it is. Taking office with a VP ready to serve is always important, but would be an essential selling point now.  Getting them ready for the Presidency should be a high priority.
How does any sane person think Biden is fit to be POTUS. I get that they hate Trump but everything they've tried has been fake and now this Biden support show what that what they said about T45 was all bogus. Can't eat your cake and have it too.
Since the rangers are back and sports are starting to come back I will no longer be tweeting or liking any more politics (except to make fun of Biden cuz it‚Äôs just hilarious). It has been a lot of fun pissing everyone off. Open your eyes. Go Vote. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
As to his running mate, Joe Biden could pick any stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.

Dear Mr.President, please give Barr a chance to speak today, he was silenced, interrupted and disrespected yesterday.   Let him have the podium!  And, to Win  Let‚Äôs run all the old media footage of Biden when he was first called out for corruption early in his career, MUST DO!
Trump claims that Biden will ruin (his) America. When I read that I think to myself ‚Äúand it will be glorious‚Äù. Trump‚Äôs values are spreading like an insidious disease and this is what it looks like. Stop the insanity. #bluenomatterwho
Trump says the country will suffer if Biden is elected. Indeed Trump‚Äôs America WILL suffer, make no mistake. Trump brought us here, the darkest days I‚Äôve seen in this country in my lifetime. Trump values the wrong things. #voteblue
Biden needs to be thrown off the ticket. There is going to be a mutiny against the vampires that own the party. This man is a racist and a fascist to his core, he is not meaningfully different than Trump.
You all know the 1st day after Biden is sworn in trump { he doesn't deserve the capital T} will say how much $ he lost while being pres then how big his companies grew cause he'd been   strongest &amp; most powerful pres ever &amp; his presidential library will be 2X larger than Obama's.
President Trump is ad spending to defend 2016 states. Biden spends money to flip states.   via
Biden echoes Obama from 2008 in bashing Wall Street.   That stuff is political gold.
I have been listening to Joe by speaking about systemic racism. It sounds so refreshing that we don't have to hear hate you can look at this man listen to this man and know you can trust this man.  I can't wait for November 3rd Joe Biden has my vote.
This election 15% of your supporters plan to back Trump.
It'd be nice if your supporters endorsed Joe Biden. But instead they plan to vote for Trump or no one at all.
And Bernie fans are planning to make sure Biden does NOT win out of spite.
The Sanders fan's plan: vote for Trump to spite Joe Biden. Worry about that, because none of this matters if your followers are going to keep these people in power.
Introduce legislation to stop your fans from supporting Trump over Biden. They're not the same and you're all fools if you think we're better off with Trump.
Pathetic is hiring people you let speak publicly saying Biden is as bad as Trump.
Bernie has people working for him who think Biden's as bad as Trump. If all Bernie fans feel the same way it means 4 more years of President Trump.
I can't imagine how ANYONE can still support Trump!! Thank you for always asking the tough questions every chance you get!! There is NOTHING, short of Biden shooting someone on 5th Ave, that could make me change my mind! #RebuildWithBiden #ToxicTrumpMustGo  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Thank you VP Biden!! Looking forward to dignity, empathy &amp; justice returning to the White House!! #RebuildWithBiden  #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
sorry can I pay $20 not to paint a bullseye on my chocolate forehead   should be wiping member rolls rn. Joe Biden abt 2 keep ALL the policestate toys and decimate the DSA/BLM/abolishICE/defundpolice as soon as he's in office, if Trump doesn't win.
#Trumpkillstexas Biden it is in November...anyone but that idiot we call our president
Perplexed: Joe Biden who, after 30+ yrs has actually never helped the black community to prosper is probably gonna get their vote; whereas Trump has been employing blacks for decades &amp; as POTUS created the best economy that give us the low black unemployment rate ever. Go figure.
Why should Biden give fox any ratings fuck fox not worth the time
DNC Attendees Must Provide Negative COVID-19 Test Prior to Event
A lot of really sad robots on this thread. I can't think of anything stupider Joe Biden could do. So it probably will be her, since he is the dumbest nominee since Gerald Ford. This is two aneurysms stupid.
...BY VOTING FOR BIDEN
Fuck Kamala.  'Kamala the Kop' says she's cool with weed, but helped imprison more than 1,500 people on pot charges. I‚Äôll still vote Biden but fuck Harris
Many of Biden‚Äôs inner circle just won‚Äôt forget and forgive Kamala‚Äôs surprise busing attack in that first debate.  But ... since 1944, Democratic nominees tend to pick Senators as the VP pick at the convention.  The exception in 1984 didn‚Äôt work out (let‚Äôs forget  1972).

Biden has the perfect strategy.....he needs to shut his mouth and let the dumb guy continue to shoot himself in the foot. It‚Äôs actually pretty funny to think Trump lost the popular vote to the most unpopular candidate in history and now he is going to lose to a guy with dimentia
This is big.  Biden bans staff from trading without approval.  These are bank level standards.   Very good!
I‚Äôm making the call: If Trump and Biden have to debate via Zoom, it will be half over before they realize they‚Äôre on mute.
IF Biden wins, he's a one-termer. Michelle Obama will be his Veep choice. Put it in the books.
Oh believe me Biden's supporters are VERY enthusiastic about removing Trump from office!  He is a serious danger to democracy here &amp; around the globe! He shows more support to Putin than a hero like John Lewis!! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #ToxicTrumpMustGo #PutinsPuppet
Biden has to get on one knee like Hank Paulson did with Pelosi, apoligize and beg for forgiveness.  That is the morally right thing to do.  That is the historically right thing to do.
OH MY GOD  Chris Dodd wants Kamala Harris to apologize to Biden for attacking his past track record of mingling with segregationists?!? And that is why he is torying with unqualified candidates?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
Yes. Those are all factors. And I admit there are people who wanna coast by with no hard work out in. I‚Äôm not saying Joe Biden can‚Äôt improve the situation for the working class. Though from what I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôm not hopeful. Politicians don‚Äôt live in the same world we do anymore
Best part of a Biden presidency will be the complete and utter cleansing of these MAGAts from the whole of the government...
Puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
His handlers won‚Äôt let him debate, either. Americans deserve better. Every presidential campaign has had debates, they won‚Äôt let basement Biden debate. Shameful.
Unfortunately we‚Äôre not going to win the battle against Covid until Biden is sworn in. Trump is a peon and thinks it‚Äôs just going to disappear. The science is clear. Other countries have shown the way.   #ONEV1
Thinking about making a BIDEN / TRUMP crossword along the lines of the famous CLINTON / BOB DOLE crossword, except only Biden's name will work in the grid.

America is already 244 years old. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden have been in government for more than half that time (150 years).  If things are so terrible, 149 years seems like a long time to spend planning a new direction.

There was some polling done there where Biden was ahead
Donald - thats BS and you know it. Your father‚Äôs tax cut went 85% to the very rich. Joe Biden will NOT raise taxes on working class people like this video. In fact, he will give them at least as much tax cut as your dad. He will raise taxes on the super rich no doubt about that.

Putting up a Biden sign is like putting up one of those signs that says "DEAF CHILD IN AREA"
Even if off a few decimals either way, why do we have a President who is making decisions about the livelihood and well being of the People based on righting his own sinking financial ship?  Is Biden or has any other Prez/candidate ever looked at the Presidency quite this way?
It's easier to figure out who DOESN'T support Biden now! Trump allowed us to become the most infected country on the planet thanks to his total incompetence! Now he went golfing AGAIN &amp; the Senate took a long weekend rather than passing the Heroes Act for suffering Americans!!
Let's look at the credentials of recent VP picks:  Tim Kaine - Senator and Governor of Virginia, population 8.5 million Mike Pence - Governor of Indiana, Congressman, pop. 6.6M Biden - Top Senator from Delaware, Chair of Foreign Relations Committee
But this is why Biden was the safe ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù choice. He doesn‚Äôt make anyone face any uncomfortable truths they aren‚Äôt willing to see... because he doesn‚Äôt see them either.
This is the only moment for which Rice is known for on a nationwide basis in the US. She is the Benghazi Liar.   Biden is going to look extremely bad and will confirm stereotypes of his senility (and lack of memory capacity) if he does pick Rice.   It'll be a Memento Moment.
The Biden campaign is going to start off very badly if Biden picks some no namer who has not done a God damn thing to earn a VP position.
The Biden campaign needs to get to work and start fixing those PredictIt odds tomorrow. You can't have random people with no national profile being bandied around as VPs. And hogging 40% of the odds.  Rice is known as the Bengazhi Liar. Nobody has any clue who Bass is.
Picking Rice would be a huge mistake. She has never ran an election or a campaign, articulated and sold a platform. In the event that she becomes President she will have serious credibility issues with voters.
This POTUS election cycle will be binary: Those who hate Trump vs. those who can see Biden is cognitively incapable of holding the office of the President of the United States.
What a shocker, well let‚Äôs move the golf game to my course, let‚Äôs have the g8 at my resort, and on and on like a James Taylor song! There is NOTHING he won‚Äôt do when money and/or re-election is on his wee little thing he calls a brain! Love ya Rachel! Biden 2020!
