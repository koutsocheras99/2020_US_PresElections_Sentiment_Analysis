I Thank God Eveydsy For My President Donald J Trump!!! God Bless Him and Family!!!!
Dude...have you ever heard of the #AffordableCareAct aka #ACA aka #Obamacare I'm from Trump country in rural Oklahoma. Even the Trump loving red hats in OK know they already have pre-existing conditions coverage. Are y'all stupid or are you hoping voters are?
Trump is so weak. Mark Meadows damn well knows what is in the ACA... So what is he trying to distract from? Most of the time when he does something this lame brained it is to distract...
Trump would know about puppets.
Trump told the "We Love Trump Because He Is Rich &amp; So Are We" members his Bedminster Golf Club in NJ who were mask less that they didn't have to follow the law because it was a peaceful protest. Like the virus knows this. Like to know how many are gasping for breath soon. Jerks
Why do we need Trump to sign a executive order to require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. If you have Obama care, you are already covered. What is this Trump care or some other bullshit.

LMAO, Obama did replenish the stockpile. He dealt with three pandemics. Trump was in office over 3 years and did nothing. The ‚Äústockpile‚Äù being gone is 100% on Trump after 3 years. He ignored the pandemic protocol.
Dow TRIPLED UNDER OBAMA. 200% increase! It hasn‚Äôt even gone up 50% under Trump and it set records for the 10 biggest plummets in stock market history all because of Trump. Poison.
Meanwhile, not only is it stagnant under Trump, it‚Äôs actually DOWN 2000+ points from its high. Trump is just poison. That‚Äôs why he has so many bankruptcies.
As I said, it was the same trajectory it has been on for 10 years. Trump did nothing but crash it. As I pointed out, it went up 4000 points in 2016 after it had already been hitting record highs. In fact, it hit record highs almost every day Obama‚Äôs last two years.
Sorry facts don‚Äôt help you. Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited from Obama and Biden.
Iris running rampant in red states. All Trump. Herman Cain is dead thanks to Trump. Americans dying in record numbers...Trump‚Äôs response is ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù I guess the politicizing by Trump to try to blame it on blue state governors didn‚Äôt work out so well, huh? üòâ
LOL, GDP DOWN a record 33% under Trump. Unemployment back to double digits under Trump. Obama did better in his sleep. Even the stock market did better. Trump tried to take credit for Obama‚Äôs work and it bit him in his fat orange ass the first crisis he faced. üòÇ
LMAO, the Dow went up almost 4000 points (over 25%) Obama‚Äôs last year in office. You don‚Äôt know what the hell you are talking about. Unemployment and minority unemployment only went down a total of 1% under Trump until he screwed it up and sent it double digits.

How many easier examples do we need?  Sued by the government for racism (he paid).  Took out an ad against the exonerated blacks in the Central Park Five.  His own lawyer testified under oath.   His own former black outreach ambassador Omarosa Manigault:
Trump is making me sick
If the case was weak, then Trump wouldn‚Äôt have paid. The DoJ was satisfied getting Trump to pay for his racism, which is exactly what they did.
Trump said that if he is innocent, he doesn‚Äôt settle. LOL
The fact that the Justice Department sued them AND the Trump‚Äôs paid a settlement makes it crystal clear that they were racist. Add to that the testimony under oath of Trump‚Äôs own attorney of his racism, it‚Äôs pretty cut and dry.
Another Trump victory!
Not convicted? They were sued. There‚Äôs not a conviction to occur. But Trump settled because he was guilty. Just like he did with Trump University.
Fred and Donald Trump literally got sued by the government for racism. Other than hate crimes, it doesn‚Äôt get much more racist than that.
The sad thing for me is that we had a chance to turn over all the swamp tables. But trump simply wouldn‚Äôt lead the republicans in Congress to do anything
Trump is promises made promises kept but democrats are seeing he has done that and are making sure he can‚Äôt come thru with more,democrats make promises and never keep them, he is making them look like what they are liars and cheaters,they promise you the moon but give food stamps

Well, Obama did take unemployment from 10% down to 4.6% and tripled the stock market and got 20 million more people health insurance. Meanwhile Trump, who you think somehow is qualified to do anything, has unemployment back up to double digits and hasn‚Äôt even hit 50% Dow growth.
Isn't that what we do with the Senate? You had 10 weeks to work out these details and all u did was ignore them. You don't give a fuck about the people. This shitshow is on you,Trump and the GOP. Speaker Pelosi has done her job.
None are edited. Trump was using Mar-a-Lago as a sex trafficking hub for both Epstein (who was living there) and himself, when he was trafficking underage illegals for his ‚Äúmodeling agency.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt. Epstein was arrested in 2008 for pedophilia. Guess who let him off with a kush plea deal? Alex Acosta. Trump rewarded Acosta for helping his pedophile friend out by appointing him Labor Secretary.Everything trump destroyed... Health, economy, unity, dignity, peace, hope, respect, and Presidency.

I am betting that Trump does not want the Repubs &amp; Dems to come together. He wants so badly to become a hero in the eyes of America. He is now considered to be a failure, a corrupt non-president, &amp; the GOP done. So he wants to ride in on a Trojan Horse and make an exec decision.
Translation, Democrats reduced price tag of their bill by 50% in order to get something passed, but Republicans are not willing to increase their bill by an equal amount to make sure Americans can survive this. Not exactly shocking.
Absolutely.  So important right now to pray for President Trump and his family and friends.  Apparently there is no limit to the Dems evilness.  I hope he will stay home with double SService and stay out of the public as much as possible.

The only genocide on the near horizon will be poor people as Trump demands in-person public schooling. Should we Americans not stop before reaching the brink of opening, then wait till two weeks after.
You can literally see how bad a job he did by looking at EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD! Trump will win Arkansas because the people here are marks for con-men. But you knew that already.
Let‚Äôs face it. You just love Donald Trump. You really don‚Äôt care what he has done to our reputation worldwide and what he has done to the justice department, the Supreme Court and how every GOP panders to him with no pride. Where is your patriotism man?
No, Trump only said that Nancy Pelosi should be executed as a traitor, and ICE isn‚Äôt yet executing all the immigrants they have caged up at the southern border.
Trump owns a High School?
This mf Trump really said ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù instead of Corona VirusüôÑ
I can verify this.  I normally receive my medication 1 week before the previous prescription runs out.  This month, my prescription came one day AFTER my prescription ran out.  Were it a med required to stay alive, I would have been in the ER for a refill. Get it together TRUMP
This is another LIE by the LIAR IN CHIEF Donald Trump.
Trump criticizes Biden for talking about the black community as if they are a non-diverse and monolithic group, yet uses the label ‚Äúthe black vote‚Äù so as to refer to them as a monolithic group of voters who all vote the same way. Donny, don‚Äôt act all high and mighty
Yup, indeed!  Trump is an inhuman, pompous fool!
He was probably over zealous, Trump is loved by lots of folks and not all are old white men. However, we can agree that throwing out wild tweets and blocking someone before they can reply is weak.
He would listen before trump would! He called for execution of 5 innocent black men. He called mexicans rapists,  asked  blacks what do you gave to lose? As if he know how shitty everyone life is. Name one thing has he criticized whites on? Its all the mexicans fault or blacks.
Ok let just say ill give you that? Ok voting rights gutted nothing from trump. Black lives matter he calls them terrorists.  Wont stand up against  white supremacist. Wont check banks on discrimination against blacks. And a whole slew of other things!
Can anyone show me a picture where Trump has went into the black community and talked with them or interviewed by black media or anything?
WHY would not authorities having allowed years of fake Russia and still being used for the 2020 election, NOT SECRETLY but OPENLY show in detail the evidence of their crookedness. If not,  O' BIDEN and company will be a cause of unfairness against Trump 2020. Don't be unfair!
Biden could pull out a map and see if tRump can find Puerto Rico.
Once again trump gets to present himself as the devil we know while the moderate democrat tries to convince everyone that they‚Äôre an angel.

If elected president, Joe Biden says there will not be 'another foot' of wall constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending one of Trump's big campaign promises.
FACT:  does more to ban Trump supporters than they do to ban pedophiles... so does
That's why it was such a surprise that they embraced a libertine like Trump.
Who's gonna tell him that that trump supporters are "poorer, less educated, etc" than trump critics? Also,  I've lived in Arkansas since 1985; can you tell me how to pronounce my state's name? I'm afraid I'm saying it wrong.
Falwell the Lesser endorsed Trump in January 2016.
So, when Trump loses, he will be eligible for unemployment, right?
And  has a SENSATIONAL podcast episode that connects the history of the Republican Party+Trump to evangelicalism, Israel, and the end of time.

That wasn't true in 2016, when evangelicals gave Trump their seal of approval.
I can't think of one on my ballot who has done that. Not voting for anyone who voluntarily identifies with the party that saw Trump for who he is and told Americans that he was the best they have to offer.
I hope no one is stupid enough to vote for this idiot. Nothing to do with his money except to try to tamper with the election. #Biden2020 #ScrewKanye #KanyeWest   Kanye West appears to admit his presidential campaign is a stunt to hurt Joe Biden
needs to give it a rest. She has more privilege than most people in this country will EVER see and to whine about being depressed by Trump is an exercise in self indulgence.
Attempts to explain this have been made, but they often start with a binary choice between Trump and a pro-choice Democrat, as if Trump was the one and only pro-life Republican.

Trump and West. Two delusional self promoters. Kanye is off his meds. What‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs excuse?
Well, Trump is Mortal.. Lets not play Satan.. However, there is little doubt that God has helped Trump. Millions are praying for him. And SATAN would love for Trump to forget that. The biggest trick he could pull would be to get the big head and then follow people off a cliff...
Poor Chris Wallace of Fox News... I think he has a problem like Biden. Only it is intentionally Stupid. Wallace is saying that Trump and Biden is equally bad abort statements and misstatements... IMPOSSIBLE, trumps talks a 1,000 times more Wallace is DUMMY!

So you're going to sit  out this year's election? I don't think Joe is the best thing since sliced bread, but i do believe Trump is a terrible human being and a horribly corrupt president.

my only response is that it really doesnt matter which brilliant woman of color Biden chooses I will vote for him, happily. We dont know who he will ultimately choose so we have to be good with the choice because removing tRump is the goal

The sickness in the White House is infecting our society.
I am betting that Trump does not want the Repubs &amp; Dems to come together. He wants so badly to become a hero in the eyes of America. He is now considered to be a failure, a corrupt non-president, &amp; the GOP done. So he wants to ride in on a Trojan Horse and make an exec decision.
Translation, Democrats reduced price tag of their bill by 50% in order to get something passed, but Republicans are not willing to increase their bill by an equal amount to make sure Americans can survive this. Not exactly shocking.
Absolutely.  So important right now to pray for President Trump and his family and friends.  Apparently there is no limit to the Dems evilness.  I hope he will stay home with double SService and stay out of the public as much as possible.
Dear mr trump I'm 58 never voted this will be my frist time.your the best .but you need to start on ssi us old fork can't live on what were getting it the big talk with all of us old forks or disabled. Want more vote tell the American people your going to raise ssi.

Yup, indeed!  Trump is an inhuman, pompous fool!
He was probably over zealous, Trump is loved by lots of folks and not all are old white men. However, we can agree that throwing out wild tweets and blocking someone before they can reply is weak.
He would listen before trump would! He called for execution of 5 innocent black men. He called mexicans rapists,  asked  blacks what do you gave to lose? As if he know how shitty everyone life is. Name one thing has he criticized whites on? Its all the mexicans fault or blacks.
Ok let just say ill give you that? Ok voting rights gutted nothing from trump. Black lives matter he calls them terrorists.  Wont stand up against  white supremacist. Wont check banks on discrimination against blacks. And a whole slew of other things!
Can anyone show me a picture where Trump has went into the black community and talked with them or interviewed by black media or anything?
WHY would not authorities having allowed years of fake Russia and still being used for the 2020 election, NOT SECRETLY but OPENLY show in detail the evidence of their crookedness. If not,  O' BIDEN and company will be a cause of unfairness against Trump 2020. Don't be unfair!

Pompeo, Kaleigh, Pence saying ‚ÄúPresident Trump has been very clear...‚Äù WHAT? Clear about what.
Why do you act like it was Trump who did wrong,  he has been the only one right you fKn morons
The trump files..you are killing me  this is the best thing EVER!!!!
All of this, of course, after Trump presents a new tone.
The Daily Caller: Trump Signs Another Executive Order Restricting H1B Visa Opportunities WooHoo!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
I other words, Trump has no clue what the reporter said his son was tweeting about.
I find Reeves' Twitter evolution interesting. His language - long threads and appeals to "nuance" - are not Trumpian. The swipes are still there, but hedged in a way that still seems to score with moderates.  It's certainly generating lots of free media, which is Trump 101.
Why doesn't Trump just flash a sign saying ditto to all press questions? His answers are nothing but tinted and tainted garbage.
The progressive wing and the independents will vote for him or not vote at all. His pick won‚Äôt help with that. This election is not about anything except who shows up at the polls this time around. Biden is a horrible candidate, but the anyone but Trump crowd is pretty strong.
This game by trump is total BS! Our children will bring covid19 home to all of us!!
5/22: Trump at a press conference announces he is labeling churches as ‚Äúessential‚Äù and calls for governors to allow their reopening, as well as threatening ‚Äî without authority ‚Äî to ‚Äúoverride‚Äù any governors who fail to do so.
5/21: Trump claims falsely that he was ‚Äúso early. A study suggesting that 36,000 lives could have been saved in the US by implementing social distancing a week earlier. He reportedly ignored security briefings on the coronavirus for weeks.
5/9: Although many states have yet to meet the minimum requirements for reopening based on the White House‚Äôs guidelines, Trump continues to push for the reopening of nonessential businesses.
Is this a parody account? When were Americans ever not productive? They were productive before the Reagan tax cuts, before the Bush tax cuts, before the trump tax cuts. I like parody accounts. Also, what‚Äôs wrong with healthcare for all?
4/30: The Trump administration allows federal ‚ÄúStay at Home‚Äù guidelines to expire. 5/7: The US hits 75,000 reported Covid-19 deaths; the Trump administration elected to shelve detailed reopening guidelines from the CDC.
4/13: Trump claims to have the legal right to overrule governors‚Äô shelter-in-place orders, asserting that the president‚Äôs ‚Äúauthority is total.‚Äù 4/15: The US hits 25,000 reported Covid-19 deaths. 4/28: The US hits 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases.
For all you trump supporters;If you believe this clown,your children will be sick and bring it home!God bless!!
Trump Administration Will Announce Huge $35 Million Housing Grant For Trafficking Victims
3/6: At the CDC headquarters Trump says falsely that anybody that wants a test can get a test. 3/19: Trump incorrectly claims that the (FDA) approved hydroxychloroquine for treating Covid-19. 3/29: Trump said he will have ‚Äúdone a very good job‚Äù if the US avoids 2.2 million dead.
I was a Republican who was against Trump from the get go, but thought Republicans in power would keep him in line. I never dreamed Lindsey Graham and the like would let Trump take our country to this point. Helsinki was the final straw for me. I was done with the Republican party
2/26: Trump appoints Pence to lead the Covid-19 task force; he again downplays the virus. 2/27: Trump predicts that the Covid-19 will disappear ‚Äúlike a miracle.‚Äù 3/5: Trump suggests that closing the US to travel from China helped to keep the number of Covid-19 cases low.  (2)

Watch Live: President Trump gives White House press conference
I'm honestly not sure what thread this is in relation to, therefore I have no comment. If you're talking about our Kurdish allies that Trump left I totally agree
Trump's envoy close to Brazil's leader -- some say too close
THOSE DUMB ASS REPUBLICANS WILL DO ANYTHING &amp; SAY ANYTHING TO MAKE WHAT TRUMP SAYS LOOK LIKE ITS TRUE. TRUMP IS AN IDIOT &amp; THOSE ASS SUCKING REPUBLICANS ARE ACTUALLY ACTING LIKE IDIOTS TOO. THATS WHY THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SEND ALL THOSE LYING PIECE OF SHITS HOME ON ELECTION DAY!
Meadows ask Wolfe to go behind the scenes &amp; listen to Trump‚Äôs mind set. THAT‚ÄôS SETTING THE STAGE TO LIE. IN FACT, MEADOWS IS DEFENDING TRUMP WITH THAT TRUMP FLU/COVID-19 COMPARISON. Republicans are actually Darwinist Believers and Theorist. They believe Lies make them superior.
Right..so who is to Blame? Under Trump a virus infected less than 5 million and under Obama 60 million people got infected. Who did better? The subject is about how the media has turned this political. We are fortunate to not have Obama in office because of the mortality of Covid
you know Trump didn‚Äôt write that. Whoever is ghost posting for him should know Trump wouldn‚Äôt know or at least remember quotation marks on ‚Äúsources.‚Äù
Presidential Crack Head stuff. Trump is loosing his mind!
Let's go with Trump's plan then, oh wait, he doesn't  have one! He won't even let medical experts speak during Corona virus briefings. Yes I am judging because a competent leader would listen to experts and put interest of the public health before ego &amp; money.
Tweeting an opinion piece doesn't count. I want YOU to list the problems Trump has solved.
Literally the only republican that joe Biden would have a chance of beating is Trump, it‚Äôs like a big game, I hate it
True, but not everyone processes things as healthily as you do. I know I allow Trump to get to me, too.
Haake-isms!  My fav was w/ Hallie Jackson on Trump meeting with Kim and subsequent 'love letter':  "They found love in a hopeless place."  ü§£
This is awful and telling about the state of our union with flames that Trump feeds every time he speaks.
Unfortunately, national polls are just indicators of how most Americans feel about Biden v. Trump. That's not how we elect a president, and Republicans are hoping against hope that they can, for the third time this century, win without actually having to persuade the most voters.
Please detail the problems that Trump has solved. I can't think of any!
Trump managed to make sure his CEO buddies and corporations got their share, now Democrat leaders want to protect the american workers &amp; families instead of fund Trumps pet projects. GOP coronavirus bill includes at least $7 billion for weapons programs
Please tell us what Trump tried? He tried to say Covid-19 was a HOAX, he said it would "just go away", he doesn't have national testing strategy 6 months into a pandemic and hospitals are still worried about PPE.
no one NOT drinking the trump koolaide believes any part of that BS.  #VoteBlue2020 #PresidentBiden2020 Few human beings are as mentally comproised as the current president...slurring speach, stumbling, needing 2 hands to drink from a glass, needing a walker to decend a ramp
TRUMP IS SUCH A CONSPIRACY THEORISTS &amp; A BIGGER LIAR. HE WANTS TO BE SOMEBODY SPECIAL SO BAD THAT HE‚ÄôD JUST MAKE UP A LIE IN AN EFFORT TO GET AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING STORY. I WANT TO KNOW WHO WERE THE GENERALS THAT SUGGESTED TO THE PRESIDENT THAT THE BEIRUT INCIDENT WAS AN ATTACK?
We're thinking of it wrong Here's Brian Kemp'S Daughter to let us how stringently Her father and trump have gone over the date to reopen the schools for us #ONEV1    #aNewNormal
At this point I could watch a video of Trump snorting coke off a hookers ass and still vote for that man in November
Honestly though, this will really help Trump win.
I guess I‚Äôm not a #LincolnVoter bc I cant vote for Biden. But as a Republican voter for 18 years, 2016 was the first time I didn‚Äôt vote for the Republican nominee. I for sure won‚Äôt be in 2020 either. As a Christian, Trump is the antithesis of everything I say I believe.
He can't admit he was wrong, it isn't in his DNA to admit he was WRONG.  Thousand of more people will die because Trump did NOTHING and will not do anything. He takes no responsibility and doesn't care. He will lie and distract, but never admit he screw up.
I do think we have to see, as a nation, that it's not just Trump, that he's the mirror in which a lot of us can see our own faces. It took a lot of people making atrocious decisions for a long time now to bring the country to this point.
Astonishingly, they think they can still play this cynical game, getting Mr. Trump in front of EWTN t-v cameras to natter on about Catholics as pro-life  ‚Äî   When we can all see now with our own eyes just what "pro-life" has meant to them all along. It has meant zero. /4
Why does this keep coming up as a defense of Flynn? Obama was *president* when he told the Russian president that he'd have more flexibility after the 2012 election. Might have been cynical, but he wasn't undermining the authority of the sitting president as Flynn did for Trump.
is right - I can smell the rank hypocrisy of Womack's tweet through my phone.   Check out this thread if you wanna see whose side Womack chooses when he faced with doing the right thing or helping Trump get re-elected.
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump    #VoteBlue2020
it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt need to show up and vote for trump since he already won the primary
With Donald Trump, colorful and crazy are synonymous. Red-hats don't know the difference anyway.
How is it that Josh Hawley destroys Yates testimony; then Lindsey Graham claims he corruptly used the FISA BY accident... While Yates HAVE NO pity on Mike Flynn or any one including President Trump.... I wonder what Graham is  really doing? He had done great!
Under Trump, foster youth are no longer forgotten
Must be true since a trump supporter wrote a blog to trumpsplain it
This thread.   encyclopedic knowledge of the Russia investigation and everything surrounding it makes her live tweets indispensable.   Flynn is a liar and a criminal. Just the kind of person Trump likes and wants to help out.
GOP voter since 1984. The weirdness of the extreme Tea Party not getting called out worried me. Then Romney made 47% speech and I realized was writing off many loyal GOP voters. Then Trump happened. Viva Independence!
misplaced...if it didn't happen with Trump who seems to be a textbook case, then not with Joe and I don't care who his VP will be but that person will be more palatable than having Pence in the driver's seat. IMO...
You do realize Trump floated the idea of accepting from the white house right? How is this dofferent?
why do you think Joe is frail and not Trump? They're 3 years apart and Joe may make "gaffes" or misspeak or whatever, DJT flat lies and makes stuff up. Physically he's in bad shape too. You've seen his mechanics.
From the moment Trump was elected I thought about the Mule in Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. Perfect analogy! üòÖüòÖ#Azimov #foundation   The forgotten Trump-like terror lurking in a sci-fi classic  via
Do you guys ever watch/listen to any of Trump‚Äôs interviews? I have a suggestion. Watch the Swan Axios interview. Also Fox Wallace interview. If stumbling/yammering/lying/jibberish were a sport, Trump wins the Super Bowl, all the Olympic Gold Medals and every Open there is.
I may be lost but are you saying they think Trump is more centrist (than Biden) and therefore the lesser of 2 evils...?
How many people have left his administration? Does anyone stay? No wonder the delegates want no press at their "convention!" I think that they don't want Trump to represent that GOP.
says that Trump ‚Äúshould be banished to the dustbin of history‚Äù. The dustbin should also welcome his republican enablers in the Congress.
do you think that Russia can electronically manipulate votes? Maybe this is why Trump doesn't want ballots by mail. He has plan already set and ready to go. #askroland
So you do support trump, no new wars, and soldiers coming home.
MO voters heard their Republican leaders beg them not to expand Medicaid and did it anyway. Trump,  et al better hurry and kill Obamacare or else some more low-income workers might get to see a doctor. #sarcasm
Jimmy Fallon: Trump‚Äôs Latest Interview Made His Briefings Look Good
I mean, if anyone knows about Trump being a source, it would be you, Maggie.
Also, really annoyed at people who are excited to vote for Biden. Aside from ousting Trump, we‚Äôre settling - why are you excited?
points out that the All-Purpose Son-in-Law only gets things done for cronies -- the kind of nepotistic swamp draining that is 100% what Trump voters understood was the top priority, right?  Will Trump fire Jared like he did Parscale? #GOPvalues
Well the second part is true! But you know we wouldn't be in this horrible situation if we had a true leader, instead of Trump!!!! This is now the Trump Virus!!
the 30ish % of Trump supporters (his base) treat that support like worship - no room for dissenters. That has been evidenced time and again from pastors to lay persons..."he's the chosen one"...
your gop/trump hush and do what I say money wont save your seat in Maine... the #GoodPeopleOfMaine know what you are and will always be ...#goptraitor #sellout just resign and spend your "twilight years" in solitude and regret
And, with any luck, so will Trump.
Trump supporters are dumb and racist. No other reason to support him.
Trump brings bar graphs he cannot read to interviews. No one is trying to avoid a debate with him. He lives for public humiliation because he‚Äôs too stupid to realize every time he opens his mouth ignorance comes out.
No greater example of how much less prepared for a job a White man needs to be than a black man than  being followed up by Donald John Trump. I see it everyday. It‚Äôs been on display for 4 years.  The some of a gun couldn‚Äôt be a Mayor with his competency and skill.
Yes! Get RID of Trump!!
Y‚Äôall be on that false balancing shit, the mans a disaster, don‚Äôt soften the criticism. I‚Äôm friends with many republicans and have plenty of moderate left leaning views, I‚Äôm not an extremist, and I value their views tremendously even when I disagree, Trump is irredeemably awful!

Yet you retweet "grab em by the pussy" Donald Trump, a guy who has 22 women who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him?  At least Warnock admitted his estranged relationship with his wife.  Plus, medical officials didn't find injuries to her foot.  You're trolling

Where's the picture with her and trump?
Pres. Trump said the late congressman and civil rights legend John Lewis "made a big mistake" by not coming to his inauguration.
You seem to blame Trump for everything, but you don't want debates and insult millions of people for their opposing viewpoints. Joe Biden is a racist, rapist, created bills that disproportionately incarcerated thousands of black men and he has dementia.
Amazon buyers voted Pence,Trump,&amp; the GOP Senate out of office.
He's a "Christian" but has desecrated the first of the Ten Commandments every day of Trump's presidency. "Thou shall put no other Gods  before me." Everything Jason says and does, is to please Trump. Trump politicized the virus, so did Jason. In doing so, he hurt our state
I love Trump!
The Census will incomplete, therefore a failure by Trump and his incompetent political installs, dismal failures.
Finally after years of putting up with the trump cronies the media is calling them out for their shit FINALLY
Someone make this Trump doing this with all of Biden‚Äôs nonsense and you‚Äôd have your Oscar.
And remember states' revenues are already tanking due to the mismanagement &amp; absence of a coordinated federal response to COVID-19. Now, trump gets to decide how to distribute funds and assistance to states and localities.
It's got trump's campaign slogan front and center. It makes the wearer a walking billboard for the trump campaign.
Can we dub Monty Python over all Trump interviews from here on out?
why haven‚Äôt you had  featured on your show? At least Trump can take your constant criticism. He doesn‚Äôt care! Jimmy I‚Äôve followed you since SNL years ‚ÄúCorksoakers‚Äù days on  .  don‚Äôt make Jimmy do this. It‚Äôs just content.
Go figure üòí it's Donald Trump, that is his M.O.I‚Äôve said this every since he said he was running.  This is a plan by trump. Get him in the ballot to pull votes from Biden.
It is only human nature..you can push and push but I have to tell you..Trump has a strong will and is determined more than ever..all this pushing makes one dig deeper into doing what‚Äôs right..he will continue the fight for this country...I believe it!
Yes.  is willing to put our educators and children in danger in hopes to hear ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù üêï from Trump.
I know you think your proving he doesn't mean what he says but do we really want a Trump executive order healthcare plan? Probably not.
I think a nice tight race is more fun. Either way Trump will call for a recount spending more taxpayer money on himself. #golf
I'm not sure what happened in Niger but are we sure he had nothing to do with the Romanian fake Trump supporting group on Facebook?
Then why aren't deaths or hospitalizations at zero because Trumps poison pill is readily available all over the US? Maybe it's because it's doesn't work. Stop enabling false cures so Trump can make money off American deaths.
You realize that over 150,000 people are dead because Trump is a failure right?  Right??
The real Donald Trump subsides and then continue to take two Ester-C tablets each day to keep your immune system strong Ester-C can be found on the VC shelf at Walmart and maybe at other stores also if it works for you too please pass it on to others
The real Donald Trump
What‚Äôs your point?  That wasn‚Äôt his statement.  Biden is not a good candidate.  It wasn‚Äôt about who is less likeable.  Trump is the better presidential candidate and it‚Äôs not really close.
Really. You would still vote for trump if he chooses a VP candidate you don‚Äôt agree with.  Did you agree with trump on his VP pick of pence
Hating Trump doesn‚Äôt mean you have to vote for Biden. They‚Äôre both pieces of shit. Look into the independent candidates
So my outrage is directed to people like you. You would rather write in a name and let Trump win again. I understand the importance of a VP but your thought process borders stupidity.
Who‚Äôs going to vote for Trump ‚Äòjust because‚Äô it‚Äôs not Biden?
oh wow..projection, once again. trump is speaking of himself.
I would say Biden has been to church more times in the last year than trump has in his entire life
when and how did trump die? who won the 2020 election? when was #Med4All adopted? so many questions...
Tom Cotton issues threats and inappropriate comments against working americans increased by a magnitude of holy cow since Trump has been in office.
Well that's very true but the only way Trump is going to be taken out of office is if we vote November 3rd. The GOP is complicit &amp; will do absolutely nothing. It will be a hoax &amp; libs just hating on Trump. We have to vote this man out of office.
I don't think it's about Trump although I wouldn't complain if it is.  Perfect timing for them to charge Trump would be mid to late October üòâ
I understand, but please vote Trump then. Love him or hate him we need him in the WH. Please reconsider. Have a blessed day.
Yes, but CA is what gave Hillary the popular vote in 2016. That has been used by Democrats to try to delegitimize Trump‚Äôs Presidency. It‚Äôs important the President wins both.
We really need to watch Illegal-fornia this time. If it wasn‚Äôt for that state Trump would have won the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. Democrats would not have won back the House in 2018 without the state either.
They really thought that Hillary was going to get it, then scrambled when she didn't. Nothing has been peaceful from the Democrat party since Trump took office..
Yes but just makes you wonder how much Graham is involved in all this...he talks a big game..expected much more from him..a failure to Trump and nothing but a showboat to the rest of us
The Latinx man running for Fayetteville City Council Ward 1 is a Trump supporter who has horrible opinions on the Undocumented Community and will not be getting my support. He shouldn‚Äôt get yours either.
Poor baby! Now she knows how Trump people felt during BO years.
The real one. Trump is unpredictable and I like that! Keeps other countries on their toes.
2020 has been so rough I‚Äôm listening to Christmas music in August. Needing that feeling Christmas brings. Also ready for Trump to be voted out.
They're concerned with working Americans taxes, and they want us to pay more, and more, and more. Trump's tariffs were working, alleviating the need for higher Taxes..
he is in trump's pocket. he doesn't care that children will die.
Why chucky and Donald Trump kinda look alike ?! I swear just give em Orange hair ..
That Land Grabbing Act was heavily Democrat sponsored, with some Republicans who colluded with them. Now they're claiming Trump is land-grabbing when it was their bill.. How's that work..ü§î
Trump sounds like a clueless person trying to redeem an expired coupon for a nickel off a can of soup in a supermarket. #unbelievable #DumpTrump
Yes, and on the same day that Trump says, ‚ÄúIt is what it is,‚Äù when asked about the deaths of Americans. üôÑ Priorities are so screwed up, people being considered ‚Äúhuman capital stock.‚Äù  has been putting the economy ahead of people‚Äôs health and safety this whole time.
Trump will blame governors
That would be Trump overseeing it.  That's exactly what he said on the last PPP that came out. That he would be the oversight on distribution of funds.
My favorite part about the Trump Axios interview. Trump (when talking about Corona cases): ‚ÄúThe US is lowest in numerous categories, we‚Äôre lower than the world!‚Äù Interviewer: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lower than the world?!? What does that mean?‚Äù
I'm smart enough to demand #Med4All before I give him my vote. Getting rid of Trump is not a good enough reason for me to vote Biden.
there is only ONE reason to vote for Biden. to get rid of Trump. if Biden was smart, he would be for #Med4All - the only reason I would vote for him.
‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù - that is Trump‚Äôs response to 159,000 Americans dying of Covid-19.   Do you know where I‚Äôve heard the phrase ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù the most?  On Judge Judy. When they interview the LOSER in the hallway after the case. They almost always say, ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù
President Trump should be careful of what he signs. Big Democrat support for this, which should be a Big Red Flag. As usual there are republican colluders, that's the bipartisanship that we do not support...
No, the Axios interview is not going to change anybody's mind. But it's still nice when every now and then Trump gets a good interviewer, and I get to remind myself that I'm not crazy and the president really is just a doddering old fool.
America wake up Trump is a traitor and now he is murdering American citizens with his constant disinformation on COVID. Now he wants to infect all our children who will bring COVID home with them. JUST SAY NO!
Trump put his kid in the mix when he said Baron wants to go to school so he demanded all schools open. So all our children can get infected. Also Barons school refused to open so no, Barron isn't in school right now.
Thank you President Trump for all you do and all you TRY to do with no help from the rest of our government and the lying media. MAGA 2020
You just finding this out?  That was a given before they wrote the legislation and Trump signed it into law.  You just got to get smarter and ahead of them rather than always playing catch up.
I'm sorry but Donald Trump has NEVER had a grasp on reality.
Could it be that Trump calling this virus a hoax, anti-mask, poison pill cure, open the economy, open sporting events, open schools, open churches,  was louder than the voice of the CDC, who bent over to his disinformation?
Conservatives aren't wearing masks or social distancing and are literally fighting for the right to infect themselves and the rest of the country for Trump.
Overconfident? They bought the disinformation campaign spread by REPUBLICANS from top to bottom. Trump is trying to kill Americans. WTFU Trump cult, the rest of the country is wondering why you allowed yourself to become COVID spreaders.
Would that be like what a Trump family poll?  They just barely like him too.
for me to vote for Biden, I want #Med4ALL at the very least. if he can't do that, I will not give him my vote. I would actually vote for crazy trump right now if he gave us Medicare for All.
Absolutely not true. I‚Äôm not a Trump fan at all but impeached is not convicted. If I‚Äôm indicted but found not guilty or if the case is dismissed it‚Äôs as if it never happened in the eyes of the law. Same way with impeached but acquitted

The Trump Flotilla...üòâüá∫üá∏üëç
Trump and his flying monkeys keep promoting social gathering. Demanding the economy, schools and churches open while pushing propaganda on mask wearing. What did he say in the beginning about what happens if we let everybody get COVID?
Notice they're all indulging in the Legal Drug of choice...üòí God bless Trump for being a sober President..üòâüá∫üá∏üëç
We need to start asking ourselves why Trump wants the USA in a weakened state by continually pushing Americans to Social gather during COVID. Most local churches are steaming live services on Sunday so no, churches weren't shut down.
In direct comparison, yes.  My concern with Biden is to what degree he lets the mega progressives drive the legislation.  Free college, loan debt relief, allowing non citizens to vote, reversing trade reform, etc will do more damage than another 4 years of Trump.  (IMHO)
All I can say about Alexander Vindman is fuck this dude!..sorry for being blunt...and shame on the military leadership for failing to do an AR15-6 on this guy!..he has opened the door for so much..not my military anymore
De-Trump-ification
Her plan is over there with Trump's plan.  I have a plan, shut this shithole country down for 9-13 weeks.  Pay every citizen 2k per month.  Every citizen goes and cleans 2 days a week for that.  Something in return.  We need out of the box thinking while waiting for virus to go.
Tell Trump to fire their a$$es!
U. Donald Trump occupies Donald Trumps head. He could never break through his ego to communicate with anyone but his imaginary friends.
Trump got rid of the Fair Housing Rule to try to get suburban White votes ‚Äî and also because he‚Äôs racist and detests poverty.  But he‚Äôll keep the evangelical vote because he‚Äôs just so darn Christ-like.  ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù unless they‚Äôre poor.
Biden only looks ok b/c you‚Äôre comparing him to Trump.  He‚Äôs not even remotely competent, which why his handlers won‚Äôt let him be interviewed.  Covid is NOT the reason you don‚Äôt see him campaigning.  There are/were better choices for the Dem nominee.
Trump doesn't bow to Dictators. We had that disgrace for 8 long embarrassing years...
So Trump is removing our Troops and now Germany protesting without masks because of conspiracy group got them out there. Coincidence?
Nope, Trump actually blocked it. Terrifying precedent to set here
Never was, never will.  Not for Trump either.  First time in my life I feel like my vote hasn't been earned by either party.  It isn't free.  Sell me on your ideas.  What ideas?  How to make the rich get richer.  That isn't an idea.  It's a way of life in politics.  Both parties.
They've been desperate every since Trump announced he was running as a Republican candidate for president.

Trump and his republican flying monkeys are killing Americans by constantly sewing confusion about this virus and promoting his poison pill that has been shown over and over again to be ineffective. Corticosteroids is what helped these patients.
78% of COVID survivors end up with heart defects. Getting COVID is going to ruin these players whole careers. Let alone college sports. Why we keep following Trump &amp; Republicans into more cases and deaths I really don't know.

I have been interested in Trump Venezuela since I heard Lev Parnas say Bolton was really pissed about Rudy Giuliani's dealings with Venezuela. Its worse than Ukraine, I can feel it.
Apparently you don't speak GYM, he wants the good doctor to be quiet when Trump is bragging about drinking bleach, etc.  You just don't understand Gymspeak.
We already have them, but the GOP ignored everything in order to stay in power.  That is about to end.  We can Trump-proof.  It's called educated voters.  Teach civics in school again so the next gen understands the constitution and how it works.
Make no mistake. Trump isn't trying to get re-elected to be President. He's trying to get re-elected to stay out of prison.  He gives no shits about any of us. At all.
The more I look at what's happening, the more I keep going back to reading about the U.N.. Barry's hangout, because Communists are all about global government. Trump threw a wrench in their plans, then we got hit by the #PelosiVirus .ü§î OWG = NWO
Who do we think is getting this virus in the South? Trump is killing his supporters by pushing anti mask agenda, amongst opening the economy and schools.
Everyone isn't spreading it, people refusing to wear masks are getting it and spreading it. 78% of people who survive it have heart damage so great job being a flying monkey helping Trump to continue the spread.
And what will people like Mr. Axelrod say when Trump wins and wins BIG?
everyone else calls it the trump virus.

Somebody better order Trump some Sharpies. It‚Äôs hurricane season.
I am continually amused at those who think I‚Äôm a fan of Trump because I take exception the senile candidate that the Dems nominated.  Not a Trumper and didn‚Äôt  vote for him.  But the Dems screwed up royally by nominating Joe.  He could actually lose.
All he wanted to do was to make Americans secure and able to prosper again. His plan was working before we were hit by the #PelosiVirus .. If that hadn't happened, suspiciously when it did, Trump's re-election was secure. Now the Left uses it as a weapon.
It's now called U.N. Agenda 2030. Electing Trump for president threw a Huge wrench in their plans. Then came the #PelosiVirus and the Globalists are feeling empowered to make their move on the USA. If they win, people will never know Freedom again..üò†
These idiots come out their inbred woodwork, don‚Äôt bother with facts, can‚Äôt admit that his skin color was and still is, their real problem with him. Trump has sold this country out to Russia, N. Korea, but you don‚Äôt see the outrage. Wonder why?
After going to the Trump Rally in Tulsa.
just found out my favorite teacher is a trump supporter not doing well at all luvGot to do that research!!
Reporter just said people at the Trump presser are breaking the NJ law by not wearing masks. Trump says this is a peaceful protest and not subject to mask rules. Right or wrong Trump throws this crap right back in reporters faces each day. People like that about Trump.
I feel like you went ‚Äúall in‚Äù today with a king high flush and heard ‚Äúcall‚Äù and the republicans turned over the nut flush. Literally Biden hiding in a basement trying not to mess up this election. While you and Schumer got Trump re-elected this week
OH MY GOD UPDATE THE TRUMP EZ UP PLACE IS JUST A TRUMP MERCH TENT WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON WHY
Well I personally try not to get to involved in politics, but from what it seems, Joe Biden is constantly rambling and doesn‚Äôt seem like he knows what he is talking about, honestly I don‚Äôt think Trump is much better at all, but he is better imo. Thank you for asking respectfully!
Are you in favor of a TikTok ban?
As a republican, I do believe Trump would run this country better than Biden, but I do not believe that either are great leaders at all
Them darn testing machines are just like the 8 ball that answers a question. Trump 2020
Woo now don‚Äôt start spreading that science around here. Fake doctors, fake virus, fake fake fake. Woo go Trump. Science and doctors are dumb
PRAY NOW  If you read this, pray for President Trump. The enemy wants to remove him immediately. Pray against this assignment. We need him in 4 more years. Cover him in protection now.
i think august 27 is the simpsons episode where trump diesüò≠
But what if Trump issues executive order today about UI? That‚Äôs not helping the democrats support
Haley is just another Trump sychophant.
Yes your right. See the republicans along with Trump have found an opening to steal this election back. They had lost the unemployed but now they seem to be the only party serious about extending the benefit at all. They now offered 2 weeks at full $600 and it was rejected by dem
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
This man was big enough to admit he implied something other than what he was trying to say. Not once have I EVER heard Trump admit he was wrong or offer an apology in any way! Your stance makes no logical sense if your supporting Trump! Facts matter and he has proven his racism !
Intel: US says there‚Äôs no ‚Äòwinning side‚Äô in Libya  via
My Trump supporting cousin simply, flatly denies that Trump is racist. It's impossible to argue with someone who thinks that way.
I‚Äôm back on the Trump train!!! Sorry I took a dip in liberal land. Found out they don‚Äôt give a f about the people on UI. Pelosi and her strategy cost me $1200 over the last 2 weeks because she wouldn‚Äôt take an extension
If you're referring to Trump, that is not what he said.! He had commented that places like Maryland, needed to be cleaned up.! They were rat-infested, and it's not right.!        The people agreed with him.!! The money is not going as it should.!
You were bought out years ago along with every other republican in office. Worry about your state! Sure, Trump daddy is talking you up because that‚Äôs how he controls you, but evidence shows you are failing your constituents miserably. You can tell you aren‚Äôt up for re-election.
I don‚Äôt give a f about all that other s. Pass the UI extension. Why did you deny 2 weeks of extensions. You cost me $1200. Trump going to issue executive action I‚Äôm gojng to have to vote for that orange dude. What is wrong with y‚Äôall
Does anyone know what executive actions the president is planning to take tomorrow. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm sitting around hoping Donald Trump May actually try to help poor people tomorrow. #GTH2020
Does anyone have any idea what executive actions the president plans to take tomorrow? Can‚Äôt even believe I‚Äôm holding out hope that Donald Trump can somehow rescue the American people. 2020 can go to heck
She‚Äôs not doing Biden any favors by handing Trump the unemployed vote when he issues executive order on UI
This statement does not make you look smart I less you want Trump to be reelected. And that's not smart either.
just passed an ez up on the side of the road with blue life matter flags and trump flags and i almost threw up UR KIDDING I HATE IT HERE
Did Obama offer any? That's right, he didn't.!! Stop pushing the blame on Trump.!! The Democratic party is getting exactly what they want.!! Everyone broke, scared, complying with their BS!!
If you think schools should be reopening in the fall but decided that ‚Äúhomeschooling them is the best option for your family‚Äù, you don‚Äôt think the schools are safe, you just don‚Äôt want to admit Trump is wrong.
to    I love all the people trying to help our country. Support Trump! First time I have ever put stickers on my car! My face mask is awesome! I am doing all I can. People are meSm and flip me off and give me looks
Obama did nothing productive. Trump made America every great thing it is now!
Your Daddy dearest is handing Joe the job on a silver platter with his conspiracy theories and his sorry ass excuses on why he has failed America during this deadly pandemic crisis and every other crisis while he has been in office! Everything Trump touches fails!! #LiarInChief
I still think Trump will not debate.
The president said he wants to extend the $600 weekly benefit to unemployed Americans.
HOW SAD IS THIS? TRUMP SAYS: IT IS WHAT IT IS! WTF! HE HAS GOT TO GO!!
Just like Trump‚Äôs Tax Plan is disastrous for American workers or should I say Tax Scam?
It‚Äôs funny how reporters who support Trump are even laying the ground work for him to dispute the loss!üôÑ MAIL IN VOTING ANS ABSENTEE VOTING ARE THE SAME THING!!!!
When Trump wins there will be a response to lots of things going on right now.
Gov Asa *the media wants your kids home not in school and you to be home not at work. This is all for Nov 3rd. If Biden wins the narrative will be turned to "how many have recovered not how many sick" If Trump wins it will be end of days talk as we have now but kicked up a notch
democrats bad, republicans good If you assume this simple-minded framework you can make a lot more sense of Trump's syphilitic ramblings.
The government won‚Äôt supply enough test kits to check staff and residents beyond an initial couple of rounds.
Trump is not just Politics.
Im not a Trump fan at all but listen to what he is saying. He didnt say Big deal about that. He was in mid sentence.
Hey, what does Trump‚Äôs chair taste like? I‚Äôd imagine it tastes like Cheetos, Goya beans, and leather, but I won‚Äôt know unless I ask someone who‚Äôs actually put their lips to his backside.
Literally it‚Äôs getting sad I have to even remove family members on social media because of their bigoted views. No one ever said someone was a racist because of their religion. We call you a racist because you‚Äôre a bigot. If you vote for trump your a racist. That‚Äôs it. #Resister
a sketch with Trump and Biden having a debate, the environment is exactly like a debate with moderators and everything but it turns out to be WWE Smackdown and the moderators provide professional commentary.
Better yet, how many people vote for Kanye because they hate trump and Biden is too sleepy to run a country? ü§î
Trump Says He'll Help with Funeral Costs for Slain Soldier Vanessa Guillen
Gov Asa Andrew from AP school reopen what is number to make you stop this stupid decision to open schools? Natl Gov Assoc meeting your goals and will this be a counter to Trump? The NGA is a strong voice to help set agenda nationally. I will be chair next year.
No Statesman like GOP leader to step up and take the lead? Any Democrat would be rebuffed? They'll just let the illness spread with no plan? No Statesmen left since the death of John McCain? (Except maybe Romney) Clearly GOP means Party over Country. And Trump isn't a Republican.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me. But I am excited to see Trump finally throw #DrBirx under the bus. I was really starting to wonder if her sleeping in the White House and then supporting the Trump admin was more than just politics. I was afraid of a presidential love triangle in the WH #2020
Trump is taking social security out of America this crook is going to continue doing this until we no longer have social security and Medicare. You think the coronavirus was bad.
‚Å¶ I wanted to send this private, but couldn‚Äôt. I got my ‚Å¶ cap. Love it, but saddened when I tore off the tag. It was made in China. I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall are changing things. Trump rocks!
The south definitely supports President Trump and prolife. There are so liberals here but we outnumber them keep up the good work.
So since there are only two choices, you are helping Trump win, thus nullifying your own handle of socialist. Are you changing it to Nazi or communist since you are helping Trump?
You mean REAL TRUMP FACTS. Those are different than facts in the real world. Thank you President Obama!
The rich got richer under Trump. The poor stayed poor but they got something in return. They were given the right to spread their racist hate in open. They were empowered by Trump. Racism was no longer confined to their home living room but was set free on Main Street
So you are trying to turn people against Biden and toward Trump? And what exactly do you stand for again?
Nope,  Trump
You should really research before jumping aboard! Trump had nothing to do with JE after he was arrested.!! He helped bring down the evil.!!
If we lose trump this year I give it two years before our country‚Äôs a communist country.
Reminder, Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are two different things to Trump and his cult.
Never has a president turned the military on the civilian population. If and president was forced with that decision they would have pain stakingly struggled with a decision like that. Trump relishes in it and immediately chooses to do the unfathomable. His supporters silent
That‚Äôs Trumps America. He empowers all the uneducated to speak. These people used to remain silent. Now they feel their hate is mainstream thanks to Trump. That easily makes him the worst president ever
You want to talk about the weather today, I‚Äôll tell you how Trumps a draft dodger, you want to talk about how your wife left, I want to talk about how Trump raped a 13 year old, you want to talk about baseball, I want to talk about how Trumps the lousiest president in history.
wth that gotta do w/ trump? üòÇ
The FBI was repeatedly dropping the ball on investigating it because those the investigation would lead to control the FBI.  People like Trump know this.
So just because 2 trump supporters are wearing nazi masks that means all trump supporters are also Nazis?
It has been proven in some of the cases.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Trump is doing what he said he would!  Cleaning out the swamp.!! Just as hydroxychloroquine, Trump told everyone it would work, but Demorats!! Don't want to hear of it.!! Why?
Wait, did Trump just endorse eating the rich? What is happening?
NEW DETAILS: Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.
You usually only see Republicans that no longer hold office go against Trump.
Reminder that the Trump and his cult think Obamacare is bad and the Affordable Care Act is good.
Finally, I agree with something Trump said!!  'Nobody likes me,' Trump complains, as even his allies fade
Former co-worker. FB rants about the evils of the left and her love for Trump. Finally had it out on FB when I fact-checked her. I realized the friendship was always toxic and I'm better off. Anyone that you have to censor yourself for just to keep peace, not worth it.
I totally agree! MOSCOW MITCH AND LAZY LINDSEY HAVE TO BE ON THAT  PLANE WITH TRUMP! TOM COTTON TOO!!
It went POOF because he is clueless like everyone Trump surrounds himself with! He and his clueless cabinets members are responsible for 150,000 Americans death! They thought it was a hoax! Trump dismantled Obama‚Äôs pandemic team and replaced it with Kushner and his friends! POOF!
Don‚Äôt be president!!!.. please trump 2020
What!!! Are you serious !?! Did Donald Trump commute his sentence too? Geez what‚Äôs with that guy.
Trump for President again
Took his team to an NFC championship. Did you see that kid play at Nevada. The way he played football basically ushered in the QB option in college. Up until him it was an urban Meyer gimmick
‚ÄúAs far as TikTok is concerned, we‚Äôre banning them from the United States,‚Äù Trump said.
Every morning. I wake up and think. Today is the day I get on Twitter and find 0% support for the Trump agenda. I really thought the death of Herman Cain would be the nail in the coffin. The wake up call you guys desperately needed. But I‚Äôm afraid y‚Äôall are so numb it‚Äôs too late
Every morning I wake up and think today‚Äôs the day. The day I get on twitter and Trump and the conservatives have lost all support. I thought Herman Cain dying would be the nail in the coffin. But you people are so numb. Nothing will ever wake you up.
If Trump loses, let‚Äôs make him legally forced to live in the White House for all of Biden‚Äôs term. Imagine him having to remember his worst failure &amp; overhear Biden undo his laws and fix his screwups. I think that‚Äôd be torture for him, especially since we know he‚Äôll never see jail
They let this dude back on Twitter. Go racist on someone else‚Äôs social media site. Can‚Äôt y‚Äôall just start an app called snowman. For all the white supremicists and Trump supporters. Y‚Äôall can spread your disinformation and fake facts over there on that platform. It‚Äôll be biggly
Did you hear Obama speak? Omg it was so refreshing. Even listening to Bush and Clinton was so refreshing. I had almost forgotten how much dignity the office holds. Trump has got to go. Reagan, 2 Bushs, Clinton, Obama, and now this. I miss having an eloquent president
How does Trump have so many failed businesses and still call himself a great business mind
Why I hate Donald Trump  #ImpotusAmericanus.
PLEASE let them be in the same room with Obama off to the side so trump can‚Äôt help but see him!
I think you need to do a little research on the term ‚Äúexpert‚Äù or better yet look at the death count from Florida for the last 3 days and get ready. It‚Äôs coming to your community too. Your not immune
Although I am a republican I have never been the biggest fan of Donald Trump, however this is why we should want him for next year! He isnt stupid and he won‚Äôt defund our police!
Lots of us were counting on checks this month. Remember screw the unemployed but you still want your check. F U. No unemployment no stimulus
Every one said Herman Cain was a brilliant business mind. He‚Äôs dead today because he let politics cloud his good judgement
I feel sorry for them to be honest. They decided to get involved in politics and cost them their careers
You guys remember Colin Kaepernick. He had talent. But nobody wanted to deal with the PR.
So far everyone who I know in hospital administration says it wouldn‚Äôt matter if she was brilliant she‚Äôs a PR nightmare. They don‚Äôt want to deal with it.
I agree. Both sides had done this. Trump wanted a new FBI building put into the bill so his hotels value would go up. The democrats won‚Äôt pass a UI exten because they know once they do they‚Äôll never get anything else passed. Like stimulus checks
That‚Äôs good. Because if she‚Äôs going to go look for unemployment she won‚Äôt find it. She can thank her party. I‚Äôm sure on the Dr salary she‚Äôs got some real bills to pay. $600 a week plus would‚Äôve helped her tremendously

I‚Äôm with ya. And it was completely irresponsible of him, Trump, and everyone who went without a mask(or even with one). But it doesn‚Äôt warrant celebrating someone‚Äôs death, as a majority of the commentors to his tweet were doing.
Read the comments. I‚Äôm pro-BLM just like the guy who tweeted this. But you can‚Äôt tweet like he died because he supports Trump.  If it would‚Äôve been a politician on the other side, a tweet like this wouldn‚Äôt have happened
Trump is a fascist - AND - NATO should have disbanded at the end of the Cold War. A poorly sourced Afghan government rumor about Russians should not be used to delay removing U.S. troops from Afghanistan.
Their logic is that if there is a handful of bad apples that are trump supporters then that automatically makes every single trump supporter racist, a white supremacist, and they hate every black person they see.
Probably? Beyond the scope of my knowledge. Still, i'm not resting my hopes on the effectiveness of the DeSantis and DeWine administrations or their willingness to stand up to the Trump administration.
No, and why would it?   If Trump is going to forego Democracy to keep his position, why would voting help?
contracted not long after attending Trump's rally in Tulsa... Can't be related, right?
Another RWNJ TRUMPER bites the dust. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL WINNING. More Trump rally's are needed asap.
HERMAN CAIN GAVE HIS LIFE TO ATTEND A TRUMP RALLY INSIDE WITH NO DISTANCING OR MASKS. THAT RALLY CAUSED A SPIKE OF CASES IN TULSA WITHIN 1-2 WEEKS AFTER LOW ATTENDED RALLY. HOW MANY GAVE THEIR LIVES TO BE BORED OUR OF THEIR MINDS? TRUMP SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER!
Trump is the master at trolling and this will indeed give the media something to talk about for the next 24 hours. You really never know his long game or short game but its something we will never see again.
HEY TRUMPERS, TIRED OF WINNING YET.   DIE TRUMP!
President Trump floating the idea of delaying the elections. What do you think?
Does Trump realize 95% of all Americans hate him for his stupidity &amp; lack of leadership during this pandemic. Other than ULTRA GREEDY REPUBLICANS &amp; PROUD LOUDMOUTHED RACIST everyone else &amp; some of then JUST WISH YOU WOULD DIE so we can look forward to being normal again.
Trump needs to just DIE!
DIE TRUMP!
Just DIE Trump!
TRUMP'S NUMBER 1 IN SOMETHING. THE WORST ECONOMY 2ND QUARTER IN HISTORY. ONLY WAY I SEE THE USA GETTING A HANDLE ON THIS VIRUS &amp; THEN OUR ECONOMY BACK WORKING IS IF YOU JUST DIE!
Arkansas loves Trump! And You Judge  Jeanine‚ù§Ô∏è
And he was born in Hawaii, last I checked that wasn‚Äôt an Arabic country. And if other people‚Äôs words are enough, what about the 2 young women with protective orders against trump cited in the original Epstein case in regards to his sexual misconduct?
Trump literally just advocated for segregation, if you want to argue that it wasn‚Äôt racist segregation, fine. We‚Äôll just call it what it is at it‚Äôs core aside from the racist implications, it‚Äôs another man from a rich family publicly expressing hate for the poor.
Trump just endorsed a doctor who said STDs were spread by people having sex with demons and witches in their dreams and that the cure for COVID was derived from Alien DNA saying she was a ‚Äúbrave warrior of truth‚Äù. And what evidence do you have Obama was Muslim?
Thats a gross assumption.  I'm 30, never graduated from college, and live in the south, but I never voted for Trump.

The key is to find the intellectually honest. If you like Trump and can‚Äôt criticize him. I can‚Äôt listen to you. If you hate Trump and can‚Äôt see ANY good in what he‚Äôs done, I feel the same.
The definition of a hypocrite is a Trump supporter trashing Clinton's morals.
No it's  not.  it's been used for ages, only become bad because Trump said it &amp; he votes by mail himself.  He is fooling people like you don't believe what trump say.  He is a bad person.  Don't follow him, please

Tammy, you need to look at what is really being done not what Trump say is being done.He is a chronic lier and lie daily with over 150 thousand dead because he neglected his duties as a president. With false treatment offer.
Chris Ruddy, your head is so far up Trump's a ** until you can't see the truth.  Yes , he gave money to help but he had to be pressured and egg on to do it. On his own, he is clueless on what to do, then retreated some crap for a woman really sex with aliens.

Right. If hydroxycloroquine is the answer, then Trump would be correct and they just can't have him being correct. Listen up, America. Trump is correct! Hydroxycloroquine, zinc, and azithromax would probably  control the virus, then there would be no need for a vaccine!

Not only is a typical stupid Trump lie, but, okay, yes it's less lethal for kids, but that's how they get to spread it to vulnerable parents and grandparents. A basic virus goal is to not kill the host so it can SPREAD.  Trump really is that stupid.

Gives Trump plausible deniability. "Yeah Pompeo told me he already took care of whatever that Russia thing was".
A federal judge has dismissed Oregon Cattlemen's Association's challenge of the Trump administration's Clean Water Act rule.

‚ÄòSit down‚Äô: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô #SmartNews that and wants to take away GOD as a practicing Catholic! This guy just gets NOTHING right
Trump is literally on his way to his golf resort right now.
Also the NRA is a fraudulent organization and doesn‚Äôt actually do anything helpful, like the Trump administration, yet lead poisoned dipshit boomers keep supporting them both for some reason.
The only person who has actually taken away anything weapons related in almost 30 years was your bitch ass.  Biden sucks but anyone who thinks Trump‚Äòs pro 2A are fudd cucks who probably use .45 acp rounds as butt plugs

It still astounds me that the newsworthy event that happened in Niger was not a bigger scandal in the media than it was.
Ready to come join Q? Blackouts, explosions, trump saying that. He knows about all of it. Trump knows everything.
President Trump should have the DOJ and the Sheriff Association deputize the returned Veterans as Posse members through the United States Marshals office. The U.S. Marshals under the A.G. has the LEGAL STATUS of the U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. All LEGAL! OATHS MADE, OATHS KEPT!
And trump is over in there country dancing with them. The world is laughing at us.
‚ÄúI take no responsibility.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù  ‚Äî both comments by Donald J. trump.
This is not fair.  I have zero cognitive challenges.  I am not suffering from his brain morbidity.  All of my nerve synapses are firing, unlike Trump's.  But I don't know how to pronounce coccyx.  Definitely not fair.
Yes.  It is just South of Trump's Grabland.
The only viable running mate is Donald Trump.  They think and act alike and have respect from the same people.

Buy Whirlpool appliances, AMERICAN MADE with AMERICAN WORKERS! Pay the difference! Families need employment. President Trump has kept his Promises, except one. Hillary Clinton has escaped prosecution so far. Let's see if AG BARR/DURHAM can close that deal! Satisfaction needed.
I voted for Dr. Carson in the Arkansas Presidential Primary 2016, and then "CITIZEN KANE" Donald J Trump for the PRESIDENCY! I WASN'T GOING TO VOTE for CLINTON BUSH DIE-NASTIES! That was a stinky proposition! Dr.Carson and Donald Trump was running against the MARXIST/GLOBALIST!
4 more years!!!! Trump is the man!
Sadly that‚Äôs a pipe dream at this state of the country I hope to mix in a different party later but I don‚Äôt wanna chance it with Trump and the country in the shape its in
Trump blames China, Democrats, Obama, previous presidents and administrations...etc.  My Dad once told me that the difference between a winner and a loser is that a loser has a good excuse for not winning.
Trump will always and forever be a fraud
Would love some Biden/Trump polling crosstabs on people who reuse plastic deli meat containers.
Are the signatures legitimate? They should be checking in every state he attempts to file in. We need to keep letting it be known he's a GOP stooge as well...Voter's should be offended Kanye and Trump are trying to trick them.

#HumanDecency must return and trump is not that nor his sycophants like Cotton or Cruz or now Graham. It will take the Republican Party a while to repair their reputation ~ let‚Äôs not forget what Mitch McConnel has done and many did to dishonor your father! I won‚Äôt!

Trump is the swamp
Trump mentioned HCQ during a presser &amp; the media and opposing party went nuts &amp; took an adversarial position. Then they dug in.  Let the medical community figure it out. Keep politics out of medicine.  HCQ: Rita Wilson Karen Whitsett Amy Klobuchar
Choice between pt and physician yes, but politicization of HCQ is on Trump administration as well as masks and testing. These are BASIC public health measures in most EVERY other country, but fought here with willful ignorance and violence.

Kanye West Reveals His 2020 Running Mate ‚Å¶ why are you letting trump and his operatives put you on the ballots? You are getting used? Why would any self respecting man allow that? What will you tell you kids?I was used and I let it happen?

Omg Trump does not have the intelligence to debate nor the facts. He will  used blaming and bullying and bottom level tactics to make himself look good . He will never answer a question. Even double dosing on his adderal won‚Äôt help.
Oops you mistakenly used Biden ‚Äòs name where trump‚Äôs name should go.
Is that the trump non- science you are referring to?
I‚Äôm guessing they swept the system trying to get rid of Trump‚Äôs claim that kids were immune and your tweet got caught in the friendly fire.

Trump has violated the Hatch Act so many times. Heck if they thought of it they would violate Arlington National Cemetery and do it there too. Republicans do not care about rules, decorum or acts of law. The GOP is a corrupt organization.

Nope. Trump has been ruining US diplomatic relationship and 4 years of his madness are enough. The grown ups will return to White House Jan 2020 and constructive dialogue with Iran can be resumed. Trump administration is full of dangerous war mongers and fools.
I‚Äôm a Christian Conservative/have always voted Republican. Bc my faith dictates my vote, there is no way I could ever vote for Donald Trump. There is absolutely nothing Christian about him whatsoever - he‚Äôs used and manipulated people of faith for 3 1/2 years now. #Lincolnvoter
My favorite are those accusing physicians of somehow "turning their nose up"  at HCQ because "Trump invented it", as if it wasn't something they already prescribed. They really are children.
after watching your interview with Trump you proved you are an embarrassment to the trade.  When did you become more important than POTUS?  Disgusting. Time/Warner. Pffft.
Dude. Pick one thing the GOP and Trump have done and then show me when the Dems did the same. Let me go first. Merrick Garland is not on the Supreme Court. Trump has used his power to keep his co defendants out of jail. Federal agents grab people with NO Prob Cause
I would a special counsel to review Barr, Trump, Munchkin and others who had contact with Russia
If we win the Senate AND do away with the filibuster, Biden will be able to complete the census (assuming the GOP-led SCOTUS permits it).  My guess is that if Trump cuts it short, it'll stay short.

Listening to Trump in Axios and other interviews, I can't help but hear the "real estate Trump" constantly preening and shoving like he's trying to make the best "deal" for HIMSELF because it's always about him. Viewed through that filter it's his MO.
This should let people who are on the fence about Biden know that the Trump administration thinks they are too stupid to realize a vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump

Lmao this is your ‚ÄúSMART‚Äù, powerful, , and ‚Äúhonest‚Äù republican leader. He can‚Äôt even understand what a proportion is and we were taught that in 4th grade. If you still fw Trump you‚Äôre dumber than he is.
Trump wants to put millions into the poorhouse. Kills hundreds of thousands due to virus inaction. The gop is a criminal organization
"The governor's MADE Trump do it!"
He lacks the capacity to be POTUS. Wise men know what they know &amp; know how to leverage others on what they dont know. He‚Äôs incapable of a lot of things which is unfortunate for the country. We‚Äôve significantly lowered the standard for POTUS. ‚ÄúTrump being trump‚Äù is inexcusable!

President Trump OTOH has covid all squared away and it will soon just disappear..... poof......
Law enforcement that does this kind of shit, is politics over the oath of office. I served for 20 years. Never once did I put my political views out there for anyone to ask if I was being fair to everyone I served. If you support Trump, take the badge off and just become a thug.
When you read anything Trump says unless  is on the screen
When I see how Trump talks about Absentee voting versus Mail-in voting
Like wooden Trump nickels?
Trump is that arrogant! He thinks his lawyer's and position of power can keep him out of trouble....And yes the attacks on Biden are unfounded.
What a petty little bitch Donald Trump is. Axios exposed his blundering ass.
Trump was never going to win 2016. But to our horror he did.  I don‚Äôt want another fascist, warmongering, racist in 2024 or 2028.
Trump is polling at 28% in California. üòÖ
Are we sure trump even passed 6th grade? Such a stupid Individual (1)!!
Not sure I'd consider it Trump's finest. It's not that he doesn't have any solid points to make, but damned if I could figure out if he ever did.
Perhaps you saw the Trump Axios interview? Trump is demonstrating TDS without requiring any assistance.
Wait...is this real? Honest question haha. Seems like an SNL skit that they got Trump to show up for.
Cotton trying out Trump level grift is why we need a full reckoning of this administration now and after the election. Nothing short of an authentic and empowered truth and reconciliation commission will restore our democracy and dissuade others from following his blueprint.
INR! Watched the HBO interview c Swann and it's ludicrous. Trump is physically incapable of accepting that which doesn't fit his narrative. No wonder that his 30% base will never abandon him. They didn't quit Nixon either for most part.
Remember when trump told us that the warm weather would kill the virus in the summer and also that we should inject bleach into our bodies to combat the virus?  This President is a catastrophic American failure.
Trump thought he was quoting "We Are the World" song, but his memory could be better....
‚ÄúThe anti-relief faction, with its sudden warnings about deficits, is eager to revive the Tea Party spirit, and its would-be leaders are ur-Tea Partyers like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.‚Äù Donald Trump strangled the GOP. These guys are the nails in its coffin.
What a pathetic asshole.
Perhaps there should have been some sort of orientation program to introduce Donald Trump to the country he is in charge of leading (which is still seems impossible btw). He might like it more if he knew anything about it - it is actually a pretty cool place.
Wow  is incredible. This is what patriotism looks like.   He was able to elicit some of Trump‚Äôs thoughts on mail in balloting which are truly terrifying:  A two-part strategy of dialing up mail in ballots and challenging the same process in key swing states. Scary.
That's nothing compared to all the allegations against Trump and the fact that he he has settled in so many of the said incidents to avoid further legal trouble
Again, the amount of spin coming from the Trump administration is appalling. Own up to the fact that you ruined our covid response. Better yet, how about you resign? Thanks.
Smooth, you get corrected on an issue so you change the entire subject so you can still complain about Trump when this conversation had nothing to do with the pandemic. God forbid you have to reevaluate the people you look up to.
Forget Tik Tok. Trump needs to go after that show Masha and the Bear. That‚Äôs a Russian show trying to brainwash kids for sure.
I know this is where professors say something about how this reminds them of their worst student - but I‚Äôve never had this student. Trump is *exceptionally* ill equipped for &lt;sweeping gesture&gt; everything about this moment. Even after all this time, it is stunning.
#Karma and I don‚Äôt mean for the journalist                               Journalist covering Trump trip to Florida tests positive for coronavirus
It's funny you say this about Biden when trump has actually been accused of pedophilia and been linked to Jeffrey Epstein.
I've been wrong before, but who was the last Pres to lose 65+ vote and win the election? It might not be a Carter blow out, but Trump will be stomped in votes and electoral college.

I've got to do this, how many children will get the virus? How many parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and others will fall I'll or die or both because this president is determined to force schools open! ENOUGH TRUMP, now your trying to kill us through our children!!!üò†

PRESIDENT Trump mentioned HCQ last MARCH as a "POSSIBLE GAME CHANGER" to force the DIMocrats hand. They had a CHOICE of agreeing,  or PUSH OUT an off the shelf vaccine for MEGA BUCKS, or Collude with the MEDIA to silence reports of HCQ EFFICACY to keep their LOCKDOWNS!
DOCTOR SIMONE GOLD deserves our support! One of many voices being punished for advocating YOUR RIGHT TO HEAR the TRUTH! It's the MEDIA who censor, gives HALF FALSE NEGATIVE REPORTING about PRESIDENT TRUMP'S Presidency. These Doctors facing retaliation for their position on HCQ.
Trump tweeted a campaign ad that shows someone petting a dog  the 23 sec mark.  It's obvious we're supposed to think it's Trump.  Trump never touched Conan the dog. Here's the footage of that event:
Also remember that Trump didn't win the popular vote and that 2 or 3 electoral voters broke the rule that they were supposed to vote what their people voted for and were summarily fired afterwards. Hard to maintain trust in a system that can just break rules wherever they want.
Trump will be tweeting crazy shit soon.    you have a huge liability problem. He may be indicted before the election.
One thing is for certain above all else, our potus, tRump, is one hugely, misogynistic, bigoted asswipe! And I am being kind.
Anyone on the Trump campaign that thought it was a good idea for an ad to be someone holding signs was just asking for this.
No. Trump MUST BE SOUNDLY DEFEATED. Trump must be voted out or will merely be replaced by another psychopath fascist like DeSantis or Tom Cotton.  Complete repudiation of criminal cabal like that of W Bush regime.
I hear Biden is leading Trump by 100% in China. Maybe you could start there. China. You Kook!
This is Trump working hard.
I only have one expectation. That they not be a rabid mass murderous war pig....neither Trump nor Biden make this low bar
Holy shit. Trump has forced Dan Rather to tweet this roast. ‚ù§Ô∏è
That 96% approval rating that Trump claims he has within the Republican party is roughly the same percentage of Peoples Temple Cult members who died for Rev. Jim Jones in the Jamestown murder-suicide pact of 1978 (The event where cult members drank cyanide laced Kool-Aid).
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst thing? You‚Äôll be an ex-senator? They are the Trump Generation. It‚Äôs how they will be remembered. Like the segregationists of old.‚Äù
Trumpkins who think Trump will fight to bitter end need to remember his bankruptcies which means he SCREWED his creditors 3 times! Trump cares ONLY about Trump and he'll retreat to FL and Trump Inc. Rubes caveat emptor.
I'll be following advice of TRUSTED professionals, not antiscience goobers, not Trump or his bum-kissing hacks or criminally credulous anti-vaxxer bent spoon's. How the hell did we get here?
I don't think Trump will defy election result very long. Republican's won't have stomach for him after they get shellacked and unless it's razor thin result he's done.  This will be long delayed reckoning for imploding GOP.
This trump crime family has gotten away with so much. Time for a reckoning
the lady who told us that Trump is a great leader in the fight against COVID, now tells us there is a problem but plenty of reason to be optimistic.  She is a Trumplican fool.

This is troubling me: Trump and his enablers have strained democracy to the breaking point. Checks and balances have largely failed. How do we keep it from happening again? Trump is not the last unfit person to get elected president. There will be others.
No thanks from yours and Obama‚Äôs administration. Trump saw the importance of space for our countries safety and to further science. Funded  it not defund like your party thinks to do with police also.
y‚Äôall are pressed our tax payer dollars could go to help homeless people or provide abortion services, but not that we pay for Trump‚Äôs golfing trips??? (of which he‚Äôs spent over 365 days doing since taking office)
Trump (IMHO) isn't really that wealthy or particularly attractive, but he IS president. Fascism was good for many businesses in Nazi Germany- notice any parallels yet? Nazis don't have to rise from the dead for fascism to be dangerous.
Typical. Trump supporter getting in the way of science. #SplashDown
As somebody who works for Fox News in Fayetteville Arkansas Donald Trump is losing an every single pole
Thank you for the support of the American  People.  Please know that Trump is an idiot.
Yes I have heard of one lol. Hipocrisy? What makes you think that. Obama was anti American Trump is pro American. Yeah sorry bud not gonna support a corrupt president like Obama
Are you sure Trump and the Republican Party are not letting the virus run rampant as another way to suppress the vote across the nation, specifically the south? If they will close voting stations, slow the delivery of ballots at the post office, they will allow people to die.
If you do not want to let the left run things but want Trumpism out of your party, you are going to have to become a centrist right independent and vote against people who run for office who have Trump and current republican traits. Conservatism may never fully recover.
Curious if maybe Trump will "punt" to governors in such a way that makes them the "big bad oppressive gubmint'" while he remains "De oppresso liber".
Congratulations you just won the award for the dumbest tweet of the day. Do some research! A LOT of what Trump is trying to do is blocked or held up by the senate and or congress.
GOP so ashamed of what they‚Äôre doing to fuck America, they want to keep it a secret. If I were foisting that turd blossom on America, I‚Äôd want no press coverage either.
You being a jerk
Honestly Ray, it seems that Senate Republican's are so terrified of crossing Trump  for whatever reason.  You have NO idea how much I miss TOTN that gave voice to all of us.  Podcast?
I've read some dumb shit in my life but that Hugh Hewitt opinion on trump's record is the dumbest shit. Would someone near   let him know he has orange spray tan around his lips, that shit rubs off
I can count the dead Americans who died because your goddam sorry excuse for a president and his cowardly sycophantic gop cronies called Covid a hoax and refused to act until it was too late. Those deaths are on Trump‚Äôs hands. How‚Äôs that‚Äôs for dead, jackass.
This is William. He‚Äôs a trump lemming. He believes there‚Äôs a new civil war coming and he can‚Äôt wait for it to get here so he can play dress up with some ‚Äúreal men‚Äù.   William‚Äôs a dumb dumb. Don‚Äôt be a William.
VOTE DONALD TRUMP OUT!
When you talk about the effect of the 3rd party vote in 2000, you could tell them that in 2016, the 3rd party vote &gt; the difference between HRC and Trump in 13 states &amp; 1 district in NE=155 electoral votes. That‚Äôs more than 2x the effect in 2000. But that is still depressing.
I‚Äôve been to a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the opening of a new section of freeway  that had a bigger crowd than Trump‚Äôs speech... and it was raining that day.
UNITED STATES CITIZENS said "ENOUGH", "I'M MAD AND NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!". WE VOTED IN PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP to dismantle the DEEP STATE'S CONTROL! PROSECUTE THE CABAL of the Shadow Government! Bring back CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND ORDER! WWG1WGA 2Q2Q LANDSLIDE!
NO COINCIDENCES! CDC, WHO, FOUNDATIONS MONEY, CHINA, DNC has much to account for! Fear is an EMOTION! PLANDEMIC is aa instrument of control of FEAR! ANTIFA/BLM MERCENARY RIOTERS are used to destroy President Trump's "Opportunity Zones" that made inroads developing inner cities.
This is the type of person that comes to mind when I think of trump supporters especially ones that agree with everything he‚Äôs done and support everything he‚Äôs done. This is the type of person Trump has unpowered ‚Äúwonderful people‚Äù don‚Äôt be a blind Trump supporter
A bit overdue, but welcome

Milwaukee Police Officers don't want to go to a slaughter planned for them. Bernie Bros are going pay retribution for another 4 years of President Trump's presidency and NO BERNIE BURNING? Nesting shooters, that makes martyrdom of the ANTIFA/BLM MERCENARIES vs POLICE OFFICERS.
Wahhhhhh. Trump was colluding with russians agents. Russian intelligence was embedded in his campaign. Grow a pair Cornyn.
I hope for cause of death on every single person that has died because of COVID-19, it says ‚Äúhomicide by Donald J. Trump‚Äù because at this point you are choosing to ignore the facts and are murdering people. see you in November, pandemic or not.
Obama got flak for the color of his skin, but never for this kind of incompetence because he simply is not capable of being this awful. it‚Äôs hilarious how much it bothers trump
I dont support trump at all, but tik tok is on the extreme side of being an insecure, sketchy, data stealing app. Im not defending other apps or our terrible president, but progress is still progress.
Seems like many Trump supporters not previously right wing changed because of frustration that "system" would never change, thinking it would take a "maverick" billionaire. But a Manhattan playboy hustler con artist is what they got.
This makes me think- is Pence the master mind and Trump is spewing everything he crafted? Downright frightening!

It is certainlyworth a listen!In the US Trump has appointed a climate change denier and coal industry executive to head the environmental protection agency (EPA). This appointment is very Trumpian. Vultures now will have a free reign scavenging the park.
It‚Äôs already the law thanks to Obamacare. Trump thinks we are ignorant enough to believe him on this. How hypocritical.
Steve Jobs‚Äôs creation has turned into Tim Cook‚Äôs Apple, a triumph of method over magic.

Trump prolife not according to his puny legislation!
President Trump!! üôèüèªüá∫üá∏ü§üüèª
We too pray for you AzzO the Asinine Trump! Here is our prayer ‚ÄúMay God Bless &amp; Keep AzzO the Asinine Trump, Far Away From Us!‚Äù
They will try to assasinate President Trump.  You can book it.  The people we are fighting are evil Sociopaths who will do anything for power, greed, and $$.
Tiktok is getting the most attention regarding Trump's executive order, but I don‚Äôt think most folks understand the implications and magnitude of WeChat being banned as well.  This is devastating to Chinese communities living in America and their families in China.
Proves AzzO the Asinine Trump is delusional if not
It's just past 1am, unlike tRump I'm actually going to get ready and WORK!  Be safe and have a great day #resistors!
Thighland is the proper pronunciation that natives use. Your entire argument is completely broken and not founded in logic , But what would we expect from a Trump hater.Trump will go down in history as the greatest US president, notwithstanding George Washington. That‚Äôs Fact.
Economy is garbage because the countries governor shut down their states for a virus that has a lower mortality rate than the flu. Unemployment is low because the economy was shut down. This has nothing to do with Trump. Trumps actions led to the lowest unemployment in history.
I actually can't leave the country currently because of the way Trump is dealing with COVID :/

President Trump is 3 steps ahead of the (Obama/Biden/Clinton) criminal cabal.   It is destiny for him (and ultimately us) to take down the Deep-State thieves, pedos, and traffickers once and for all.  This will end up being the greatest story in American history.

Facebook is just another Deep-State DNC controlled media propaganda outlet.  They are all-things anti-Trump.  Pathetic.
I in no way support Trump. But I do have concerns. AI and automation in the manufacturing and service industries is the future. When machines are producing and selling, and drones driving and delivering everything from groceries to garbage, what do displaced workers do?
Biden should agree only when trump releases his taxes.
This is what I was talking about.  It‚Äôs a ploy to help trump win.  Kanye doesn‚Äôt have a chance, but a split vote could leave trump with a chance of winning a second term.
Trump is so worried he‚Äôs losing that he is backing Kanye to steal votes to ensure he can win.  Don‚Äôt be stupid and allow him to do this.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
The press corp should refuse to cover it. Tell the Trump to provide his own camera crew to provide a live feed. Let Fox and Oann carry it while all others just report on it.
President Barack Obama changed the world and gave people Hope, Trump robbed America of it's dignity and supercharged hatred, Vice president Joe Biden will build it back better!

No doubt about it!! It‚Äôs Trump (and us).....vs. the radical, extremist, DNC/Antifa/BLM mob.
The Deep-State is very deep &amp; very wide.  Their main goal is to destroy the man who exposed their crimes, pedos, and trafficking.  They are after President Trump, our children, and all of us.
Maybe Trump will finally unseal the criminal Hussein Obama‚Äôs records.  We don‚Äôt even know who this fraud is.
Kinda like you meddle when anything but Texas is at issue? Trump could meddle in your election and talk about UFOs, Jerry Falwell‚Äôs girlfriend, and what it was like to grow up wealthy. Just ask him.
Without Florida, Trump needs to win WI, MI, OH, PA, NC, and AZ. He won these states in 2016 but is currently behind in all 6  With Florida, he could lose 2 of those 6 states and still have enough EVs to win

I can imagine this is how tRump explained his school grades with his dad.
You guys are in a major shutdown, plus the üî• you guys have had. It was heartbreaking to see all the animals that were killed. The USA is having a major widespread breakout, but none of our states are shut down. Trump is a disgrace to our country. Worst President, EVER!!!
Don‚Äôt count Trump Resigning either! Ignoramus!

Of course Trump is a criminal, he's in the US government. The illuminati always picks criminals to lead the U.S.
I agree.  Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
If a vacancy occurred, it would all depend on how bad the polls look for repug senatorial candidates, or between Nov. and Jan., would depend on how many Repugs have lost their seats. They will turn on Trump if their seats are threatened. Vote early and vote Blue!
White women voted for Trump over Hillary in the past election...so... whats your point, there's a lot of wpp in this country and a lot of them make bad choices...

Hundreds of thousands of children live with a single parent or grandparent. When the kids infect and kill their caregiver, will trump just send the kids to the cages?

Did I not just say I defend neither trump nor Clinton. Did I not just say that
I think he tweeted about he will never forgive Trump if he banned Tik Tok.
God bless you, Trump!
The Repugs never give up. They have accused both Clintons of every crime imaginable for decades. Funny how not a single charge has ever been brought against either. Not during 8 yrs of Bush nor nearly 4 yrs of Trump. Never an ounce of proof. Just endless accusations.
Opinion: So, Trump is not really about law and order: Trump didn‚Äôt like rulings on DACA. So he‚Äôs defying them.

Granted, Trump banning tiktok because he got his feelings hurt by some teens is an over-statement. There are other issues at play. But the threat Tiktok poses to national security is also over-stated. There are other issues a play there as well.
It‚Äôs amazing that the same elected officials who  -didn‚Äôt understand how Facebook makes money -think Zuckerberg runs Twitter -have to have Twitch explained to them by  (and still don‚Äôt get it)  are internet security and social media experts now that Trump wants to ban Tiktok.
Russians manipulate social media with fake accounts and bot army to influence U.S. elections.  Trump: *Does nothing*  Teens make fun of Trump on Tiktok.  Trump:
One of President Trump‚Äôs greatest legacies will be all of the corruption, criminality, and evil that he bravely exposed within our very own government.   #DarkToLight #WWG1WGA
Amen!  Now do the same for the entire trump klan!
If you voted for Trump, I hope you eat a dick and choke on it
So you‚Äôre telling me that first trump got rid of flavored Juul pods and now he‚Äôs banning tik tok. Fuck my coping mechanisms I guess??????

Obama is not far left. He's moderately left. The same principle goes for both Bushes. They weren't that far right, but were moderately right. Trump's position depends on his tweets which can change hourly as can his views.
The F.B.I has known about this since 2011? Trump is taking the heat from far lefts, but why didn't this come to light during the Obama Admin.... if they knew about it?ü§î
Actually, no.  I do believe all Trump Supporters are racist.
That seems to be a popular idea with a lot of MAGAs. Source is always someone‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs girlfriend who works at a hospital. Same idiots who believed Trump‚Äôs claim of hospital workers stealing and selling PPE supplies.
None of the above. Clear winner is still Trump.
Rumor has it that Giuliani is in preparations to hire him for the Trump campaign.

Blame Dr. Fauci. Trump didn‚Äôt kill anyone.  Or hell go after China. That‚Äôs where it originated from. Also look at the deaths between democratic and republican states. That‚Äôs shocking! Their also saying even if you die in a motorcycle accident with Covid it‚Äôs still a Covid death.
I did pretty good the first few months. But the isolation and loneliness are hitting hard now and will be even worse soon. Unlike Trump, everyone around us can‚Äôt get tested everyday.  I don‚Äôt know how people who support him can live with themselves.
You sure are going to disappointed! Trump will win by a bigger margin than 2016! People are sick of all this crap in America, tired, mad, and we can‚Äôt wait to vote!
Betting trump won‚Äôt be delivering a eulogy for Herman Cain.
Would be nice to see you and trump actually do a day of real work. Yelling, smirking and tweeting don‚Äôt qualify.
I usually hate the disclaimer, but I kind of feel like Trump needs to put "Tweets are my own and don't represent the views of my employer." in his Twitter bio.
How can you not care about the lives of adults - no matter their politics or ethnicity or age - and be pro-life? You can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. Trump can‚Äôt. Period.

And he wouldn‚Äôt have snubbed a dead hero‚Äôs Capital viewing. Trump has now dishonored McCain, Lewis, family of Gold Star parents of Muslim U.S. soldier, and more but not of Putin, of course.
I called   &amp;  today to find out their stance on Trump's call to delay the election. None gave me an answer. This shouldn't take ANY consideration. Speak out against this shameful attempt to subvert democracy NOW!
RIGHT like im not gonna buy from b&amp;bw bc they fired that one manager for saying fuck trump or whatever, but warm vanilla sugar has a special place in my heart forever
yes I am sure if Herman Cain could come back to life he would say ‚Äúthat Trump rally was sure worth dying a painful death and possibly spreading it to other members of my family!‚Äù

The left can‚Äôt do anything but complain.  They have not come up with any ideas.  All they can do is show their Trump hatred.  It gets old and boring to say the least.
Wonder if there will be six seconds of memorials for trump when he goes. That would be six too many.
Arkansas is Trump country
I hope our former presidents remember John Lewis stood on principle and refused to attend Trump‚Äôs inauguration.  They should follow his example by refusing to attend Trump‚Äôs funeral when the time comes. Just let Pence give him a ‚Äústrong and decisive ‚Äú descent below.

Most providers didn‚Äôt leave the ACA. The ACA is legislation, not an opt-in program. The ACA declares that insurance companies already have to cover pre-existing conditions, which is what Trump is trying to remove. It‚Äôs a meaningless EO.

It‚Äôs OK. The majority of people who voted in the 2016 elections knew that Trump was a colossal fuckup who would destroy the country. Our only surprise was that it took him 3 years to do it.

President Trump to ban dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
agree that it is a bad move, but trump already stopped MAGA
LMAO, Obama did replenish the stockpile. He dealt with three pandemics. Trump was in office over 3 years and did nothing. The ‚Äústockpile‚Äù being gone is 100% on Trump after 3 years. He ignored the pandemic protocol.
Dow TRIPLED UNDER OBAMA. 200% increase! It hasn‚Äôt even gone up 50% under Trump and it set records for the 10 biggest plummets in stock market history all because of Trump. Poison.
Meanwhile, not only is it stagnant under Trump, it‚Äôs actually DOWN 2000+ points from its high. Trump is just poison. That‚Äôs why he has so many bankruptcies.
As I said, it was the same trajectory it has been on for 10 years. Trump did nothing but crash it. As I pointed out, it went up 4000 points in 2016 after it had already been hitting record highs. In fact, it hit record highs almost every day Obama‚Äôs last two years.
Sorry facts don‚Äôt help you. Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited from Obama and Biden.
Iris running rampant in red states. All Trump. Herman Cain is dead thanks to Trump. Americans dying in record numbers...Trump‚Äôs response is ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù I guess the politicizing by Trump to try to blame it on blue state governors didn‚Äôt work out so well, huh? üòâ
LOL, GDP DOWN a record 33% under Trump. Unemployment back to double digits under Trump. Obama did better in his sleep. Even the stock market did better. Trump tried to take credit for Obama‚Äôs work and it bit him in his fat orange ass the first crisis he faced. üòÇ
LMAO, the Dow went up almost 4000 points (over 25%) Obama‚Äôs last year in office. You don‚Äôt know what the hell you are talking about. Unemployment and minority unemployment only went down a total of 1% under Trump until he screwed it up and sent it double digits.

Donald Trump is a fake president
We are 6+ months into an international crisis. Why does any Governor need to be getting help from Trump? Why do u continue to ignore the lack of leadership provided by this President and the GOP. U should just change your name to the Trump Battalion.    =  =
Really? Then you must think something is really really really wrong with Trump then!
Twitter temporarily restricted President Trump campaign's ability to tweet over false COVID-19 claims
Suburban housewives = whites  Low income housing = blacks  Trump is pretty blatant.
She blocked me. She supports racist losers. Trump. The Confederacy.
I been thinking about it though...did he inherit Bush‚Äôs war like Trump inherited the good economic momentum Obama created? Trump done burnt it up but...he had residuals. Anyway, back to Obama It‚Äôs a thought.
How do u continue to absolve the President over this shit show? Are u sure you are American? NY is only a fraction of the problem and u are blind to the lack of leadership shown by Trump and the GOP on the national &amp; international stage. Must suck being U.
Why are they wasting any resources in Ark. He will pull as many crazies from Trump as Biden. Is Trumps internal polling showing Ark. is getting tight? Makes no sense.
Facebook, citing virus misinformation, deletes President Trump post
U said it like it happened. Go Trump
I get it, but do you want Pence to be in a position to pardon Trump? I don‚Äôt.
How many easier examples do we need?  Sued by the government for racism (he paid).  Took out an ad against the exonerated blacks in the Central Park Five.  His own lawyer testified under oath.   His own former black outreach ambassador Omarosa Manigault:
Serious question: Once Trump leaves office what would it take - who can bring charges - for him to be charged with crimes against humanity? I would love to see him tried before an international tribunal.
Trump is making me sick
If the case was weak, then Trump wouldn‚Äôt have paid. The DoJ was satisfied getting Trump to pay for his racism, which is exactly what they did.
Trump said that if he is innocent, he doesn‚Äôt settle. LOL
The fact that the Justice Department sued them AND the Trump‚Äôs paid a settlement makes it crystal clear that they were racist. Add to that the testimony under oath of Trump‚Äôs own attorney of his racism, it‚Äôs pretty cut and dry.
Another Trump victory!
Not convicted? They were sued. There‚Äôs not a conviction to occur. But Trump settled because he was guilty. Just like he did with Trump University.
Fred and Donald Trump literally got sued by the government for racism. Other than hate crimes, it doesn‚Äôt get much more racist than that.
BIG NEWS: President Trump is full of shit, will not be re-elected, and will be prosecuted for bank fraud and tax evasion.
The sad thing for me is that we had a chance to turn over all the swamp tables. But trump simply wouldn‚Äôt lead the republicans in Congress to do anything
Trump is promises made promises kept but democrats are seeing he has done that and are making sure he can‚Äôt come thru with more,democrats make promises and never keep them, he is making them look like what they are liars and cheaters,they promise you the moon but give food stamps
I‚Äôve definitely had that problem before‚Ä¶ But it was with Trump‚Äôs tweetsüò≥üò°üò°
Even before Covid-19 Trump couldn‚Äôt match Obama‚Äôs growth. And he wasn‚Äôt smart or good enough to maintain the economy through the pandemic, while Obama was able to maintain economic growth through 3 pandemics.
Trump was accused BY A 13 YEAR OLD VICTIM of Epstein of rape.
Joe... President Trump is going to chew you up. Go back and watch the debates of 2016 of him and Killary.  This is what ALL Americans will be like, debate time.  I can not wait!
Trump bragged about gawking at the semi-naked teenagers on the Howard Stern Show. That was public knowledge.
I mean, he just wished Ghislaine Maxwell ‚Äúwell‚Äù just a couple weeks ago on national TV. So that‚Äôs true.
It has been leaked. It‚Äôs public knowledge. The Trump cult just ignores it. The majority of the country that actually follows news have known about it for a long time.
Well, Obama did take unemployment from 10% down to 4.6% and tripled the stock market and got 20 million more people health insurance. Meanwhile Trump, who you think somehow is qualified to do anything, has unemployment back up to double digits and hasn‚Äôt even hit 50% Dow growth.
Isn't that what we do with the Senate? You had 10 weeks to work out these details and all u did was ignore them. You don't give a fuck about the people. This shitshow is on you,Trump and the GOP. Speaker Pelosi has done her job.
None are edited. Trump was using Mar-a-Lago as a sex trafficking hub for both Epstein (who was living there) and himself, when he was trafficking underage illegals for his ‚Äúmodeling agency.‚Äù
LOL, those are brilliant compared to slurring Yo-Semite Trump. Trump is legit having strokes, which is why he‚Äôs having to take trips to Walter Reed and getting coumadin.
As long as William Barr leads the DOJ, a sitting president is above the law and can not be charged with any crimes.   We need to remove Barr, then impeach Trump for tax evasion and fraud.   It‚Äôs past time we Al Capone Trump! #AlCaponeTrump

1). There were basics about the virus that were known though not specifics.  2). Regardless of what was known there seemed to be no coherent plan.  3). Trump denied fhe effects of the virus for some time

Meddling????? But he‚Äôs completely fine with Russia, Saudis, etc helping Trump. Republicans have lost all sense of duty.
Yet when Trump set up his voter fraud commission in 2017 to investigate voter fraud because he lost the popular vote by a wide margin, they had to disband because they found nothing. Ironically, the Dems introduced an election security legislation which the GOP blocked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trump has been popular in KY. It‚Äôs not like there is a big lib presence there. It will easily go to Trump in the election and they will elect white (R) senators regardless of who is running. Even the most popular black politician of all time didn‚Äôt come close to winning KY.
Some guy I don‚Äôt even know unfollowed me because of an unsavory Trump tweet, I have made it!!!
I'm not seeing what you're seeing. It wasn't that great. He allowed Trump to ramble on and didn't press him on so many things. Plus, not a lot of fact checking. Chris Wallace did much better.
Isn‚Äôt it great ‚ÄúThe Dumb Trump?‚Äù  Daddy just keeps talking and saying stupid shit and Biden just keeps quiet and let‚Äôs him dig his own hole!  Love it!
Trump has been lost for a long time. Now he adds exclamation point

I would assume they want to economy to ‚Äúv‚Äù back and so they want everyone back to work so they are willing to sacrifice our kids.  Plus they want trump in power. Everyone in the administration is complicit especially the doctors at the cdc and on the ‚Äútask force‚Äù

Either I am living in a bubble Or the presidential polls are very skewed. Of the hundreds of people I meet maybe one or two have been Biden supporters all the rest are for Trump and are proud of what he has done for our nation
Kamala Harris may did a wrong thing by accepting Joe Biden's nomination for Vice President. It may do more damage to her name than good and causing her the chance of becoming a USA President.
I was looking at the exchange rate with China in previous years and it was treasonous. So wrong, how can USA pay so much and China were pennies. Did Biden know about that and didn't do anything about the exchange rate? Can we trust him?
God picked Trump, who loves America.Trump didn't outsource jobs, but brought them back. Joe Biden plans to give millions of jobs away; Americans will lose jobs &amp; won't be able to pay mortgages &amp; lose our homes. Just like during Obama/Biden time. Do you want the repeat of that?

Trump on Harris: 'Nobody more insulting to Biden than she was' during primary  #FoxNews
Americans have a right to protest and he was calling in the national guard. Biden signed the Crime Bill. Flint, MI still drinking bottled water because their water is contaminated
I do but right now we have big trouble inside this country.  Current news,  Harris as VP.  First, speech praise for Biden then, shots at President Trump.  With the Dems, no matter whom, it‚Äôs the same old, same old, since 2016.  Put any other Dems in her spot today, same old song.
Fox News "Judge" Jeanine Pirro:  "Something is going to happen to Joe Biden". Man if anybody said that about Donald Trump, the FBI would be knocking on your front door.
Ok now we all know the most fun new thing to do is make up mispronunciations of Ms Camel-la la Harris. You do realize that the moment poor Mr Biden places his hand on the Quran to be POTUS, if he wins,he will be whisked to THE Home!

Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
Kamala ran for Senator as an American Indian.    She ran for President as that poor little black girl.     When she and Biden lose, what will she be?........unemployed.
CNN hasnt mentioned K Harris calling Biden a racist (because he is). Nor has CNN mentioned that Bill Clintons name is all over the Maxwell docs. CNN hasnt denounced BLM as they are a terrorist organization. CNN makes up lots kf lies. CNN is a problem.
Good choice. He was going to carry CA anyway, but she will bring energy.  Had Biden chosen a WF, he would've been doing damage control 4 weeks. Harris makes it harder to use the crime in the streets BS as the narrative. She can punch w/o seeming mean, vital for a woman candidate.
however, the chances of him being elected are slim to none. In that event it is political suicide for her to associate herself with Joe Biden
Of course it could be a shrewd move on her part if she thinks that is the only way she is likely to become president.  If Biden does get elected it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion that she will become president
Politically I think that Kamala Harris should have refused to be the VP pick. I thought she was smart enough not to allow herself to be played as Biden‚Äôs patsy simply because she is female. Guess I over estimated her intelligence.

Here's What You Need To Know About Joe Biden's Running Mate, Kamala Harris
Kamala and her stupid giggling is the best gift the Biden campaign could have given us.    Mucus gracias!  #TrumpPence2020
I do agree with you on this. My feelings are on my sleeve about this stuff as it is. Biden is extremely status quo. No shock. But he‚Äôs still my choice. For my sanity at the very least.
Oh, I'm certainly not a fan of the Biden camp at all either. CNN gave him millions of free advertising during the primary. CNN goes in hand with what the DNC wants about as much as FOX goes in hand with what the RNC wants.
I've been pretty sure that's where it was headed for a while, too. Felt pretty sure that Warren had no shot. If Biden wins and Harris leaves the Senate, she'll be replaced by another democrat (most likely a more moderate one... blech) in California. Risk is greater with Warren
All of the choices that Biden was seriously considering were black women. No matter who he chose (Warren and Whitmer were never going to be picked), this was going to be the story. I prefer Harris in that she actually has supported some legit left policies, unlike Biden
I don't think the VP sets policy, but I do feel that the likelihood that Biden is only a one term president means that his VP decision was more of a "future of the party" choice than anything else. She's the immediate 2024 front-runner
Flipped to CNN. As expected, it's nothing but "First African American woman.." "First woman of Asian descent.." It's so irritating that this is considered more important than policy at all. We're right back to the "Biden's more electable" crap. Talk about policies at some point
In May of this year Kamala Harris was asked if she would accept VP slot with Biden.      She replied, ‚ÄúJoe would make a good running mate for her since he knows a lot about being VP‚Äù.
Honest question: has anyone else had trouble giving money to Joe Biden? I cannot bring myself to do it.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party‚Äôs most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.

1)Why do you think democrats didn‚Äôt complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.

Let‚Äôs be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden‚Äôs blood by the time it‚Äôs all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they‚Äôre actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.

Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.

Blacks for Trump. Women for Trump. Latinos for Trump. Trump is so polarizing and sexist and racist that the pro-Trump minority factions have to have labels to make it sound like they have some significant movement.  Meanwhile, it‚Äôs just People for Biden.

Biden might be mentally declining, but he had something to start with. The current leader is declining from basically nothing. I trust Biden will also surround himself with professionals with knowledge, unlike now.

Thanks you Carmen
Bahahaha!!!!!  I‚Äôll bet you can‚Äôt remember what you had for breakfast this morning.    Let me tell you what I remember:  1. You‚Äôve lied repeatedly about your accomplishments. 2. You once dropped out of potus race over plagiarism and lies.   3. Hunter ‚ÄúHoDaddy‚Äù Biden in Ukraine.
THIS is the voice of an IDIOT... That is the idiotic idea that the USA have to wait on the world as China  BUYS other nations and the Biden family. It took Trump to say NO MORE and no waiting for decades for the world to agree. You Go Mr. President, You knew the truth!

I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but many read headlines and watch biased coverage that puts a negative spin on everything he does. Did they cover the FBI lawyer that just pleas guilty for falsifying information to start Russia probe? Joe Biden is the biggest Racist.
I just can't understand how one has put together, over 40 years, the most damaging legislation towards the Black and LGBTQ community is held in higher esteem than Trump? Biden voted for the Defensive marriage act and ran on preventing gay marriage in 2008.
Not moving goalposts. ACA and GND are proposed solutions. That is fine. Challenge you to promote Biden by advocating the strength of those positions rather than accusing POTUS of every unsubstantiated crime under the sun or being disrespectful to people who choose to support him.

You are really commenting on Biden‚Äôs intelligence and sharpness? You bragged about performing well on a dementia screening test. Think about why you might have been given that test. It‚Äôs not standard, I assure you. Keep talking. You get dumber every day.
I never once said I was, now did I? I was commenting on this to say basically I wouldn‚Äôt trust Biden to be the best canidate. He‚Äôs not all there, it‚Äôs very clear. I‚Äôm more concerned for his health, honestly.

Hey dumbass     You may not know this but  ballot is absentee since he is in Washington working to fix the mess you, Biden &amp; Obama made. He resides in Florida.  There is a difference between mail in ballots and absentee ballots.  You are a moron.
How do you know what books are fake and which are not? You haven't even read them. You won't even read daily press briefings anymore. Joe Biden is already getting briefed daily and is putting together an experienced staff in anticipation of your retirement in Palm Beach. Bye.

Equal time should be provided to the Biden-Harris campaign.  If not, then  ,  and Fox News need to drop the coverage.   is getting much more coverage and attention than he needs.  Keep the correspondents there to challenge him.  Quit giving him airtime.

Joe Biden and his running-mate Kamala Harris are calling for a national mask mandate, saying it could save thousands of lives. Should there be a national mask mandate? What do you think?
Yeah, those polls are soooooooo accurate! **Wink wink, remember 2016? LOL. Biden will never be President.

You don‚Äôt care that Biden plagiarizes his speeches or inappropriately touches kids? Which one? Or that Kamala lied about bumping Pac &amp; Snoop while burning one in college in 85? A lot to not care about there! üòÇ
FYI - The Trump Administration has added more jobs THIS YEAR than the Obama/Biden Administration did in EIGHT YEARS.  The only thing you will change is raising taxes and crashing the economy and jobs with it.
Biden is a total creep.
Hillary was up more than that at this point. Biden will lose
I said SAME thing! üòâ   "It shows he's comfortable with strong younger people and strong younger women of color. He's not intimidated," she said. Together Biden and Harris will be formidable...‚Äù
Well, maybe I tweeted too soon!
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.

Also, since this is blowing up, I have another message. If you can vote, VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE!!!! Biden's not perfect, but he's not a narcissistic, egomaniacal, authoritarian wannabe! Vote on November 3 to get him out of office!
If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they‚Äôve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn‚Äôt vote Clinton in ‚Äò16. It opens a window into Dan‚Äôs unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!
first hand experience shaken down by the Clinton‚Äôs (twice) my dads law firm was Nixon‚Äôs attorney in event he went to impeachment trial. They ‚Äúfired‚Äù Nixon. Biden‚Äôs corruption has been documented extensively. Hope my niece never writes about me. She knows nothing about what I do.

What about investigating Obama -Biden; Biden being one of the most corrupt in history - up there with Nixon and Clinton.
That Kamala is *ACTUALLY* Joe Biden's MOTHER!

I believe so. I don‚Äôt have the stats but from observation only I don‚Äôt believe there is a discrepancy in live media coverage between POTUS and VP Biden. Not sure where to find the numbers on that though.
Us normal people have no clue either and can‚Äôt wait for the election when we can put a decent man in office Joe Biden and KAMALA Harris for VP.
Biden is a career politician. She called him a racist during her run. Odd they a pair now. All I'm saying
Trump is terrified of Kamala Harris. Biden Harris equals defeat to him. They will be unstoppable! Trump, get ready for a jail cell buddy!

I'm PROUD to stand with YOU!!! BIDEN-HARRIS
Since Dan recently decided to free me from Whitfield Twitter Jail, I‚Äôll answer for him!  He ‚Äúclaims‚Äù he‚Äôs voting for Biden. I find that rather strange since he voted Jill Stein in 2016.
Looks like Biden's selection of Harris has totally discombobulated Trump and all his Republican cultists.
Absolutely! Go BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!!!

Geez dude, you should probably take some good sleeping pills and dream. Cuz Biden has been in office for over 40 years, and he hasn't accomplished ANYTHING.

It‚Äôs not an assumption. Biden has been explicit that race and sex are deciding factors in his selection of a running mate.
It's hard to make his campaign against Joe Biden about "Mental Competence" when he can't pronounce common words and his greatest academic achievement to date has been the cognitive exam involving animal shapes and memorization.

Right? This asshatery is why I won't be returning to the Catholic church anytime soon. But Biden never left and shouldn't have his faith so maligned.
Look, it absolutely sucks that some people view this as being stuck with two evils AGAIN. We didn't need a repeat of 2016. But if you genuinely believe *not voting at all* is better than voting Biden/Harris, I do not understand. If youre willing to explain that reasoning, dm me.
Prior to the  and  administration we did not have riots destroying entire city blocks, racial divide, men in women's restrooms, a dishonest FBI, etc.  Just imagine how horrible it will be after a Joe Biden  presidency.
A person I‚Äôm very close to openly supported Trump in 2016 and is now actively and openly supporting Biden/Harris even though people are giving her flack for it. Voters like her are some of the ones that will help flip this election for #BidenHarris2020

Yes, and I wouldn't be surprised if Biden has read it.   (Trump doesn't need to read a stinkin' book. Especially not one about Lincoln, whose accomplishments were ‚Äúalways questionable.‚Äù According to the  Finest.)
Straight linear logic: Kamala Harris said Joe Biden was a ‚Äúsegregationist‚Äù so Kamala Harris by accepting his offer to be his VP is now an ‚ÄúAunt Chloe‚Äù (Uncle Tom‚Äôs wife)
I Can't Wait For November To Get Here!!!!! Team Biden/Harris
The most heart warming thing right now is seeing my mother so excited for Joe and Kamala. In 2016 she never talked politics. Hell, in 2018 she hardly talked politics. Now, she‚Äôs putting up a Biden/Harris yard sign, buying t-shirts, and trying to figure out how else she can help.

THIS is the voice of an IDIOT... That is the idiotic idea that the USA have to wait on the world as China  BUYS other nations and the Biden family. It took Trump to say NO MORE and no waiting for decades for the world to agree. You Go Mr. President, You knew the truth!

I just can't understand how one has put together, over 40 years, the most damaging legislation towards the Black and LGBTQ community is held in higher esteem than Trump? Biden voted for the Defensive marriage act and ran on preventing gay marriage in 2008.

Also, since this is blowing up, I have another message. If you can vote, VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE!!!! Biden's not perfect, but he's not a narcissistic, egomaniacal, authoritarian wannabe! Vote on November 3 to get him out of office!
If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they‚Äôve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn‚Äôt vote Clinton in ‚Äò16. It opens a window into Dan‚Äôs unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!

Prior to the  and  administration we did not have riots destroying entire city blocks, racial divide, men in women's restrooms, a dishonest FBI, etc.  Just imagine how horrible it will be after a Joe Biden  presidency.

Straight linear logic: Kamala Harris said Joe Biden was a ‚Äúsegregationist‚Äù so Kamala Harris by accepting his offer to be his VP is now an ‚ÄúAunt Chloe‚Äù (Uncle Tom‚Äôs wife)

Why Joe Biden Picked Kamala Harris - The Atlantic
Laughable. I‚Äôm a 73 year old White woman. When I heard Kamala was Biden‚Äôs choice I felt tears of happiness streaming down my face.‚ù§Ô∏èüíÉ‚òÆÔ∏è
The funny part about all of this is that nothing can top the carnival of stupidity we‚Äôve had to endure these last few years. Anything they say about Biden to me sounds like ‚Äúpot meet kettle‚Äù at this point. üëçüëç
Joe Biden acting like he just really for black people......
Please end the nightmare! If anyone can do it, it will be Biden/Harris!
Yup agreed. My wife and I are privileged to know many black women as you described. We are voting for four of them in various statewide elections.  Definitely like the VP choice of Kamela Harris.  Joe Biden would be the first to say he had a great group of women to select from!
Could have done better. Nobody ever said the woman or any candidate is perfect but she is highly qualified and deserves a chance. Same I feel with Biden. If nothing else y‚Äôall need to be looking at what they are advocating for today
Have you kept up with anything she‚Äôs done recently? Everyone keep speaking on times when most thought the tough on crime thing was the way to go.. this was years ago same excuse y‚Äôall want to use on Biden. &amp; as AG of course there will be things she
Worse than that. Biden doesn't have the cognitive ability to do it even with a teleprompter and/or his wife by his side.
You‚Äôd never know Biden is going to be 78 this year! He‚Äôs in great shape! No sleepiness there!
Here's a guy who A. Realizes Biden has dementia; B. Is terrified he'll debate Trump.
You could have stopped at "Biden".
‚ÄîWith the introduction of  Things might really pick up. Republicans gone have a whole new bag of slurs üëéüèæüôÑüòÜ sadly. OAN: Her kandor would be nice. I find Biden to be a little Boring ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÑ
She claimed Biden was Racist !
Watch Biden fall in the polls from this day forward!
Well someone posted that Ben Shapiro thinks Kamala is going to try to kill Biden. So that must be the new thing.
I don‚Äôt know one person of color who would seriously vote for him. He‚Äôs trying to take the black from Biden apparently.
So... I think what the implication here is that Hillary killed Epstein and Kamala is going to kill Biden?
Question. Can trump really syccessfully use videos of riots on the streets that are happening under his watch and legitimatelly use that against Biden? I suppose it could work for getting his base out, but I just don't see how that could compel anyone on the fence.
Whyyyyy is everyone falling all over themselves to acknowledge that a Biden/Harris ticket is ‚Äúimperfect.‚Äù Tired of lame people hedging their bets to look omniscient. No one is perfect, but Biden/Harris is perfect. Get on fucking board.

Former Vice President Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate proves he 'wants the person who forces him to be better.'
Trump 'surprised' Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed, anywhere. Just thought it was funny. With Biden‚Äôs VP pick you guys ready to double down on your bets?
FWIW, it strikes me as possible that both could occur simultaneously.  A Biden administration will have the worst kind of far left loonies (he's basically signed up for the Green New Deal, and forget Betsy DeVos' Title IX changes) while indulging Harris' carceral impulses.
OK. So here‚Äôs my question. When Biden and Harris win, what happens to Harris‚Äòs seat in the Senate? I know it depends on what state we are talking about so what happens in California?
He is a real price and she and Biden are gonna beat his orange ads all over the place!
I hope you are right... She brings almost as much baggage with her as Joe Biden.
If I was Biden I would‚Äôve picked a mother to portray a pro family view during pandemic. He picked a childless woman.
I really don't want to see #TrumpIsNotWell debate VP Biden.  Trump couldn't tell the truth if he had to. Difficult to debate such a person without truth-checking throughout the whole debate!
the best part about biden and harris is that once they win this election, biden‚Äôs senile self will eventually HAVE to give up the pr*sidency to the vp........and we‚Äôll have the first black female president ü§´ but i didnt tell yall that!
Can you imagine Biden getting the debated ‚Äú3 am phone call‚Äù that was all the fuss when Hillary was running ?
Now it‚Äôs time to draw back and think but when Joe Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him, you ain‚Äôt black... crickets üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Kamala is alot craftier than Joe Biden. We have to start saying Single Payer so she has less wiggle room. Otherwise we're gonna end up with Medicare Advantage For All which is the same thing as Obamacare.
Seeing a LOT of republicans come out against sex trafficking? Good. Seeing the Clintons getting mentioned? Good. Seeing Biden get mentioned for being creepy? Also, good!  So, when are y‚Äôall gonna denounce this man that was a known Epstein &amp; Maxwell associate?  I‚Äôll wait. . .

Why do ppl have to defend voting for Biden when people are talking about how ridiculous the Democratic Party is? U can vote against Trump &amp; still talk about how fucking stupid the Democratic party is right now. Stop acting like ur part of a cult that u cant critically evaluate.
Name-calling, insults and the racist birther lie allowed Trump to rise like cream in the party that admires and rewards that kind of thing. But I rather doubt using his go-to insult for strong women on Harris is going to cost Biden any votes.
The scars of racial tension are deeeeper than republican//democrat and a lot of whites don‚Äôt understand that. Some are just feeling guilty about the overt racism we‚Äôve seen in this recent era. The shit ain‚Äôt just come from nowhere tho and it won‚Äôt magically go away under Biden
No problem..I didn't vote for him the first time around. I can't vote for Biden. I like a lot of the things Trump has done...ALOT.... Since this is an equality thread and not a " Who you support for President" thread...I'm open for dialogue.

Quick read: Kamala Harris is a safe choice. Nobody who was really going to vote for Biden won't now. But she also won't flip any new blocs. It's a good veep pick for a candidate who believes he's already winning.
Is Kamala Harris who I wanted? Fuck no. She was the last on my list of potentials. But as expected, Biden picked her and it is what it is. I'm riding. #BidenHarris2020 #Democrats
My take is that it seemed that the obvious choice for Biden. No matter who gets elected, we advocate and agitate for our causes and hold power to account.

I don't know who these people on the list are speaking for but it certainly isn't for me. Nor do I think they will vote for Trump if their demands aren't met. I wouldn't respond well to coercion and neither should Biden. #Biden2020 #PickWhoYouWant

Close to 50,000 nursing home patients (what's reported) died because Governors sent infected patients into nursing homes. However, we keep blaming one person. Joe Biden had to take a backseat because of his muddled messaging during 2009, 60 million infected and we are fortunate

We all know the Dems project their intentions and beliefs on others.  In recent days both Biden and Hillary have projected the Dems desire to raid social security. This is clearly a talking point of the radical left and they should be challenged on it.

Biden/Obama did worse. If I told you one infected 60 million and one had 5 million infected, not discussing the deaths because over 74% happened in Democrat ran States, you would go with the 5 million. We are just fortunate that the same death rate wasn't falsely reported.

We had 60 million infected by H1N1... just think if Governors like Cuomo sent them into nursing homes as well. We have 5 million infected and Obama/Biden had 60 million.

$5 he's in the Biden administration now. UN ambassador or something
Hey where is the social distancing...so she wore a mask yesterday walking side by side with Biden but now no mask and no social distancing. What bullshit  displays..just a power grab and says and does what it takes to move ahead..

Everyone too weak of will to not be affected by liberal moral scolding about voting in November: just accept that Biden will win the white vote and nothing you say or do matters at all.
Look Spicy, none of us really give a flying fuck what you, the GOP or the New York Post thinks. Facts are that the Biden/Harris ticket is going to spank your asses all the way up and down the ballot.
The whole appeal of the Biden/Kamala ticket is that once they're elected you'll never have to care about BLM anymore.

I ask White Democrats to quit attacking BIPOC who have their concerns on Biden or Harris. While most progressives will be voting for them because of what we‚Äôre up against, our feelings are valid and should not be ignored by your desires to have everyone vote Democrat.

The only way this could possibly be better is if Biden steps down on the convention floor, and they make Kamala the official nominee.

Yeah I‚Äôm going to criticize anybody that hurts people. Democrat or Republican. I‚Äôm voting for Biden obviously because Undocumented lives are at stake but I won‚Äôt ignore facts.
Explain to me   Maybe I‚Äôm missing something. How can anyone in their right mind support Biden.
Hell yea... by trying to lockdown to slow the arrival to herd immunity, there‚Äôs 10 billion in annual sales awaiting Big Pharma.. 40-50 Billion in vaccine sales for the next president.  Biden cant wait to get a piece of that money.  The DC whores are lining up to get paid.
Whoever he picks on the short list is fine. It won't change my mind. I am voting for Biden. He doesn't need to reveal the pick until it's the right time. Don't give the GOP any ammunition. ‚ù§
We can't let Joe Biden get into the White House...ü§£
Should be used as a top campaign video clip against Biden.
Seltzer is such a joke. Like he's not gone on non-stop attacking President Trump since he's been in office. Oh my, little Brian is upset that other media would point out Biden's failing mental state..üòâ
Democrats upset that President Trump is making emergency decisions from one of his properties? A while back Nancy was stalling aid and talking about gourmet ice cream in her Mansion. Democrats have over used the social security scare to panic older voters.
So the Biden plan is to claim it's going to do what President Trump was already doing before Democrats power tripped on pandemic and stopped it??? Can you get a little more creative? Stop making claims that Democrats can't deliver on..üòâ
Wow, now if they find a Biden connection it would be over for Dems...
You expect this kind of misinformation from Democrats, lying is part of their nature...ü§£ü§£ü§£ Truth is, Trump has more support now because of Biden..üòâ
He must work for Biden's campaign..ü§£ü§£ü§£
This is exactly why Biden has waited to announce his VP. Don't give them anything until you have to. #WeHaveHerBack
I‚Äôve said this every since he said he was running.  This is a plan by trump. Get him in the ballot to pull votes from Biden.Reporters hate you;except the ones you plant in the room so they can ask questions about Obama, Biden or anything else you want to gloat about.  And you NEVER actually answer the question. Also, you storm out like a baby üçº
Using Fauci, Gates, Biden, Obama, Kamala, Clinton‚Äôs and many, many more to use COVID as a fear monger against the American people! People have lost everything while Blasio killed the elderly cramming ventilators down their throats
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
A declaration of intent is not a confirmation of results, but the point stands that I believe we can hold Biden/Kamala more accountable than Trump by far. You may to disagree, but I made my point clear.
I may not want to vote for you or creepy Joe Biden....but I do want to say sorry that your brother is in the hospital. Hoping for rapid recovery. Light and love.
Who is saying this? I plan on blasting Biden's ass in office (and Kamala!). He's shit and deserves to be held accountable; however, I do think anything is better than Trump so I will support him into office. But yeah, no, this "I know what libtards are gonna do hurr durr" is üòÇüòÇ
'Every single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months at a minimum,‚Äô the presumptive Democratic nominee said Thursday. What do you think&gt;&gt;
She is like Mitt Romney. Like the Dems, that live in Seattle. Portland. Chicago. NYC. What does Biden, say come on Jedi
Get Biden and Harris elected, and then drag them to the Left kicking and screaming.
Before y‚Äôall say Biden is gross too, we know. The sad part is they‚Äôre both bad, but unfortunately he‚Äôs the lesser of two evils, and at least he doesn‚Äôt lust about his daughter.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Wednesday. Here‚Äôs more&gt;&gt;
This Biden Harris announcement was not worth waiting 2 hours on. Total puke fest. Just a hint of things to come. Pandering racism medicare for all orange man bad. Going to be a great next 3 months.
The only ones that believe Biden and Harris are Far Left Socialists are Right Wingnuts.
All these celebrities have a lot to say about Biden &amp; kamala, but what about the elite pedophile ring? Or all the children that are going missing every single day? Where‚Äôs the concern about that? They‚Äôre just proving we have no reason to look up to them.
Even with this thread, I‚Äôll vote Biden because the alternative is Trump, but anyone that screams to support Biden and Harris with no criticism can piss off. There‚Äôs plenty of legitimate criticism for both that they need to be taken to task on.
Vote for Biden then drag him and Harris to the Left kicking and screaming if necessary.
Let‚Äôs demand that the media tells about the pedophilia &amp; sex trafficking that happens every day Let‚Äôs demand that you &amp; other celebrities stop choosing to believe certain accusations &amp; not others How much of an uproar did Hollywood make about judge kavanaugh, but u endorse Biden
Hidin‚Äô Joe Biden asked Phony Kamala Harris to join his failing Presidential campaign. The radical left is pushing Joe around and President Trump is standing up for America. Keep America Great!
Just when you thought the Biden campaign couldn‚Äôt possibly get any worse.
1. Biden said he wants to lock up all anarchists  2. Baby I‚Äôm an anarchist  3. Harris denied aid to trans women in prison  4. I‚Äôm a trans woman  5. Uh oh
How could anyone in their right mind think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are fit to run our country? Mindblowing.
I love the Kamala pic but Biden could have picked potato salad with raisins in it and I‚Äôd still be excited about voting Trump out of office.
The problem with this statement is that America deserves better than Jack the Ripper. We also deserve better than Biden/Harris. Settling for less will always give us less and right now we need a whole lot.
Okay so can we agree Biden 2020 and Ocasio-Cortez 2028??
They aren‚Äôt saying Kamala shouldn‚Äôt accept they‚Äôre saying Biden shouldn‚Äôt have picked a prosecutor during the largest ever movement for police reform.
Biden selects K. Harris as running-mate. #Election2020
I‚Äôm not a fan of Joe Biden, but I AM HERE FOR KAMALA!!! üíô
BREAKING:
BREAKING: Joe Biden just lost the election üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Apparently Joe Biden still has enough of his mind left to not pick this disaster of a human being.
We NEED Joe Biden AND a Blue Senate and House to help us recover and move forward as ONE!
Joe Biden literally said that all black people are the same and think the same and that if you don't vote for him "you ain't black." Democrats think they OWN black votes...which shouldn't be surprising coming from the party that was pro-slavery.
I won‚Äôt enthusiastically vote for Biden. I will hold my nose and do so reluctantly and in protest as I believe the DNC has screwed Bernie twice now.
Where did I claim Biden was a ‚Äúdevout man of God‚Äù? I didn‚Äôt. The only points I raised were in response to things Trump said and did and nothing else. Trump claimed he was and his actions do not reflect this statement. He also claims to hate polls while bragging on their results.
Raise your hand if he‚Äôs better than Biden
We can't let corrupt Joe Biden destroy America.
You are absolutely insane. Your own Biden Obama administration ruled this was an assault on the officer. You again showed your lifelong racism towards black Americans this week and now at trying to stir up division again. Truly despicable.
As a republican I‚Äôm not a fan of Trump, but I‚Äôm REALLY not a fan of Biden, plus trump is funny so. Trump&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Biden
ü§£ü§£ Biden needs a nursing home.!
This is not white people! This is crazy Biden who has always talked down to other cultures, especially Black he, Pelosi and the Democrats HAVE NEVER done anything for any USA citizen. He‚Äôs a Pedo. You would have to be really crazy to vote Biden!
I feel like you went ‚Äúall in‚Äù today with a king high flush and heard ‚Äúcall‚Äù and the republicans turned over the nut flush. Literally Biden hiding in a basement trying not to mess up this election. While you and Schumer got Trump re-elected this week
Well I personally try not to get to involved in politics, but from what it seems, Joe Biden is constantly rambling and doesn‚Äôt seem like he knows what he is talking about, honestly I don‚Äôt think Trump is much better at all, but he is better imo. Thank you for asking respectfully!
As a republican, I do believe Trump would run this country better than Biden, but I do not believe that either are great leaders at all
Pro-Trump bubble? üòÇüòÇ The reality is that the government party you are applauding is the same party that sells aborted babies. Oh, my how does that work seeing as Biden is Catholic and all.  Christian? But you are okay with that.? Hypocrite much? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Why don‚Äôt you guys call up Schumer and Pelosi and let them know that if they don‚Äôt get this stimulus deal passed. Then all these ads and all the time you spent helping Biden won‚Äôt be worth a hill of beans come November.
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
Biden probably does not want to debate because there is a lack of adult diapers.
That's why they call him hiden Biden
The liberals are using the unemployed as a bargaining chip to get funding for their states. That‚Äôs the 100% truth to the matter. They aren‚Äôt negotiating. They are sticking to their position. Where is Biden? Where is anyone besides Pelosi and Schumer. They have miscalculated
We need a movement that shakes the ROOTS of AMERICA! Biden 2020!!If Biden wins the election there will be a record number of babies murdered in our country. God help us all!
Just because she didn't .......he won't have to go anywhere, Holl except back to the White House unless the Dems can cheat enough to push Biden through!ü§îü§îü§îü§îüòñüòñüòñüòñ
I would never vote for Biden or Harris!
They are still saying Biden leads Trump by 7. That is so hard for me to believe! I can't imagine that there is anyone who cares that little for America, but then I know a lot of Dems who seem to hate her! TRUMP 2020! VOTE RED ON NOV 3!
Bless Biden's heart, he only knows what his puppet masters know!
She's intelligent and cares about the  people of this country.  Hope you vote Biden-Harris 2020.
YES!  Fired up, ready to go vote the liar out and put Joe Biden in the White House!
Kamala Harris you were excellent today!  I contributed yesterday and today, and will work harder to do more.  You and Joe Biden are what the U.S. needs.  Don't let haters get in your head. LAUGH!, cause you are in theirs!
Yep!! Biden-Harris 2020!
KAMALA SAID: DO SOMETHING! I say: LET'S ALL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
I don‚Äôt care for Biden either but I‚Äôm damn sure not letting that dumb ass orange sit in office again
Excepting re-election campaigns? I mean, Gore ‚Äò96, Biden ‚Äò08, etc.
I just can‚Äôt vote for a baby killer. Plus i think principle and practicality need to be observed simultaneously. The lesser of 2 evils is not always a bad thing. We all know Jo has no chance. Trump is better than Biden.
So... Khamala openly said that she believes the rape accusers of Biden. Why would she get on a ticket with someone whom she believes to be a rapist? #landslide2020
Kamala Harris. Name some things that Joe Biden has done over the last 50 years to show he is fighting for us! That is a long long time and I can't think of even one!
I thought you had lost your mind for a moment. There will be no Biden-Harris Adm.
Truth is we have super shitty choices for the top two candidates. But, everyone that is ‚Äòfor‚Äô Biden as a candidate, is all about whataboutisms. Nobody is voting FOR Biden, they are voting against Trump. That is dangerous.
Joe Biden announces  as his pick for VP running mate.
VP Kamala. Way to go Joe!    I picked the ‚Å¶‚Å¶ win two years before the 2016 election.   Now I‚Äôm calling for a double digit win for him this year. (Actually predicted it back in the spring.)
I'm on board!!!! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020! AND READY TO GET THAT LIAR Trump OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE! VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
So, a tweet announces Biden's pick? I find this very strange! Is Biden not able to even announce his running mate? I am very confused!!! VOTE RED ON NOV 3! TRUMP 2020!
Nope, Kamala Harris was just announced but not by Biden. .......strange!
Joe Biden hardest hit.
I honestly can‚Äôt tell whether you‚Äôre talking about Trump or Biden. I‚Äôm guessing Trump because it sounds like you want it to continue, but everything you‚Äôre saying also applies to Biden.Putting democrats (and many republicans) in a daily position of feeling that their very lives depend on Biden winning the election is perhaps the oddest of Trump‚Äôs campaign strategies.
You'll never see that under biden. In fact its the other way around. Haha. Creepy Joe aka Pedo Joe
Hey  you need to take  offline. He is spreading unproven Russian bullshit and trying to hurt Biden and his son. Johnson is a russian asset and needs to be removed from twitter.
I am for mail in ballots and absentee ballots....but I‚Äôll say this.... I would and will crawl with a mask on to my polling place, if need be, to cast my vote for Biden/Harris.
This is ultimately why when people say their vote doesn't matter, it very much does. People may not like the choices of Biden and Harris but ultimately that's not all what's at stake. Barely winning elections guarantees gridlock  Moscow Mich happily xploitz.
So is Biden.
Just to be clear, it‚Äôs possible to not like Biden and Harris while also not being a fan of Trump... it‚Äôs our responsibility to stop having bad choices for president
You mean Vice President Joe Biden as of now. Don‚Äôt count your chickens before they hatch.  #PresidentJoe #PresidentBiden
The  reviewed all of Trump's television ads since June. Two-thirds contained clearly misleading claims or edited videos.
via  some good thoughts about Kamala‚Äôs family story. I‚Äôm hoping that she will share more of who she is and the family history that shaped her.
Only if Trump manages to steal it. Even China wants Biden to win because American instability rocks rest of world with uncertainty roiling their markets.
1) There has to be a POTUS. 2) There are only 2 real candidates. 3) You said you don't want 45, right? 4) Then vote for Biden.  #VoteByOct22 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
So I notice a lot of folks out here simping for Julian Assange, an alleged rapist, because of his Wikileaks work.  But at the same time you folks are over here screeching inchoate about Biden and Trump because THEY'RE ALLEGEDLY RAPISTS TOO.   So pick a standard folks, please.
(ugh) What about...(don't do it)...you know (oh god don't)...Biden Thugs-N-Harmony
"The Q &amp; A period is useless if no one ever dares to ask real questions."  True, just like all of Biden's pressers - USELESS.
Many people are saying that Judge Pirro is full of shit. Including her fake news colleagues.
More accurately it‚Äôs Harris/Jill Biden, Soros, Pelosi, AOC, Waters, Schumer, Nadler,
from  "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told me in an interview for Axios on HBO that he 'would be concerned' about a President Biden."  And well he should be, because  will tell him "You're fired."
Regardless of whatever policies Biden is able to get approved
I realize. And Huckabee goes on air and questions Biden ‚Äúas a man of faith‚Äù There is not a word to describe how inside out and upside down this world is
It would be nice to ask Biden to clarify. Did anyone do that or did they just nodded their head?
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Does Biden wear a mask in the basement?  What an absolute joke!!!!
In general yes, but Biden is not mentally fit to lead in this instance which increases the importance of the VP choice. Biden and Harris couldn‚Äôt have been more different on the left, obviously the point for demographics...
Mike Milbury is the Joe Biden of NHL commentary.
So exactly what Biden &amp; Harris did yesterday? Prepared speeches attacking their opponents. It‚Äôs called campaigning.
What? How? When? Biden is not in charge. Where is the GOP that cared about it‚Äôs citizens and were once financial conservatives?
"Today, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East." Joe Biden said. "The UAE's offer to publicly recognize the State of Israel is a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship."
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
is helping Trump all it can by reporting Trump's talks and scarcely mentioning Biden.  Congress is helping Trump by failing to pass legislation to protect national security. The Senate confirms every judge that will permit Trump to live the life of a criminal dictator.
Yeah, it's all "so confusing".  Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates ‚Äúa historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.‚Äù  ‚Äúa welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship‚Äù
Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates ‚Äúa historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.‚Äù  ‚Äúa welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship‚Äù
So you're saying the media &amp; Biden are all wrong about UAE?  Biden is calling the agreement between Israel &amp; the United Arab Emirates ‚Äúa historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.‚Äù ‚Äúa welcome, brave, &amp; badly-needed act of statesmanship‚Äù
Nothing could be worse for the stock market or the economy than Trump has been! #Fake If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America #SmartNews
The actual Left was born with two middle fingers for a reason, we say Fuck Biden &amp; Fuck Trump!  Both right wing corporate capitalist imperialists.  This picture succinctly summarizes the wicked system that must be smashed.

We need someone to take charge! This should have been mandated at the Federal level months ago.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
When the #MobBoss speaks  covers his every word.  When VP Biden speaks, they mention in passing that he has spoken, but other than a still picture, no coverage.  This is obviously one-sided coverage similar to 2016.
Biden will be the first President to haunt the White House before death
No Legislative Branch member is more responsible for the Iraq War Crime than Biden.   Well researched 20 min documentary on this history:

You need a spelling teacher. Biden can spell. You and Trump cannot. BidenHarris 2020.
Pro-tip for those of you apolitical people out there: you can go to your twitter settings and mute certain words (ie Biden, Trump, Kamala, Pence) for a set duration of time and you won‚Äôt see them on your timeline! Problem mostly solved üòé
Since none of his buddies went to the funeral seems sad they are using his account. RIP Herman Cain. Twitter Account Attacks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris From Beyond the Grave #SmartNews
My guy, no matter what side you vote, this is a horrible choice for the VP... do some research on her policy ideas and tell me you want to live in a country with her policies in place. Because ultimately if Biden is elected, she is in command.
Since I oppose war pig Biden &amp; his cop sidekick, I get attacked for having "white privelege".   Biden led the murder of a million brown Iraqis.  Ignoring his imperialistic mass murder is American privilege.
Then we have this, Biden with Byrd, great friends with former KKK member!! ü§îü§î
Jan 22nd, 2021, an independent prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the Trump administration and the members of the Republican Party that enriched themselves.  Biden must stay out of it so it doesn't look like or become a political retribution investigation.
I really wish that Biden/Harris would emphasize Trump admn management of the pandemic and the tax cuts for the 1% - these 2 issues alone would get them elected!!!
Can somebody please tell sycophantic Barbie  that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris aren‚Äôt in power yet.
Love how Kamala refers to Trump as ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù and calls him out for his lack of leadership.   Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time Watch live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time
Everyone who thinks Joe Biden is not mentally ‚Äúall there‚Äù should go watch the speech he gave this evening introducing Kamala. Powerful speech delivered flawlessly and followed with a strong, inspiring speech from  Excited to watch this election play out.
You‚Äôre telling me that we have no better options than Biden/Kamala and Trump/Pence?   Also, abolish our for profit prison and criminal justice systems.
Great line: ‚ÄúKamala Harris: For the People‚Äù
I honestly don't think Biden would finish his term if elected POTUS. I believe that's one of the reasons he took longer than anyone in history to announce his VP choice: they had to vet them more than normal.  Also, he's said as much himself. 3:45 mark
So does my wife and she is 100% for Biden/Harris.  This is a really stupid argument.
Biden has substantial leads in multiple swing states Clinton lost in 2016. Nothing perfectly certain, but unless big improvement for Trump by September, he WILL lose.
Since Joe Biden or Al Gore üòë
yeah they both evil but don't even act like Biden is on the same level of evil as trump.
For years  political writer for  has assigned arrows (up or down) to political figures. He offers his latest arrows for President Trump, former Vice-President Biden and Gov.  Hutchinson.
it's ok if you don't like Biden and Harris. you can bitch with like minded people. but if they're going to win, you need to vote and you need to keep your grievances to a minimum. they get shredded by the right every day ......it's fuck trump, and they're our only way out rn.
Yeah, Biden is so damn good that he's been in Congress for over 30+ years &amp; the VP as 8yrs and we still have (according to the Left): systemic racism white supremacy police brutality illegal immigration expanded the never ending wars  Awesome!
See this shit is why I don't like her, Biden I can deal with he's going to go do old white men shit. Obvious and easy to lean into. She's too much of a contrarian republican wet dream. I really wish he'd have picked Warren, fuck the optics and obvious black-pander with this one.
The best argument I have heard for Biden is he would be better to protest against.  Imperialist oligarchy demands low standards.
It infuriates me that Biden showing empathy and humility is seen as a flaw.
I don't post political issues, however the decision to select Kamala Harris as Bidens VP pick is going to eat at Trump like a chain saw cutting through a tree! Get registered, let your voice be heard and VOTE!!! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
All I can say about the ‚ÄòBiden / Harris‚Äô ticket is... #TrumpPence2020 üá∫üá∏  We need a #RedTsunamiAcrossAmericaüá∫üá∏
Anyone else‚Äôs berner friends pissed about the VP nomination and think that Biden has lost the election because of it?
Yes, I'm familiar with how hard biden has screwed poc communities, and how much of a fucking bungler Harris is. I think we need to burn a federal building for every home stolen and flip a cop car for every family forced to live in their ride thanks to her letting the Nooch slip.
Regardless of how you feel about Kamala, don‚Äôt let that keep you from voting in November. Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.
If you love America and love your rights as a citizen of the United States of America,  you cannot allow the leftist and socialist party win this election.  God forbid!!! Biden and Harris are evil.  Destruction of America would be inevitable!üôèüèºüá∫üá∏
Enemy from within, just like Biden!!!
Biden/Harris ?  Seriously?  What a disaster for America!!! Wake up, America!   God bless America and not allow evil leaders to rule this country!!! üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
I could vote for Biden/Harris if I didn't pledge my voice to Iraq War Orphans &amp; Occupied Palestinians.
no one is saying trump is better???sure he‚Äôs worse but that‚Äôs not gonna make me pretend that kamala &amp; biden aren‚Äôt both terrible people
To be fair, the mass uprisings are against exactly the kind of policies Biden has instituted throughout his political career as well.  They twinkies, yo
People are dying, yea, and war criminal Biden led the killing of a million iraqis. So what's your point?
The words "by now" are journalistic malpractice.  War criminal Biden  has always been committed to right wing neoliberal imperialism
Broke:  staying home bc you think biden/Harris is meh or bad  Woke:  doubling down on your involvement and advocacy, getting the white nationalists out of the White House, and organizing to hold the Democratic Party accountable if it gains power
Would be nice to see the memo to see what it says.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden‚Äôs VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
Ok, for real, aside from 'literally anyone else' why Biden?
And he has explained that this cartoon has been on his desk for decades to remind himself that other people are going through a lot worse than you are at any given moment.
Donald Trump tries to destroy women who stand up to him. Joe Biden chose one to be his Vice President.
Trump calling anyone phony is a hypocrisy of gargantuan proportions. The fraud in chief has so many fraud charges against him Twitter would have to allow 5-8 full pages just to list them.  is a fraud, phony, liar, just to name a few. He is done! Biden/Harris 2020

it would be a better ticket if Joe Biden were her running mate...no one votes for the "great running mate"
Hours ago, VP Biden asking Sen Harris to join the ticket. Incredible image.  Also if you zoom in Biden‚Äôs phone looks like it‚Äôs been through hell and that is *so* relatable
This is the VP choice of a confident candidate, and campaign, who believe they are winning. And who believe that Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president. Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP - CNNPolitics

Joe Biden just won the election by bringing Kamala Harris on board. I absolutely love her. #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just helped plan my 30th 2 years ago done ‚úÖ won‚Äôt do another back to Biden/Harris
If you can‚Äôt get behind Biden, get behind Harris. If you can‚Äôt get behind Harris, get behind your vulnerable neighbor.  Trump is a colossal failure. We sent among the worst of us to govern us. He must be removed in November. We are poorer, sicker, more endangered than 4 years ago

I just ha e to believe, she and Biden taked much during this whole process. There is a plan.  is integral to that plan.
The Harris pick tells me the Biden campaign is serious about winning.   Which is something I haven‚Äôt felt from our national party in a long time.
‚ÄúI can't wait to watch Mike Pence debate Kamala Harris‚Äú  VP debates mean...nothing.  It‚Äôs the Biden-Trump debates that carry weight: POTUS  I don‚Äôt think the debates will happen. I think Democrats will back out to protect Biden‚Äôs image. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. Very wrong. We‚Äôll see.
Same here. WHEN Biden/Harris win the election, the floodgates will open! üò≠

I was the same, I fully understand wanting a more progressive candidate, but if you are sick of what's happening in America then you need to be ridin with Biden.
I saw reports of Kamala unfollowed Biden on Twitter.
Everyone always asks who Biden's VP pick is. Nobody ever asks how Biden's VP pick is. üò•
How anti-climatic will it be if the US gets its first woman President because Biden wins and at some point has to resign due to health concerns? (I get that he's perfectly healthy for 78, but its a valid hypothetical)
Poll: Biden maintains 10-point national lead over Trump
About the only time  and  ever mention VP Biden is when they are reporting what nasty, lying thing Trump says about him.
And that is EXACTLY what I tell those who aren't big Biden fans: It is whom he will choose to be cabinet heads, to be advisors, to be researchers, etc. that I am voting for. So far, they seem to buy it!
A theory: Biden decided on her months ago but went through the process of meeting others because he wanted to be absolutely sure, and because the campaign wanted to misdirect everyone. She‚Äôs been too conspicuously absent from the conversation since nearly its beginning.
I have learned that Joe Biden‚Äôs pick is exactly the person you thought it would be and when it‚Äôs announced you should either be incredibly excited or neutral about it, but in no way disappointed because honestly who needs that right now?
If Biden wins Arkansas, I may run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è down the street screaming!
Y‚Äôall are actually voting for Biden? LMAOO
"the biden's vp pick" i'm so excited by the scoop i can't even type properly
I KNOW WHO THE BIDEN'S VP PICK IS  it's the girl reading this ‚ù§Ô∏è
I just searched biden______.com for most running mate combinations. No dice.
Biden will lose... by a lot. The dems destroying of America will end up destroying the chance to win. All the dems had to do was stay out of their own way...they couldn‚Äôt do it and it will cost them the election. It‚Äôs a shame
Biden will lose...by a lot. You can thank Antifa and BLM for your downfall.  Americans will not stand for Dems burning America to the ground. The hard truth is about the slap you across the forehead on Nov 3rd
The next VP must be a Black woman. Because the next president after POTUS Biden must be a Black woman.
Not a trump supporter. They are both clowns, the thought of Biden letting the convicts run and burn the country to the ground is unsettling. Democratic mayors and governors casted my vote. Unlike you, I‚Äôm able to swing either way without a bias position
Not one single thing in your left leaning article did it reference anything about race. Want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?   Below specifically refers to race though oooooofffff! Talk about sticking your foot in your mouth ü§¶
That statement doesn‚Äôt refer to race whatsoever. U want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?  PS. Never said anything about Biden molesting children, we do however, have video/photos of Biden being very creepy around children
No way Biden wins. You gotta really hate America to vote for a joker who stands by and watches his people burn America. Oh and she says hi üëã  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'll start watching them again after they institute the daily  Biden conferences.
Mask vs no mask   Fall sports vs no Fall sports   Virtual school vs traditional school  Trump vs Biden   Man everyone is assembling like this with their people or crew depending on what side your on. Going to he an epic showdown in the coming weeks and months.
We own one. Joe Biden owns the other
Do I think Biden will win if we work our asses off? yes. Do I think Trump will definitely win if we don‚Äôt? Yes. Can trump win by stealing the election, even if we work our asses off? Yes.
That really been my argument the whole time tho man. In relation to the Biden tweet. AA are disproportionately treated differently by police and I feel that is undisputable. But ya boy just got to work. Gonna have to carry this convo on later on
Joe Biden is proposing a federal Tax Credit Scholarship that would be even larger than the one championed by Donald Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos. Among other things, Biden's proposal would help lower-income families participate in education "pandemic pods" #SchoolChoiceBiddingWar
President Joe Biden, Vice President Daenerys Stormborn ‚ÄúBreaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons‚Äù Targaryen sounds very good to me personally
it‚Äôs absolutely hilarious that people think Joe Biden is anywhere near being a radical liberal
After Biden is inaugurated, I vote we cut bait on each &amp; every one of them. I am just sick to death of ignorance.
Obama alumni message boards buzzing with rumor that Joe Biden has inquired about whether ‚Äúthe gal with the dragons from the television, you know the one‚Äù was eligible to run as his VP.
Is ANYONE else even remotely bothered by the fact that Biden's VP running mate will be selected based on their sex and their skin color?   Just curious.   Sounds like the most racist &amp; sexist criteria on earth to me. ü§∑   opinion
Biden is not bite, he is just a political lever to use in the long process of unfucking the things trump fucked up. Tool, not solution.
"Replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and then changing your shirt."
Is it true Joe Biden is set to name Bob Vance (Vance Refrigeration) as his running mate???
You forget Biden was VP when that administration did it. It survived
I'm thinking it was telling her not to siphon off votes from Biden.
Biden should just challenge Trump to a 3 mile walk. Honestly don't know if Trump has walked that far in years. It really requires Trumpian hubris to go after Biden as somehow being senile and infirm. Trump must be looking at himself in funhouse mirror.
Screaming the following into the void:  Trump *will* break laws to steal this election. Trump *will* drive the post office into the ground to steal this election.  Trump *is* working woth foreign powers to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.  1/x
Reporters writing their 20th headline this week about Biden's possible pick for VP.   THIS IS IT! HE'S ALMOST READY, GUYS!
Y‚Äôall need some patience, re: Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.
The thought that any and all 45 has done thus far could be taken as precedent is enough to drive us to despair.  I'm very glad you weren't thinking Biden could be as low. Sorry for snarling!
You can bet  and  will carry every word of it then talk about it all day.  Joe Biden?  Who's he?  Very lopsided coverage, just like 2016.
What a brainwashed approach... did you not hear the interview where Biden said black people all think alike?? He represents just as much ignorance as Trump or worse because he doesn‚Äôt have the cognitive ability to lead the country. We need to expand outside of the two parties
Putin, Russia, Joe Biden, and the specific word denigrate. Been seeing these keywords in tweets a lot today. You a bit dude or just a shill?
I fuckin love your Biden artwork!  Please do the Donald too for balance &amp; to show just how shitty the 2 Corporate Imperialist "choices" truly are.  As Assange said of Hillary vs. Trump, "it's a choice between cholera &amp; malaria."
Arkansas won‚Äôt win any games this year. Won‚Äôt lose any either. Ain‚Äôt nobody playing football. Ain‚Äôt none of us having any fun until Joe Biden is the President of the United States
Is it true Joe Biden just announced that his running mate would be ‚Äî and I‚Äôm quoting directly here ‚Äî a ‚Äúboss-ass ‚Äò64 GTO with the Tri-Power carb‚Äù???
I don‚Äôt think trump or Biden should be running the country. Biden has been saying the whole time he needs a VP who can be POTUS day one. Obviously something is off with Joe. I don‚Äôt see him finishing a term &amp; Trump, I have a long list of reasons why I can‚Äôt get down with him. Ha
Why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be a disastrous duo in the year of George Floyd #SmartNews they are the #PerfectDuoInTheYearOfFloyd!!!!!! ü§¨
I havent heard Biden say any of that &amp; I watch multiple news outlets every day. Biden is actually moderate &amp; doesnt push socialism like youre saying. Will he conform to the new left, thats TBD but I hope he doesnt go extreme bc he doesnt need to for success in the election.

This straight white Democrat agrees with you. I‚Äôll sulk if it‚Äôs not Harris but I‚Äôm still doing everything I can to get Biden in.
Our biggest #threat is Trump  ‚Å¶ US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
DON'T FALL FOR THE SCAM!  China wants Trump reelected.  They know the best way to help him is to make you believe they want Biden.  Don't be fooled!
Got a huge tip about who Joe Biden is picking as his VP and let me tell you:  you get a VP and you get a VP and you get a VP too.
Can you also explain away the Biden comment: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù
‚ÄòSit down‚Äô: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô #SmartNews that and wants to take away GOD as a practicing Catholic! This guy just gets NOTHING rightLiterally my patience for neoliberal white women who pat their little Biden/Harris button with pride and think showing up to a BLM march lead by cops is at an all time fucking low.  You don‚Äôt give a fuck about black lives lmfao shut your ass up.
Biden definitely qualifies. ü•í
The statute of limitations won‚Äôt have run out by Jan. 20. Biden must have an AG ready that day to start filing charges against these criminals.
Stay strong folks! üëäüèªüôèüèªüá∫üá∏ We can defeat the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal, trafficking, pedophilia cabal, their media, and crooked globalist partners.
If a Christian does any research into the Biden/Harris policies &amp; track record of voting, there is no way you could vote for these two crooks.
Let‚Äôs take down the entire Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal, Trafficking, &amp; Pedophilia ring!!
We are witnessing the methodical dismantling of the Deep-State Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal, Trafficking, and Pedophilia ring! #ObamaBidenClintonGate üçøü•§
can‚Äôt wait to see joe biden‚Äôs reaction when he finds out he picked kamala harris
Vernon is spot on!  Biden &amp; Harris‚Äô record with black/ brown Americans is horrendous!
Vote for Biden!
The choice is crystal clear: Trump = God, Faith &amp; Religious Freedom üôèüèªüá∫üá∏  Biden = Remove God, Late-Term Abortion, No Police, Open Borders, Payments to Illegals, High Taxes.....
Biden &amp; Harris are Deep-State tyrants.  They are proven, verified, criminals from the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Kamala Harris is just another desperate, sick, Epsteiner.  She is a product of the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal regime.
So I‚Äôm a child r*ape survivor and I am disappointed with fellow leftists, who preach all about mental health, attacking people who won‚Äôt vote for Biden on the basis of ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù.  I won‚Äôt vote at all if I try to vote Biden. I will have a panic attack in the parking lot.
And Joe Biden is trying to give credit for that to Obama!üòÇüòÇ
Another truth...I just can not fathom why anyone can't see how well this President is conducting business for the American people! Perfect, no but still better than anything Biden ticket can bring!
Is it a wasted vote if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden? Please explain your side after you choose!
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô - Fox News  via
If the Kanye West campaign is some not-so-secret plot to steal votes from Biden, why did he bother getting ballot access in Arkansas and Oklahoma?
I know the feeling it's crazy but unfortunately some of us is still in love with Obama. We are getting shame for not wanting to support Biden and Karma Sutra Harris.
Trump is coool! Nasty Pelosi will not be a goid president. That‚Äôs what will happen if Biden/Harris get elected!
And knocked Biden off snd Harris up!üòÇüòÇ
It gets worst if a Black Man criticize Kamal Harris on her record alone, we are labeled a Misogynist. I called one bc I've been going in and refusing to support the Biden/Kamala ticket.
Me: we gotta vote for Biden. It sucks. But it is what it is right now.   Y‚Äôall: But what about...   Me: SHUT THE FUCK UP
Sen Harris, do you still believe the women who say Former VP Biden did something inappropriate to them?Do they still deserve to be heard? Like when you accused Justice Kavanaugh of inappropriate behavior? Or is this a case of #doublestandard #justwondering
Joe Biden is a 50-year corrupt, career, politician and a stone cold crook.
Harris is just another Obama/Biden/Clinton Cabal crook.
This presidency has been such an unconventional one. Plus Biden will come with a more &gt;&gt; progressive cabinet &lt;&lt; That‚Äôs so important. Plus I was talking to another PS friend and we think ppl have been so desensitized to the horror that has been this fucking presidency
Anyway, no one is saying that Biden is the optimal choice. In a perfect world, we could go third party &amp; say fuck these two old hags but that isn‚Äôt realistic. Is Biden problematic? Yes. But you have to take into account that Biden is not going to have all the leeway trump had ‚Äî&gt;
This...this is y‚Äôall‚Äôs Presidential candidate? I know Biden isn‚Äôt much better but come on
Many of us live in states that have zero chance of breaking for biden, many others live in states that have zero chance of going to Trump.  I live in Arkansas the only way I can definitely waste my vote is to cast it for Biden. At least voting third party gives my vote meaning.
Maybe Biden should... he is the nominee
Americans: Defund the police!  Biden: *runs with a cop*
And that's where we get into a very grey area.  Some priests still allow Biden to participate in Mass and take Communion. Then there are some that don't, like you've pointed out.
Technically, Biden IS a Catholic.  This is totally different than saying he is in Communion with the Catholic Church.   Most non Catholics probably don't understand the difference.
It‚Äôs SO SO much bigger than not liking Biden and/or Kamala...it‚Äôs about children in cages, it‚Äôs about the future of title ix, it‚Äôs about funding for HBCU‚Äôs, it‚Äôs about reproductive rights, it‚Äôs about the future of the USSC for the rest of our LIFETIMES. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº

Trying to figure out what the Biden camp is thinking.   Maybe they see a ground swell of push back against the protests going on across the country.  We'll restore "law and order".  It will play well with moderates on both sides.
Uhhhh, not that it matters, but I thought Biden was catholic.
Because Biden definitely isn't here cognitively for anything that taxing, kinda like the presidency itself...
Up thinking about this Biden-Harris ticket. So many non-Republican college students I know backed Elizabeth or Bernie. How are y'all feeling about Kamala as VP?
Whewweeeeeeee!  It's 1am, time to get ready for work! Biden and Harris is a great start to my day!  RAWR!!!!!!!!! ü¶ñ  #BidenHarris2020
You really want to run this ad?  Aren‚Äôt you worried this will cause your base to vote for Biden? I mean, being a racist is what most of them love you for.  I think about the house I passed today w/ a Confederate flag next to a Trump sign, whatever will they do if they see this üò≥
A Biden harris would be a good debate too
Biden picks another racist as his running mate. She locked up so many other blacks with her stupid anti drug laws.
Oh sure I think he just means that enthusiastic Warren supporters are frequently miscast as trenchant members of the party‚Äôs left when, for both policy and stylistic reasons, they‚Äôre often pretty mainstream. I personally went with Biden over Bernie after Warren dropped out.
Great, a cop... I'm sure that will appeal to... Republicans maybe... just like Biden. But there were definitely better choices. Her record, much like Bidens puts her pretty squarely on the wrong side of history, Btwn his crime bill and her prosecutorial career.
One of the things that infuriates me the most is the spectacle involved in the VP pick (not specifically Harris).  Like, rather than acting like it was a normal thing to pick from only women, y‚Äôall sucked Biden off as if he himself granted women liberty
I love how as soon as Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate, Maya Rudolph began trending. üòÇ We‚Äôre ALL ready for those SNL skits!
Yeah, when I think of the radical left I too imagine *checks notes* Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Mom is back on the ticket, boys and squirrels üòçüôåüèª
Consuming dem media at the moment is exhausting. If you genuinely think Biden will win Texas/Georgia I have beachfront property in Idaho to sell you
Damn, Biden really took like 4 months to pick the VP we all thought he‚Äôd pick anyways lmao
What do y‚Äôall think about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?
Given that Biden was chosen by the Obama campaign for particular signalling, the Biden campaign choosing Harris is completely thematically sound.
Joe Biden picked her to be VP
Good thing Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate!  We secured California!
I honestly feel like Joe Biden made a mistake picking Kamala as a VP &amp; we just might be stuck with Donald bitch for another 4 years.
If Biden announces his VP pick at 4:20pm I'll die! ü§üüèª
No thanks!!! .....and the Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal would get away with Treason, Sedition, $ Laundering, Human Trafficking, Pedophilia, and Murder just to name a few...
Joe Biden is a 50-year crook and con-man.  VP of the most corrupt, criminal regime in American history.
The Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal cabal was and is the most corrupt, evil, regime in American history.
I mean, they picked Biden to run for president, so....
Would love to hear them sing at Biden‚Äôs inauguration!

All Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal Cabal Thugs!!
The media is mum about the massive, exposed Obama/ Biden/ Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Joe Biden thinks he owns all black voters.  Biden is a stone cold crook.  This thug has gotten ultra-wealthy scamming blacks for 50 years!
Stupidity cubed! Trying  to protect "China Joe" Biden!
Rice, Obama, and Biden are stone cold criminals who belong behind bars for a long, long time.
Biden and Bloomberg both only ran to undermine the Sanders campaign, neither of them care about the welfare the nation.
People: shouldn‚Äôt it bother you that Biden is old and not always sharp when speaking publicly?  Me:
Creepy Joe Biden &amp; the entire (Obama/Biden/Clinton) criminal cabal is owned by China üá®üá≥ and Iran üáÆüá∑.  They sold their souls to these countries.
Shut down the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking &amp; Pedophilia ring.  It‚Äôs gone on way too long!
What a crock of BS, Biden already told the rich and corporations that "nothing will change"... GTFOH with this platitudinal BS.
You know why? Who are the Traffickers? Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal ‚úÖ Hollywood ‚úÖ The Media ‚úÖ  Make sense now?
Obama/Biden/Clinton regime ‚úÖ Hollywood ‚úÖ The Media ‚úÖ
Biden will have no say in this.  The DNC will hand Creepy Joe a black woman.  You can book it.  They have already caved to the mob....and the infamous ‚ÄòDemocrat Plantations‚Äô will continue for them.
This $430M will be used to specifically fight the now notorious (Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia) ring.
Worse comes to worse, Biden fucks us over (kind of like we are now) and we try this again in 4 years üò©üò© I just can‚Äôt expect different results from the same situation
Muhfuckas talmbout how can you vote for Biden with the dumb shit he says?! Easy, he‚Äôs not Trump!!! 4 years of Trump has me in a desperate state of mind this election
The Obama/Biden/Clinton regime is one big lie. #Treason #Trafficking #Pedos #MoneyLaundering
All funded &amp; coordinated by the Obama/Biden/Clinton DNC.  A regime of Lawless Thugs.
Yes, probably because the only thing that makes Biden a Democrat is the D next to his name because it certainly isn't his record and definitely not his current policy platform
The difference is, and I know it‚Äôs hard but try to keep up, what Biden did was ILLEGAL.
Justice please come for Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal, trafficking, and pedo regime
To be fair, Clinton chose Tim Kaine to be her vice, not the other way around. Biden would be the first to choose a woman vice. Reading it the other way is twisting Dowd's words.
Empty platitudes, where are the policies that will let us achieve these goals? How can we have economic equity without criminal justice reform including the end of Marijuana prohibition, and Medicare for all. I don't believe for a second that Biden has plans that move us forward
Joe Biden: "I promise to raise taxes"  Literally
My emotional state is irrelevant. I try to cite facts, whether anyone takes me seriously or not. isn't my concern. Whomever Biden chooses I will defend but some will be easier than others. Some Democrats feel we shouldn't hash out our differences in public. I'm not one of them.
You see, if Biden wore a helmet, he would engage in more risky biking behavior, because of a false sense of security the helmet creates. Maybe he would also wear it incorrectly. Also, there are no good RCTs showing that helmets work.
This is funny that‚Äôs all I don‚Äôt care how long Biden takes to pick a veep
I'll vote for Camela Harris if Biden picks her, but without going into much detail. I would prefer someone who wasn't a prosecuting attorney. On the plus side I expect she'll use her courtroom lawyering skills to tear Mike Pence  a new one! Unfollow me if you like.

You can say that again. My stepmom is vehemently anti-Trump and will be voting for Biden and Harris this November. What an asshole. I am so glad I know the truth about  and  and
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt good at making himself ‚Äúvoteable‚Äù but he is extremely good at making other people seem extremely ‚Äúunvotable.‚Äù Donal Trump is gonna EAT Biden alive for his Kamala pick.
Why doesn‚Äôt Biden take questions. Get him off the TelePrompTer and let‚Äôs see him bumble his way.  You are all nothing but traitors. Go away.
Another Fox survey has Biden up by 7pts.  Who the hell do they survey?
Biden - Harris - Wrong for America.  Trump - Pence - Right for America...because, yes, the soul of our nation is at stake.  Trump 2020
This is what will happen if Biden becomes president. Control over our lives.
this is outrageous! I have donated to the Biden, Harris, BidenHarris campaigns as well as many Senatorial efforts. I have little $. But Bloomberg has never given money promised! AOC instead of him. I‚Äôm angry!
I learned from my vote in 2016 which is why I will vote for Biden in 2020.
4) this nonsense, I‚Äôll take and I did take Trump over party, he has looked out for our best interest from day one, he has always loved this country as I do, every democrat I know are dispicable liars just in it for themselves and republicans, VOTE TRUMP!!! Leave the biden trash
1)Why do you think democrats didn‚Äôt complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
She‚Äôs not a puppet like Biden and Harris
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.
Wait isn‚Äôt Biden choosing Harris a symbol of how Joe DOESN‚ÄôT prefer personal loyalty over all else? She did attack him during the primary debates.
Of course I voted for Hillary, just like the majority of voters did. And I will vote for Biden, just like the majority of voters will. And no, unlike just an entry on a flight log, I use actual incriminating evidence (video, accusations from victims, quotes from participants).
I will be voting for Biden because Trump is the most dangerous president I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime.
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way....
Biden Harris - Wrong for America.  Trump 2020
I have loved learning from you and if you think Trump is awesome or just ok or needs to be replaced or if Biden is awesome or just ok or should have been Bernie... honestly I just want to get published. And if your work helps me do that, think/post what you want.
You mean where Harris will be speaking. Biden will just stand there and stutter incoherent sentences
'Kamala will challenge my assumptions, ask the hard questions."-great message by Biden! #BidenHarris2020
I can‚Äôt understand how the people who have listened to Ku Klux word salad for the last four years have the fucking audacity to call Biden senile
Journos just making it up as they go along.  Anything to try and stay in that "Biden for Pres" lane.  Goodness.  They have no shame.  Harris isn't a small "c" conservative, that's an absolutely laughable thing to write.  She's a "Big PL", progressive liberal.  What a joke.
Ah you finally caught him!  Now listen to Biden, he is running for US senate!  You missed that didn‚Äôt u?   Your guy can‚Äôt put two coherent sentences together and Trump runs the world!
I held my nose and voted for Hillary b/c I recognize a narcissistic personality when I see one  This year I'm enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden not only because my initial judgment of Donald Trump was right, but b/c Biden is the right man to heal our country.  #LincolnVoter
My Brit buddy just passed me again and still laughing saying Harris is that all you got, I told him I have Trump the democrats have her, still he said is that all biden and harris hahahaha
Let‚Äôs be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden‚Äôs blood by the time it‚Äôs all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they‚Äôre actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.
pardon me, FIRST what we‚Äôre not gonna do is not manage to elect Biden in 2020 like some of y‚Äôall did with Hillary in 2016 just because she doesn‚Äôt check every one of your seventy set dream socialist boxes
Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
With a mindless and ignorant statement criticizing Biden‚Äôs pick of Harris as running mate, Tom KKKotton demonstrates his bigotry and incompetence.
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Ummm...Joe Biden blew it for himself, he needs no help for anyone
not voting for joe biden is a vote for trump. idgaf what you say. refusing to not vote for biden bcuz he isn‚Äôt bernie is selfish. you might as well be a trump supporter. #BidenHarris2020

"Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men." --Rebecca Traister
Biden trying to put words in order to tweet this
Ben Sasse wants to help the democrats and biden, I wonder what the democrats have on him
Looking forward to Biden‚Äôs VP pick this week!
You made the point of why it‚Äôs important. Biden riding his bike while Trump struggles to walk show Biden is in far better ‚Äúcondition.‚ÄùJust like our economy, country and military will be once we #FireTrump Nov. 3.
Biden is.....
I‚Äôm pretty sure Shaun has told people not to vote for Biden on here before. I‚Äôd look it up, but he blocked me, so I can‚Äôt see any of his tweets anymore :(
I agree. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden should be running ads talking about the Social Security debacle in plain English.  ‚Äîno more Mr. Nice Guy on this issue.   get off the damn political shows. Get Congressional Dems  on local news!
Hahaha can you imagine Joe Biden coming out in clown shoes?
just finished watching 2016 debate with Killary. Prophetic looking at your achievements the past 4 yrs. Excellence! Coaches watch game films in preparation for battle. As you prepare 4 election reflect &amp; enjoy!  We r behind you, hit Biden hard, if not harder!
Blacks for Trump. Women for Trump. Latinos for Trump. Trump is so polarizing and sexist and racist that the pro-Trump minority factions have to have labels to make it sound like they have some significant movement.  Meanwhile, it‚Äôs just People for Biden.
Everything about Biden concerns me.
Yep....anybody for Biden abortion-killing is LOST

Looking forward to when Biden uses E.O.‚Äôs to demand Germany and Japan unconditionally surrender and he can finally claim victory for WWII.
Explain how this will work #MoscowMitch should I not deduct withholding from payroll this week? I‚Äôm glad the leaderless GOP is now on board with deficits and EO. It‚Äôll make Biden‚Äôs job easier cleaning up your mess.
While u were off gallivanting, Trump has attempted to neuter your congressional powers. I guess u are fine with Biden doing the same in 6 months. U reap what u sow Tommy.

Me in 2019: I hope we don‚Äôt pick Biden... I want someone I‚Äôm really excited about! (someone like   or   Me in 2020: OK... fine... Biden. I‚Äôm so exhausted... let‚Äôs just be done with this.
Biden might be mentally declining, but he had something to start with. The current leader is declining from basically nothing. I trust Biden will also surround himself with professionals with knowledge, unlike now.
Oh but if someone said something about Biden supporters like this, it would be a hate crime
Biden ....NEVER.
Biden is a liar.

Will Biden‚Äôs handler please remove him from this and just pick someone else to run against Trump.   You know how hard it is to make Bernie look like he has all his Stuff together?  Well that‚Äôs Biden.

Well it‚Äôs Biden or Trump lol
