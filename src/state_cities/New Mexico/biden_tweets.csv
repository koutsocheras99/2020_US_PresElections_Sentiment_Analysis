There is ABSOLUTELY NO gain for Biden if he debates Trump!

I hope you're right, but I don't see Biden being able to debate a girl-scout more less stand up with Trump and Kanye and come out looking like anything other than what he is, a man with severe dementia. Unless he is going for those much-coveted "pity" votes.
Sadly key players in the narrative are already paving the way for Biden not to debate Trump. From the New York Times to a key person in the Clinton camp. Various reasons but one basic theme. "It's Trump's fault" would you expect any less?
One of the biggest reasons why schools are heavily segregated now, the police can take your stuff if it‚Äôs believed you have drugs, and why abortion bans are still such a hot idea is due to years of great work by representatives like Joe Biden. Unapologetically too :)
A real President BIDEN
And on the other hand, if Biden is elected, America will become a Third World country within a Very Short Time !!

because it's too early for a cure and economic recovery.  that can only happen and fit their narrative in biden is electedIf Virginia was closer than North Carolina that would be bad for Biden. Same if Colorado was closer than Arizona. But neither is currently the case. And again, the reverse of these wouldn't necessarily be good for Trump.
If Texas is closer than Florida, that's bad news for Trump. Same if Ohio is closer than Pennsylvania. Both are the case right now. Note that the reverse result would not necessarily be bad for Biden.

Yup, But Biden has Always been a racist. Amongst many many other thing's. In almost 50 yrs as a Public Servant the man has never accomplished anything Good for our country, yet Political Idiots will still vote for him. Smh
I'm supporting Biden all the way.  But I do have a sense of impending doom involving trump.

A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden. A vote for any third party candidate is a vote for that person. Nobody is entitled to votes, no matter how much mindless propaganda claims otherwise.
Vic, tRump and his sons make fun of Biden all the time!  And Biden has an actual speech issue, has overcome stuttering.   So FairPlay.
One of the first accts that followed me was a man who came here from Peru when he was 7. He lives in NJ. A year ago he thought AOC was the bomb. We could always have a great conversation, we didn't talk politics much. I sent him the clip of Biden putting the screws to Ukraine.

I'm interested in seeing what she thinks she has seen or read regarding Biden. I used to feel sorry for them until I saw how hateful and violent the radical wing of their party is. It's gone so far off the deep end.

My picks for VP Biden
None of what it true? Biden said he would not only repeal the tax cut that benefited millions, but that he would raise all our taxes. He said he would enact heavy gun control, and give everything to illegals that even you and your family don't receive. Stop with your propaganda.
Dumb Biden
Not good..Biden is not capable of being our President..sorry the truth
DonCon, is so desperate, that playing "Go Fish," is his favorite game of choice. Maybe, he'll bring up that Biden has reversed the universe, turning it inside out? Or, Biden, will take away everyone's water rights, by using a straw to suck all the reservoirs dry.
This somehow lacks surprise.    #KanyeWest #2020USElection

Remember giving "your word as a Biden" that it's all 1000% true.
"I'm not going to tear it down but I won't build more" seems like the Biden pitch for everything
A vote for Biden is a vote for taxpayer funded, elective abortion, up to the moment of birth. Thanks to  for holding their candidate and the DNC accountable for promoting such a radical, pro-abortion platform and agenda. #BabiesLivesMatter

My point is, when was the last time you saw Biden do a live interview? UNCUT not 5 second snippets.
You're talking about Biden, right? When was the last time you saw Biden give a live interview? I think it was when he said- if you don't know whether you're voting for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
That's exactly it. I want to see Biden's round table with Biden LIVE and uncut.
Every single one of these clips the commentators were talking about Biden, he manipulated it and will claim he was joking.
Michele, all these clips he's using the commentators were actually talking about Biden. The left has to use propaganda, and Trevor gets away with it because he'll claim it was comedy.
Will Navarro's round table be shown live, or will it be cut to shreds because Biden isn't coherent?
Trevor has to use manipulated media in order to dupe his fans. He would dare show a full minute of Biden speaking. Biden is incoherent if more than 20 seconds of him is shown to the public. Let's see how they have to slice and dice his time with Navarro.
And Joe Biden has ZERO to do with that. What is your point here? You want to yell at someone, yell at the orange idiot.
Give it up. He's not dropping out. Do you even listen to Bernie any more? He's told all of you to support Biden. If you are not doing that, then you're ok with another 4 years of the orange idiot.
Perhaps Biden is getting speaking tips from Pelosi!
You vastly overestimate most American voters. This will be accompanied by targeted Biden bashing in the AA community to try to peel off even a few percent of voters. There‚Äôs a reason the GOP is doing this just like they funded Nader &amp; Stein
Biden is a habitual liar.
So Biden lied when he said he took the test in June. So not surprised.
Biden lied more than he told the truth in that debate. If the networks weren't just pure bullshit propaganda at this point, they would have fact-checked him.
I‚Äôm with you! Joe Biden for the win!
Paranoid.  I will vote for Biden even if his running mate is a cactus.
Just like KHive and Biden Brigade knifing each other. The alt-right left, and the super alt-right left going at each other is kinda funny.
Do I think Trump is a total scum bag, YES. But I also feel the same about Biden.
I dont have to prefer either. Many of the outcomes will be similar, the methods will just vary. Trump is an open book, Biden is a typical establishment democrat- Lies and manipulation.  Trump will stab you in the front and Biden will stab you in the back.... Which do you prefer?
That is their choice. It doesn't necessarily make them frauds, it may be that they feel that it will be easier to make change with Biden in office. But what will really change for the working class?  I really have much respect for West and Chomsky for various contributions.
We will! In November. President Biden will be the one to rid this country of its infestation of cockroaches. Bye Felicia! #GoJoe
Joe Biden and his Vette - he can drive!
Biden's pitch is "Remember when you were happy? You can be happy again, just hop in my time machine!" and it'll work about as well as buying a Corvette and having an affair
It also ties in to Biden's whole brand. "Which classic car would you bring back?" is very much hearkening to a brighter era for certain people, back to "normal" when you had fewer worries. It's blatantly a midlife crisis appeal, the idea that he'll take you back to a happier time
Keep spouting Covid-19 and vote-by-mail nonsense.  It's helping Biden.

On January 20, 2021 when Joe Biden takes office America will be great.
Avoidance does not change the fact that Biden and Trump are both representing a declining collective consciousness that values profit &amp; power above human life.. and all life.
But Biden architected the policies that mean that blue-collar workers DO have to get drug-tested to do their jobs!!! He shows a fantastic lack of knowledge that what he's making fun of as implausible is something that probably every journalist there had to do at some point
(ps it's Biden's fault that people have to take drug tests before they can do their jobs:
Some people don't seem to understand that minorities and poor people *have to take drug tests all the time*, which Biden here suggests is ridiculous and unrealistic. And Biden was the architect, on some level, of many of those policies:
He is absolutely blind to the reality of asking a group of journalists of color "what would you think if you had to take random drug tests to do your job?" WHICH IS THE REALITY, a reality largely enabled by Biden. I can't make the dude look more out of touch than he is
He implied that it would be ridiculous to expect the journalists to have to take a drug test to do their jobs. In fact, poor people and minorities are often asked to do drug tests for all sorts of reasons, and Biden passed a lot of that legislation
Can you imagine a world in which Black and brown people were often asked to take drug tests for no reason at all? Joe Biden can't.
"He is a double-minded man, unstable in everything he does" James 1:8  Almighty GOD teaches us that a man like joe biden who wavers in his mind is troubled in all his ways.  #Trump2020

Just watched the  interview with  on   Gotta say--Trump is legit. Biden is going to be puppet'd by the "my feelings are hurt"-mob. That is a nasty little world. Trump gets shit talked mad, but he doesn't give a fuck. Got a thing he's doin' -- do it.
It gives the President the excuse to not go to the debates because he can claim Biden won't debate him. It doesn't matter that it's a lie.

Trump will use emergency powers to remain in White House if he loses election, says House majority whip
Even if Trump holds all these states, he‚Äôd still lose. Biden is where every campaign wants to be. There isn‚Äôt a path for Trump that doesn‚Äôt go through holding MI, WI, or PA.   Or the dreaded EC tie but tbh that‚Äôs too traumatizing for the morning
Lack of decency, understanding of history and plain old common sense are just three of the many reasons Trump is unfit for office.
I have read, too, that two doses per person may be necessary to confer immunity.  And we need a sufficient number of syringes. And this all needs to be distributed properly to HCPs. Hopeless, if we are relying on Kushner. Under a Biden admin even, next summer at best.

Yes. Unfortunately, with Biden bringing on advisers like Larry Summers and Jamie Dimon, we're assured of this regardless of administration.

Five-to-seven hour lines on college campuses in CA. Even more polling station closures in AZ, esp. in Maricopa Co. As it was, Sanders crushed Biden in both CA and NV, and was winning the Latino vote by huge margins.

Sanders crushed Biden in California and Nevada, despite seven hour lines on several college campuses. He swept the Latino vote in both of those states and Florida. Note: much larger demographic than the AA vote. That used to matter, but now?
What about the Latino vote, which is a far larger demographic? Biden's campaign is badly mishandling them, unlike Sanders who crushed Biden in California and Nevada partially due to that vote.
And now Biden's campaign is badly mishandling the Latino vote, a demographic that Sanders handily won in Nevada, California, and Florida.
Either it doesn't matter who Biden picks as his running mate, or the vast majority of respondents had no idea who these potential VPs are.

..... While ignoring the detrimental consequences of VBNMW since 1992, being that the Dem nominee is more conservative than Republican nominees of the past. Biden is also more conservative than Hillary. There is no choice here. #Vote3rdParty
He makes a lot of us sick. We can only hope come November, he‚Äôs made a majority of Americans sick and that transfers to their votes for Biden!
1) first get Biden elected; 2) give him some time to clean up the mess trump and his administration left him. After that, maybe you won‚Äôt have to trash him. Looking on the hopeful side.
People are voting for Biden. Many people, of all races in this Country. Pack your bags.

CNN's Chris Cuomo: Trump's judgment 'may be impaired'  Well said, time to look!
You had me at Biden Administration.
I respect your position, but my answer is,  I want to fight Biden and what he represents: a democratic party that goes further to the right every chance it gets, suppresses the most mild reforms,  and cheated to get Bernie out.
I'm assuming you're referring to Biden, and my conscience doesn't allow me to vote for him for many reasons, primarily his stance on abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism, police, self-defense, and like a thousand others. Not to mention he can't even form a coherent sentence.
Ridin‚Äô with Biden from the Land of Enchantment, the beautiful state of New Mexico. We have an amazing governor here ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è we‚Äôre also blue and sanctuary so yay!

I disagree, but I understand. (#HawkinsWalker2020) What we do in the voting booth on Election Day is one of the LEAST important political actions we can take. Green voters, other "protest" voters, nonvoters, and Biden-but-he-sucks voters need to stand together in the streets...
Slowly explain, in words you are sure mean what you think they mean, how Biden's statement is within a hundred miles of your statement that the complete obliteration of recognized Native American tribes would be a good thing.
Biden was in a televised debate less than 3 months ago, against somebody who doesn't brag about being able to pick out an elephant in a photograph.
This is why i won't vote-shame those who reluctantly vote for Biden. Good people who really want to change the system are looking at this cursed "choice" before us and making decisions based on legitimate fear that Trump is making actual, no-joke fascism more likely...
I made this joke because I saw someone else say Biden is ‚Äúagainst energy‚Äù and I thought that was a joke. But nope, the President actually said that lmao

Biden is also against flushing the toilet more than 10 times.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ Does he think he is talking to a 5 year old? This is why we need to teach critical thinking skills to our kids!
I disagree. While Biden may not be your first choice, he has proven that he can modify his position to change with the times, he is empathetic, and he has the intellectual intelligence to listen to his advisors. There isn't really any comparison.
I‚Äôm pretty sure he tried to restrict flights from China at the start and y‚Äôall called him racist for that too.  Biden is consistently ignored for his racism against both Latinos and Blacks.  But it‚Äôs ok white progressives will just hold a sign at the corner to represent our voice
If Trump said this people would be burning down cities. But since Biden said it all the extreme leftist (progressives not true democrats) are willing to over look it and say it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs an accident.
How about when he admitted to putting kids in cages?

Yes, yes he did. Its his VERY VERY poor attempt at appealing to the latino community. The people advising Biden are idiots. The way you appeal to them is through Grand standing with Christian speeches and Job wage securities. Hes doing neither atm
Ordinarily this would be correct. But, Biden is melting by the hour. Next  week, he oils be catatonic. The nation is confused, but not g
In the debate trump should bring kids up and force biden to not touch them, It will be the ultimate stalemate.
The Jenner-Kardashian-West famous for being famous routine has never been worthy, but Kanye West is being used by Trump to siphon votes from Biden. There is no justification to further deify their brand. Doing so is a mockery of journalism, even fashion journalism.
That is your priority. Forcing that on everyone else, and I do mean forcing, gets you the opposite of what you want. It is Biden that needs to bend, not us.
We need a president who doesn't go charading down the avenue holding victory hands with KKK leaders... well that removed Biden, so guess that really only leaves one choice...

It would not surprise me if Trump put Kanye up to it, to help steal votes from Biden.
I think they should give Joe Biden a pop quiz on the pronunciation of ‚ÄúYosemite,‚Äù and just decide the election on that. No fuss, no muss. Who‚Äôs in?
Honey, I don‚Äôt pray, but my thoughts are yours. This shit is a struggle minute to minute. Keep the goal in mind and believe with your heart and soul that there are not enough dumb ass peeps in US to stop Biden.  If not, how much Xanax is needed for another term? 1 or 2 tons?
Has Trump read His Dark Materials? I hear they kill God in that series. Maybe that's where Biden gers his fiendish plans.
I'm from the rust belt. This is super condescending. The reason Hillary lost in 2016 was the way Dems like she, her husband, &amp; Biden sold "free trade" as a panacea while Corporate America shredded good union jobs in the Midwest. Nostalgia about "muscle cars" won't fix that.
Biden needs to exert American power, influence, and dominance over Russian scum. They‚Äôre a third world country and #TRE45ON has handed them the keys to our country while Senate Republicans have been complicit in the collaboration.
I heard Joe Biden is ‚Äúagainst the economy‚Äù should i be concerned?
The  should start saying nice things about Biden. He should say he would vote for him if he wasn't running against him.... the collectives lefts head would explode. They wouldn't know what to do....
Thank you Governor for your hard work amidst all the negative feedback you get. That is a true leader. You'd make a,superb US Secretary of Health And Human Services in a Biden administration!
In this case, I'd say the most important attribute is the VP's ability to effectively assume the role of President, with the expertise, wisdom and enthusiasm it would require, should Mr. Biden be unable to complete his term.
Kanye is being groomed and encouraged to run for president by Trumps republican election strategists.  Trump figures he can steal votes from Biden this way.

Joe Biden‚Äôs mental ability is a campaign issue that can‚Äôt be ignored: Devine
Let‚Äôs be real, when Trump said a Biden presidency would hurt ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù he was referring to himself.
You are not from here do you commitment to the thing.   Fight the fight good for hairy legs and yet.  Biden 2020.
Biden doesn‚Äôt get it! He doesn‚Äôt get any of us people. He doesn‚Äôt understand that we are independent people no matter what our race is.
Further, If you‚Äôre going to go after Biden‚Äôs mental ability, you cannot then excuse EVERY sign that Trump has completely lost his. I‚Äôve mispronounced words, sure, never pronouns that I‚Äôve been saying my whole life like Yosemite and Thailand. 2/3

It really is fortunate for Biden that no matter what stupid, insensitive, or offensive thing he says or does, his opponent will always drown it out with several things far worse.
Biden campaign responds to Trump's 'hurt God' attack: 'Biden's faith is at the core of who he is'
Your response to Trump being an idiot today in front of an industry he‚Äôs actually hurt, is to say that Biden is not mentally there. Trump the past two days has butchered Yosemite and Thailand, bragged about helping an industry he hurt, then said Biden is against god. Pitiful.
Then again, you get your news from right wing propaganda, think democrats hate the country, and think that BIDEN is the presidential nominee that has mental acuity problems...carry on being an ignoramus.
Joe Biden‚Äôs chances of winning the election would be higher if he made no public statements (or private statements that leak) until the election than they will be if he does not do that.
I'd probably be tired if I killed God.  I do find it entirely ironic Trump is calling Biden against God and the Bible when he admitted he's never gone to Confession.

So let's see. USA is falling apart. No other country has as many cases or deaths. Murders and crime are up. But its Obama and Biden fault and our president is innocent
It's not racist to say that regional differences are more significant than racial differences. I'm a white dude from New Mexico, I have way more in common with black and Latino New Mexicans than I do with white people from rural Alabama. Biden is still racist, just not for this.
And the people who think Joe Biden is great have the IQ of null.
I wasn't going to vote for Biden, but if he publicly announces a war on god then I'll join the knights in Satan's service.
One can get 5% nationally without taking a single electoral vote. There are many voices that appeal to purple of different political outlook. Not every 3rd Party vote takes from Biden. Republicans are not a uniform voting bloc either. You offer simplify things to your detriment.
You don't understand. The problem isn't that people will actually vote for Kanye instead of Biden. The problem is that Russian hackers will make it look like they did.
and here it is the real reason why Kim Kardashian don't want to have nothing to do with Canye West is because the motherfukers poor somebody else had to pay his f****** debt who pays his debt Trump pays his debt who gets f***** Joe Biden gets fucked ain't this about a b****
yes, but for instance in Wisconsin, Trump won by less than one percent because my old boss and Jill Stein were on the ballot. Biden needs to win Wisconsin.
So Biden needs to send tear gas at people and hold the Bible upside down to now religion. That's the ticket.

He‚Äôs like a football player constantly running the wrong way and fumbling the ball every 5 yards. If he wins in November it will be because the other team lost on their own, not because Biden actually did something himself.

Poor Biden. He seeks a female VP popular enough to get votes but less popular than himself. There is no such person. Every woman dem of note is better and more popular than creepy Christmas uncle.
Oh, sweet Lord. He's talking again in public, isn't he? Let's all focus on something positive (like supporting Biden by donating and/or volunteering. And don't forget the Senate!)
I'm very certain Biden is not again God. I'm also fairly certain that trump is with the devil.
My ideal joe Biden presidency would be joe biden being entirely hands off and letting the most progressive Congress in history take the wheel. Which was the initial point of the presidency
But everything Biden‚Äôs saying is totally cool right? Seem what‚Äôs he‚Äôs said about our fellow black Americans in the past 2 day‚Äôs alone? Basically said all blacks are the same and can‚Äôt think on their own.

If he uses the right strategies, he will win in a landslide. If he pokes too much fun at Biden, he will win very narrowly.
Jill Stein isnt the reason trump won. It was a growing dislike for establishment shills &amp; the country's massive desire for populism, which the dems refused to concede to. But you cant admit that bc admitting that would be admitting Joe Biden is the wrong man to pit against trump

I mean, he was terrible in his debates against Hillary and that didn't hurt him.  Biden will be a less skilled debater than Hillary I suspect, but I wonder if the debates matter much at all.
Between the first and second debates; Trump versus Biden, matching Corvette Stringrays, Road America, Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin
Okay fine. üôÑ How *will* Biden's plan help them? Will he give them "access" to buy insurance with the money they don't have?
Looking forward to Joe Biden &amp; his Administration!
Because Rashida Tlaib is a Bernie Bro who is filled with white male rage, whereas the KarenHive prefer to uplift progressive women of color like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.
Hey guys! Did you see all the news today about Biden being racist against his interviewer and asking about cocaine testing? Wait; no? Why not, I wonder...
This account always posts within 1 minute of a Biden post - and always several times.
A lot of the people who "like their insurance" just lost their insurance along with their jobs. How does Biden's plan help them?
Biden trying to use his music or what?? Hope you‚Äôre well bro-bro
His opponent can't put together a cogent thought of any kind, and is an utterly incompetent brain damaged idiot. Biden is way better.
I rejected Biden from the start. Just another day of the rejection.

Watch "Brian has been a loyal Republican since he was 18-years-old, but Trumpism has left him voting Biden." on YouTube       TODAY MORE THAN 79% AMERICANS WANT TRUMP OUT 49% R REPUBLICANS
She doesn't look any different. What do you mean? That's a lot of Biden in your phone. You more than likely fondle your flute to his pictures.
a full 180' on what he says from day to day. There is little consistency there.  I do not give Trump a pass for his history w/ women, I also do not give Biden a pass for his creepiness. However, being a bit creepy is weighted less than the hoards of allegations against  incumbent
Joe Biden is no FDR.

Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus, party officials said Wednesday, signaling a move to a convention that essentially has become entirely virtual
Yates, Preet Bharara, so many other federal prosecutors should get jobs in a Biden DoJ. And Lt. Col. Vindman should get his career back.
Is Joe Biden high?
Why would he take the test? I can understand why tRump took it, it is clear he is in full decline. Biden doesn‚Äôt exhibit those symptoms.
So, will he go to Cleveland for the debate?  Maybe they can have the 1st debate at the gym near Biden's home.

Regardless of the title, it specifically says he is NOT endorsing Biden.  Avakian "wants his followers to know that he is not endorsing Biden, but that he sees this election as choosing a lesser of two evils." In fact, you did make this up.
Biden isn't the one making that decision. The fates have taken the wheel, and they have decided that 2020 will be the year of everyone always doing the absolute dumbest, shittiest thing possible.
Joe Biden will not go to Milwaukee for DNC
How about the  tweet last night about Biden? Think that's legal? Seems to me,you should know this stuff cuz you're a Senator. You Trumpublican Senators should have a little talk with your "president."Right.üòÇ
My metric for determining Biden‚Äôs chances in November is to note how many GOP pundits are becoming born-again deficit hawks these days.
Maybe Trump has agreed to debate Biden, &amp; maybe he hasn't. Despite efforts by right-wing media to portray Biden as a reluctant debater, it is Trump who has not yet signed on the dotted line.
Another attempt to keep Black and Brown voters from voting for Biden.
THIS IS SO PATHETIC. JOE BIDEN IS SICK. FOR GODS SAKE GET HIM MEDICAL CARE. MAYBE SOME DRUGS FROM PELOSI.

Joe Biden? For reals? Lol
Couldn't tell you. Quite frankly it doesn't matter to me. Biden could run with a pogo stick and he'd get my vote.
Lordy, just unfollowed him. Fell for the Biden face.
If this plays as a 'job well done' victory lap situation -- which I assume it will -- I might finally decide to believe that Biden can win Arizona.
But really. Is there anything to debate? A true debate would be about your platform. Trumps only platform is down playing the #trumpvirus and be negative towards Biden and others

Whether by mail or at the polling place, or a mail-in ballot dropped at the polling place -- I will vote for Joe Biden and every other democratic candidate on the ballot.
How this different from what Democrats are doing with Biden?
The problem is running for president. Biden won't be a solution to anything... he's proved that already.
Did Biden write this tweet??
Did you copy and paste this tweet from somewhere? I didn‚Äôt say shit about whether or not she‚Äôs qualified. That person mocked Bernie for losing to Biden while Kamala lost to 20 people in the primary and if she becomes VP will have to serve Biden too.
The claim that Bernie was propped up by the media is not only laughable but has been easily debunked by numerous outlets. In reality, the media propping up Biden after SC and before ST was what lead to his win. Do some homework next time
You really wanna compare candidates? Kamala didn‚Äôt even make it to Christmas. If she becomes VP she‚Äôll have to play second fiddle to the same Joe Biden you‚Äôre mocking Bernie about losing to.
You know what ill love most about a biden presidency? How he will have decorum when he continues the drug war and civility when he bombs innocent civilians.   Man that wine must be really good.
The 46th president of the United States of America Mr Joe Biden already made the announcement You're too busy tweeting
Yall wanted to endorse Joe Biden.
booed Hillary Clinton and has refused to endorse Joe Biden.  While chalking up another W! Love to see it.
Because they want to rig the election. They know their loser of a candidate Joe Biden could never stand a chance in the ring against your favorite President Trump!
You may as well vote for yourself. A  vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the destruction of America.
How did Biden do, On any interview?
Joe Biden is nothing but a puppet on the hand of the radical left socialists.
I don't know where millions of private citizens are at any moment in time, including Hunter Biden.  Joe Biden is doing the hard work and thoughtful planning that is needed to make his transition for his administration as smooth as  possible when he is elected the next President.
You failed the trial period. Unfollowed. Spend a little more time in reality than this utopian ideology that is a fantasy world in 2020. You can preach from a perch all day, but the next president will be Joe Biden or Donald Trump. That's it. The rest of this is colored bubbles.
That's really short sighted. But ok.  I have yet to hear 1 thing Biden wants to do, he is hiding from the virus, and he is just pain creepy. Jeffrey E. Creepy
By that logic, was it NOT ILLEGAL for White men to only consider other White men for VP...like they did for two hundred years? Fox host Tucker Carlson: It‚Äôs ‚Äòprobably illegal‚Äô for Biden to only consider women of color for VP
It would be good luck if Biden even lived through a minute of a debate with Trump
There won‚Äôt be another four years of America if Joe Biden wins.
And you‚Äôre going to die of shock when  he beats Biden into the ground!
To be clear: Biden, Murphy, and the Democrats aren't mad at the Trump administration because attempting to overthrow a foreign government with an undemocratic coup is a BAD THING. These warmongering imperialists are mad at Trump because the coup didn't succeed.
I BEG THE DEMOCRATS TO TELL US ONE THING THAT JOE BIDEN HAS DONE IN HIS 50 YEARS IN POLITICS EXCEPT BE A RACIST AS SHOWN ON T V FOOTAGE FROM THE PAST. HE IS A PATHETIC MAN.
JOE BIDEN IS CRAZY. B L M NOW STANDS FOR BIDEN LACKS MENTALITY. HE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE WHERE HE IS OR WHATS GOING ON. HE NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.
Kamala Harris is not the 'build back better' VP.  She's the 'build back like it was' VP. We're about to find out if Biden means it, or if it's just a nice slogan. #BuildBackBetter

Personally I'm okay with anybody that he chooses. My vote is for Joe Biden 100% down the line. And if it is taking him at so long it's because he's being careful thoughtful and considerate of the nation
Best choices would be candidates with experience as administrators, but the two Governors Biden considered, Whitmer and Lujan Grisham seem out. Harris ran the California AG's office, so she's best remaining choice.

it's because Trump thinks if he keeps giving more money more money to the Pentagon and to the military that they were going to stop Joe Biden for taking offense that's going to back him more than what Joe but little does he know the military has to back the new President Donald
They are happy that joe biden will win in November and fire you
Ha! None of it is real, look at what you shared. Yang got more individual donors than Biden did. Yang should be the second dropout after Bernie if we had a real democracy. Our media, state, and racist culture continues to kill us. #ICantBreathe #YangMediaBlackout #BasicIncome
As a democratic socialist myself, I know that Biden was/is not the first choice of people on the left.  But the alternative to that is another 4 years of Trump, which would set back left policies for years or decades to come.  I signed on to this letter to the Nation as well.
The debates are already scheduled. Trump is pushing for more.  Silly Biden talking points are useless.

Not even thinkable after Trump won the nomination and they were Rinos Republican. My sister a good DEMOCRAT had to be hospitalized and my wife half black&amp; half white Hispanic is. Ok with Trump in the Whitehouse she doesn't  even know who Biden is. I am sure that Trump will win.
Trumps enablers so worried about a Biden win now saying that Biden only looking for a black vp is illegal and discrimination
If Biden can‚Äôt debate he can‚Äôt be president

If debates look questionable, maybe  can meet Biden at the Delaware gym.  They can be separated using plastic cubes and have the panel separated with partions.
I hope Biden makes a good decision.

Anything for Biden !
There won't be any debates. The Democrats don't want to put Joe Biden in any kind of position where he shows his compromised mental state. Also Trump will refuse to wear a mask or abide by any kind of Covid restrictions. I feel like we're holding our breath.
Trump gets hit with water on the golf course and melts. Pence withers away from not being able to suck up to the president. Biden wins!
No it doesn‚Äôt. But Biden is still better than Trump, which is a very, very low bar. Unfortunately it is where we are at right now. I understand not wanting Biden, but as a POC, it could mean the difference of lives lost. I will absolutely vote Biden. Know your privilege.
Wonderful seeing  Ah, reason, sense... as for his comment about #COVID19 control "starts with president" WE DON'T HAVE ONE (haven't since 1.20.2017.) Gov should invite Biden 1 - 2 a week to zoom in to his briefings. Take control NOW! üí™
There are 8 other allegations of inappropriate physical contact against Biden from the same time period. The fact that some Biden staffers have said they dont remember the Reade incident while not addressing the others is an indictment of his staff's integrity, not her testimony.

I agree.  They could have a field day with this, if the GOP releases ads about who is surrounding Biden.
So China would own us if Biden is elected?  Russia already does, so I guess China will have to fight for ownership rights with Russia since Trump sold us out!  When Trump lets Russia pay bounties on our military and says nothing, he makes it clear that Russia owns us.

As much as I think he deserves jail, there is about 0% chance it will happen. And if he thinks it will, he will resign at the last minute (if Biden beats him) and have Pence pardon him at the last minute.

One of the Top 5 reasons to vote for Biden
It won't be Kamala Harris.due to her abrasive nature. Team Biden is going to most likely go with Rep. Karen Bass because she has proven herself invaluable, by being able to reach across party lines to work with republicans and her gentle nature. I could be wrong, but I'm not.

I want Biden to choose someone who does have presidential ambitions. The last thing we need is a drawn out and bitter primary in 2024 or 2028.
Stay focused on the goal: overwhelming landslide and Electoral College vote for Biden.
I also think the Biden team is being short-sighted. I was willing to accept the fact that the Dem nominee is yet another old white man based on the understanding that there would be a female VP, who would likely be the next nominee.
I left the Republicans and joined the Democrats because I didn‚Äôt trust Trump. If Biden wins I will become an independent. I‚Äôm just disgusted with both and the truth is I‚Äôm not alone.
I honestly don't care who he picks. I'm voting for him no matter what. Any of the people on the shortlist are more than qualified and I have every faith in Joe Biden to pick who is going to be most compatible with and will be able to help him get the most work done
Head's up: when Biden's running mate is announced, the misogynists, who should be immediately discredited, will use the following descriptors:  -Unlikable  -Inauthentic  -Too ambitious -Dishonest   -Calculating  -Aggressive  -B word/C word
is this actual fact ?  cuz I keep seeing that obama , clintons , hanks , etc... have been arrested and executed but see them in social media and on t.v. least obama and Biden. are they CGI? clones ?

I mean, Biden wasn't the one on David Duke's header photo before his account got suspended.
He will make the nation better. What have you done with your 40 years in office, Biden? I mean aside from wasting everyone's time and money.  I'm on the lookout for a good deal and you aren't it.
You were right when you said what‚Äôs needed in a VP candidate, she‚Äôs the one:
But I do want them to debate. I want Biden to call him a liar and give 20 examples of the worst lies WITH PROOF to his fucking face on live TV.   (Which, btw, is what reporters should do at every single press event).
Vote Biden so we can save this country!!!
Biden will never debate anyone.

I fear that if Biden wins they‚Äôll instead comment on every tweet of his where they poorly splice together a vaguely coherent thread of soundbytes into a single video with ‚ÄúNOW THIS üëèüèº IS WHAT A PRESIDENT SOUNDS LIKE üéäüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº‚Äù
1. Nope  2. Jill Stein would like a word.  3. Demanding rigid loyalty to the leader ... What could possibly go wrong?  4. Lots of policies Biden opposes are life and death for millions.  Conclusion: nah, I'm voting Green.
I was making the (much easier) prediction that it would be many times the number in the year before Biden took office, which is not a politically substantial position (since they were practically eliminated), but likely to be accurate :-) .
Please help, Here in New Mexico, we have a corrupt governor, Michell Lujan-Grissom. She is by the way is on Biden‚Äôs short list for VP, and a corrupt family. She has now blocked all in person campaigning oaf fundraising in the state. Please help expose this nasty abuse of power.
Figures that this scoundrel operating in the historical mode of William Walker in Nicaragua would incorporate in Biden's corporate mill. Delaware has had it in for this nation ever since the unregulated corporate form was approved by SCOTUS.
Please help, Here in New Mexico, we have a corrupt governor, Michell Lujan-Grissom. She is by the way is on Biden‚Äôs short list for VP, and a corrupt family. Her cousin is Pelosi‚Äôs lap dog.  Mark Ronchetti is running for senate and we need him desperately. Then she endorsed Biden.

Fuck Biden  Fuck Trump  Fuck the Clintons
Also, when did Biden admit his crime bill was wrong?
Americans wanted fully funded schools and universal healthcare, too, but for some totally my$terious rea$on$ Biden and the Democrats didn't do what Americans wanted on those issues.

Actually you are incorrect.  Libertarians historically take 50 50 from the 2 major parties, it's been like that in 5 consecutive presidential races.  Besides, Biden is much worse then Trump.
From CNN: Trump's muddled message isn't landing Trump's muddled message isn't landing          WHAT A WASTE OF FLESH HE IS PATHETIC EXCUSE OF A LIFE FORM MURDER OF 150,000 AMERICANS
We have no chance of a progressive future under Biden if people like you go back to brunch and pretend the problems are solved. Whoever wins, MASS protests and rebellion are needed for a progressive future to be possible.
In fact if Trump wins, I'll blame anyone that voted for Senile Biden.  He's literally the worst candidate the Democrats have ever nominated for President.
Wonder if Trump will sneak up behind Biden, like he did with Hillary.
Throwing a vote away is only possible if you vote for someone you don't believe in.  In this case the only 2 people that would fit that description would be Biden and Trump, Jo Jorgensen is literally the only person of those three I could believe in to do what's right for America
Biden has always made idiotic comments like these.  Look into his busing legislation, he backed known racists like Jesse Helms.
...but not Joe Biden...
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
Please make this woman Biden‚Äôs VP already so I can ducking sleep at night with the slightest bit of hope for the future. For fuck sake, why is this dicision so difficult. It‚Äôs extremely obvious she‚Äôs the right choice.
It's crazy to me that progressives critiqued Harris from the jump about her record as prosecutor and people went "toxic bernie bros üôÑ" and then literal Biden aides denounce her on the actual basis of gender and race. Like maybe the Bernie bros weren't the toxic ones
Trump is not a typical politician which I can‚Äôt stand, like Biden, etc. Trump is trying to achieve fair trade, safe borders, employment, strong economy, etc And he has! Until this virus hit...isn‚Äôt that convenient!? People need to respect other people‚Äôs views! My opinion!
Biden and the Convention could choose a tuna fish sandwich and I'll vote for them. There's no "other" option.
Imagine thinking the left wing is supporting Joe Biden as anything other than not being Trump.
Because they are receiving the funds being raised by BLM through Act Blue platform! Why do you think Biden is doing so well on fundraising!
Joe Biden doesn't and didn't yall endorse him?
I don't think there are. There is no requirement for Joe Biden to debate that loathsome ape.  If he wants to fine, but no need. This voter will vote Joe Biden no matter what.
You're right, tho Biden and Dem leaders have all come out against current calls for all Medicare-for-all plans, dashing my hopes, so far. Biden seems to be an open guy, and I'm eager to hear what he has in mind for health care.
He wants to bankrupt social security so biden has to deal with it
Thank you for being here and you give me hope in these dark times. We have a fascist wanna be in power. I know Biden will turn things around. I'm sorry the white peeps don't see you. I see you.üíô
If the #PostalService American Postal Workers Union is going to certify delivery and receipt of 130 MILLION #ballots in November, they shouldn‚Äôt be endorsing  in August. NO CHANCE OF #VoterFraud HERE!
They should just make a meme of Biden as William Henry Harrison at this point
‚ÄúAll this is designed to help Biden, whom they endorsed in a Washington Post op-ed in April. Their unique skill is talking to conservatives in a way that Democrats can‚Äôt, with techniques that they‚Äôve honed over many Republican campaigns.‚Äù
You gave a 1.2 Trillion dollar tax break to your rich cronies that the rest of us have to pay for and you‚Äôre whining about what you think Biden will do when he becomes POTUS (which he won‚Äôt)? Talk about desperate!! Trump, the disgrace being laughed at by the rest of the world.
When Nina said voting for Joe Biden was like eating a bowl of shit, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be Biden‚Äôs pick.
All I care about if he can be a President who stands up for Americans! That‚Äôs what Trump has been doing unlike Biden who was the VP for 8 yrs! Did nothing significant!

Even more so. Trump has gone quite mad and would most likely spew out nothing but conspiracy theories and lies, and Biden would have to waste network exposure on such crap. Better to make more productive use of his time.

Only poor blacks will  vote for Biden , but this time that may change!!!
Okay, the intense racism and misogyny being directed at Harris is off the charts, not just the 'leaks' from alleged Biden insiders but the hysterical far-left pro crime faction. All of this is making me admire Harris more than ever.
Absolutely. Fascism is here. And Biden doesn't give me an ounce of hope. Shit is laughable. Also cryable.

What I'm enthusiastic about is kicking trump's ass so hard that he FLIES out the door and lands flat on his face on the White House lawn, has to crawl to his knees, and limp to Marine One to be flown away.  Does that make me enthusiastic enough about voting for Joe Biden?

If you were Joe Biden, you'g have no idea of what you're doing.
Once again I have to say with clarity. President Obama did not run 4 years ago. You cannot defeat somebody who didn't run. He tries to erase Obama's legacy but he can't. It just grows stronger every year with each and everyone of us President Biden will bring it all back
So where is the FBI investigation into candidate Biden as a potential blackmail target regarding the Biden family relationship with both China &amp; Ukraine?
I really think they are increasingly pinning their hopes on another Russian active measures disinformation campaign, they KNOW it worked last time.   Biden should pick a senator who serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence to prepare for this...
I'm guessing it will be back to the Hunter Biden Burisma bullshit and that wackjob theory pushed by loons that 'Russiagate' was a "hoax" and Michael Flynn was "framed".

Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It Sounds a lot like  Agenda when she was running for president. Looking more like he really likes her policies. She also helped with budget plan for Biden.

Trump campaign hits pause on TV ad spending for 'review' of messaging strategy  The move comes after the demotion of campaign manager Brad Parscale and polls showing the president trailing Biden. I guess they saw those ads weren't working for him very well
Still thinking about that one person that said Biden couldn‚Äôt have raped Tara because Biden is hot and Tara isn‚Äôt.
shutting  restaurants‚Äô inside service down in the hot summers months!hasn‚Äôt slowed down the + cases.  Give this farce up. It‚Äôs not right to shut the entire state down; you‚Äôre killing business in places that have very few cases. Keep trying to kiss Biden‚Äôs ass but Kamala‚Äôs got it
Additionally, the claim in their original post that the vast majority of Americans are centrist is absurd--so assuming every one of Biden's policies were indeed perfectly centrist would mean having an agenda that does not, in fact, represent most of the country.
I'm still wondering what Khive does if she doesn't get picked as Biden's VP...
Yup. And it doesn't matter who Biden selects as VP, they're going to go after her with every sleazy, sexist spin and lie. So, suit up, folks! Let's win this thing.

100% this. I don‚Äôt feel there was a single person better qualified than her. But, her influence on Biden even now gives me hope. And he‚Äôs listening! The fact she‚Äôs still kicking ass &amp; hasn‚Äôt stopped fighting gives me hope. She genuinely cares. We‚Äôre lucky to have her.
It is the same with Joe Biden.  He should be at home, but he thinks he must hold that spot for whoever the Dems intend to be their real candidate.
I'll just leave this here!
The VP doesn't control the purse strings and you know it. You and your cronies were in charge during that time because the GOP controlled both the House &amp; the Senate. So, sorry, this bogus BS is on your heads, not Biden's.
But what does that have to do with the accuracy or otherwise of the material about Biden?  The dubious Ukrainian sources used to convict Paul Manafort weren‚Äôt a problem for the Democrats.

Is she also not allowed to talk about race issues? Richard Spencer was comfortable enough to say that the Trump campaign is the first time that an identity politics for non ppl of color is on the rise, so maybe check your perverted, bigoted president.
Both of these so-called criticisms would be just fine if she was a man. Hopefully Biden won‚Äôt listen.And just like that Trump got all the liberals to start talking about God. Biden can't remember what he had for breakfast you think he can quote the Bible.

I agree. I‚Äôm just conflicted. voting for Trump is a no, voting for Biden is a no, and voting third party is essentially throwing away your vote.
Biden won‚Äôt debate because everyone one will know he is messed up in the head and does not have a clue where he is or what year it is. Worthless oxygen thief.

Kind of misleading on POLITICO‚Äôs part, don‚Äôt you think Donna? They make it sound as though Trump himself has knocked on doors, and that Biden NEEDS to. If there were even a remote possibility that The Hemorrhoid would knock on my door, I‚Äôd answer with a katana in hand.
Sorry I'm not sorry... but I trust Twitter to decide what is and isn't misinformation about as much as I trust Joe Biden around little girls.
It‚Äôs hard not to when he keeps saying stupid shit. He‚Äôs supposed to be the steady experienced statesman.   In recent interview when asked if he‚Äôd taken a cognitive test like Trump, he gets offended and goes off on reporter. And Biden asks him if he would submit to cocaine test.
Yes but most of us will vote Biden on Tuesday Nov 3. I get it.

Biden: "if you're a socialist don't vote for me." Biden supporters: "if you're a socialist who doesn't vote for Biden I am going to laugh as the facists hang you from a poplar tree. You're worse than Trump."

While I generally agree with you, I don't think the research has caught up to COVID, which may drive a record number of people to vote by mail. Those who are more science and evidence-based are likely to vote for Biden and vote by mail due to concerns with social distancing, etc.

I still laugh about it. Kinda like I'm currently snickering over the Harris stans who have started calling her "Mamala." üò≤ That Latino outreach the Biden campaign isn't doing would reaaalllly come in handy, here.
No way, Biden mains Sub-Zero
So being from one of those Shitty Southern States, I thought the borders were closed. Border patrol under Trump us the most corrupt bunch allowing drugs and sick immigrants. Don't worry folks, Biden and Harris will do the real work necessary to secure our corrupt border.
Trump only cares about Trump. He has no idea how to wipe his ass much less run a business or a country. Biden/Harris ticket presents RNC with a problem. Lies and petty name calling is not leadership. It is desperation.
Biden and Harris Pledge a Strong Challenge to Trump and a Path Out of Crisis
Girl! It will all be over when Biden/ Harris take office! All the protest are because of systemic racism!! Where have you been? Or are you racist?
I could not be more disgusted with the DNC if they dug up the corpse of Reagan and ran him as "the most progressive candidate." Biden is a lying, cynical self-aggrandizer and opportunist.
Harris looks like the prez candidate..not Biden...lol
Do not let anyone deceive you,        joe biden IS A RACIST         #JoeBidenIsARacist   #Trump2020

The case had already been closed by the time Biden asked for the prosecutor to be fired.
Not to me, Fox News has been running with the ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs got terrible dementia‚Äù for months and Pirro probably believes it.   I‚Äôm betting she thinks he‚Äôs going to have a stroke before Election Day.    It‚Äôs more of a death wish than threat.
Don‚Äôt let it go unnoticed that Doofus Jr had the audacity to come out from underneath his rocks to pile on Sen Harris, as if.  Jr: Hope you have plans after January, because she and VP Biden will be kicking your and your Dad‚Äôs ass, the way Stormy did.

Creepy!  Let‚Äôs spread Covid-19 as much as possible because it will put Biden voters out of commission!
Joe Biden can read. Joe Biden can speak in complete sentences. How refreshing!
I think you're absolutely brilliant. But I must say, Joe Biden is not a baby boomer. However, Kamala Harris is. The baby boomer era is from 1946 to 1964!
Or predicate it upon a contingency. When he produces his taxes, Biden will debate with him.
Pres.Biden #MakeMyBirthdayNuts #Sweepstakes
For the first time in U.S. history, a Black woman will be on the presidential ticket of a major political party. It is a groundbreaking selection, all the more so because Harris, a U.S. senator from California, was also the logical, almost safe pick.
The Veep's VP: Inside Joe Biden's search for his own running mate
Biden is more together &amp; prepared than the Yo-Semite &amp; Covfefe Con Man‚Äôs lack of intelligence &amp; whiney emotional state of üçº baby.
Agreed. Too bad there is no one advocating for Medicare for All!  Biden keeps using the GOP talking points ‚Äúaccess‚Äù to healthcare!
Democrats need to stop saying versions of this about Biden and Harris because all it does is remind me of the better candidates that got shafted by the primary process.
Voters are not ~in~ politics, but are ~subjected~ to its effects. I‚Äôm seeing everywhere the argument to set aside critique when it comes to Biden/Harris, and just vote for them, but this is not a necessary division. Voting is a pragmatic effort accompanying attentive critique.
Harris Is Set to Appear With Biden; Trump and Allies Attack Her
Eight years of Obama/Biden and no guns taken. This is an old tired effort to rile your base.
8 years of  Obama/Biden never a gun taken away.
Also, the center isn't as much in the middle as it was. Biden is bringing the country back from the right, if this works. Time for a much-needed correction.
In case you missed it: California Sen. Kamala Harris could be the next VP. She will appear with Joe Biden for the first time as his running mate at an event Wednesday near his home in Wilmington, Del.
Well behind the real big news, yesterday, I was able to go to a hair salon ‚Äî because we have a kick-ass Governor and because people in NM are wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Oh, and I applied to be a poll worker and to volunteer for the Biden/Harris campaign.
Obama/Biden didn‚Äôt have to dismantle the USPS to win two terms
This ‚Äúsuburban housewife ‚Äú will be voting for Biden &amp; Harris.   I‚Äôm thrilled you will soon be gone.
My concern, should Biden win, is the the transition period.  What will be done to eviscerate what is left of democracy during that time?
Contenders 4 VP were good, but lots of practical politics involved. Was confident that final choice would be great ( Kamala: tough woman - drive DT nuts with her knowledge &amp; skill) &amp; others wld find powerful positions in the Biden admin. Liz 4 Maj Lead!!! Rice 4 Sec of State!!üëç
IMO, the only thing working against Sen Harris is that she'd taken a campaign contribution from then-civilian Donald Trump. Inasmuch as he has claimed to be GOP-ish in his politics, and she is a person of color and the child of immigrants, I was astounded.
Kamala will not let them get away with anything. She speaks up for the rule of law and for the rights of others. She will run circles around Pence at the debates and Kamala brings fire to the Biden ticket. Great pick
In Kamala Harris, a Choice at Once Safe and Energizing
Biden will not cut Social Security. The Democrats will not cut Social Security. If anything they will expand it. Where do U get that? The only people looking 2 cut Social Security (+ Medicare) are GOP &amp; the right. After Biden is elected &amp; serves, will U admit U were wrong?
55 Things You Need to Know About Kamala Harris
Opinion | Kamala Harris was Joe Biden‚Äôs boldest and most qualified pick - The Washington Post
If Harris is "far left," why aren't far leftists happy with Biden's choice?
biden is gag worthy, as in trying not to throw up, gag
I wish I had your faith in his ability to be pushed left. Biden has been dreadful since before I started voting in the 80s.
Good chance WFP will endorse Biden anyway.
I can't wait to see the images of the Biden inauguration crowd size compared to you know who's.
I saw it somewhere yesterday that Biden was a Catholic.  I don‚Äôt give a shit what he is, just that he gets us the hell out of this mess!
I think all the ‚Äúyeah I like Bernie, but...‚Äù or the ‚Äúunfortunately, I guess I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden/Harris ‚òπÔ∏è‚Äù people are very deserving of unfollows üëçüèº
Happy to do so.  Proud to be a Biden/Harris supporter.
Conservatives are actually trying to make the case that Biden wants to enforce Sharia Law.
Repubs will vote for Biden. Whites will vote for Harris.    Since "Progressive" means anyone but Trump.
Biden could have picked his nose and I would still vote for him and the booger.
Biden's choice of a Black woman for VP is historic. It could also help him win.
Shameful that we again nominate a weak candidate that wants the status quo. Biden wants to strengthen Obamacare: A failed Republican plan that is responsible 4 ppl dyingbc they can‚Äôt afford insurance, going bankrupt even w/ ins. or doing without meds! That is shameful!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
So sry.  Given state of country I need to vote for Biden even without a vegetable running mate.  I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs a spot in cabinet:  Turnip for Sec of Agriculture!!! Who could be better!!
Ummmmm, you do realize that Joe Biden is Catholic, don't you?
Kamala: She called Biden an "old white racist", got schooled by  , had horrible reaults in the Dem primaries, besties with #JussieSmollet , and Biden has better support with the black community than she does.  not sure why she was picked.
Even better if you do % increase, which is more relevant than raw #s: Obama/Biden +118% Trump/Pence +40%. Not that stocks are representative of economy for most, but everyone does better under Dems. Consistently
Attacking #KamalaHarris as being far left is absurd (just like attacking Biden for being far left is). Just look at Far Left US twitter if you have doubts.
Hahahaha‚ÄîGOP whining about fiscal responsibility as Trump runs up biggest deficits in American history‚Äîincluding before COVID (after Obama/Biden had brought down W‚Äôs deficits...and Clinton brought down Reagan/Bush deficits). Hahahaha
If Kamala stood up and apologized for her past poor judgment and explained how she has changed and why.  And, if I believed her &amp; she said she is for #M4All  I would consider it.  I believe Biden will not be pres for long.. due to his declining health.
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
Exactly.  No way I‚Äôm voting for  Biden.

Congratulations, Kamala Harris! Re "the little guy" Biden mentioned in his tweet, first off, please get those kids out of cages on the border!
biden hates kamala in his heart
Lol. Ok Dave. Trump has only let 160,000 Americans die, but Biden is in trouble?  Suuuuuuuuure.
Joe Biden is Catholic.
Almost anything is a net gain over Biden.
So desperate dear Donald! Divider in Chief, racist, traitorous,thieving moron, 168K dead because you said Corona virus was a Dem hoax, then it will disappear, mocks face masks,slows testing, wha? Why is Trump still President? Why isn‚Äôt he in jail? Biden/Harris will whoop yo ass!
Biden/Harris will protect us! not allow assault weapons in such situations. Vote blue
Even kamala believes biden's accusers
I mean....... I don't see a world in which Biden lets anyone dismantle homeland security. Obama didn't even close Gitmo
Really? And can you in good conscience let Trump destroy whatever degree of democracy we have left? I would recommend to mull over this and imagine the two outcomes‚ÄîBiden or Herr Drumpf‚Äîand then make your choice.
Biden picking Harris is like Bush and Cheney all over again.
I ordered my Biden Harris yard sign already! Let‚Äôs do this!

Gotta say, I had a premonition of this. Maya Harris (sister/campaign mgr.) is VERY close with the Clintons, and I can guarantee you that if Biden wins, he‚Äôll soon have a ‚Äúmedical incident‚Äù and Kamala will announce HRC as VP.
Her endorsement meant a lot to me, and I will do everything I can to ensure President Biden and the first ever woman of color Vice President Harris are elected this November.

Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate - ABC News
Better than that vulture Jamie Dimon, who is reportedly on Biden's short list.
There is a large faction of the DNC that is still doing absolutely everything to oppose Sanders.   Remember, Biden's hostility towards consumers &amp; coziness w/predatory lenders &amp; credit card companies is what got Warren into politics in the first place.

joe biden does not respect harris or any other black person in his heart
Looks like I won't be voting for Biden. Nor Trump. Nor Kanye. Nor Mikey Mouse. I frankly have no opinion on the matter one way or the other. Too abstract and removed from everyday life.  "Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind. Oooooo ahhh..."
Indeed. Biden is not much different than digging up the corpse of Ronald Reagan. Adding a self-described "top cop" to the ticket doesn't exactly improve the stench.
Biden should have picked  as his running mate.

All this talk about the Biden #VPPick, I‚Äôm wondering when  will announce his  pick.
the GOP must own their failure to save us from a Depression. If McConnell is the majority leader he will obstruct President Biden at every turn. Voters must be made to understand why it is imperative to send Democrats to Congress and not only the WH.
really? clearly Biden supporters have Biden mentalities.
All these dominoes will have fallen before the end of the week. It is the only way, and I would not take a bet on the Spring sports, either, unless VP Biden wins. And by then, we will have 300,000 dead, with no good reason
In other words: both Trump and Biden are terrible candidates. Both are thin-skinned, combative, compulsive liars, and both are guilty of rampant nepotism in  service of their hideous children.
And Biden's considering him as Secretary of the Treasury?
Biden plans to give police forces MORE money, not less. He's on the record with that.
I don't think that is a fair or accurate spin on what he said or meant. I'll just accept that we unfortunately see it differently &amp; say that Biden is a better man that U give him credit 4 - certainly miles &amp; miles better than the menace currently in the White House. All the best.
They are both *that bad.* I've been watching Biden help gut our safety net and lie through his teeth since the Reagan era.
My father calls Biden "the last of the Dixiecrats."
At this point, I'm shocked at Republican's lack of spine. It's absurd. I can't believe they won't stand up for our country. This country is greater than any one man and I believe you can steer the ship right, Mr Biden üëçüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

You're kidding, right? You may not be crazy about Biden, but voting for someone else, or not voting at all, is the same as casting a vote for Trump. This is a defining moment for our country. No candidate is perfect, although, compared to Trump, almost anyone might seem to be so.
Yes Harris is awful in sooo many ways but because she‚Äôs neutral (almost conservative really) she is the best option for biden to beat trump. If you don‚Äôt vote for biden because of harris,  you‚Äôre then voting for trump.
"Mango Mussolini", "Apricot Asswipe", "President Sippycup Stumbletoes", "Orange Caligula", or "Trumplethinskin".  Personally, I think Biden could use Mango Mussolini if he here's "sleepy Joe" during the debate.

Remember, Biden had aneurysms in the late 80‚Äôs. No wonder he can‚Äôt function.
If you really hate this shit you need to get out there and demand voting rights, support the USPS and condemn the entire GOP for their fascist and authoritarian power grab. Support Biden/Harris. Anything less is BS.
People aren‚Äôt aware that Biden has a couple of brain aneurysms in the late 80‚Äôs. Wikipedia said it could affect his functionality.
You don‚Äôt. When rumors that Biden was going to pick Beto out of the gate were circulating, us Beto supporters were pissed off. Rightfully so. She hadn‚Äôt even decided she wasn‚Äôt running and the media was hounding her as to whether she would take VP.
Again, eloquently breaks down Trump‚Äôs attack on USPS, defers question about VP pick to Biden team, says Joe will make the right choice, redirects back to voter suppression. This is the interview she‚Äôs been giving since early June.
President Joe Biden!
It doesn't matter we're coming for him and he's not going to stop us! Joe Biden and the American people will claim the victory!
Literally she did almost every show in the week leading up to the VP announcement and refused to talk about it. She referred all questions about it to the Biden campaign and redirected to say she was proud to work with Joe on voter suppression and census.
I watched every show too. Since the ONE interview months ago where she responded to everyone shredding her capabilities and experience for months by standing up for herself by saying she would be an excellent running mate, she has answered with referring all questions to Biden.
Girl, what? She redirected every question about being on the VP shortlist back to talking about fighting voter suppression and the census every time. I could literally post every interview here to prove it. She said ‚ÄúI refer all questions about that to the Biden campaign‚Äù.

Can Biden/Harris give me some bullshit position in the administration so I can get fired and then write a lackluster 'tell-all' memoir and make millions? I'll vote for them if they agree to those terms.

Madam VP and President Biden sure sounds good!   You can do it and you can fight hard.  You give it right back to them in this fight!   Let‚Äôs get our democracy back.
What a bunch of crap! How do you post this with a straight face? Or are you secretly smirking? Biden didn‚Äôt suggest swallowing Clorox.
Sorry Sleazy Biden, I'm outdoors, no way I'm wearing any of your control devices.

Gregg Pop looks as lost as Joe Biden
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
‚Äúthe big difference between the parties now is that Biden and Harris are trying to make things better, trying to make us more like the country we‚Äôre supposed to be. Trump and Mike Pence, by contrast, are basically trying to make open racism great again‚Äù
Harris hates bananas! Harris wants to kidnap your children! Biden hates cars! And the sky! And shoes!
They didn't retract. They just said that only people who are voting for Biden can shit on him. Lotsa liberals got radicalized by BLM but they apparently need more time to really understand that electoralism will never be what they want it to be.
82 days until we elect Joe Biden the 46th President of the United States. 82 days until we elect Kamala Harris the first female Vice President in American history.
I feel like that question is going to be a question thats going to be repeated ALOT over the next few years as his VP pick takes over his seat since Biden knows hes a transitionary candidate

Unfortunately most people think we should be wearing masks. This includes many conservatives. I am not one of those but Biden is playing to those people. It is a political move that may work sorry to say.
Joe Biden: For The Next 3 Months, All Americans Should Wear A Mask When Outside
Trump supporters are more than twice as likely to be "issues voters" as Biden supporters. Liberals are basically offering their complete capitulation to the corporate establishment (and screaming at the left to do the same) because ORANGE MAN BAD.
But Trump is a dictator ya‚Äôll said. Okay, but now Biden seems to be.
why does it feel like there‚Äôs a real chance joe biden shows up to the first debate with a lil bit of chick fil a sauce on his collar?
GOP has generally denied science and sought to prioritize private interests over national health. Saying that Biden was wrong about the virus is ridiculous. Trump was in the chair and did NOTHING!
This lie started floating before Biden even made a decision.
LOL...you‚Äôre really saying Biden is ignoring facts &amp; science about the virus while your Orange Fuhrer is touting hydroxychloroquine, injecting people with disinfectant, and saying the virus will just disappear? You might want to rethink the lies you tell!

Ask all Americans to unite behind Joe Biden in a spirit of bipartisanship.
Thank you...We all know that Biden is a let down, but saying he's the same as Trump is absolutely bonkers. It's a bus trip, you take the one that gets you further instead of trashing it for not taking you all the way  We cannot afford another 4 years of trump

The people did not pick Biden tho. Nobody, not the far left or the actual democrats, is happy about him being the other choice. Him and trump are one in the same
For yesterday's Biden/Harris speeches, they used Teleprompters set to the left &amp; right, the way you would w/an audience; not directly ahead, as normal for a purely broadcast address. I thought it was effective, and I suspect that's what they're planning for convention speeches.
You‚Äôre mistaken. If they win, Kamala will run the White House. That‚Äôs why Biden‚Äôs selection was so crucial.
I keep seeing libs who view this as a great thing "Oh, Biden's gonna win in a landslide because people hate Trump" but it's actually a very damning indictment. If at any point, for whatever reason, voters start to feel neutral towards Trump, Biden loses over half his support.
In order to win this election we are going to need moderates, independents, and even conservatives to vote for Biden. That may mean having a convention that is inclusive. While to use dems it may seem odd, I guarantee it is a well thought out strategy to widen appeal.

I get it, I really do. We can comb through the dirty baggage that Biden and Kamala have accrued. But look at what the opposition is! Yes we need to constantly critique and hold our leaders accountable but in the face of 4 years of more disaster, we need to unify.

Show me the proof that China Hacked anything to help Biden. There is proof that Russia is using OAN the spread disinformation.
Biden did say Harris "would be ready to LEAD the first day".  Sounds like he won't be around long if he wins.
i mean people have been speculating they're going to withdraw Biden so this isn't surprising
If they are already questioning her parents nationality-they recognize she is a real threat to their power.    Someo who questions Harris or Biden‚Äôs qualifications for the jobs they seek entirely lacks credibility.    Important to remember-no dirty trick to low for republicans
"Don‚Äôt hurt our cause"  i'm all for anyone but Trump.  i'm vegan too.  i also am conscious that Biden is a terrible choice for President, and picking a cop during world-wide cop protests is... aslo a terrible idea.

Dems are in a bad position with the electoral college. It takes more blue votes to get a dem in office than for repubs. To win we have to show up in big numbers. Even a tiny fraction of the vote splitting is how we got Trump. So yes, no vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
We're living in Russia right now....next stop...Belarus....barr will sanction that...jean pirro is inviting assassination of Joe Biden......maybe it will backfire
Right?! This makes Biden look strong and willing to get the job done
Yeah boost away, I just didn't wanna explicitly say Fuck Joe Biden exclusively for a boost.  I wanted to say Fuck Joe Biden because Fuck Joe Biden.
"He'll act much more presidential once he takes office."  Trump voters in 2016 but also Biden voters now.
In what world do you see suburban housewives...voting for you??    Your childish behavior, name calling, lying and spreading fake news...only serves to show how unfit you are for president.    Biden and Harris...will get the job done!!!
This kind of herd mentality is why political parties will never improve, they know that no matter what they do or who they select that their members will support them no matter what, even if they had said they hated them before. Dems went from hating Harris &amp; Biden to loving them
Your little cartoon is belittling to the least.  If your the train...full of hot air and running on the backs of others.  At least you dhow Biden actually doing the work and that is why Biden will win for President.  He doesn't name call, point fingers or whine about news.
Fuck Joe Biden
I would rather not see Biden‚Äôs old wrinkly face next to her.
Don't get me wrong, Biden and Harris aren't an ideal choice either.   But the presidency (in its current state) is nothing more than a symbol and I would much rather NOT have 4 more years of symbolic fascism.  Instead we can spend the next 4 years doing two things:
There‚Äôs #hope again for real #leadership at the federal level. The future is bright with #BidenHarris2020!
Lol someone said they would rather not vote at all...because voting for Biden means "8 years of non-progress" (this person obviously forgot a term is only 4 years) and that they'd rather see the Green Party thrive.  Isn't that how we got stuck with Trump to begin with...?

Wayne Dupree: The Joe Biden-Kamala Harris Ticket Inspires ‚Äî No One!  via
Right, so Biden played it safe in terms of leaning hard right (for Dems) and consolidating his whole ticket behind corporatocracy and oligarchy, showing his true colors. SMH Do you think he cares about racial justice, equality and trans rights? He doesn't even support UHC.
Right, I think Warren is enough of a Bernie protege for me to go for that. She was my easy second pick in the primary. And Biden could have done himself a favor in rallying the progressives behind him for November in her, but man he screwed dat pooch.
It's the same people who justify Biden's you ain't black comment.
Who‚Äôs Joe Biden...and what‚Äôs a Kamala?
I have a feeling a lot of those accounts saying they‚Äôre not voting for Biden are Bots, a lot of fakes out of Russia trying to divide the Democratic Party the way Trump has divided America!
Trump has already ‚Äúswayed‚Äù me to vote for Joe Biden.
My take is that the country survived the civil war and it will survive Trump. In a way we're actually still fighting the civil war, this being divided by racism. Under Biden that might all get swept under the rug again, protests and support for the protestors might go away.
In 2016, Putin used "Pro-Clinton" ads to discourage voters and widen political divisions. So if an account looks suspect, report it, even if it is promoting Biden/Harris.
Biden got his Pokemon hoping to win the election. You know she is just being used right? People complain about talking about grabbing by the pussy, Biden actually does it.
Oh boy, Biden is thinking about little girls. What a sicko...
Today's Word of the Day is rodomontade.
Biden/Kamala don‚Äôt care about Americans, so that would be just fine with them!
This young man has good points why to vote Biden/Harris even when they were not your first choices. Many of us had to compromise. I‚Äôm happy with this compromise though
Yeah, they said it was content i chose not to see, lol i was like im not Biden you cant make my decisions for me
This, as we were told repeatedly during the primary, is a 100% legitimate reason to refuse to vote for a candidate. Therefore it's pretty clear that anyone who wants to get mad at Bernie supporters for refusing to vote for the toxic Biden/Harris ticket is virulently anti-Semitic.
Boost not requested.  Fuck Joe Biden anyway.
I doubt the Sleazy, Creepy, Slimy Biden knows what denounce means
All y‚Äôall that are hating so hard on Biden/Harris seemed to forget that none of y‚Äôall showed up to the polls on Super Tuesday. We could have had Bernie running against trump if we had just turned those tweets into action, shit bums me out.
Only the most ignorant or the greedy will buy this drivel. Biden/Harris is out now and the difference is startling-just Joe and Kam being who they are is a mortal blow to Trump/Pence...with or without Mother, Pence does not want to debate Harris...
I'm glad you mentioned that.  I would love to see the citation for Biden going after Social Security.  I know he has said he will veto Medicare For All if it's not fiscally responsible, but Medicare is not Social Security.
No wonder he overfilled his Depends when he learned Biden chose Kamala.

Why not reserve the Deleware gym for mid-September and challenge Joe Biden to a debate?  Ask 2 TV stations to show up.  Limit the number of people who can attend.
It was so refreshing to hear both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They are good people.  Those who are still lamenting a candidate that didn't get the presidential or vice presidential bid, need to get over it now.  This is a great ticket, a winning ticket.  #BidenHarrisForTheWin

When will the kamala shit end. I am already over this crap. She is a shitty  vp pick. Biden stated it was going to be a black female. He is a corporate shill of course he was going to pick someone with the same history.

Cajoling definitely won't suffice.  I've looked at your timeline, and surmise (and respect) that you believe nothing will suffice with them.  Since, this year, the least bad outcome will be Biden and Harris in the white house, I hope something else will suffice for now.
I've got to be honest, it's probably better that you don't. It's up to you of course... But at this point asking anyone to vote for Biden and kamala is like telling us to commit  sepuku. So much for being for the people.

Move over Hillary, Biden is about to become the newest "Most mythologized living person" now
‚Äòwith this pick, Biden showed that people around him shouldn't be afraid to speak out, that it won't get someone thrown under the bus or "canceled."
‚ÄòWhat's also notable is that Harris is seen as a "safe" pick. That's because she's a known quantity, has already been vetted during the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and is disciplined.‚Äô
Breaking:  trump learned of this disclosure and that Biden chose Kamala Harris while on his golf course...he promptly over filled his Depends...
I just got an email asking me to participate in a Biden focus group. So I did.
President Obama hardly ever said "trust me" when people questioned his intent;  he would say "keep me honest".  And those of us on the left side that elected him didn't do enough to keep him honest.  I want Biden/Harris elected, and I want us to watch them and keep them honest.
Harris wants U.S. to give Americans $2,000 a month during pandemic, a contrast with Biden‚Äôs measured approach      Real help from #BidenHarris2020.  All you want to do is help your rich friends.
Biden and Harris is just plain scary
Hard pass. I‚Äôll be watching the winning ticket - Biden/Kamala.
Liberals: We don't want a progressive candidate! We'll push Biden left to secure the leftist vote!  Leftists: okay. Let's see it.  Biden: OINK OINK WE THE PIG PARTY NOW SQUEEEAAAAL! FUCK YOUR HEALTHCARE PLANS!  Liberals: This can only be the fault of the leftists!
well said
wondering how many times biden will even get to see harris in person this fall
WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware
Biden makes his pick  #NewsRadioKKOB #BrandonVogt
Let‚Äôs be real, anybody who says they won‚Äôt vote for Joe Biden because of his VP pick wasn‚Äôt going to vote for him in November anyway.
Why Biden picked 'fearless fighter' Kamala Harris as his running mate
And what's scary to think about is that if Biden becomes president and then he cloaks out while president, she will become president. üò®
The country needs mature, responsible leadership to pull us out of this ongoing disaster ‚Äî and Kamala Harris will help Joe Biden deliver it ---- EVERY SMART EXECUTIVE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE TEAM YOU BUILD AROUND YOU.  via
Congrats Senator Harris.  Together, Joe Biden and Kamala will bring our country back!   What a great team!
The systems that Biden helped create?
I knew Kamala  would be Biden's choice; I'm so happy!!!!!
Kind of expected it, altough Caiifornia would have propably gone to Biden anyway. Kubachar or Wilson would have better.
You do actually have to choose between empathetic and intelligent humans, or Biden/Harris.
Remember the inauguration when Secretary Clinton &amp; Barack Obama demonstrated strength, grace, &amp; class attending? Does anyone think for a sec Trump will attend Biden's inauguration?  #TrumpIsASoreLoser
No,we need these debates,Biden gaffes and Trump bullshitting stupidity,all out there. Biden will be ready but Trump is going to chicken out. Just a matter of when and what excuse Trump will use.
I think a lot of people are completely oblivious to what the democratic party has transformed into the last 4 years. They think it's still the first Obama/Biden ticket
Love the fact that you tweeted Biden and Harris, as if they care one whit about what a tin horn like you thinks.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
The biggest indictment on Biden voters is that every time  replies to one of bidens tweets they never realize it's a bot and start trying to insult and attack the 'person'.
Democratic nominee Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his Vice President, so what does that mean for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham who was considered for the job? Could a cabinet seat be in her political future?
Just this is enough to get my vote:  When asked why she was so mean to Joe Biden in the first debate, Kamala Harris laughed and said, ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS  POLITICS.‚Äù Right she is. If you want to play the hardest game in the world, you better be tough.  via
Biden could‚Äôve picked someone with a lower profile or less Washington experience, aomeone he could control better. She‚Äôs not that; not by a mile. This is a real breakthrough. To those of us who‚Äôve watched the world topple women while men soar on, unimpeded, it matters.
My amazing governor  Michelle Lujan Grisham just showed up like the badass she is on msnbc üî•üî•and I gotta say, it‚Äôs quite impressive that she was the only LatinX person on Biden‚Äôs short list. So proud üòÅüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Doesn‚Äôt help Biden/Harris"  fuck helping public servants.  Trump is awful and needs to go.  anyone is better.  i feel sorry for anyone who actually thinks Biden is THE BEST choice to be president, cause he is just the best over Trump.  Biden is too old and out of touch to lead.
I‚Äôm not saying it is. Dark fox is saying that Biden won‚Äôt even make it a full term before dying, insinuating his old age as a factor. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs bullshit considering trump is only 3 years younger...
Worthwhile read. "...The Harris pick is not only historic in nature but also has many elements that make it a powerful positive moment for the Biden campaign."
okay, i understand that. and i totally agree. the system needs to be made over, but do you really thing that the division in this country right now will allow something like a green party candidate to be elected? and what happens if we lose that fight? biden‚Äôs already a shitty.
JOE BIDEN MADE A REALLY BAD DECISION. SHE IS AN INDIAN JOE. MICHAEL OBAMA IS A BLACK MAN. W T F
No one DESERVES to be VP or POTUS. Everything should be earned. She didn‚Äôt earn this. Biden boxed himself in when he said he‚Äôd pick a woman of color to be VP. She was picked on a coin toss &amp; that‚Äôs all. Deserves?.You self entitled libs make me sick.#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
I was going with "Biden is one unit less evil than Trump."
Senator Harris is tough and can take of herself. She rocks! Biden is lucky to have her in the VP spot.
Amen to that! trump is so malignant people have to be in denial to "what about" Biden/Harris. I'll work for that ticket, but won't love them.
Voted for her, even after it was clear that Biden had won. Mostly in hope that it would prove she should be the VP ticket.
They support a Biden/Hitler ticket with more enthusiasm than they ever supported Bernie.
Biden Needs A Friend, A Real Friend, Or A Family Member To Put An End To These Shannigans! He Needs Medical Attention Not The Stress That The Comes With A Presidential Campaign! He‚Äôs Already Had 2 Brain Aneurysms! He Doen‚Äôt Need Another One!
Either trump wins and he makes things worse or Biden wins and he does nothing to help. Yaaaay
You think this is a great pick because you are a white Liberal with privilege. Biden and Kamala are horrible for minorities.
Let‚Äôs see Kamala called Biden a sexual predator and racist. Great pick.
Biden: "Hey Liz! Can we get your notes?"
So the #democrats now have - Biden, who sponsored racist criminal bills,  and Harris, who cared more about her record than true justice.  Congrats, Dems.. you basically have North Korean gulag runners for your Dem. Picks. Enjoy that forced slave labor while incarcerated.
As a math person, I really fucking hate how much the term "exponentially" gets abused these days. The only way Biden is "exponentially" better is if the exponent is zero, because technically speaking:  Biden = Trump - 1  Is the same as  Biden = (Trump - 1) * e^0
Everyone should be treated the same. Just cuz I'm not white shouldn't get me considered for a job over a white person who is more qualified. that's exactly what Biden just did yesterday. He admitted he was picking a woman of color,  it didn't matter if she's qualified or not
Thank you. I am sooooo happy todayüòä Biden/Harris2020. America‚Äôs hope for the future!üòä
Great that Biden is being responsible! And I'm pretty sure Jill lets him out of the basement on a regular basis. Did you see his bike ride?  I'm headed over to buy/donate, why don't y'all join me? She doesn't read the replies anyway.
"Better than Trump" is about the lowest bar you can possibly set, and the Democrats have once again chosen to measure themselves against this standard with a Biden/Harris ticket that barely clears it.   I'll vote by mail; no way I'm doing anything more for these two assholes.
Are you more excited to vote for Biden or Harris?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
lol did any one else get triggered with Joe Biden's "You ready to go to work!?"   I guess I do have traumas with white man telling me to work. üò¨
There isn't enough space to record all the laughter towards this statement. What you mean is she is the team as Biden slips into a permanent time in the past (not saying this with any pleasure, it is horribly sad). When you cast a vote for Biden you are voting for Harris as Prez
Kamala Harris is the safe, boring, obvious choice, for a candidate and campaign that are making a virtue of those traits. Biden's anti-attention strategy rolls on--or so I argue, in my new  joint:
You forgot your God. Biden stole that too right?
why can't we have you and  on the ballots instead of Biden and Harris?  That's a MUCH better ticket.
Saying #KamalaHarris  is ‚Äúnasty‚Äù is SO TYPICAL coming from someone #TrumpIsALaughingStock  who regularly attacks Biden and many other people he disagrees with first by calling them insulting nicknames. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Be wary of who is paying for four decades of Joe Biden's racist and pro-corporate policies.
Somebody I went to high school with called Biden a Marxist the other day.  We're so fucked. This Overton Window thing is a much more serious problem than I think most people realize.
I‚Äôm not being criticized, people are calling me racist and transphobic for saying I don‚Äôt want to vote for joe Biden. That‚Äôs just harassment. No one has presented a good, level headed argument that is going to change my mind, not like I was going to in the first place.
Not to mention Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill...
Not much funnier than  claiming  and  are far left socialists and then listening to the actual far left socialists saying that Biden and Harris are far too conservative.
Well get over it, a race is a race!  I am voting for Biden/Harris!  The alternative sucks!
So many vote on their feelings rather than on issues, wished more people wake up. It‚Äôs a total ‚Äúno on Biden‚Äù since Biden! Lol
- Fox News Radio  - CNN Suggests Joe Biden Could ‚ÄòStep Aside‚Äô for Kamala Harris -  - #abqfm #rockoftalk #ABQ #NM #tcot #nmpol #newsabq
Biden didn‚Äôt make the choice . The party did. Biden is the nominee but Harris will be President if he is elected.
You‚Äôre wrong about the suburban housewives, the one thing they are is very intelligent and educated .When you were getting in the election ,you said you wanted ignorant and non educated people.The Biden/Harris Team Wants ALL,they Don‚Äôt  Judge!Blue wave üí™
Hey I need another 50 orgs to email me to tell me who joe Biden picked for VP I‚Äôm still not clear
It what fantasy universe is Harris a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pick? She‚Äôs both a bold choice, and a popular one.
Both parties have been blown up. Trump did that. He has been fighting the Cabal for four years with little help from the Republican side. Think Paul Ryan! Both sides are evil! If we don‚Äôt win, installed Biden will crush all our freedoms!!!
do better. #BidenHarris
Amy good morning ,you‚Äôll fit right in with that party ,Biden Harris, was watching GMA this morning ,you next to Kamala if your hair was longer it would be hard to tell you two apart ,maybe that‚Äôs why you best buddies ,have a great dayBluewave üí™
You are neither of these. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both.  You and your sycophants out putting down a man and woman more capable than the entire Rethuglican party
Dems line of thinking that I heard earlier. Biden, Kamala and pelosi. Biden gets removed or dies, kamala cant be a pres since she's an anchor baby so pelosi steps in, in her place.  Makes sense and why we have to vote our asses off. They will be cheating like dems do.
Back-to-back in my Trumpland message-setters feed this morning: Biden-Harris is the choice of Wall Street, and of radical socialists and anarchists.
Joe Biden is a practicing catholic.  You may want to stop moving known sexual abusers rather than putting them in jail.  And oh by the way that whole separation of church and state thing ....
I wonder if Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a racist?! The hypocrisy is unreal man... and Democrats are overjoyed at this news?? What a bunch of fucken idiots. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tangentially related - how did conservatism become so demonized? I just can‚Äôt believe how quickly that happened. Biden will be such an extremely progressive puppet president for the new (D) party. I‚Äôm constantly vilified for preferring trump over the Uber progressives
Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden‚Äôs historic VP pick
She is not your opponent. She is Mike Pence's opponent. Your opponent is Joe Biden.  Try to keep things straight.
You are not only wrong, but insulting. The "suburban housewife" is a myth, a fable from the past.   Suburban women want a good and decent world to live in without all of the noxious racism and misogyny.  Suburban women, both married and unmarried, want Joe Biden for the POTUS.
I mean there is jo jorgensen, ill be voting for her. I can't vote trump just like in 2016 I couldn't bring myself to vote for him but he proved why I couldn't over 4 years. Biden/Harris is the Democrat knockoff version of Trump/Pence so why vote for DLC?
Biden is like Trump on steroids
Not full oppo. She was the safest pick for Biden. Just In an era of Black Lives Matters and Defund the Police, Joe Biden proposed increasing police budgets and now he has announced a cop, Kamala as VP  The Democratic Party doesn't care about minorities.
Not just rejoiced, at least in Biden's case he helped write the 94 Crime Bill, helping lead to more blacks being arrested and given longer jail time than whites
Kamala votes for Trump's military budgets twice. You know one of the leading causes to climate change is the military industrial complex? Biden is a warmonger and loves his fracking and fossil fuels.  Keep going though....
my mother went into deep depression in 2016. She died in 2018. I know damned well she's being a party animal on the other side today. She adored Joe Biden. And she really loved Kamala.
Well, I fully expect Biden to step down before even a year in Office.
You talking about Joe Biden as the racist incompetent bigot?  Cause if so you are correct. #TRUMP2020Landside
BLM,Black,Brown All Color Matter,Clayborne Matters,Klobuchar matters, Biden/Harris matter, and myself BO matters.History Made,A woman vice president, a woman of color, great woman. You able to tell grandchildren you helped first woman voted in ,blue wave üí™
People joke about Biden not making the choice. But I doubt Democrats would have advised Harris. Biden evoked his son in his tweet revealing his pick. Looks like a sentimental choice...an homage to his son...but one that will not likely help his chances to win.   Good for Trump!
Biden doesn't care old man.
Yeah I think Biden Harris is the dumbest ticket possible but since the USA is a 2 party ticket we don't have much of a choice at this point
Is this guy a former biden staffer who said this out frustration one day,  and then quit because the whole campaign turned into this?

Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Also, just who is pretending Biden was going to give them a progressive ticket? Anyone who's been paying attention since before the primaries knew Biden's NOT a progressive, he's a rich old white man, kind of the very antithesis of progressive (stereotypi-/statisti-cally anyway).
What if Biden/Harris TRUMPED Trump's recent executive orders on unemployment, etc., with a $2k/m UBI #YangGang ü§ûüèΩüòÖ
Um wrong. Race is a social construct that is leveraged by trumps rabid supporters to justify kids in cages, secret police disappearing people etc. we are still going to have to organize against Biden/Harris but I believe more of us will be alive.
She was tough on crime. Maybe a little too much, but now that Trump is about law and order, she and Biden have to go to the extreme and be soft on crime. Whatever Trumps position, they go far left. It won‚Äôt work
Why is it the marxists groups want Biden to win? Oh yeah...they admitted it. He can be maipulated to do what they want.
Dr. Timothy Krebs, professor and Chair for the Department of Political Science at UNM, said the governor now may be on a short list for a cabinet pick under a Biden Administration. #KOBNightBeat
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm so tired of ppl looking at the left as a joke, b/c so many of them support pedo Biden. Hopefully Kamala can change things.
I‚Äôve been on a friends FB looking at MAGA comment the last few days &amp; tonight after hearing about Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. Trump is such a moron, but his supporters, Gawd, they are truly STUPIDü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  YES WE CAN OUT VOTE THEM, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS VOTE! Show up, mail in, absentee.
what‚Äôs your call on the Biden choice?  Do I wait for Abes top hat?
I even have other reasons for not voting for Biden and I‚Äôm not voting for trump. Hoes just mad.
"he's spent his life fighting for us."   LOL, multiple citations needed.  I understand why some ppl want to put all their eggs in the "get rid of Trump" basket, but don't let the Democrats gaslight you about who Biden is. They picked the most Trumpian "non-Trump" they could find.
They‚Äôre acting like the country is going to nuke itself if me, a girl in NEW MEXICO, Doesn‚Äôt vote for Biden
I never said I‚Äôd vote for Biden, it was bait lmfao
Mark, when do we get back to a national conversation on Biden &amp; Ukraine? We need to fight fire with FIRE!!!
This is bait. I never said I was voting for Biden in the first place and I‚Äôve said countless times I‚Äôm not voting for trump and they‚Äôre still here in my mentions saying I‚Äôm voting for Trump
Kamala the wrestler died a few days ago and that‚Äôs who Biden actually was going to pick, but everyone just assumed he meant Kamala Harris.
biden really saw the "vote blue no matter what" and said lol bet
Im not sure why #NeverTrumpers think this days is good.  It‚Äôs moderates that elect a president.  As a moderate Indpendent, that does not help me pull the Biden lever. It scares me.
Now just how the fuck do you know Biden's religious beliefs?
Trump and Biden are trying hard to lose this election.
Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Biden spent years accomplishing nothing; otherwise BLM wouldn't be a movement today.
every time i hear any angle of support for biden
Say what you will, but no vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Perhaps we halt progress a bit for 4 years - is that worse than allowing GOP to elect more conservative judges who will effect us for the rest of our lifetime? Than further degrading of our nat security? #VoteBlue2020
Don't oversell yourself on Biden just because Trump is awful. On foreign policy and criminal justice issues, Biden's record and positions are as bad or worse than Trump. And on many of the issues where he's nominally better it's an open question whether he'll follow through.
This is Biden‚Äôs weakness. He must overcome this. Watch.
She believed Biden committed sexual misconducts and assault; now she is his running mate...
We have a Strong, competent, and honest leader already. And that's President Trump. Takes responsibility, that's one big joke, after all, Obama/Biden did nothing but blame Bush for all 8 miserable years they were in office.
I got the text from the Biden campaign, and it came across at 4:14pm EDT.
never forget kamala harris is better than mike pence. never forget I have to tweet this because with Biden the bar has been lowered to the basement
Thank you Mr Biden! I'm so excited about this, let's get Joe into the White House and  in as VP!
There's no way I would vote for anyone other than the President. And with Sleazy Biden's VP choice, the odds of me voting Biden/Harris got worse.
Veterans for Biden and Harris !!  Let ‚ÄúMake America Great ‚Äú Forever !
*Worse on Iran.  Trump's intentions on Iran suck, but he's too mercurial to follow through. Biden is more consistently belligerent in foreign policy and he's openly embracing all the Bush neocons who want to crush the Iranians under their boots.
Well electing Biden is a whole other conversation. There were better choices but we all know Biden was the safest choice. I‚Äôve just seen this shit pop up on FB already and I don‚Äôt wanna see it gain any momentum.
If Biden wins the election he will be removed from office within a year and a half due to medical reasons and/or a democratic (setup) assassination. Then our first female president will step in.
Anything other than a vote for Biden is an action that supports Trump.
Sorry, that falls flat.   Biden had squeaky clean 8 years. That‚Äôs why Dems put him to this task. üòª  Meantime, djt goes elementary school at every turn.  Including rapist, racist, Russian asset, shall we continue?
It's cute how you seem to think Biden/Harris actually want to pass a public option, free college, or a minimum wage increase.  If they were willing to tax the rich and discipline the MIC like Ike did, though, we could afford all that, M4A, and the GND easily. But they aren't.
Two people on my Facebook timeline posted the exact same article about Biden‚Äôs VP choice, both with two totally different opinions about the pick. It was interesting.

Wow! Congrats to Senator Kamala Harris. Biden-Harris will energize and inspire our communities.
Go back and read. I said Bernie calls those in the Senate his "friends", just as he called Biden his friend. If you really want to not vote, vote for the progressives that will fight for you, not for Republicans that want to bend you over like tRump. Just Vote.
FINALLY , some good, hopeful, inspiring much needed news!!! Let‚Äôs go Biden/Harris!!!!!!!!
Never forget. Who stands for working people and who made a career out of crushing regular people.  Biden chose poorly. #Vote3rdParty
Four out of five dentists endorse Biden/Harris ticket. I‚Äôm mean, look at those teeth! Congrats  and women everywhereüòÅ
No offense to Kamala, but this about guarantees that Trump will win. There are so many people against a woman in office it isn't even funny, and with Biden age, you know they are going to assume she will end up president and that is not acceptable to some people
Best Biden commercial to run in the south!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden! #BidenHarris2020
oi. I‚Äôm at such odds with the developments in this campaign. A part of me is happy that a Black woman will be VP, but I also feel like Biden did it ‚Äújust to do it‚Äù you know? And then her history...
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Remember when those Biden and Obama photos came out and everybody was so obsessed with them how embarrassing
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
BIden guaranteed a win in November with his vp pick
Also  do you still believe Biden's accusers?
We'll most likely get 4 more years of Trump. Dems hate Harris &amp; Reps hate her. He went for the identity politics pick and it's going to bite him in the ass. I was hesitant to vote for Biden cause he's a creeper w/ dementia but now I really don't want to vote for either side.
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
I hear this argument. But the DNC is not on our side. They are an obstacle to actual progress, and do not deserve to get to   take our votes for granted. Make 'em sweat. And if Biden is planning on putting Bloomberg in charge of the World Bank, where's the difference?
Yes! Let's do this. President Joe Biden!
Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
Yes!  President Joe Biden!
Biden-Harris is the dream ticket America needs! Get ready to loose
I don‚Äôt-just making a joke. My worth is in my contribution to society,community, family, friends.  I always vote, not just pres elections-I volunteer in my community. My family serves in armed forces. I advocate as a nurse and provider-what do you do?  Try to hurt others? #Biden

And I reserve the right to vote for whoever I want, Biden or not.
IF Biden steps aside?  That has always been the plan.  No one watching this saga unfold, ever believed he'd go the distance.  Every day it becomes clearer.
You think the problem with be resolved under Biden/Kamala...üôÑü§£üòÇü§£
She's better than Biden though. No creep allegations or sniffing ppl for her.
Joe Biden was humping through which rice paddy? Guess you didn‚Äôt know Joe, the famous high school football star, was deferred 5 times for asthma.
I need whoever is libertarian running for presidents views and policies. I will not vote for Biden bro
I was never going to vote for Biden, just also never going to vote for Trump. I'm an Independent, not beholden to either party. As a socialist, I can't reconcile even how the Dems do business, they're crooks too.
Biden =  Decency. Vote for Joe.
That‚Äôs not the only reason, you obviously haven‚Äôt paid attention to my other tweets. I‚Äôm not voting for either of them. It also doesn‚Äôt matter because my state is heavily blue so it‚Äôs not like my vote will change it going to Biden or not
I'm so excited that   has chosen  as his Vice President! She's an AMAZING trailblazer who will help bring the soul of America back to life. ü•∞ #Biden2020
Biden and Harris ticket - This is the ticket that will make America Great Again.
When did you become Pope and take away Biden‚Äôs beliefs?  You should be more concerned about all those Trumpers that don‚Äôt think Catholics are real Christians!
Kamala Harris is now the de-facto presidential nominee for the Democrat Party and the radical Biden-Harris agenda is way out of touch with the mainstream of America.  #VoteTrump2020
Picking Harris reassures Wall Street, Pharma, the health insurance industry, and the military-industrial complex that his administration will be reliably neoliberal even if/when Biden is too incapacitated to be their puppet himself.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP
G-d  you are entitled to your opinion and you are voting #Biden - sorry you were attacked.  We all have to unite!  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison
I am so excited to hear that  has been chosen to be Biden's #VPPick It is going to be so exciting to watch, especially the VP debate in October. #BidenHarris
You heard trump men will be insulted by Joe Biden‚Äôs pick. Women should only be seen in plastic surgery offices as centerfolds and as Pence‚Äôs mother in church next to their stick up the ass husband
And just to be clear, I‚Äôm a fan of the Harris pick. I think her and Biden make a strong ticket, and I think we need that more than ever.
They are three years apart lol. If you are taking that stance then Trump could die just as soon as Biden.
Yea, Obama/Biden caused this unrest in America with their forever divisive actions. When was there "peace" in the World, Never. And you actually believe a Slime Bag/Knee Pads ticket is going to bring peace to the WORLD? That's some strong D'Rat Kool-aid you're drinking, Cupcake
One good moment in the debates, when she skewered Biden with 'That little black girl was me' over busing.  Other than that, entirely forgettable. Far from being scared, Pence is relieved he doesn't face Warren.
Trump is literally ineffectual as POTUS. Biden will actually be able to continue the wealth-gap, money-grubbing, wealth-concentration, robber-baron, croney-capitalist agenda. Which is worse? They both suck pretty bad IMO. I'd prefer to vote for REAL CHANGE, not more of the same.
Harris ‚Äòhonored‚Äô to join Biden on Dem ticket
President Joe Biden!
Childish. I'm not happy with Harris, either. But I'd still vote for Biden over Trump if he'd chosen La Llorona.
Biden/Harris- out with the orange in with the blue!
Biden and Kamala just released their slogan!  Kneepads and Peepads 2020!
Biden-HairSnifff Loll!!!!!
The DOW was up over 350 points this morning.   Kamala Harris was chosen to be VP Biden‚Äôs running mate-then the DOW went DOWN 104 points. Retweet please...
And only reason I bring it up is because I‚Äôve got a feeling that even Trump wins again, he will probably get ride of Wray and if he doesn‚Äôt Biden will probably bring his own guy in.
Biden is getting more Twitter love that you
Thank you, Sen. Warren! Can‚Äôt wait to see you become part of the Biden/Harris cabinet.

Interesting choice for VP for Biden. I suspect she will succeed him if he happens to get elected. She seems the type who would support a police state.
I don‚Äôt get the surprise, Biden isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt ever been listening to progressives. It seems like an attempt to please anyone on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù who want women of color in power while also trying to scoop up the centrist and cop voters who abandoned trump.
BIDEN VP üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The Harris pick notification sucked, but mostly because it just reminded me that Biden is the nominee
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California, as his running mate his campaign has announced. If elected, she would be the nation‚Äôs first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.

If people didn't wake up with Biden's choice for VP, then idk what will. And I am not a Trump supporter lol
Seeing a lot of 'Mike Pence so scared,' but I believe he's probably relieved he won't have to face Warren.  I remember Harris in the debates; nothing special.  Yes, I'll vote for Biden/Harris, but my checkbook is likely sitting this one out.
I never said I was voting for Biden in the first place
Maybe Biden told him before he died. I am going to think that.
Correct. Biden/Harris makes a badass one-two ticket. Biden scores a lot of points with me for having the confidence to make this choice.
Hello Amy Klobuchar, We have been push Bluewave as hard as we can,we do not see any way that Trump can win unless he cheats ,it would be nice to have Biden,Kamala and yourself running our country. What part are you gonna play in the White House ? Bluewave üí™
‚ÄòMost Pro-Abortion Presidential Ticket In American History‚Äô: Pro-Life Groups Condemn Biden VP Kamala Harris
If  and  bring Yang into the #DNC2020 I will vote for Biden. If not #VoteGreen will be my path. I‚Äôll let the DNC choose.
I mean, yeah, at the beginning of the year I was upset that it was gonna be Biden vs Trump.  I even thought Trump would be re-elected.  But there‚Äôs no way in hell things could have possibly gotten this bad if we had literally any President from the past 50 years.
Biden and Harris all the way for me!
Biden/Harris 2020!  Out with the orange in with the blue!
When my preferred candidate suspended her campaign the only scenario that made sense to me was that she was going to be Biden‚Äôs running mate. I am awash in joy this afternoon. Biden/Harris ftw! This choice reveals a lot about Biden‚Äôs confidence and leadership.
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- I AM SOLD JUST BECAUSE "HER PARENTS MET AS GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY, IN THE 1960s."  -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Biden/Harris 2020!! Out with the orange in with the blue!
Biden will simply mouth words to settle: the race riots, the trans community, the poor and destitute (or those who think they care about them), etc. while in the back-channel he secretly empowers the rich. All while nothing of relevance changes and the world burns.
Look up kamala Harris bussing Biden debate. Those should be all the keywords you need.
1) I oppose both parties.   2) Bid IS as bad as Trump, and I'll tell you why: Trump is so bad there's a strong counter-response to his presence. Biden will lead to more complacency as robber-barons continue to man the wealth-concentration machines with the DNC's support.
It's just plain common sense, right? That's the direction we, as a country, need to move in. Which is why I'm staging a protest vote to write-in Bernie Sanders. Trump or Biden doesn't matter, both will lead us down the same road of croney capitalism, wealth concentration machine.
you tryna get on your knees for Biden like kamala lol
Kamala Harris? Really?  Biden/Harris 2020? 2020 is a fever dream.
Biden and Harris are getting 10x more retweets an hour than you do in a week
Biden is Dumbledore
So glad Biden picked  but even if it wasn't her, I'd still vote for Joe. #BidenHarris2020 here we come! üá∫üá∏üåäüó£Ô∏è
"I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person." #BidenHarris2020 #VPPick #VPHarris
She'd be better than Biden to run the country. I don't agree with everything she wants, but it would be nice to have a president that doesn't have allegations.
Politics are so weird this woman really outed Biden‚Äôs racist past while they were competing against each other and now she‚Äôs happy to be his vp
Biden: I haven't picked a VP yet.  Boooo...  B: but it will be a woman!  Yea!!  B: The VP will be black!  Yea!!!  B: And also a cop.  BOOOOO!!!!
Don‚Äôt you just love it? Fuckface saying how horrible it was that Kamala was ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù to Biden during the primaries....! Hahahahaha haha
I grabbed a Biden/Harris yard sign!
Wow. Wow. I mean... [low whistle] that is some shot at Biden from the Providence bishop.
I think a protest vote in the national election is more meaningful, esp given my State never even had primaries due to Covid and that I absolutely do not no matter what support Joe Biden. Just as bad as Trump IMO and doesn't move the needle on... well ANYTHING.
Everyone will be watching Biden‚Äôs news conference instead   get used to being irrelevant
Top political voices react to Biden picking Kamala Harris as running mate
I don‚Äôt want to vote for either of them I can‚Äôt stand behind Biden policies
I really can‚Äôt vote for Biden
We don‚Äôt want to hear stock numbers, we want to hear you talk about Biden and Harris or are you scared? Bluewave üí™
I predicted Biden, not Harris. It's time to start betting money on these things.
Katie good afternoon, I am so glad and thankful to be here in this time of need, history has just been made ,and I love the words President Biden and vice president Harris oh gosh I‚Äôm so excited have a good evening,Bluewave üí™
First we must get Biden elected. Then replace Bill Barr and hire an aggressive AG.
Does that not feel good to get tingles up your spine, just hearing the words President Biden and vice President Harris ,Jose Cuevo, you are a friend of mine, I like to drink it with a little salt and lime Bam Bluewave üí™
Name recognition, progressive female person of color. Basically the Democratic Party pandering to its progressive wing since Biden is an old white dude that‚Äôs RELATIVELY moderate in comparison.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be hilarious, if we can get President Biden and VP Harris up there at the same time ,I got the feeling that I know which television station People would watch ,right or wrong ?Bluewave üí™
and  That's a winning ticket!!!  Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
NM governor responds to Biden's selection of Harris (Luj√°n Grisham was vetted, but had said that communication dropped off with the Biden campaign).
Joe Biden announces Harris as a running mate the same day I opt to move onto election work so I feel like this meme of ted Cruz
Biden could have picked a 2x4 with googly eyes taped to it for his VP and I‚Äôd still vote for him. We (America) cannot survive 4 more years of the orange one.
And before anyone accuses me of not voting for Harris because she's black or a woman - it's because she's shady as Hell, has had a dubious career as a prosecutor, doesn't make sound arguments, is a DNC shill, and yet another capitalist greedmonger. Same reasons against Biden.
Me too!  Biden-Harris 2020!
Hmmm, well, there goes any chance I'd even possibly vote for Biden in November. Guess I should practice my cursive to write-in Bernard Sanders. #nevertrumpneverbiden #NeverTrump #NeverBiden #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I am pushing hard, and especially now with VP Harris.  We will defeat Trump.  Biden-Harris 2020!
Priveleged?  What I'm saying is, they're is not a progressive running.  It's Biden or Trump.  If you don't vote for Biden, you are especially voting for Trump.  And, sorry my opinion doesn't matter to you, that is what is wrong with your millennial stance. All opinions matterüòÉ
On today's episode of 2016 election 2: Electric Boogaloo, Joe Biden picks a prosecutor who blocked evidence that would've freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so as his vice presidential candidate. God, fuck all this.

I‚Äôm excited about Kamala. Let‚Äôs get Biden/Harris in office, flip lots of seats in the House and the Senate, and push them all to be as progressive as possible. Local elections will be really important! Surround Harris with progressives so that 2024 looks very different.

News flash:  Biden picks human being for VP, with some actual flaws.  Would've been better if he had picked a robot, or perhaps some extraterrestrial being operating on a higher plane of existence.  Oh well, can't vote for him now.
Biden-Harris is not the "left" dude.
Kamala Harris is now the de-facto presidential nominee for the Democrat Party and the radical Biden-Harris agenda is way out of touch with the mainstream of America. #Truth
I am so happy and proud that in November I'll be casting my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket.  Great choice Joe!!!
Joe Biden ain't gonna be president if he wins its so blatantly obvious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol
Yeah, I get it. Biden's tough one. 77 years old, career politician, and highly inarticulate. Surprised the Dems choose him. Bernie and Warren had fresh new ideas but were rejected. Must be a tough election for you.
I'm with you but it goes more like this: 1) Joe Biden and Kamala Harris destroy Trump in a landslide. 2) After 18 months Joe makes history and steps aside (reasons don't matter). 3) America has its female president.
#NewMexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will not be Biden's VP.
OK ladies, now is your chance,now that Biden has picked a Women,Kamala ,to be his running mate ,All Women Will be part of History,Now you will be able to tell your grandchildren that you helped pick the  first woman and a woman of color,Bluewave üí™

Kamala will be a solid VP. Her reputation sounds worse than it is &amp; that's going to be the struggle for Biden campaign to overcome.  Picking the person who took him down such a peg at the debate shows a real willingness to work with &amp; understand different points of view. Kudos.
Im waiting for Biden V Trump

How much money did you lose/win betting in Biden vps?
Oh, you wanted a woman top of the ticket. Well, that didn't happen. And there were several qualified woman primary candidates. But the Dems choose Biden. How do you feel about that choice?
It‚Äôs already been said that Biden won‚Äôt run again even if he wins. So there‚Äôs that
Biden is somewhat less dangerous but I will physically assault every fuck face liberal who thinks that this country doesn‚Äôt have some massive issues to confront even if Biden wins.
HAPPENING NOW: Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, picks Sen. Kamala Harris of California as his running mate.
she has attacked Biden on several occasions lol
Biden, Harris... it will get even better, folks, this is just the first tremendous salvo in the battle to reclaim our democracy. You can begin to imagine the cabinet they will put together and the new department heads, to be named.
So you think the Biden team disregarded all that? Come on man.

Joe Biden would pick a cop to run with him.
Hi Rebekah. It's going to be fine. I liked Duckworth myself, but this is a safe pick. Safe works when the opposition is self immolating. My prediction: Biden makes history in 12-18 months by stepping aside for Madame Vice President to take over.
Biden/Harris.  YES!  I support this ticket! History is again being made! #BidenHarris2020
And just like that my hesitation is gone.  can at least help guide Biden into what the younger generations want to see changed.

Shockingly,,,, Biden didn't choose Grisham....so now what gov??
And what about the words and actions of joe Biden there‚Äôs no accountability their and the democrats whole bunch of shady stuff... shady stuff on both sides, however, democrats go to much further lengths
Apparently Biden is announcing his running mate here any min
The fun thing about whoever Biden chooses as his running mate is that it won't matter to any voters!
Because it certainly isn't how Biden was chosen....
I'm praying to all the gods, the old and the new, that the light of the seven should shine upon old Joe Biden Jr, and color his brain to pick Elizabeth Warren for Vice President and NOT Susan Rice
The Obama/Biden administration played a big part in criminalizing dissent from Occupy to Ferguson to Baltimore to Standing Rock. Saying they handled these things "with class" is telling. Their response to protests was always to protect the interests of the ruling class.
Biden encouraged people to go out and vote in April without masks.  COVID "relief" going mostly to the rich would absolutely have happened the same way.  Republican state officials would have rushed to re-open just as fast with a DNC POTUS saying no.  These problems are systemic.

Disagree. Author sets out the various fault lines among Dem powers-that-be, making the Biden coalition and support appear fragile. Obama and Clinton are portrayed as Vernunftsrepublikaner where Biden‚Äôs concerned. Fascinating insider baseball, but.

"Nothing of real consequence"?   You may see it as inconsequential, but it's still more than ANY other President has EVER done for us.   Certainly more than Biden would do considering he said he'd never allow same-sex marriage.
He's convinced Gilead to provide over 200k people PrEP to help stop the spread of HIV...   He was openly for gay marriage back when people like Biden were defending DOMA.   He's been an absolute champion of our rights compared to other Presidents, including Obama.
How exactly? Honestly I don‚Äôt know exactly what QAnon is.   I believe in God-so the earth is round.  Have fun voting for a man that should be in an assisted living center.  #ElderlyAbuse #YouAintBlack Biden‚Äôs not going to be the actual nominee anyway-  He‚Äôs been in gvmt how long?

If one party refuses to investigate the ACTUAL crimes of the other, I can't see what the difference is between the two.
Miss Harris calls Biden a racist, sexist rapist one week and then kneels to the man is this what she‚Äôs representing! Who is this woman?
Oddly Biden never filed for bankruptcy during those 48 years. Trump filed for bankruptcy 6 times between 1991 &amp; 2006. I think I'd rather trust the reins of the Presidency to someone other than the guy who couldn't profit from a owning multiple casinos.
Kamala, just curious if you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers?

Considering Biden's cognitive challenges alone, the record of Kamala Harris deserves absolute maximum scrutiny.

Not sure how to pronounce Kamala Harris, comma Harris, or like Joe Biden says K mala Harris
I see Biden's staff are back at work running his twitter account.  Otherwise it would be "Working families need.. you know.. the thing.. and we can only... reelect Donald Trump"
The past 5 mo when I read a Biden Tweet saying "I won't abandon you", I teared up &amp; was blubbering. It was ok to admit my fear &amp; reassuring to realize a person of strength/compassion wants to do all in his power to lead us back to whatever normal is going to be. I have hope again
If you‚Äôre only going to go back to 1980 then yeah Republicans &amp; White Liberal Moderates like Biden along w/ complicit Black politicians that stood by &amp; defended them. Looking at you Rep. Clyburn.
If you're a BLM or immigrant supporter and you vote for Biden or Trump this election because waahhh Trump, then don't say anything about these topics for the next 4 years. See how far generalizing will get us? Nowhere lol
What does voting for Biden do? Other than marginal improvements. Look dude, I hate Trump too, but Biden is a Republican who says he's a progressive lol the point is, voting for another racist/rapist does not help change the system.
You would have called it real if it was Biden +6
I wish people realized that Harris is as much of a fraud as Warren or Biden. She's always claiming to be "African American" and saying she wants to represent "her people", yet her parents are South Asian and Jamaican. Everything she says is a fraud, just like when she was in law.
I personally think that Harris was their choice all along. Biden was used so they had a declared candidate on the ballot and could bring Harris in late in the cycle as VP. I suspect he'll step down within 6mo if elected.
LOL, no one is voting for these clowns. The public can clearly see that Biden is senile and just being used. Within six months he'd step down and we would end up with something like Harris/Pelosi in the white house. Not gonna happen.
I think you have it backwards. Kamala is the candidate. Biden is just the senile puppet being used to get her into the White House. If elected I almost guarantee he'd step down within six months and we'd up with something like Harris/Pelosi.
A libertarian vote, just like any other third party vote, is a vote thrown away that risks ending up with Biden unfortunately. That is especially true for the states who have now bound their electoral votes to the popular vote.
Joe Biden will win Kansas by 10
There wasn't. This is true about Bernie compared to Clinton, but Biden fared better vs. Trump than any other candidate, consistently, for months. To claim otherwise is to be as much a liar as a Republican.

The 2020 election is Republicans calling Biden/Harris socialists while the actual left is upset they aren‚Äôt socialists.
Guys it sucks, it really does. But we have to get Captain Orange out of office please. I don‚Äôt think we can survive another 4 years of this. We have to vote Biden. We can deal with the ramifications of that later, but we have to get that asshole out of office first.

Insanity Wrap #26: Kamala Harris Got the Nod, Biden to Get the Knife?
Imo, progress is bigger than the two party system. Progress is the DNC not throwing an election for their establishment candidate. Progress is Healthcare for all and police reform, which we will not get with this ticket. I could go on. Biden is not progress, he's the status quo.
I'm riding with BIDEN and I will always cherish KAMALA HARRISüôè

You can't say black lives matter and also cheer Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP.
I really like  She was never my top choice for President, but I'm excited at her being the potential VP. Some people I know are less excited about it, her record as AG is not the best, but I believe she is what the Biden campaign needs to beat Trump. #BidenHarris
Me seeing friends posting about Harris' selection as Biden's running mate.
Conservatives dogging on Joe Biden for the 94 Crime Bill and for picking Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, while claiming to be the party of ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù is a very sad self own.
No doubt she will use the Race card like she did with   Biden

Biden campaign gives a racist gift basket to the Trump campaign.   Lol.
Not a bad thing considering Biden‚Äôs typical old white man comments
What a fool!  Biden/Harris 2020
Yeah, pretty sure Team Biden not that worried about the debates. #DementiaDon
You do realize that Joe Biden DID everything the Dems tried to pin on Trump....right? They have him "dead to rights". This will not end well for America if these criminals are elected!
Biden Harris ticket???  Wow.
Harris doesn't help Biden in TX GA or AZ but she does help him him in WI MI and PA.
Don't forget to review Biden's confrontation with KH in the Democratic Party debates, and, more importantly. Tulsi Gabbard's evisceration of KH in those same debates.

Yeah, I wish Biden was as "radically left" as GOP attempts to make him out to be
Progressives for Biden
Dude. Margins can move around. They dont matter. I can say candidate D is at 36% support and R is at 30%. Thats a +6 margin. But guess what, undecideds will decide that race! Biden getting to at least a 50% base is all that matters.
I think hes trying to say the news org polls are fake because they show biden leading?
Same way Texas is a for sure Biden win right?
Hey, with Biden being pawned off by everyone as apparently being ready to self-destruct, they‚Äôre just lowering the bar for him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Looks like Biden supporters are the silent majority here.
Yes.  Barr is going to indict Biden in October.  It is phony but it will happen.
Ur ostracizing a whole group of voter by ur words not ur thoughts. Of corse I question everyone‚Äôs motives including Biden‚Äôs but I also know that now is not the time to voice them and cause a fracture within our ranks. We need to be kind for the time being
I‚Äôll vote for Biden if he picks an armadillo.
I love when a Biden Bro gets snarky and asks what  has done for #LGBT people, but when you start listing accomplishments they block you before you can even finish listing them all!  #Hypocrisy #Gays4Trump #GaysForTrump #Trump2020 #Trump  #MAGA2020 #KAG #KAG2020
Pushed to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide. Appointed openly gay cabinet members and ambassadors. Supported same sex marriage from the beginning back when Biden was vehemently against it. Secured free PrEP for 200k+ recipients to help fight HIV...
MSNBC Virtually Silent Over Biden Gaffes
I had a dream.. Trump, Pelosi, Biden, AMLO, Boris, Maduro were not politicians. There wasn‚Äôt Republicans,  Democrats, capitalists or socialists, progressivists, ‚Äúantifa‚Äù or white supremacists, fighting for power.. there was no division! It was a peaceful dream, but just a dreamüò¢
TO: GOP Chairwoman, NO,NO&amp;NO! Just because Trump has all you Repub. lemmings sucking in his BS, last time I checked, the WH belongs to the American taxpayers &amp; from this TAXPAYER I find your ignorance in attempting to use this promote Trump as just one more reason to VOTE BIDEN!
Yeah, all twenty of Trump's top donors are richer than all the tens of thousands of Biden's supporters.  We know.
Right.. why support the guy that's fighting to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide. Or that's appointed openly gay cabinet members. Or that supported same sex marriage back when Biden was firmly against it.  You complain about trivialities and ignore huge advances...
Biden is qualified to be president primarily because he is not Donald Trump.  It's a pity you can't bring yourself to admit that Ben.
He CAN NOT do that, and it doesn't matter because as soon as Biden's in the white House he doesn't have a jobü§ó!

We need to win.  I am very concerned that Barr is going to do something in Oct to help trump win. Possibly charge Biden with a phony crime to destroy his campaign. I‚Äôm more worried about Barr than anyone else.
Nope its because now all those who left will be voting Biden in November through mail in ballots voter fraud is real
You're kidding right? That's like saying Biden supports blacks.. lol  There is a HUGE #lgbt4trump community that is VERY accepting!  We have his back!
Yes, thank you for putting into office a real President that is fixing all the horrible policies and programs Obama/Biden forced down on us.
You're already preparing to lose by blaming the imminent crash on Biden so your goons can have talking points and you can tweet about how "you were right" between spending time under Putin's desk to thank him and getting peed on by russian prostitutes.
Biden just needs to pick a decent human that is qualified regardless of gender or race or ethnicity. This is about qualifications.

Really pathetic to attack Biden when Trump &amp; the GOP's incompetence have literally trashed our economy and killed over 160,000 people in five months.  Conservatives are a crime syndicate.
He needs to start telling that to these so called ‚ÄúCatholics‚Äù like Pelosi. Biden and Pelosi need to be excommunicated. But they won‚Äôt. They give lots of money to the church. Such hypocrisy
Having the oppo out early gives Biden the advantage of knowing what attacks are coming from both the right and the left.
The Morning Briefing: Idiot MSM Hacks Confuse Joe Biden for a Practicing Catholic
I agree. I‚Äôm just conflicted. voting for Trump is a no, voting for Biden is a no, and voting third party is essentially throwing away your vote.
Biden won‚Äôt debate because everyone one will know he is messed up in the head and does not have a clue where he is or what year it is. Worthless oxygen thief.
My "thoughts"?  Probably is mixing paranoia up with depression.  OR  setting up a case for leniency, which I said a long time ago Biden may be too.

The not so pretty girl that kept telling all how gorgeous she was until all began to believe her and the really gorgeous girl followed her around wanting to a member of ‚Äúthe click‚Äù- Biden and Hoover Kamala both have flipped sides so much that just the really stupid idiots follow
A Biden-Trump debate would be so unfair to Trump who seems to just want to keep the camera on himself and keep his mouth moving regardless of the insanity coming out!  It would be very hard to watch.
Damn y‚Äôall, I don‚Äôt know whether to be happy that the army of social media armchair infectious disease specialists are now political analysts or not. The browbeating has begun, as if Joe fucking Biden is our lord and savior. F**k you, vote blue no matter who.
President Joe Biden!
Also with his father cheating contractors, telling prop mgers not to rent to black and cheatose who signed up for Trump U.  Find a new job ....  Biden and Harris will win!
Ummm...I think your cartoon is really missing the point. You just showed Biden as a man with strength and stamina.  So, yea, EPIC FAIL.
She will LBJ Biden before January
This kind of herd mentality is why political parties will never improve, they know that no matter what they do or who they select that their members will support them no matter what, even if they had said they hated them before. Dems went from hating Harris &amp; Biden to loving them
Don't get me wrong, Biden and Harris aren't an ideal choice either.   But the presidency (in its current state) is nothing more than a symbol and I would much rather NOT have 4 more years of symbolic fascism.  Instead we can spend the next 4 years doing two things:
Lol someone said they would rather not vote at all...because voting for Biden means "8 years of non-progress" (this person obviously forgot a term is only 4 years) and that they'd rather see the Green Party thrive.  Isn't that how we got stuck with Trump to begin with...?
Who‚Äôs Joe Biden...and what‚Äôs a Kamala?
Today's Word of the Day is rodomontade.
President Joe Biden!
guess what?? No one is listening to you anymore. Not even Fox News....we just want to hear from Harris and Biden. üòä
Biden has to get enough votes to offset all the cheating and voter suppression.

Congrats Senator Harris.  Together, Joe Biden and Kamala will bring our country back!   What a great team!
I knew Kamala  would be Biden's choice; I'm so happy!!!!!
No one DESERVES to be VP or POTUS. Everything should be earned. She didn‚Äôt earn this. Biden boxed himself in when he said he‚Äôd pick a woman of color to be VP. She was picked on a coin toss &amp; that‚Äôs all. Deserves?.You self entitled libs make me sick.#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Biden: "Hey Liz! Can we get your notes?"
So the #democrats now have - Biden, who sponsored racist criminal bills,  and Harris, who cared more about her record than true justice.  Congrats, Dems.. you basically have North Korean gulag runners for your Dem. Picks. Enjoy that forced slave labor while incarcerated.
why can't we have you and  on the ballots instead of Biden and Harris?  That's a MUCH better ticket.
Biden didn‚Äôt make the choice . The party did. Biden is the nominee but Harris will be President if he is elected.
I wonder if Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a racist?! The hypocrisy is unreal man... and Democrats are overjoyed at this news?? What a bunch of fucken idiots. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mark, when do we get back to a national conversation on Biden &amp; Ukraine? We need to fight fire with FIRE!!!
She believed Biden committed sexual misconducts and assault; now she is his running mate...
No offense to Kamala, but this about guarantees that Trump will win. There are so many people against a woman in office it isn't even funny, and with Biden age, you know they are going to assume she will end up president and that is not acceptable to some people

We'll most likely get 4 more years of Trump. Dems hate Harris &amp; Reps hate her. He went for the identity politics pick and it's going to bite him in the ass. I was hesitant to vote for Biden cause he's a creeper w/ dementia but now I really don't want to vote for either side.

One good moment in the debates, when she skewered Biden with 'That little black girl was me' over busing.  Other than that, entirely forgettable. Far from being scared, Pence is relieved he doesn't face Warren.
Childish. I'm not happy with Harris, either. But I'd still vote for Biden over Trump if he'd chosen La Llorona.
Seeing a lot of 'Mike Pence so scared,' but I believe he's probably relieved he won't have to face Warren.  I remember Harris in the debates; nothing special.  Yes, I'll vote for Biden/Harris, but my checkbook is likely sitting this one out.
Biden and Harris all the way for me!
Yeah, I get it. Biden's tough one. 77 years old, career politician, and highly inarticulate. Surprised the Dems choose him. Bernie and Warren had fresh new ideas but were rejected. Must be a tough election for you.
Oh, you wanted a woman top of the ticket. Well, that didn't happen. And there were several qualified woman primary candidates. But the Dems choose Biden. How do you feel about that choice?

Damn straight. I am a Republican and I will vote for Biden no matter who he selects to be his VP running mate.
Its 100% true. Why don't you watch it.  It wasn't the Mueller report, it was the Weismann report. Every one of the investigators was a Democrat, they were donors to clinton and Weisman is on the Biden campaign team. Youre a little out of touch on this apparently

We have given Biden plenty of ways out to earn our trust/vote but it falls on deaf ears. He can't even do a proper campaign from home. He admitted to possibly dieing in office. If he is elected and dies are his supporters murders. Why can't we challenge Biden
We need to get our America BACK, folks. Biden should be ‚Äúbiden‚Äù his time. He doesn‚Äôt have much more left.
How about Biden‚Äôs power hungry wife- letting him be made a laughing stock because she cares more for a Position and attention than helping a mentally handicapped human! Talk about zero care and unlikeable!
So fucking what   He's right as usual. Don't see you making as big a deal about Obama's hot mic with the Russians or Biden's blatant quid pro quo speech. Fuck all the way off you libtard mouthpiece.
If trump would‚Äôve said exactly what Joe Biden did about Latino &amp; black communities he‚Äôd be a racist. Look how the real racist is!
I'm assuming you're referring to Biden, and my conscience doesn't allow me to vote for him for many reasons, primarily his stance on abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism, police, self-defense, and like a thousand others. Not to mention he can't even form a coherent sentence.
He is all over TV this morning begging to confront Biden in the debates!!  And by the way, The OHio Gov. was retested and doesn't have Covid

It's not racist to say that regional differences are more significant than racial differences. I'm a white dude from New Mexico, I have way more in common with black and Latino New Mexicans than I do with white people from rural Alabama. Biden is still racist, just not for this.
Didn't Biden just say black people have no diversity?  Kinda sounds racist to me.
Low blow Biden thinks black crack head journalists are out to get him. 15year mandatory minimum sentences were his idea we all know that. Does everyone get thier own community can't we have more than one? And are All black journalists cocaine users. Juan Williams too? It is confu
Sleepy Joe insults African American community.
A few days ago, I heard you call this guy, "smart."  Come out of the closet, Darren.If Biden loses, do not blame oppressed people for speaking out about how he has contributed to their oppression.   Blame Trump, blame Republican voters, blame the people who elected an extremely flawed candidate in the primary, blame voter suppression, blame the pandemic.
I have no patience for people trying to silence legitimate criticisms of Kamala and Biden.   Think about what you‚Äôre doing, especially if the people you‚Äôre trying to silence are members of the communities that were directly affected by their past wrongdoings, and you are not.
Never.....never.....never! If Biden is elected America is done as a free and prosperous country!

All I get is Biden.....WTF??
Joe Biden is the Nazi
Automatically have a greater advantage, bc more people are collectively voting for one person. So hypothetically if 60% of the votes are democratic, if it's split 50/50 between Bernie and biden, the 40% republican vote for trump will win. At this point pick the lesser of 2 evils.
1. Implying Trump is unfit to be president because he‚Äôs disabled is ableist 2. He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwannabe fascist‚Äù, he is a facist 3. Holding Biden accountable *includes* criticizing his VP pick

I'm probably going to get my acct suspended...but damn it's hard not to call people out for the assine bull they are trying to smear Biden/Harris with. I can't handle the dumb, the stupid, the DELIBERATELY mentally unstable psychos who think they are helping "run" the USA. SMDH.
Kamala Harris, the descendant of a major slave-owner in the Caribbean, spent her career locking up people of color.  Democrats supporting #Blacklivesmatter rioting and then wanting Kamala Harris on the ticket with Biden would be hilarious if it wasn't so goddamn insane.

Just because your a woman or black does not qualify you to be Vice President. Biden has no mind left and will be an empty vessel for ever radical liberal idea that comes along. Thank God the American people know this and will vote by the millions to re-elect President Trump!!
Joe Biden is a joke.
President Trump will only need one debate to expose Joe Biden‚Äôs complete and total dementia. Even now Biden can‚Äôt speak for more then 10 minutes sitting, much less standing for 2 hours. President Trump was right to call you bias! It‚Äôs so obvious!
