President Trump is 100% correct Again. Finally Jim Acosta reports some truth. LMAO
You’d better or you’re all but handing trump 4 more years.
As everyone on my timeline knows anyone with half a brain knew exactly how this was going to play out. I mean that should be enough. But crazy as it seems it really isn’t. A person can’t stand up to trump alone. Democrats seem willing to let this play out.
You are no fucking doctor. Holy shit you are a bigger fraud then trump. Why am i not suprised. You are no doctor.
And, Trump must surely get sooo tired of all the crap.   He can easily handle the real problems but has had to even fight his own party along with  DOJ trying to railroad him !
😂 no shit. He is trumps buddy. This is all to help trump. You just now figured this out.
I had the same filling for eight years when you were in the Obama White House. You have 4 more years to go. When trump won the depression went away.
We’re worse but because it’s trump we are doing great? Even though it is twice as bad what the fuck?
Well, Trump told us late in 2019 that he left troops in Syria "only for the oil".
Every tiktoker should do fuck trump vids for forty five days.

So Trump's Twitter timeline is an accurate reflection of his mental status.
Trump: Joe Biden is against religion, against God. He hurts the bible, he kicked my dog -- I had a dog, he kicked the dog -- Joe is against grandma. He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste. Joe is terrible, Joe is anti-Earth, can you believe it? Terrible. Hates Earth
While  is a Trump sycophant and terrible for TN, at least  can crawl back in his hole and stop insulting good Tennessee voters who he deems "hate America".
The trump
Biden is none of what trump claims.
Trump’s mentally breaking. I bet he breaks before 11/3. Today was close. Real close. I am guessing debate night.
I'm not getting that from Trump, I've seen plenty of doctors who says it works and have given it to patients and it helped them get better. That one post was from a neurosurgeon about the countries that use it vs countries that don't, the death rates.
The Republican party embraced and enabled all that Trump represents. So yes, Never Tump is Never Republican, but not Never Conservative. Your party is broken and needs to be rebuilt before it is viable again.
Hell fire, the entire Trump family (especially Jr.) have made HUGE amounts of money on PAY FOR PLAY.
But Trump stated he took care of this at least 1-1/2 years ago.  Majority know this.  His base can keep believing his lies, but majority does NOT.
Good grief. Expand the photo &amp; look at how Trump is standing.

Did your father State yesterday (live TV) that he had nothing to do with the GOP getting Kayne to be on ballot in several states that Trump was way behind?  YES HE DID.  One of #45 lawyers are taking app. To state election offices.
Leadership tip: Especially in the middle of a pandemic, get your facts straight. People need to hear truthful information. DJT video of interview with false claims about children and Covid removed but only after it was released and the wrong info spread
Yep, he went around saying people who disagreed were just disgusting democrats who wanted Covid deaths to spike so Trump would look bad/worse
On the flip side, if Trump missed one he would say, “Wrong, the test is flawed. That is the most perfect fox sound I have ever heard. It was beautiful. Ask around, ask anyone they will tell you, that is the sound a fox makes”. “Fox isn’t on the test sir”. “it should be”.
Who didn’t have trump ramming a vaccine narrative going into the election cause he thinks it will be all he needs to get re elected on their bingo card. This was so forseeable by anyone with a brain.

Trump Train 🇺🇸🚂💨💨💨🇺🇸 Tennessee
Yea the game is in a beautiful place with ratings at about 25% of what it was in Jordan’s day. It’s impossible to just enjoy a game anymore without politics coming into it. Who cares if Trump doesn’t watch and is that all you have to ask him about after a game ffs?
So you want to shut down the economy even further as a response to COVID and then you blame Trump for the economic downturn?
Just as long as Tom Bodett doesn't leave the light on for Trump. ;-)
I saw a report that it's the Trump campaign acct rather than Trump's personal acct. But only 1 report so....
you should mention that the trump administration shut down Kushner’s plan for a response because at the time it was democrat cities and states hurting so it was politically advantageous for them to let it spread then blame it on democrat leaders. see what they say then.
Trump is doing his acceptance speech from the WH.
This is so very disturbing. Especially the part where DJT does not know how to interpret basic key charts and data. And saying to Swan "You can't do that" in terms of deaths per population. Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump-Axios
That was possibly best night ever that is until this November when Trump gets re-elected.
hey  you don’t really need debates but trump does so you should refuse to debate him unless he releases his tax returns

Trump says he may suspend payroll tax himself: Fox News interview
This is too funny. Biden can’t have a convo without reading off a prompter and it’s just pathetic that somehow he won the nomination at this point given his state of mind. It’s sad that he’s lost it, but if they actually have to stand toe to toe Trump will demoralize him
Bill Lee is trash. Just like his buddy Trump. They are clueless. They are willing to put our children’s and our teacher’s lives on the line. I hope Tennessee has enough smarts to vote this guy out when the time comes. He has given no leadership or direction.
Liberals don't hate America, we hate what Trump has done TO America.   But, keep pandering to the rubes.......

I'm voting TRUMP in person!
And their mission is accomplished. Trump and unbelievably earnest interviewer joisting focusses our attention on nonsense. Meanwhile.....
Trump &amp; Administration leaves out 💩 all the time to twist Dems words.
When things got really rough, Trump stated of the elderly.....they’re going to die soon anyway &amp; Also stated, Grandparents would be willing to give up their lives for their grandchildren.
I cannot wait for Trump to devour Biden in the debates. It's going to be so bad it will probably drive you off Twitter for a few months.

typical right wing deflection. but since you asked, the mueller report concluded that there was probably russian collusion but couldn’t definitively prove that because there was obstruction from the Trump administration. collusion, likely. criminal obstruction, most definitely.
now would be a great time to release the evidence on Trump colluding with the Russians.  By the way, why did you throw Vindman under the bus?  You ruined his career by haven him testify with only his opinion and no hard evidence.
Why the FUCK am I getting ads on YouTube for the United States Space Force? I mean, that's real? Trump was being serious? I mean, it must be real if there are ads about it.

All you guys on here saying Trump is a dictator for banning TikTok, please do a quick google search and understand it’s been a bipartisan issue all along.  Ask your beloved AOC and Schumer what they think about the app.
The $600 a week is causing people to NOT WANT to go back to work. We've had a few people say, "No, I'm not coming back yet." They expect us to let it go, but of course we have to report it. Then they get mad when they lose the $600 and their job. People are idiots just like trump

I don't like this question, but that we are asking it and were asking it in 2016 is why I voted libertarian then. Please note, Hilary asked it in 2016 and her supporters haven't accepted Trump as president now. This is a question both parties have failed to answer correctly.
No you never know, but I sincerely believe if Trump was involved he would never have run for President. He kicked him out of Mar Lago and banned him after an employees daughter said Epstein hit on her.
Have you not seen where the FBI agent involved in the Epstein case the first time said President Trump willingly came and talked to them and gave them all the time and information they asked for
I don’t think many people care what Trump says. Also Trump probably can’t name 10 NBA players anyways. I don’t blame any athlete for not accepting the White House invention Trump is a moron.

Trump set us on this path with his tariffs &amp; other stupid trade policies such as pulling out of the TPP, etc. But the addition of the COVID pandemic during an election year will be, I hope, only semi-disastrous. An excess of uncertainty &amp; sick workers is terrible for business.
Fuckin trump. Herman died a poisoned sycophant. He died showing us a great example of the sacrifice trumpism is. Kills the foolish. The myopic. The blind. The dead. The tragedy of denial. Let him serve as a glaring  example of the pitfalls that are inherent to trump and his ilk.

Trump wants his followers to riot. He wants to use them as a political weapon for his agenda. If he loses in November and the margin is not wide enough, he will refuse to leave and say that the results were tampered with or hacked. This is terrifying people.
The dates of presidential elections — the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in every fourth year — are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

Mr. Trump do you lie because you think people believe you or are you just the bully that people say you are.  Nothing in your post is true and you know it.
I have to imagine, and this is purely conjecture...the states that are reluctant and/or slow to move are those governed by a GOP majority that worship the ground that Trump walks on, or at minimum absolutely ‘fear’ (God forbid, right) the Democrats winning.

Who is making money off of this in trump admin
Biden's answer to pretty much everything has been giving the police more power &amp; less accountability. In terms of actual results, he's well to the right of Trump on LE. It's funny watching Trump try to paint the guy who thought Reagan was soft on drug users as a leftist.

The Trumps are just as dirty too. I think that’s what was shocking. The truth is that too many GOP candidates stayed in too long. Trump probably doesn’t get the nom if it’s him and Cruz head to head earlier.
Trump, in his first term:
He never gave the voters a reason to vote for him. Just "endorsed by Trump. "
All these  politicians testing positive before Trump visits. If Trump would just stay home, then they'd never have the virus? #TrumpThinking
We live in a red county in a red state. 90% of the white people we know excuse everything he does and intend to vote for him. There is literally nothing that could change their mind. If Jesus returned and told them they should vote against Trump, they’d just call him Fake News.
UR so full of shit   Trump doesn’t give rats ass whether kids Or teachers live or die,just wants to open school for his re-election!  Testing in MOST parts is still-10-14 day waiting period! Nothing’s changed since MAY just more Bloviating from U🤬 Trump is incompetent!

Thanks, awesome to know they are making good progress.  I think the point about my retweet is that trump is bow saying that a vaccine is going to be ready by late October,  which even from that article mrna is going to be enrolling people up until September.
I worry more about the American oligarchs that both Trump and Biden are beholden to than the scary Russians.
I lost my husband to #ALS in February, 2016 and November came Trump.  These 1293 days have been layers upon layers of grief.  So I too wish Trump a very crappy day.
And we fucking need Trump
chuckles but trump has already asked China for help him-we have the video and we know he asked russia for the second time! Question is how much dark money from Putin have you both taken  now let’s talk about dumb as rocks Johnny &amp; linney!
It was a wretched hoax by you-an embarrassment! You’re just like trump trying to protect  traitor Flynn
So please grow some nads and so something! Trump is a corrupt criminal 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
What a joke...it was TeamTrump not Donald Trump’s. You are a joke🤡
Allegiance to Trump is synonymous w/allegiance to the American ppl? I hardly think so. Keep drinking the kool-aid.   I’ve been a conservative my entire life...I can be a conservative &amp; not supportive of Trump. Being in opposition of Trump does not make me anti-American you bigot.
Government made this monopoly... and not just talking Trump!
He also said today that he won’t attend the DNC (where he’s going to be formally *nominated*) and his campaign isn’t knocking on any doors while Trump’s is knocking on a million per week. It really does seem like he’s trying to lose.
She’ll indict trump on State charges.
He should just take the test. And Trump passed it already. Come on man.... Biden should take the test.
you’re a full blown liar and sychophant! When did you get your MD cuz you don’t even have a college degree! A 6 year old just died in TN after being diagnosed with trump virus! You will be worthless when trump is gone! Putin paying you?
Idiots!!!! Trump will be deceased in 6-10 years. Someone else will be President. Could be a #Democrat, could be a #Republican. You people really aren't this stupid, I hope??!!
This is VERY concerning. I’m not convinced that Democrats can be as effective with virtual efforts. I don’t think this is the time to experiment.
So what was “the attack, the bomb of some kind” in Beirut, your great generals told you yesterday or Fox guys perhaps🤔    Trump’s absofrigginlutely dangerous
No way. Debates are ALWAYS coordinated by League of Women Voters and those debates are the only ones Biden should participate in and as previously scheduled. It’s not Biden’s fault Trump bungled the coronavirus.
So where was your affair with trump, Oval, AF1, West Wing, Residence🤔 BTW NO ONE spied on Trump campaign except Putin himself!
NO ONE SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN  but you had a fling with him!
Trump campaign requests fourth presidential debate with Biden in early September
It’s because of these type of clown shows that I am no longer a Republican (prior to Trump, I had NEVER voted for a Democrat, but I will pr do so this year - I was a Rubio donor).  /2
Your conduct at the Sally Yates hearing this morning was despicable. This is not an investigation, this is a witch hunt (to use a term you are very familiar with), a farce, a desperate attempt to help Trump hang on to power.   /1
6 year old girl dies in TN after being diagnosed w Trump virus!  BUT  said kids are immune🤔 He wants to pretend “trump virus” is going away! It’s all abt him&amp; re-election!       157,416 dead 4.8Million cass
Gonna be so pissed if Joe Biden opts out of the debates against Trump this fall. Been waiting forever to watch these two morons go at it 😐 it would make for comedy gold
Fair. And I appreciate the comment.  For me (like many others) it’s simple...  1. Trump &amp; ‘Trumpism’ must be defeated. He is void of any moral compass. 2. 3rd party is not an option this election. (I voted 3rdP in ‘16) 3. Biden is a decent man who has a history of bipartisanship.
Just a matter of time before  &amp; his #MAGA #QAnon idiot echo chamber start blaming  #Antifa or #BLM for the #BeruitBlast. But remember with #Trump, all roads lead to #Putin, the 2750 Metric Tons of Ammonium Nitrate that exploded came from #Russia!
I agree. Mr. Trump took it and did very well with it.
No, of course not.   She’s a limelight legislator.  I don’t believe that what she is doing is for the benefit of the American ppl...it is to get that pat on the head by Trump and the GOP and her own political advancement.

This trump government yes!
you’re NOT smart enough to understand any of this! They weren’t into gossip like a pathetic person like you! NO One in TN talks about the scuttlebutt in the FBI BUT EVERYONE IN TENNESSEE want to know about YOUR affair with trump😱

Opression is Oppression. Rape is Rape. Murder is Murder. Theft is Theft.✌🏻
Never said the were treated "the same", Idiot. I said they were both "oppressed". Libs love to put words in your mouth. You can write, obviously, but seem to have a problem reading and comprehending.
We need to enact voter ID to keep Trump from cheating
Not questioning that. Questioning the oppression once they were here. Many Blacks in the North were successful and not enslaved. Equal Rights was another story. ✌🏻
Trump Ad: Joe Biden 'Hiding in His Basement' from 'Decades of Failure'
Donald Trump thinks too fast. Now I’ve heard everything.   This is not a neutral analysis. People who like Trump think Trump is more mentally capable, and Biden people think Biden is. I don’t like either, and from my view they both appear to struggling big time.
did y’all y’all see this?
Just imagine what it will be like when we’re making the same sort of comparison between a future president’s capabilities and Trump’s relative competence and insight.
Half? Nah, not that many. Hell ive seen a lot of Dems declare that they’re voting for Trump this time.

How wreckless and ignorant of  to come out and say it was an attack without knowing what the explosion was caused by! Doubtful “the generals” told trump  that!
It’s conveniently a good thing where he thinks he may have a chance. I think we have work to do in many states to help build the infrastructure needed to handle mail in voting. But the overall arguments of fraud are smoke &amp; mirrors for fear of an unfavorable for Trump &amp; GOP
Trump pronounced Yosemite...as Yo-Semite...🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻
Amen. Donald Trump has no comprehension of this kind of courage.  He is empty inside.
Of course that’s first thing our soulless heartless dictator mentions. He didn’t come to my inauguration. Trump measures every person’s worth on how loyal that person is to him. That’s it. He has no moral core. John Lewis’ compassion &amp;  bravery are incomprehensible to Trump
All he cares about is that John Lewis didn’t attend his inauguration. Trump has no soul or moral core. He measures every person’s worth on how much loyalty they show to him. This is the soul of a dictator.

i don't know. You would think that at least Obama would've done something about this. why isn't anyone bringing this up to Trump (or is this why the Deep State is going after him so hard?)  thanks for this...i'm going to do some research on it
Crazy...the right can't wait to see Trump debate Biden🥴

didn’t think dumb could get dumber-beyond stupid in a state where the trump virus is running rapid because of your ineptitude
It’s real. Just like our 1,000 plus death toll daily here in the formerly great United States.  When historians look back at his tweets and interviews like this they will call this the Age of Glorified Stupidity in US. Under Trump The US is pretty much at rock bottom

President Trump doesn’t care thousands of people are dying from this pandemic #ItIsWhatItIs and this moron says he is pro life. Lol. Hear that    #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
Over 150,000 deaths and counting. Over 1,000 deaths in a day this week from a raging pandemic and people losing $600 a week in unemployment assistance and losing their jobs and all Trump can obsess about are cable news ratings. No other president of the US worried abt tv ratings
1,244 Americans died in a single day this week in the US from a pandemic that Trump says was going to go away since Jan. We’ve had 2 1/2 Vietnams,  40 9/11s and Trump says well “things happen it is what it is”. In a single day 0 deaths in Spain, 0 in Germany
Wow...I have yet to listen to this interview in it’s entirety...but this clip still sums up to me Donald J Trump...  He doesn’t give a damn about anyone but himself.   He couldn’t muster any sense of caring for a man who devoted his life to the advancement of Black Americans.
President Trump has been the greatest President on conservation since Teddy Roosevelt.
He hypnotized Trump with his Aussie accent.
“It might be time to do away with the idea that President Trump is a master media tactician and fully embrace that he is idea that he is an abject moron who stumbled ass-backwards into the White House.” -Rolling Stone. I would add it’s high time to get him the hell outta there.

Key Words: A record high for the Nasdaq ‘would all come crashing down,’ says Trump in a tweet, ‘including your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,’ if Biden wins presidency

You’ve got to be absolutely kidding me...   Trump represents today’s Conservative Republican?   This is the dumbest thing I’ve heard in awhile. Well done.
I have mad love for the 2nd camera - the one to Trump's right.
If Biden can't debate Trump, How could he possibly be expected to delegate with China and Russia, or even be a Walmart Greeter?  #Trump2020Landslide
It’s as real as blaming Biden’s unwillingness to debate on Trump’s “lies” instead of Biden’s dementia.
Trump all the way
#greatamericanoutdoorsact Trump set to sign landmark Great American Outdoors Act.
This problem has nothing to do with Trump.
This is more like pointing out the German guy wearing a brown shirt who slapped a kielbasa street vendor in 1933 was a member of the Nazi Party. Some people are still unaware of the path Trump is taking, so these details help for those not paying attention.
How the election will go down. Trump will lose the popular vote &amp; win the electoral. Again. Due to the “Trump is trailing” news that will feed the news cycle for the next 100-ish days, many people will think “Trump can’t win” and vote for this year’s Jill Stein. Again.
‘Calling out Rino Republicans and dispensing truth’....hahaha. Ok, buddy.   Yes, I am a NeverTrumper...Trump doesn’t represent the Republican Party I grew up with, and he is void of any moral compass. And those who pander to him are just as bad.
It’s all one big lie  you don’t get to lie the trump virus away-doesn’t work that way!        With each interview you cement in your ignorance, pathological lying and buffoonery! Good job🤣🤣
Trump has golfed 1 year-365 days of his presidency and  pocketed over $150 MILLION of taxpayers money!😳 when did watching TV become work🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣 Biden is whooping  ass without even trying -He’s not hiding, he’s smart opposed to trump never wearing a mask and every time he opens his mouth HE LIES!  Good luck with L’orange &amp; his deadly buffoonery!

That's a no win situation. Like you said, if Joe does debate him, it's another platform for Trump to lie. If he doesn't, then Trump gets to take free shots at for not debating (more than what he does now.)
Trump.
And then there's this - focusing on John Lewis's treatment of Trump rather than on Lewis's immense contribution towards making America a better and more just nation. Lewis boycotted George Bush's inauguration also, but Bush had the integrity to rightly and powerfully honor Lewis.

Agreed, but I can't decide if this deal subjugates social media to increased Trump Punishment(TM) or if it insulates them from such. Toss up.  Notably, it's also MS selling out big tech. Right or wrong, the other behemoths will be expected to pay a Trump Tax from here on out.
Country is moving in  WRONG direction cuz of    Ask corrupt Donnie about his over $150million golf trips where HE pockets the money and the rest of his fleecing of America along w his corrupt children! Get back to us! AND his failure dealing with trump virus!
Biden needs to debate Trump then. Let's go get him on stage tonight.
Because he said he isn't and Trump doesn't lie he is not a democrat

President Trump you might as well make a national address on all networks outlining your new Executive Orders and also explain how cruel and uncaring the Dems have been.
Dems, you should have made a deal with trump while you could. Now he is going to do it himself by Executive Orders, just like the Wall funding. Trump will look great while you will all look  like cruel schmucks again.
Trump is going to act on his own to help desperate Americans because of the cruel and heartless Dems. Nancy is happy at home eating ice cream. When Trump acts the Dems will act like a stuck pig. Make em squeal! Trump 2020!
Turns out Trump is a leg man. Who knew? 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Since Dems don’t give a damn about the American public. Trump is going to use Executive orders to provide relief to Americans. He is going to let the mismanaged Dem state and local governments choke on their nazi destructive lockdown. This is going to be good.
Get ready, President Trump is about to use executive orders to provide unemployment, prevent evictions, and provide a payroll tax holiday. That is going to cut Pelosi and Schumer to the bone.
Yesterday Trump teed it up for Joe Biden to talk about his personal faith and what it means to him to be a Christ-follower. He’s a church-goer and a decent man. Christians devoted to Trump will have to reconcile their support for the most vile, selfish man in US political history
If you vote for Kanye instead of Biden, you are really voting for Trump. Stop playing yourself.
Have been waiting on a package to arrive since July 24th, it's now Aug 7th. Post Office says they are looking for it. I may never see it. The tracking says it's in Arlington, Tennessee which is about 10 miles from my home. Every thing Trump touches turns to  💩
Donald Trump, you are a good man with a wonderful wife &amp; children. You don’t deserve this, the way the hateful people have treated you.They do not appreciate what you have done for so people in this country. I would not blame you Mr President if you walked away.
haggerty won 😔 poophead 😔 literally your only personality trait is being endorsed by trump 😔
I can not stand kanye west he is as crazy as Trump
Think what a disaster it would be if Biden picked Ginsburg replacement for the Supreme Court.  Trump has shown he will elect Constitutional respecting justices.
Does Trump mean the was chosen by the devil, because he sure is evil
Sad some are as stupid as Trump, but we have larger numbers
Tell us how Trump is a racist and how Biden is not!!
President Trump use your executive order. Payroll tax holiday, delay evictions, reasonable unemployment. The Dems will look rediculous if they try to stop you.

Trump as a president alone probably wouldn’t have been that bad, it’s the niggas he took up with him that made shit exponentially worse
People see it as simply Biden vs trump and simply look it as those choices, but I look at it as Biden vs trump, pence, DeVos, his sons and other randos who he gave important political positions to
But I’m not voting for Biden exactly , I’m voting for the opportunities that will arise because we won’t have trump in office and his whole clique that he has given prominent positions to over the years
I believe the GOP has a plan concocted with Trump to not pass this bill..they want Trump to sign executive order so he can score political points... just watch and see.. holding Americans hostage for politics!!! It’s all abt the election!
It's always been around and Trump came along and opened the can. I never noticed how Racist people really are.

Wow Trump stomped Biden in fundraising. Biden freaked out in an interview. This does not bode well for Basement Biden.
Pound the Dems President Trump. Use the Executive Order. Payroll tax Holliday. Stop evictions and limited unemployment. The disgusting Dems will look terrible if they try to stop you.
And Trump controls the news cycle another 2 days. Dude is genius.
They are representative of the voters...you asked me about “will of the city”, which to me is not clearly indicated just by an election based on the other factors laid out. Trump really represents the “will of the USA”??
And I’m aware TN is a Red State and Trump won the rural counties across the state.  Thanks for the history lesson, though.
You missed the part where I said they voted for Trump.
I’m a lifelong Tennessean. I interact with Tennesseans everyday. Many are my friends.  I assure you most don’t know what a FISA warrant is nor did they vote for Trump because of his morals &amp; ethics.

155,000 deaths, 4.5 million cases and we are the best ? We have the lowest numbers ? Trump is delusional and his minions are going along with his lies. How about they begin to think about American lives and do the right thing ! #StandUpToTrump

Great action TRUMP.
Mr. Trump everybody sees and knows your game you played with weak people man
You go Trump, we got your back. We are going to show up on Election Day like no one has ever seen. Thank you for a great job!
Trump is surging in the polls. Biden is hiding in his basement.
Trump has been reckkess 3 years !  Grfoh
Well, we certainly know that Trump knows next to nothing so there I will agree with you.
Interesting that that what you are really saying is that Joe Biden can kick Trump's butt just hanging out in his basement.
Record low virus death and cases today. Trump has saved millions! He is a national hero.
Not when Trump wins. This insanity will only get worse.
Trump 2020
Need Trump to get noticed !!!! 😂
If Trump is re-elected I’m literally going to cry. Y’all can’t be this stupid.
Donald Trump promoted Telehealth instead of addressing the expensive health insurance or the medical costs. Got it.
In the Bible 2Chronicles 32 ;20-32 . Hezekiah prayed out to God and he was answered by giving his land and country and people a prosperous and protected land for his life and reign as king .  No President Trump is not a king but he President. God is going to bless us with him
Republican governors are bowing to Trump! Disabling local control!
Another Trump grifter I'll be glad to see go when Trump loses on November.
I honestly don’t care who I offend by saying this. But FUCK DONALD TRUMP. Yeah I said it fuck off.
Donald Trump's grandfather was born in 1869. That's a long time ago.  #RandomThoughts
Keep it up Trump. Waiting for Biden blunders without promps during interviews and Upcoming debates. Vote Trump.
President Donald Trump
This is Donald. J Trump's base group when the KKK. supports his administration he won't denounce or condemn their actions. DJT will take their money and express their views as long as he can get their vote.
Obama plan: kiss their ass Trump plan: kick their ass Biden plan: what's an ass?
United against trump nothing. Negative in the democratic party and Republicans against trump together we defeat trump
My 86 year old democrat widow neighbor stopped me last night to tell me that she hasn’t received mail 6 out of 8 days.  She asked me if I thought she was going crazy thinking that Trump was trying to rig the election this way.  It’s terrible that she has to worry about this.
Trump will never say anything to his boss Putin

Trump gave the demoncrat leaders the authority to fix the problem before he steps in. He is also giving the demoncrats enough rope to hang themselves with when it comes to election time. Trump is letting folks see the demoncrats for what they really are, evil and incompetent.
I wonder if i threw a rotten egg at trump would I go to jail🤨
Never Biden.  Trump 2020 🇺🇸
It seems to me trump and his enablers are owned by Putin
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
The virus is falling like a rock. Record low deaths today. Economy is roaring back. Stock market is going through the roof. Trump has saved millions. He is a true hero.
It’s truly sad The Dems want to keep the country as sick, poor and unhappy as possible so they can somehow blame Trump. It should be a warning to us all.  they don’t give a damn about your well being.
they will definitely do this if trump accidentally invents single-payer trumpcare-for-all during some press conference
Nope he is not telling the complete truth he is letting trump control him, sad
I'm trying to live to vote trump out
The Trump's own three Stooges!!
Wait what would you know ! It’s not like you are a law....yer. Oh wait never mind carry on. I bet Trump thinks he knows more about the law than you though.

Wow! You are amazingly gullible if you think Trump is losing. Make sure you take Nov 4th and 5th off for recovery.
That makes no sense. Those that vote for Trump are the ones that allowed him to— You know what, no. You’re not going to be derailing it to something unrelated here.
So sorry we must get trump out of office or we all will die so sorry for your loss trump does not care

I do not like trump. Having said this, I pray he’s not having strokes and walking around with access to launch codes.
This is sad. Whomever she supports, I doubt she’d like her picture posted everywhere. I do think she needs to be better educated about who trump truly is though.

In my eyes, JFK was a patriot and a hero. Trump is neither ! Besides his followers would be convinced he was a martyr !
It can not be Karen bass she is into scientology, she would help get trump reelected
Trump has made the USA the pariah of the world.
I'd vote for a rotten potato over Trump.
Thank you Germany we need rid of trump
Trump your fired all you do is lie
I do agree with you. But, there's not much the Dems can do when Trump has the Senate Majority Leader and the Attorney General in his back pocket.
"Nice guy, got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein," Mr Trump said....  2015.
So if Fauci has been setting all this supposedly bad policy for months, wouldn't that be a huge failure in Trump's part?
A true patriot. Thank you !!
I’d vote for  regardless. I’m more apt to believe it would be trump who would back out of a debate.
BTW, I recommend reading Paul Krugman’s new book, Arguing with Zombies. Page 353, “Trump is a pathological liar, the most dishonest man ever to hold high office in America.” #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
It also says “Trump supporters have a visible presence on TikTok, so banning the app could also work against the president during an election year.”
Anyone out there really believe Trump is banning Tik-Tok because he is concerned about national security?
Crazy how TikTok is getting ban . Trump be trippin smh

Dogs are smart think they smell evil and trump is pure evil
Trump and the Republicans just made 4 offers to immediately send stimulus payments to every American. But the Dems are stopping the payments because they want money for their own pork projects. How utterly disgusting.
Trump can’t lead the country into chaos then say we have to delay elections due to chaos.
You mean Dick-Tator Trump!!There are more than 80 nights until Election Day, Nov. 3. That’s enough time for President Trump, a menace to public health and economic revival, to go all out to destroy a Biden candidacy.
I can certainly put up with Biden's occasional gaffs. Trump opens his mouth and hate falls out. He also proves his ignorance every time he talks. He is highly unqualified to be president. Biden has good relationships with the rest of the leaders around the world, they know him.
Wonder how  and other MSM media will treat  (if hell froze over) if he becomes Pres.?   Can u imagine the softball questions?  couldn’t even say the word “fitness” yesterday.  When Trump wins I can’t wait to see the meltdowns AGAIN #MAGA
Taking credit for something they didn’t do, runs in the trump family, especially his plagiarizing wife!
Trump has still not addressed the situation of putting a price on the heads of American soldiers. Trump is so afraid of offending Putin and so afraid Putin won't like him he's willing to sell America out.
TOGETHER, we will destroy big-tech and re-elect Donald Trump!
Maybe certain unions. Teacher's union should DEFINITELY be on the chopping block. The Republican Party wants rid of the unions. Trump was somewhat union-friendly. That's probably the only reason he won MI, PA, hell the whole damn election.
If Trump has his way he will disassemble everything that President Obama worked so hard for. 8 years for ALL of the American people. Trump's jealousy is a danger to our country. Obama was loved by many. Trump is despised by most.
Remember March 1st when DeBlasio(Cuban), Nancy, chuck and rest of Demonics kicked and screamed because of Trumps Covid Travel ban?....  I 🙏 Trump wins again. Election night will be epic...as long as not to many deceased Democrat cats mail in their vote😮
Trump hates successful people and any of those who have obtained Success Through good decision-making, compassion and appreciation for others. He is simply incapable of any of these things

I'm pretty sure that every time Biden mutters some incoherent thought, appended by a "C'Mon Man!..."  it boosts Trump far more than any Russian support. In all seriousness, with the direct exposure of today, Trump himself wins or loses his own votes. Russia influence not so much

Trump is always uninformed, ignorant, and just an embarrassment to our country.
I remember watching Putin sitting with Trump. Putin elbowed Trump and smirked, so this is your press. It was such a diss.

I am so tired of these political games the GOP plays. Do they really think we don’t notice. Republicans stall to let Trump swoop in and save the day? BS. We are not fooled. Vote for Democrats.

Trump has got to stick with what brought him here. The left will never accept him and neither will deep state Republicans. He has got to call a spade a spade and stand on that. Clean house, President Trump! Get your enemies out of your Republican circle! Listen to the people!!
There’s no way the American people are stupid enough to vote for Trump a second time.

We’ve had crises in the US before and never had the economy plummet like this. It’s not coronavirus. It’s Trump’s lack of planning, leadership and belief that’s he’s smarter than everyone, that has led to this. Trump’s a failure and a fraud.
What update. He just blabbed on. No new news. I am a Trump supporter since day 1 but this is just ridiculous.

We had 250,000 Dems vote and 600,000 Republicans. We need 200,000 Republicans to see the anti-Trump light and cross over to vote Dem. That is the hard problem I'm worried about.

Amazing. Trump finally got the left to complain about people getting unemployment. Your transition into 90s republicans is basically complete.
No kidding man! Total drop today. I think it will level out/bounce back soon. Trump banning China didn’t help. Then stalling/arguments about stimulus..
Well, the weird thing I have seen and might also be wrong about is that Trump's extremism is what's actually making his cult stronger, somehow.

She says “Leticia James is Trump-hating, NRA-hating...” like it’s a bad thing...
the new David Brooks piece is... not terrible! But I'd like to investigate the parallel universe where anybody could believe this...
The Joe Biden episode of Jay Leno’s Garage was the scariest I’ve ever seen.  Can’t wait to see how Donald Trump tries to one up this.
I tell one version of the story here.
Paul Krugman says he’s done the math — and the risk Trump and McConnell pose to the economy is ‘terrifying’
Trump is anything but cosmopolitan, his tastes are again amalgam of gilded cathedral trailer trash chic, educated well beyond his intelligence, grifter with a wobbly mind.
We’re to the point where Biden has done worse than the trump rumors has stated. But because cnn hasn’t told the left, they’re unaware #sheeple
I think the only masks that may work have Trump 2020 printed on them.
Donald Trump is willing to use his executive power as commander in chief to ban tik Tok but not to stop Covid gee thanks mr president
If I'm a Russian bot wouldn't I be helping trump?
s if they can’t decipher what they are trying to achieve. It’s racist to assume people can’t think for themselves and would vote for Kanye because he is Black! It’s disgusting and I won’t even start with Kanye’s desire to control woman’s bodies! Kanye is Trump period
We need to stop enabling and putting money in the pockets of this Kardashian/West family. They are actively trying to throw the election in favor of Trump. They are pridefully removing the integrity out of our democracy! They are also insulting the Black vote by treating them
Thread by  It's #TIME Thread: #AmericanaRISING: A GLIMPSE INTO THE SHADOWS 02- DAGGERS ARE OUT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP Everyone is spg on what President Trump meant when he said the following= "This may be the last time you'll see me for awhile."…
Thank you,  for joining our efforts to ensure essential medical supplies are produced in the United States. We must continue to strengthen our medical supply chains, and can start by passing my SAM-C legislation.
Haggerty is the mainstream candidate.  He’s all in on Trump.  Everyone who wasn’t all in on trump voted for Sethi or others (over 10% was other candidates).  Grab those voters and the ones that didn’t turnout, and the math starts to work.  Mackler was Bredesen part 2.
id wait for days to vote trump out if i had to
Yet resistards on Twitter are busy blaming Trump.
God bless our President Donald Trump.
A few days ago I said that when Biden wins in November, there will be a massive scrubbing/shredding/bleaching operation in every office of the Trump Administration. Remember: Trump never shut up about Hillary "smashing and bleaching hard drives."
Trump is the king of Cooking the Books...so I don’t believe one word or meme from #LyingTrump
Biden Is 'Following the Radical Left Agenda' That Is 'Against God,' Trump Says -
It was Obama and his admin that caged the children. Please get your facts correct! Beside, you’re very wrong on everything else! Yes, Trump knew Epstein and had him banned from Mara Largo and Trump also said he knew him, many others knew him he was in NYC. Get a grip!
If we don’t focus on getting as many Democrats elected as possible (including Biden), it’s going to be a lot more difficult to pass more progressive policies.  They will NOT pass during a second term with Trump.  It’s very likely Trump will overturn ACA.
Are you going to debate Trump before voting starts  if you don’t then I’ll be forced to vote for
great idea. keep “packing houses” for trump
Perfectly stated.  Who do you see being President then?   I’m not sure either Trump nor Biden will be which concerns me on many levels being it’s AUGUST!  Thoughts?
Let em go at it...IDGAF...less #trump voters in November...#winwin #cantfixstupid #deathwishbikers
Donald Trump and his actions are the true face of America. Look around you.   Look who your neighbor is  voting for. Black lives do matter. If you ask me human life matters.
Did we need a "boycott Trump" movement to convince ourselves the Kardashian brand is worth avoiding?
For the record back in 2016 when I said I don't think I will be able to survive 4 years of Donald Trump it was mostly a metaphor and not the current reality of the actual struggle between my life and death.
I'm pretty sure Trump isn't a devout follower of Christ but I do know that he respects and protects those who are. In a politician, that's acceptable to me. Not ideal, but acceptable.
How popular is Donald Trump? FiveThirtyEight is tracking his approval ratings.
Trump’s America
Trump lies daily.
Gov Cuomo says schools will go back to in person learning statewide, Is he gonna be accused of killing children or does that only apply to Trump?
Never seen a bigger optimist than Donald Trump. The dude is really always “glass half full”. Almost 300,000 deaths, but hey, our ratings are solid🤷🏻‍♂️
The NRA spent $36 million backing President Trump in the 2016 cycle.
Black lives STILL matter, pedophilia is a huge issue, don’t vote for trump or biden or kanye, homophobia/transphobia/racism/colorism is still an issue. Free the latinos from those nasty ass cages and let’s give transgenders their rights back OH and overthrow the gov 😉
Really,  His “captivating 11th hour run?” Literally nobody cares about Kanye’s sham attempt to run.
If you are a Democrat, are you not insulted that the DNC propped this guy up to be the leader of your party? The DNC is basically saying, we know how much your hate Trump, so here’s this decomposing bag of bones that you’ll vote for just because he’s a democrat and not Trump.

Anything for a buck with this family. I’ve always believed they were morally bankrupt and this proves it. Although I believe if anything Kanye will take votes away from Trump, not Biden. The people who support Biden are smarter then that.

President Trump Issues Executive Orders Regarding TikTok, WeChat Bans
See Trump’s tweets for myself!! The Resistance!!
They seem to think it would. Have you noticed how many of them have already mentioned the military removing Trump?
At least this is something. If  only Twitter would have penalized Trump every time he broke terms of service.  “Twitter locked the Trump campaign out of its account for sharing COVID-19 misinformation - TechCrunch”
The black lives matter movement has gotten so big and the fact that Donald trump was about to get put out of office, then turned around I see a campain running for office.
I think we’ll have fires. I just think it’s not the grand finale.   I’m thinking the media lies about the election results and tries to make the military remove Trump even though he won.
This is some Nixon-type shit.

Like why about that black trump supporter who got killed by protestors
huh, would you look at that
No matter how many times Joe tells you, you still use it to attack Trump lol. Sad.
The media bias. How are we even allowing it? It’s beyond the freedom of the press.  is just one hate trump speech after the other. No real news.

Ok so there isn't an issue with mail in voting because it's secure and each ballot is registered to a single voter, thanks for the clarification. Trump has been lying
Jerry Falwell, Jr. is a grifter just like his lord and savior, Donald Trump.
The doc can't prescribe it because it's not proven or tested or safe. It's been touted by non medical morons and a lady who believes in demon semen. What does Fauci have to gain from lying to you? Trump has to save his campaign

Also they think they will be the victors to write the history books.   They won’t.    Plus we will demand that all the documents that Trump Administration will be reclassified to the correct level and put into the public record. Along with new laws so IGs can’t be fired easily.
Do Dems or Reps absentee vote more? Yesterday's election affords opportunity for a quick look, comparing Nashville vote method distribution in US Senate primary. Dem absentee voting rate doubles GOP rate. Just one slice of data but could be Trump is suppressing his own vote.
It speaks volumes when Trump encourages the NRA to flee to Texas while under investigation in NY for criminal activities. How much more proof do you need to show that Trump is himself a criminal? A law biding person would not give this illegal advice.
Please explain what  logic you used to come to this conclusion. What has Trump done that has hurt our country?

TRUMP 2020
Biden sucks. He's a terrible option. He's an old man with dementia opposed to m4a and legalizing recreational in 2020. Biden is a miserable terrible excuse for a Democrat and will be a shit president.   But he will still be better than Trump.
Hillary was supposed to win. There was some agreement between Obama and Hillary. She had something on him. He had to attempt to sabotage Trump and Biden probably was in the loop. How is that an feeble hateful forgetful old man is the Democrats choice? Surely they had better.
Sure, anyone involved in that is in the wrong. But I thought that Trump was better than Obama, why continue this?
We're going to hear a lot of talk about the soul of America during this campaign. f
All I see are three people standing there who care nothing about anyone other than themselves. Isn't that the Trump family motto!?
Those are all just talking points. It’s not simple and it is quite ridiculous. I’m a fan of conviction, compassion and a true record of service and success! Trump is a Carnival Barker, plain and simple.
Is the takeaway that Trump thought Blackburn was Diane Black?
To bad we have 160000 DEAD, UNEMPLOYED at 10.2%, people starving and being evicted, millions infected, debt 27 trillion, and over 9 trillion dollars of fed injection in markets. Doesn't sound good to me.  3.5 years ago we were slamming it. Trump destruction
Why do we get Trump as the RNC choice is the bigger question IMO. But I think Biden was chosen because he has the most realistic option to pull moderates over and defeat Trump. I’m a republican, pretty moderate on some fronts and pretty liberal socially, I want Trump out of there
When  called  last night to congratulate him, Trump said Hagerty “didn’t choke.” When  took over the call, Trump said Hagerty “didn’t choke like you.” The comment led to lots of laughter, including from Blackburn. Heres’s video I got

" dump the trumpster " or "Trump the dumpster" which one sounds better?
Biden is a devout Catholic. But Trump paints a very different picture of Biden—as a man hostile to religion. “No religion… He’s against God.”
There’s only like 1 poll that puts him within 10 points of Trump here, and even just walking around town, you can see what the ratio is like. I hope I’m wrong and this changes before Election Day, but as of today, there’s no way Joe’s coming close here

Keep equating Haggerty with Trump. That worked for him in the primary but maybe not in the general election
It didn't start with Trump, but with the various waxes and wanes of populism, notably the tea party nonsense recently. The "party of no" during Obama was a dereliction of duty. It shouldn't take a mandate to pass legislation, like sensible background checks.
Of course...why not?😡  Trump reimposes tariffs on raw Canadian aluminum
Or if Obama had used Executive Orders just a tenth of the times Trump has?
😪 if this country can't live w/out #TikTok our issues are bigger than #COVID19 and a contributing factor to the current leadership crisis &amp; I'm in no way a nationalist nor a trump fan in any universe  No matter what, if the loss of Tik Tok hurts ppl/markets we f*d
I said it before and I will say it again:  is a Christian and he's my brother. I will vote for him. Not because he's my Christian brother, or because Trump isn't.   I'll vote for him because my conscience and the gospel are at peace in the Democratic party.
But Trump definitely couldn't care less about God. God is another script line. He's a character who has gotten poor ratings so far and definitely has NO say in his administration.   But the rubes seem to like the character, right?
3. Trump can barely remember where he is, most days, so he has to have his talking points broken down into manageable pieces.   "HOLD BIBLE" "AGAINST GOD" "WALL" "CHINA VIRUS"   Sidebar: He can't even be brought to use proper grammar in his racism and call it a "Chinese virus."
2. Trump gets told what red meat will satisfy the base and he awkwardly regurgitates it for them like some diseased mother bird.   He was told that the polls show they are losing evangelical support. They needed to shore that up. How? By painting Joe as anti-religion.
Let me draw your attention to a couple of key things:  1. Trump is an actor. Definitely not a good actor, but he's an actor. He says what's in the script like he's in the world's worst production of "Our Town."   Except the play is "Our Nation" and at the end we're ALL dead.
So is Joe against God? Hardly.   But why would Trump trot that out? Why would he make such a dumb and easily disprovable claim?  It's pretty simple: people will believe it.
Trump lied yesterday and says that Biden is against God. Now, that's about all the time I'm going to spend on that lie because it's so obvious and so weirdly stated that it's beneath all of us to do more than mock it.
trump and mark zuckerburg should kiss!

Every tweet from Trump that I see I see you write something. Do you have an alert system or something? Maybe a hobby would be a good idea?
It shouldn’t even be an issue, though.  He shouldn’t have to release a statement about his faith.  Trump shouldn’t be making these crazy claims about whether or not Biden is a religious man.
has the bully pulpit.  Why doesn't he use it?  I guarantee this happened to Pelosi, AOC, or another lefty they would have Big Tech up on the Hill.  If President Trump doesn't act, shame on him.
So the $600/wk relief bill is being dragged on by the reps... so that Trump can later say he made it happen with his super power. Cheap political trick at the expense of the people who are suffering now without the extra help to make it through. Don’t you see it? #politics
The same people that were blaming Trump for the economy a few months ago, were the same DEMS yelling to shut the country down. 160,000+ my ass.
Why do we have to see this over and over again without saying Trump is crazier than a loon and he’s bloviating crap!
Those first few minutes when you wake before you remember trump
I don’t think any Trump supporting friend could even comprehend the question...
Damien Trump is not only a #Biblicalidiot he’s also eerily similar to the Anti-Christ.
Cool, like the fake news attacks Trump and the Republicans everytime they are on the air.
if trump bands other apps we will have more problems  and protests
Yes! Same here. It was mostly right wing memes or endless praise of their god emperor Trump. Then once some of them started going Qanon I was like that’s it.....
Exactly, people won’t be able to handle the truth. Or if Trump wins that will also start up the mongrels again
not necessary!Joe would drop Trump like a stone and quickly!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I don't remember when trump promised to extort and embezzle American taxpayers.
Actually I DON’T. I’m a highly educated, non-sheeple. I just want this over so people can stop losing work, jobs, $, LIFE. If it means 4 months in masks, so be it. And if you support Trump (which I’m gonna guess u do), then re-examine what propaganda means. He epitomizes it!
It’s as if f Trump heard the word Hoax, decided it was important-sounding, and  made it his fave word.
John MacArthur, a California megachurch pastor and radio preacher, says the Bible demands his congregation meet in person and sing together - despite public health bans on singing and large group meetings. Will his appeal to the Bible hold up in court?
John MacArthur believes the Bible trumps COVID-19 public health orders. Legal scholars say no  via
The NRA and Wayne LaPierre  are corrupt as the day is long and  is still trying to cover for them!trump is only comfortable with criminals and corruption ! It’s his way of life!
God took center stage in the presidential election yesterday, with President Trump warning that Biden would "hurt God" while Biden quoted the Bible at a church meeting.
The sad thing is most trump supporters can’t own up to their stupid mistake. He is a disaster. His failure is killing Americans, daily.
More like a slang. One of Trump's tweets
No name was a traitor to our country.  He armed ISIS!  Worked with Obama to create havoc in the Middle East.  He also pushed the Steele Dossier to remove Trump.  Trump has done more to end human trafficking, done more for our Black brothers and sisters than anyone! FU
Done seen a few people say that at least Trump is transparent. The only transparent thing about him is if he doesn’t like someone or something, you know it. Aside from personal feelings, he generally lies about most things to fit narrative favorable to his point of view.
How interesting it is to see that Biden  clip floating around &amp; ppl who are voting Trump like “How can you vote for this when he says things like that?!” after they’ve spent the last few years screaming “you didn’t watch the whole thing” or “they took that out of context.”
I’m begging you to remember that you HAVE to defeat trump. Please don’t screw it up.
Last night:  -Trump pick Bill Hagerty wins Senate GOP primary  -Jim Cooper fends off Democratic primary challenge  -Marquita Bradshaw surprise winner of Democratic Senate primary
Working with a conspiracy theorist who hates Obama &amp; complains about Obama's "lies" while ignoring Trump's is quite interesting for me to deal with on a daily basis 😑
I’d crawl over broken glass, thru a swarm of wasps, wade thru a swamp, climb a mountain, trudge thru a desert, walk a 1000 miles, fight an ogre/Trump supporter, swim thru snake infested waters &amp; walk thru fire to vote Trump out. Good thing we don’t have to do any of that so VOTE!

Trump couldn't run... Well anything as evidenced by his many bankruptcies, Trump U scam, disastrous presidency... A rock would be preferable to trump.
Trump Card!!!!!  Where may I see the movie??? #TrumpCard
Is anyone from the left going to say something? First he says if you don't vote for him you aren't black. Now this! If you are going to call out the statements of Trump you must also call out the statements of Biden. #Election2020 #Biden2020 #Trump2020
How many white babies or mixed babies have been aborted in 50 years? Why are you just mentioning Biden as your opponent,what about Trump? Why are you not dragging him? Your mama has got to be ashamed.
More like a ripple effect. People are at the edge, economic situation and other factors has contributed to the hostility.  We can do better than being hostile  Love Trump's Hate
Michelle Obama Admits She Has 'Low-Grade Depression' Over Donald Trump's Actions:
That sort of idiocy is why we have such an idiot for president. Even the Federalist Society doesn't want trump. Luckily, Biden is on the glide path to an easy win, since Trump can't open his mouth without lying.
Trump looks like a bad skin tag that came to life and put on a lil blue suit and just started talking one day
#WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE #V  Trump’s Whirlpool Speech #NovemberNovember 😎
Our soybean farmers better move on. Trump destroyed their market share with his “trade war”.Damn, copycats really runs in Trump family. Wait, which one sounds better to the world’s ears? The president who recently took the hardest cognitive test the world has ever seen, had someone took HIS ACT OR Plagiarism? Answer: ALL OF THEM!!!
We don’t see this Trump as often as we used to, I hope he’s returning to us and this is just the beginning
Churches meeting in casinos was not exactly the MAGA I was going for when I voted for Trump
They are trying shame Trump back into the mask bully side....maybe Trump never actually believed the rona mask crap
Let's be honest, nobody else is tweeting for Trump.
Bill Hagerty did his job well when he led the Trump transition team....make sure no MAGA candidates make it through
Any Republican that supports mail in ballots doesn’t not want Trump to win
The Senate gave up their power to Trump long ago. Of course he thinks he can do it. Stop him!
Personnel is policy....something I would have thought  would know by now...personnel is Trump’s Achilles Heel
Please do not allow that!! Let’s pray for the Trump - Pence to win
Unfortunately there were not good choices for this race, Dr, Manny’s mentor was Bill Frist...not exactly a ringing endorsement but Hagerty on Trump transition team kept MAGA people out of Trump admin, I wish we could have gambled with Manny but he was weak, don’t beat yourself up
Trump biblical book: Person, Man, Camera, TV - let me add 1 more word “prison”
Sigh....kind of hard to overcome the Trump endorsment
Catturd I really love you but I will be first in line. Trump 2020😊
If you like Lamar , you’re gonna love Hagerty , Trump also endorsed Mitt Romney , we need Dr Manny , the real MAGA candidate
It will takes years for the Republican Party to rid itself of the complicit enablers of Trump.
Republicans clearly don’t care what Trump has done.
Plus all those big, giant, complex and wonderful words Trump loves to use!! Lol......
I was making a joke. Basically saying that 50% of white Americans are deranged for still supporting Trump.
May the Spygate members ALL fall into the pit they have dug for Trump
Rephrased: Mitch and friends will try to crush MAGA but will only make it bigger...MAGA is bigger than Trump
Dumb asses.  trump virus  DeWine: Churchgoer spreads coronavirus to at least 91 others after single service
Because Trump isn’t known for making the best endorsements.....see Romney
Unbelievable! You didn’t blame Trump for this. Congrats
Picture this....Obama and friends expel 35 Russian diplomats hoping to escalate tensions and cause problems for Trump and add to the narrative of Trump Russia collusion, after they kick out Russia doesn’t react to their schemes, Obama is shocked...They just got Flynned!!!
The democrats were trying to escalate tensions with Russia, thanks to General Flynn nothing came of that, democrats are mad that Flynn threw a wrench in their grand plans to screw Trump as he was taking office....amazing
Trump Russia is as real as this pandemic.....let that sink in
General Flynn is a good man....served his country for decades....and people at the highest echelons of power ruined his life in an effort to get Trump....after years of money and more resources than anyone can imagine they couldn’t quite get him....they are still not giving up
You blame the China virus on Trump? Why are people so stupid? The regular flu kills tons of people every year. If it wasn’t the flu you blame him for something else. It’s the new generation blame everyone for everything. You fit right in.
Let’s pray for President Trump to win this election! How could this “Joe títere” “Joe muppet” be a President if he is afraid to debate?....
Trump is playing their game...their narrative....as long as he does that he loses....if he would start exposing the inflated numbers maybe we could get somewhere
It's interesting to watch all the people calling out Trump for knowing Ghislane but not saying a word about Bill Clinton being on Pedo Island
So are you saying Donald Trump is involved or is she lying?
How the hell can you watch the above three minutes of video and say that?!?! You’re dumber than trump.
Wear the damn mask.....not exactly the MAGA message I had in mind when I voted for Trump in 2016
You guys have raised a buttload of money off Trump, anyway you can sue some people or something? Like do anything productive besides whine?
Hey Trump how about you wear the damn mask and open up the damn country and we will wear the mask if we want to ???,
Facts dispute every single liberal bit of lies in response to your post Laura.  As usual Libs just get angry when facts don't support their desired perspective.  Here's the real facts
Please help  It's hard to live in this state with one of the most corrupt senators  Trump-era primaries in Kansas, Tennessee trigger GOP family feuds over who would deliver more for president
Exactly. This is actual data that shows the race is different than some polls indicate. Doesn’t Trump have more primary votes than any incumbent ever?
No no. I was asking which Democratic VP candidate is the best of the worst. Trump was doing a great job until coronavirus came along. All while the Democrats did everything to undermine him. But hey that’s all you got. Nothing. Hence why y’all are running Biden
What will India do??? They just banned tik tok. I think trump will say, “remove ban or else......”⁦
Unfortunately too many Americans want to vote based on their feelings instead of policy
You’re correct. The fact remains that he’s not all there mentally. Hoping whatever is left of moderate Democrats see this and either don’t vote or vote Trump
tRump proves that education is a meaningless piece of paper. That piece of paper doesn’t prove competency.
I believe you are correct.  It has Biden picking up Wisconsin only and Trump picking up MN and NH.
So the whole of deep state couldn't get Trump but some spoiled rotten teens are gonna....Blumpf is finished oh nooooos
Keep in mind....NYT considers Trump supporters Nazis so there's that
The media hate Trump and want people to die so that he loses. Plain and simple.
Picking up Togo from Fridas Restaurant and a White family of 4 decked in Trump paraphernalia walked in with no masks...
I have a dream that some day Trump will talk about all the lies about COVID numbers....false positives, positives for those who haven’t been tested, probable cases included, etc
Why, why &amp; why saying Trump in trouble now? This country already in deep trouble when he took office. No need to wait 4 f*#%king years OR Covid19, racial protest, Russia, etc to say OH! He’s in trouble - that’s jusT BS!
The same people that lied to you about Trump Russia are lying to you about Covid numbers ...but by all means wear the mask if you think that cloth bacteria trap protects you
The shutdown crew made mail-in voting a thing....also helped crash the one great thing Trump had going for him ...the economy....weird
Americans can't hold funerals but John Lewis can have 5  Americans can't go to church but "protesters" can riot and loot  You're such liars Jake...you should give back your award for lying about Trump Russia and give it to Julie Brown for her reporting on Epstein
The #EpsteinFiles clear Donald Trump and implicate Bill Clinton, pass it on.
Even if Trump isn't listening to him, ,mayors and governors are
We had the biggest roaring economy of our lifetime... was cruising to victory....and then the shutdown crew convinced Trump to stop the engine of America...they got Trump to destroy the best thing he had going in a matter of months
It was designed to watch a biased media who can smell Trump’s blood in the water above the stench of their own. Mission accomplished. Pavlov was right.
Trump isn't going to pardon Alan Dershowitz....he's not that dumb
I believe trump called it “winning.”
The victims of Jeffrey Epstein reached out to the  they FBI blew them off...think about that when they put 40 agents to investigate Trump Russia ..something they knew was a lie
...have spent generations living and benefiting from that lifestyle. Trump was the inevitable backlash, especially right after the first black president who was perceived by the right to be a “radical leftist.”  Believe it or not, there’s more people who believe in progressive...
BREAKING: The 100 Day Siege Begins!  "They will be targeting Trump's poll workers saying they are targeting minorities"
Twitter stinks. However I want to stick around when the lose it after  Trump victory.
So sad to hear this he was a voice of conservatives. He will be missed by us. For those who spout obscenities consider the source and move on. I believe that’s what Herman would want us to do. Let’s make sure we vote for Donald Trump one last thing for Herman. He would be pleased
Perfect interview, Steve! Powerful words. We’re not going to take Trump’s pathetic attempt to hold on to power.
Have no dog in this fight, but I’m guessing you’re against Trump...what exactly do you think “your side” has been doing the last 3 1/2 years?
#WeWillVote as it’s never been more important. Voting out Trump and Trumpism is VITAL for this nation to survive.
I know someone who was dying of COVID AND double pneumonia, was praying with a fried of mine on phone over this woman, she was 72 but had been active and in decent health, same week Trump mentioned HCQ she got HCQ, she went home within the week and is fine now
I can see the smile on your face when you tweeted this. You want to get rid of Trump so much you don’t care if it hurts Americans. Hope you feel good about yourself. Btw Trump will win in November
Mr. Clyburn, Shelby County, Tennessee has seen a 96% increase in July of the trump virus.  is praying the trump virus away. He likely won't tell you that.  And  blames the trump virus on China. Welcome to my life.
Yeah, that’s not happening. We have the obvious shy Trump voter plus just garbage polls in general.This is bull shit. ACA already covers pre-existing conditions- trump is suing to end this coverage. Are his followers &amp; you that stupid to believe this?
Kudos to  &amp;  for not interrupting their program to air trump’s golf club rally/briefing. My remote was ready to be switched if it came on. People are out of work, need money for food, rent, medication &amp; healthcare &amp; he thinks it’s good optics to have it with his guests.
Donald Trump Jr will be named interim president
Trump accepts assistance from Russia for 2020 campaign.
Of course, Trump is our only defense against China
Next to Trump, he looks and sounds like an absolute genius.
The Dems are just itching/praying for another Kent State. If just ONE protester is killed by a Federal Agent either by self-defense, accident or doing his duty, that will be the match that lights the fuse to eliminate of Trump. He must tread lightly.  Give them enough rope.
I would but Americans are banned through trump’s incompetent handling of COVID-19!
It isn’t going to hurt Amazon which is trump’s intention. They’ll pass the cost of shipping on to the consumer. When are people going to realize Republicans  are NOT for helping the average, everyday American, they’re in it for themselves, the wealthy.
Sound like when  had to issue a false statement to cover for trump’s idiocy.
Trump’s Axios interview is one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen in a while. Like, painful to watch. What a train wreck.
Take your lunch reading:
AGAIN, Paula White is Trump's Official PAID by Taxpayers, Spiritual Advisor.    She's a Cult Leader and like most in Trumps Cabinet, A Felon.
Horse Shit, Separating children from parents at the border is terrible. He took office with illegal crossings at a 40 year LOW-He created an "Emergency" to build the Trump Memorial Wall, a tribute to stupidity &amp; waste, stole $9 Billion from Military Housing budget to pay for it
You can keep making up BS but the reality is that the whole world saw what happened there.   Twist it as you wish but History was made by Trump and it was just one of a long line of despicable acts in his Made for TV Presidency.
Oh brother, you're nuts, they have daily services just after noon daily Eucharist service at 12:10 PM.     And the Rector for the Main Church in Georgetown is regularly there to conduct services.
So...Trump says Tik Tok needs to get out of their "holding companies" before he'd be comfortable with them remaining in U.S....oh; you mean, LIKE TRUMP WAS SUPPOSED TO AS PRESIDENT?! AND STILL HASN'T!
President Trump issued executive orders Thursday evening prohibiting Americans from transacting with the owners of popular mobile apps TikTok and WeChat.
I’ve never thought of it that way. We have 3 family members who hate trump but refuse to vote, have never voted-“their vote doesn’t count.” I don’t know how to challenge their ignorance, we’ve tried every argument. Even “one way to be sure your vote doesn’t count is to NOT vote.”
The campaign hasn’t started in earnest, yet, which should happen after the Dem nominating convention. Even without this, Trump is only 3 points (Rasmussen) behind Biden. Republicans have all the issues. The Dems have no issues that can’t be easily campaigned against. Trump wins!
This is Trump's Religion,
Trump has neither
A friendly reminder for those that have forgotten about Jill Stein, she was in Russia with Flynn and Putin BEFORE the election. The votes they flipped to her, threw the election to trump. It just happened to be the same 3 states that Manafort shared polling data with Russia on.
Exactly what Jill Stein did, but quietly. They’ll have the voting tallies throw JUST ENOUGH votes to Kanye to give the electoral college vote to trump. It worked in 2016.
She says God is a Divine Vending Machine for your personal prosperity.   Precisely the Opposite of what Jesus Said
That's BS, to start with I despise the Talibangelicals in the first place, second, Donald Trump likely doesn;t even HAVE a bible and third, his own family says he is non-religious.   He Does Bill Us Taxpayers for "Prosperity Gospel" cult preachers in the White House though!
They used Jill Stein to divert votes in 2016. Remember, she was in Russia alongside Flynn/Putin. They flipped just enough votes from Hillary to Stein w/o it being too obvious for trump to win in 3 states, WI, MI &amp; PA. Manafort was sharing polling data on these states with Russia.

“There’s my African American” -Joe Biden. Oops, that was Donald fucking Trump.
In case you were unaware, the God of all creation can not be hurt by Joe Biden. The Gospel however is severely damaged by deranged people, like Trump, who represent everything that the Kingdom of God is against. Our God’s kingdom is one of peace and love. Trump’s god is money.
They still have trump and his businesses.
I stood for the flag based on Romans 13 and Titus 3:1 during the Obama admin as well as Trump.
Biden could pick dog shit for his running mate and I would vote for him and his dog shit with a smile on my face. Anyone pulling this garbage about not voting for him because of his vp pick just wants to vote for trump but needs a reason to make themselves feel better about it.
It’s the same thing. Trump owns them. They kiss his ass and make fools of themselves daily. They all have to go.
Why are you and trump attempting to control/brainwash the public ?
By walking to the church and posing with Bible in hand, after he had armoured police clear his way Through peaceful protestors, Trump reduced the church and the Bible alike to profane props in his grandstanding theatricality.

Trump's Own Family has stated that the only time he has ever held a Bible is for Photo Ops
Really VS NRA Leadership Stealing Millions, it IS refreshing to see Wayne LaPierre going down in flames.....then Trump will pardon them all for Federal Crimes but state Crimes cannot be pardoned and the State's Lawsuits cannot be Tampered with by the IMPOTUS
SAD To hear that the NY AG is bringing charges vs the NRA and not the Trump Crime Family.     Still Hopeful though!
In scathing obit, Texas woman blames Trump, 'selfish' people for husband's COVID-19 death
No one suggested an equivalence until you popped up, moron. The tweet didn't compare or even mention Trump. It just said the Biden plan is shit, because it is. Obviously the Trump plan is shittier. Doesn't make the Biden plan good.
No surprise there. Now that a trump toadie is in charge of data collection instead of the CDC, #TrumpVirus will now magically disappear, the “numbers” will show nothing but happy news, beautiful news, as the #TrumpVirus just goes away “as things do...” Are there ANY repub adults?
Even the fake weebs who are influenced by Trump XD been seeing that too.
Well, trump and his campaign. Where do I go to get my 10 million?
There’s something horribly wrong with some (trumpsters) Americans. #DrFauciWontLieForTrump, so he &amp; his family get death threats. The nazi mindset of trump’s fools is absolutely mind boggling &amp; disgusting! #TrumpDomicide #GOPBetrayedAmerica #RepublicanTraitors #NoCriticalThinking
Another trump stooge who is being used to benefit trump. He will be used and thrown away.
I am sure Trump knows. I believe God is going to intervene soon. If the satanic deep state thinks for even a second that Fauci will squeal to save himself, he will soon be found dead. The greatest revival in the History of the world is about to begin.

Update: Twitter temporarily bans Trump team from tweeting  via
The union is behind Biden. I’m a postal employee and The union has never seen a dime of my money. There are more people that work in my office that are Trump supporters than our Biden supporters.
The union endorsed Biden. Not the post office. Not all of us are off our rocker. In my office there are more Trump supporters than Biden supporters.
And trump would respond, “it is what it is” or in other words, “shit happens.”
Pelosi blasts Trump for saying he may deliver convention speech from White House: 'He can't do that'   #pelosi #PresidentTrump The President  tried to save tax payers money but Pelosi whines about everything. Mr. President hold it 1 of your own properties.
All of this because Trump has a grudge against Bezos and wants to slow mail-in voting everywhere but Florida.  Such reeking corruption.
What’s your point? They were doing their job protecting Americans? I know it seems crazy considering trump works for a foreign power but seriously, that’s what presidents used to do.

Trump's Axios Interview in 28 seconds  via  ....Oh Lawwwdee!
Keep smiling back at the death stares.
#LincolnVoter I refused to vote for Trump in 2016 because I knew he'd make a horrible President, instead voting Libertarian.   The party has become completely dominated by Trump, abandoning fiscally conservative Republicans.  I'm voting for Joe Biden!
I forget that there's an election coming up. Trump has never stopped campaigning and Biden's whole game plan seems to be "Well everyones minds are made up."  Feels like presidential campaigns don't even exist anymore because it's just been years of campaigning as the new normal.
They used Stein in 2016 to divert votes from the Democrats. It seems illegal to run a candidate on the ballot for that purpose. They’ll divert just enough votes to say trump won. They’ve got the voting machines that can do it remotely. Look at WI, PA, MI in 2016.
I don't know that but they specifically told me they had not given to Trump or a PAC for Trump
None of you have any idea what you're talkin about which is par for the course for the leftist garbage piles in this country. President Trump had already been elected and a transition was taking place which includes contacting foreign dignitaries. This is commonplace and normal.
what are you doing to keep the  functional? This isn’t just a question of funding but of dealing with the stooge trump installed to dismantle USPS. We receive all of our medications by mail.
If you just listen to the audio, this could easily be one Trump going on a rambling tangent.
Anything anti-Trump trends immediately.   Coincidence?  I think not.
Whistleblowers have been a trusted &amp; necessary part of our government since George Washington. Now they are outed, vilified, lose their jobs, as well as other, what I thought was illegal, retaliation. Death of a democratic republic with a thousand cuts...
And why did she make it criminal to prescribe hyroxychloroquine?  Hmmm....Does she know more than medical doctors? Or is it just pure hatred of Trump that she will let more people die?
I received a Message from Darden Restaurants shortly after this post on November 27, 2019 saying that they DO NOT Support Trump and have not given to anything related to him.
And trump has ethics?
Neil Young sues Trump campaign, deriding use of famous tunes

scary if true.  had a gentleman on that said IF it was, and there is nothing to indicate it was a bomb, the first country Lebanon would suspect would be Israel. This could start a war over trump’s hyperbole and incompetence.
We need to be told what happened in 2016 too. We still haven’t been told the extent of the Russian interference. Why were the 3 states Manafort gave polling data to Russia on, the same 3 states trump won by a TOTAL of 77,000 votes? How many state election databases were accessed?
President's can't over rule the constitution. It's not a joke I think trump honestly thinks he'll stay in power forever.  It would literally take an act of Congress to remain president for more terms.
I’ve known that Ellen was a fake for four years now, when She ended Her Show with the phrase “ Be Kind to one another.” I always added to it by saying, “Except Donald Trump”😂 Low and behold if anyone was kind to Donald Trump.

If pedo joe and democrats was in charge, this would be a living nightmare!!! THANK GOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!
A tRumper calling me a hyoocritical piece of shit. 😅🤣😅🤣😅 That's rich. It's like tRump calling someone a liar!  It just has no sting. Have a day.
He's trying to save his spot on this season of Governer Apprentice. He really doesn't want to get fired by Trump. It's the people of Tennessee he should be worried about.
Let me add to that: 1. Sexual misconduct, harassment, and bullying.  2. White supremacy, racism, homophobia, transphobia. 3. Ordered his administration to slow down testing. Responsible for the death of almost 160,000 Americans. Oh wait that was trump!!!
Oh yeah, its the Dems that want to take down Trump, Bolsonaro, Duterte, Macron, Trudeau, Duda, Johnson, Putin, Zapatero, Mattarella, Piniera, Vizcarra, De Souza, Lopez-Obrador, Moreno, Marquez, Rasmussen, Merkel, Moise, it's worldwide - Damn them Dems are everywhere!
No one has suggested Open Borders except Faux Noose. When Trump took office, illegal border crossings were at a 40 year LOW.  He CREATED this "Emergency". Just one of those things Fox says over and over to convince the weak minded against Fact.
Of course Donald Trump the fake media are going to say whatever they can to make Joe Biden look good you can't make something that ugly look good

He SAID he's Happy to show his tax returns, In May 2014, Trump said in an interview: "If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that." In February 2015, Trump said that if he ran for the presidency: "I would release tax returns"

Oh no I'm definitely not Above that. Please Get Covid-19 Donald J Trump, hell I go one step more get Don Jr. Too #NotMyPresident
Literally 2 mins into the actual interview, Trump says more people would have died if he didn’t put the ban on China in January and then Europe. Sweetie, it is AUGUST and thousands of people are still dying and being infected.
Trump said they were designating ANTIFA as a domestic terror organization. He was immediately mocked because that's not a thing.  But if they can prove that there's a connection with foreign organizations, it could become possible to designate ANTIFA as a terrorist organization.
That neck placement can’t be by accident. Is it her, or is it trump? #neckcameltoe
Trump has to go! Ride him out on a rail and never let him back in Washington! Also, all of his enablers!!!
Usually someone is hired on an HB1 Visa because they have skills that local workers don't and the company is unable to fill otherwise. This is just Trump rewarding a minion with a job or favor while playing to his base's nationalist and racist tendencies.

They know Trump would make him look as bad as he is.
And why do Republicans choose fetuses first instead of real, tangible humans? Vets, kids, or seniors?  Schools shouldn't open but Trump has demanded it so in a hissy fit.  Put your money where your mouth is, conservatives.
tRump doesn't even have enough decency to be embarrassed for clearly lying.
I would think journalist will be investigating both Clinton and trump. Trump modeling agency was most likely a front for trafficking young girls.
He hasn’t condemned it because he is ok with it. Trump does not work for the American people. The sooner everyone realizes that the better.

President Trump is the Cyrus of today.
Also, Prohibition and Trump doesn’t drink.
I hadn’t heard that Trump was even close to losing. I honestly expect a landslide victory with 49-50 states. I expect the polls to show this mid October.
Trump is the Crystal Pepsi of presidents... It was a bad idea to start and the results are atrocious!
This disgusts me about Trump and his cronies. I never saw so much disinformation and propaganda in my life before they wanted power. Now people follow q-anon conspiracy theories as if they are fact. So many are misled so easily. I hate liars, trolls and propagandists.
No, the Republicans wouldn’t do anything for at least two months. McConnell wouldn’t put it on the Senate floor.  They now have let it lapse! Way to Go Trump and your “No Care” Republicans!!!!!
The Trump plan to hurt the Post Office is beginning.  “If it fits it ships” packages that took 3 days are now arriving in 5 days. If you are planning to vote by mail in this election, plan to vote as early as possible.  Don’t wait until the last couple of days.
The Supreme Court declined by a 5-4 vote Friday to halt the Trump administration's construction of portions of the border wall with Mexico following a recent lower court ruling that the administration improperly diverted money to the project.

If apps like TikTok are truly a security threat the why haven’t others been banned?  Thanks for taking away the one platform I could reach people with, Trump ✌️
I myself wanted Warren. I didn't get her, but guess what. I'm going to vote #Biden2020Landslide  because that's who the majority of Dems wanted. Let's face it. A dirty dishrag would be better than tRump. Baby steps. We will get there progressives. We are on a journey.
That’s what Trump says, I can’t say I have as much confidence in Google, but I’m pretty confident that if that was true Apple would have found it during their App Store approval process.
Are you talking about Trump banning the app for political reasons, or that people are making it political against him?
No.  Hagerty born in Gallatin went to Vandy. He's tried and true Tennessean. Manny from Ohio. Seems like a sharp dude too but I'll take the guy Trump endorses and has roots in TN!
Just one more reason to vote Trump 2020 🇺🇸
It's because Sara Cooper, is getting to him,I've showed 5 former Trump Fans those videos and boom they could not believe how dumb he sounds,and how dumb they felt after watching too. It's a great mirror for some it has to be eating at him. So Ban Tic Tok that's important 😂
Great idea, John Dean! All National Delivery Services; UPS, Amazon, FedEx, etc. Need to step up and set up a system to help US Postal Service deliver Mail-in ballots for 2020 election  our voting rights MUST BE PROTECTED. Donald Trump must not be allowed to destroy postal service
Do republicans not understand they aren’t attracting new voters? Do they not realize when their old asses are gone there will be no one to replace them? The Republican Party is dying. Trump and his band of traitors are to blame.
JUST IN: President Trump says he'll act to ban TikTok in the U.S. as soon as Saturday
And 2 billion to renovate the FBI building so a hotel won’t come in there and compete with trump’s hotel. And don’t forget blocking all liability claims against companies.
Biden has a plan. Trump is a socialist. He redistributes wealth upward to himself and his donors.
Because I never said you were a Trump supporter
Yes these all happened, I never said trump was a perfect human, and I also never said I was right wing. I can’t stand our political system. But I stand by everything I’ve said above this

Yeah a bunch of people in power do, and it happens all the time. I’m not defending trump, but it does get old seeing people post the same story that has been proven wrong in the past. Yes trump was associated with Epstein, but not to the degree of many others
Here’s a second source for you. Do your own research so you can come to a solution yourself.

Nichole Williams says she never wants to fight for toilet paper again. She says the economy doesn’t need to be shut down again and she thinks Trump did the best he could. She says she declared in August of last year and has been everywhere and answered to everyone.
Trump has NO friends .  .  .
Funding isn’t going to stop trump from slowing down the mail &amp; preventing ballots from being counted. He’s installed his crony and he has already started slowing down mail delivery and cutting hours.   will have to restore service along with the funding.

My prediction: Trump will reject all COVID relief proposals from democrats so he can take unilateral action and then solely claim credit.
I’m not defending any terrible shit Biden does/has done. I am not a Trump supporter. Like I said, on the racism meter, both of them register. But one is on a significantly different level of that meter than the other.
I’ll put it this way. If Trump loses, it’ll be a tough day for racism, but not as tough of a day as it should be. Wouldnt call myself a Biden supporter. Not running around waving his flag or putting his sticker on my car, but if I’m choosing between the two on the racism meter...

No one forced Trump following to continue to do so. There is so much proof of his illegal acts and yet they follow
Bro you obsessed 😂both party’s have idiots you can’t shit on dems without realizing how much of a mess the Republican Party is.   Biden is senile and can’t even speak   And trump says whatever the fuck he wants w no remorse      They both are bad my guy
And people ask me why do I have my money on trump not only winning again but beating Joe Biden fairly easily
Exactly why I'm betting on trump
Well, if the democrats want mail in votes you can bet that I Will send in an extra 5000 votes for Trump!!!
The trump sheeple are ignorant, so no surprise here.
And you guys screwed it up😂😂😂😂 now we are gonna have four more years of blatant racism, I don't know how the left and liberals screw this up. donald trump is the worst president I've even seen and he is still gonna win and I'm willing to bet on😊
I actually don't care for either one of those clowns but I am betting my money that donald trump wins, not only that but fairly easily Joe Biden was the wrong candidate to hand pick you guys picked the wrong person should've went with ol'Bernie. You had four years to get it right
I mean, that’s the purpose of a representative democracy, to represent the will of your voters to the best of your ability. If Trump became pro-choice and appointed liberals to the Supreme Court, pretty sure no one would be saying “what a profile in courage to ignore his base”
All the things Biden screws up. He may be better than Trump, but not by much.

I think the military actually pay the NFL to display the flag so how patriotic is that? And actually donald trump made it political
I prefer neither but I'm betting on racism and trump its really a no brainer. You have to just get out of your feelings and you'll see that racism is still here and doing well, you guys hand picked the wrong candidate. trump supporters are uneducated, low informed and racist
We will never know if Trump or him get sick, they are to prideful.
Let's see. His opponent is weak and his supporters aren't nearly as ready as trump supporters. Racism. That's the part you don't get, I don't realize how racist this country still is. His supporters are uneducated, uninformed mostly racist and they really don't care about none

What is devastating is dem voters buy into this staged crisis.  WHO says covid 19 doesn't qualify as epidemic even with inflated data from dem run states. Fauci stated in 2017 that Trump would face an epidemic crisis in 2020, was planned by NWO and dem players. Stop being stupid.
Apply to Dem Mayor De Blasio force institution where vulnerable elderly reside, 2 take known covid patients &amp; to Governors Newsom &amp; Northam. Trump took advice of HIH and CDC. Sweden did nothing &amp; had the same stats. Fauci says Trump saved lives. TG you r out of gov lib hack.

Trump is never prepared for anything. He has no idea what he’s looking at with those charts and I’d put money on it that this is the first time he’s seen them. I wish this wasn’t our fucking president 😔

Omg, I had to cover my mouth, he was on drugs or drunk , but my thing is ,he was sober enough to not hit the men that was following him and attacked that lady, what a sad cowardly punk, I hope he got arrested and he can call Trump.
Balls, this isnt the time to put out your Trump gear.
How you going to follow Trump, so you want get retired, when Trump is facing retirement......smh

Question to trump. Do you know why there's such a big push for mail in ballots.   Trump: democrats, crime, ICE, MS 13, post office isn't prepared, USPS loses money, there will be competitors to amazon.    Dr. Freud, we have an exsmple of free association  Ummm there's a pandemic
Dr. donald trump MD😊
“Donald trump bad vote Biden” I voted for you bernie. I am sorry but I won’t be voting for Biden. I’ll be voting green. Nothing anyone in the replies says will change my mind...they are wasting their time. They should get to phone banking for dementia Joe
I am confident Potus will win regardless of polling. Why don't they call or  text me to vote. Who are they polling?. Go Trump.
Idk, president Trump is the funniest, im not sure if anybody can beat the laughible president, im about to watch the bleach one now.
Trump is trying so hard to win reelection, probably because he knows what is awaiting him.
Is he starting with his companies? He has a lot of none Americans working for Trump hotels, etc. What a total lying hypocritical walking joke
yeah his a hypocrite! It’s so funny how the left will say something than if Trump agrees that they had him so much they will completely flip flop #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

Dr. Deborah Birx has been attacked by both President Trump and Speaker Pelosi and my faith in government erodes further every day.
I think it fits well with the strategy to just let Trump make mistakes. Joe's lead has been so big and consistent that as soon as he does something, even if it's good like a VP pick, it's going to put the focus on him (Joe) instead of on Trump being corrupt and evil.
We found out that Russia interfered in our last election and republicans had shoulder shrugs lol I’m surprised trump isn’t championing the app at this point.
And we aren’t playing in the two party system anymore. Good luck with trump.

Trump lost it by 3 million. The right hardly ever has majority support
You trump supporters should secede
“In 2016 trump won and he hasn’t lost any support this will be the same as 2016” famous last words
Lmao Literally Hillary got 3 million more votes then trump ( I didn’t vote for hillary) it’s just the truth. Your hopes like with the electoral college which Biden is poised to win.
Trump IS going to lose
I’m November. Trump is out. No landslide for him not at all. He never enjoyed the luxury of the popular vote. America is going to vote for Biden no matter what.
No just trump and his base. I hate them.
I can’t wait until trump loses so that you ducking trolls can go back to the cave you crawled out of.
Trump, trying to make people believe that there will be voter fraud. He tried this bullshit 2016. If any cheating is done its on Trump side and his buddy Putin

Victoria, Australia has 6.4 million people. Tennessee has 6.8 million people.  Victoria has 671 new cases, declared a state of disaster, curfews, and limits on movement.  Tennessee has 2,225 new cases. We're bringing back schools and football.  Yet Trump highlights Victoria.
Each state gets X amount of EC votes based on states population, higher the population the more EC votes you get. That was Clinton’s problem, she campaigned in large population states only, Trump went to all 50. He picked up the little states, it added up to beat her.
I have not. Hates Trump even then.
In order to get the states EC votes, the candidate MUST WIN that states POPULAR vote. Trump got the popular vote in 30 states.
Notre Dame withdraws as host of Sep 29 debate. Democrat Party officials urge Joe not to debate Trump because “he’ll lie.”  Right. 👌 okay....
If trump says something, pretty much it's a lie and a futile attempt to preserve himself. Something of that magnitude would be in the briefs.
The more trump is cornered where it is soooooo apparent that he is gonna lose, the more wacko some of his supporters will get as well. They can't handle it. With the mentally I'll you dont know what they will do. So, just be vigilant.
You think trump will win this November?
Biden isn’t exactly ahead in the polls because, people like him. He’s ahead because trump is a screw up. Biden has had this election handed to him on a silver platter. He has to put in zero work. And if he wins, he’ll change nothing. And we’ll be right back in the same spot!

Repeat after me:  I will support President Trump  I will not allow the media to tear down the USA.  I’ll call out any democrat for lying because it is so easy.  This election is life or death for this great nation. Democrats are killing people. Let’s get to work!
The longer they delay (VP, debates, policy, possible cabinet) the harder it is for the Trump campaign to develop a attack strategy. I don't think Biden nor whoever his VP is will ever see a debate stage
Because we don't have enough time to list all of his accomplishments.  We're Republicans...we have jobs!!🇺🇲Trump 2020 and beyond🇺🇲
You keep saying this shit yet you literally have made sure you reply to every tweet donald trump sends for the past 2 years INSTEAD of going to make the world a better place. You’re just as bad as him, at least he’s trying

What I’m not finna do is argue with a bitch in a “Re-elect TRUMP” tshirt. You’re ignorant. 😂
Trump won the popular vote in 30 out of 50 states. Try reading the constitution sometime!!
But what about when Joe Biden is saying that we need to re-elect Donald Trump??
Like the ignorant thought that Trump is linked with Putin when in reality it's Hillary and Dems that is tied to Putin! Why do you think they never did anything about him?

This guy had 40+ years to do that. Not one day he has achieved anything but swindle our money into his pockets with Obama, Clinton's, and Bush's. Also a pedophile like the rest. Keep your children away from this sicko geezer.  Trump &amp; JFK Jr 2020 Wait he sleepy Joe=dead!
Theft of our money for 55 years, by this crook was 40 of it. Reason why he is dead, treasonous acts is death penalty. Who is running this account needs to walk away before paying for the same price of fraud and false identity.   Trump &amp; JFK Jr 2020 Pence is Dead already!
How can a dead man tweet. Who is running this account. Of course won't be tweets from this pedophile dude, for when it comes to the light here soon. A dead man can't tweet!  Trump &amp; JFK Jr 2020
I don’t see trump supporters destroying cities that looks like you’re side is
I get you dont like him.. and yes, some of his policies were iffy, and he had his moments.  But to try to use the pedo thing to burn Obama and boost Trump is jus asinine, when Trump is under the same scrutiny, dating back decades and his dealings with Epstein.

Don’t you just love how an app could possibly determine the fate of this country. It’s so ridiculous. You should vote for who has this country in their best interest. If you vote against Trump just because he bans TikTok, that’s not right, and it’s stupid.
Easy Trump
This is insane, both McConnell and tRump have no money issues, no problem feeding their families, paying for housing yet they continue to deny the least of us the basic needs of life.  #DumpTrumpDayNov3 #DitchMitch #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy
Find it so amusing that trump is far more concerned about banning an app than containing covid
Libs aren’t going to vote trump out without mail in voting lmao. Hopeless.
Who cares fuck Biden and trump and all centrists. I’m voting green.
I probably need to join tiktok, just to see them rip Trump a new one........
Im a little confused, did I miss a whole 4 years, Trump won against Hillary.......He talks about Obama so much, almost makes you think he won against him, lol
Instead of using an executive order to require masks while in public or in stores Trump decides to ban Tik Tok instead of forcing masks
Trump is planning on banning tiktok as soon as Saturday... good thing I’m off to Germany soon 🥳😂
Trump is really going to ban TikTok because it’s hurting his feelings and campaign... we are turning more and more into a fascist country... get ready twitter is next because they are censoring his tweets
why is trump so scared of tik tok lmao
What the What!.....McConnell is in the same boat as Trump, what he look like telling other candidates to distance from Trump, we going to get rid of him to.

I am not surprise bc Obama is itching to go back to the white house. It does not matter cause Trump all the way.
I like that this article doesnt mention, that Trump wanted to extend the 600 , only for 1 week......
Only people Trump tricks is his voters, that 600 is a slap in our face for 1 week and a political ploy, what is 1 week, after that 1 week, they will be back to that 200 doller crap.
Im not sure about this, but I do know , we all got screwd by Trump, with him not taking action with covid from the beginning.

Yeah trump and Biden will not move left I know that’s why I’m not voting for them
Trump made heads explode today by asking a question about maybe delaying the election until people can vote in person...that question was directly aimed at Democrats that want mail-in voting and they took it hook, line and sinker🤣🤣🤣🤣
you know, I didn't realize that someone could be a bigger loser than Trump but you have done it. You have proved me wrong. Brad, you're a loser. And what the real kicker is is that you got fired by that loser. So yeah I think that makes you the bigger loser or The biggest loser
Hey what about the Trump pompeo Barr regime in the United States?
Trump knows there won't be a delay..he's playing you fools
The reason for all this crap is Trump is draining the swam and it will soon hit them very hard. OH! Ya Epstein killed himself, if you believe that you're not using your brainpower, Hill hit squad, just follow the money. Like what did Bill do on his island fish or talk about ???
Remember Dems blame Trump 4 things they did or do like he is dividing the country when if U R stupid U think that but smart people know the truth. Like Russia spent $100,000.00 on FaceBook adds 2 influence our vote, so how many votes did it get him one, two. Hill paid $4million.
Is it just me but I think these polls are fake and the News know it that is way as we get closer to election day they will move Trump closer to make it look neck &amp; neck yet they know Trump is in the lead but Tv want the viewers

It cannot happen as he has no control, but trump is testing his base for other evil actions to follow.
Since trump is not going to be there in January let’s vote for James Mackler  an not put another Moscow Marsha in office. Come on Tennessee use your brains. Put a man in office that will help Tennessee

I'm not a polling expert but if the Kelly vs McSally polls are right, it's hard to see Trump winning here just because Kelly seems so popular, McSally seems so unpopular (she's already lost the last election), and the splits to vote Kelly (D) and Trump (R) would have to he high.
Lathan is capping  We all know his favorite Trump is
That is sad. Poor man believed in trump and cost him his life. As many others are. 150,000 dead.
Herman Cain arrogant attitude killed him. Didn't he say the virus was a hoax. Trump just provided the place
Pence and the others are using Trump. If their coats catch on fire watch how fast they will pull a Joe McCarthy on his ass. Self preservation is a bitch
Not really, always Trump first

Delay the election because of the pandemic. That's a good one, considering we are in this mess because having Trump as President during a pandemic put us in this mess.  Over 150 thousand + deaths so far
Herman Cain, Mr 999 Republican presidential candidate has died from COVID-19. He attended the rally in OK, the no mask rally. Good thing Trump had everyone sign a waiver not holding him responsible for sickness and death. Money can't save U from this virus
25A your friend and savior trump.
Trump is floating the idea of delay election because of his so-called mail in voter fraud. WTF? He, some of his staff, daughter Ivanka, Jared all mailed in their voting ballot. Did they try to cheat &amp; found this wasn’t a good idea? I am counting the days U FAKE PRESIDENT

Too bad the fact that they happened to run in the same circle for a while doesn’t make Trump a frequent flyer on the airline or visitor to the island.  You have to do better.
Living off social security for the emotionally disturbed and living in the basement of any relative who could actually tolerate being near him. That’s the best case scenario. The worst is Trump would be doing time for pedophilia...
Stop the insanity #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica Trump is doing great things even now during the #ChinaVirus

Hey! If you follow me on Twitter, I have one thing to say:  Fuck.  Bitch.   Fuck. Donald. Trump. Bitch.  Hey, ANYONE I KNOW THAT SUPPORTS THIS MAN:  FUCK. YOU.
If you listen to the broadcast they want to blame trump for how Governors hankdevthier states with the virus. Blame the right person. No one can do what Trump has done with big Pharma. Or the insurance companies. No one has ever done it!!!!!
Also Trump has complained about how CBS NEWS  has covered him while talking to  So if Nora is on the list it's to give her a hard time It's his MO to try to "get back" at her
Later that same night  commended Paula for the way she questioned Trump and didn't let up Nora seemed happy about it
There was a press conference where   questioned Trump "in your face" way about the way he handled the virus especially in February Trump didn't answer the questions
Trump used to pal around with Epstein and theirs plenty of proof of it. Maher doesn’t even mention it.
My aunt just said “Trump is worse than cancer.” This woman beat breast cancer....twice.
It's not the real Trump.
Someone please tell Trump he does not "have to go through" it.
So... Trump replaced Obamacare...with Obamacare.  I have no idea how to react to this
Even if they did, they do not care. They are all in on it. The swamp is overflowing and his cult laps it up while the "maskless players" laugh at them. Trump and all his cronies along with his cult represent the worst examples of humanity. They are vampires feasting on US.
Pre-existing conditions were covered with Obamacare. Trump dismantled that part and brings it back so you’ll think he did something good. This guy is a piece of work. 🤦🏻‍♂️
When Trump gets reelected, he's going scorched earth on these Communist.

I would literally take anyone over Trump at this point. Biden's not perfect, but he'll be a far better president than Trump could ever be. (Not that Trump sets the bar that high, but still).
They asked Weatherly to resign as provost over his anti trump video.
In the field of 15 candidates, Hagerty was the only one endorsed by President Trump.   Hagerty reminded supporters last night his election in November isn’t the only one he was focused on and that re-electing President Trump was another main goal.
Bill Hagerty told supporters at his event in Gallatin last night he spoke with President Trump on the phone backstage before he came out on stage.   Hagerty thanked Trump, calling him an “inspiration.”

I agree with you, except, we’ve not seen that to be true. Trump and the GOP have gotten away with everything so far.
Trump doesn’t need anybody to sabotage him, he does very well himself. #UnfitForOffice #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsALaughingStock

Oh honey, the only hits the Bible and God are taking is from Trump;  Porn Star.  Adult Film Actress.  Infidelity.  Alleged Rape.  Bank Fraud. (that’s 5 that I remembered, did I pass my cognitive test?)
The thought of Biden being President scares me to death!  You will win in November  President Trump!  God chose you!  Praise God for you  President Trump!
Let's be honest-- Kanye West is not the first candidate with a mental illness that the  is taking advantage of. They did it with Trump and now they're doing it again.
Without evidence other than unnamed "sources," Israeli journalist makes dramatic accusations against administration he obviously loathes. Sounds exactly like the partisan crap our own #FakeNews is always throwing at President Trump.
Have people not learned from 2016 that polls and projections don’t matter? Like ima end up being blamed for trump winning again because I vote for third party, because the silent Trump voter will come out again. Polls always skew to the left.

I beg to differ. From where I sit “Never Trump” is synonymous with “Never Republican” ever again. Your father was a great man whom I hold in high regard, but the rest of GOP are nothing but stinky trash. They are nothing because they hurt regular people in USA.

Will not be voting for Mitt (Bill) Hagerty in November he’s a fraud he’s Mitt Romney’s lunch buddy who will be worse for this state than Bob Corker and Cousin Lamar combined. But you folks who voted for him just because Trump endorsed him ( even though he backed Jeb Bush in 2016)
The new executive order bans TikTok – and chat tool WeChat – under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.
And to insist otherwise—that Trump was correct in saying “Thigh”—is asinine. What’s next? Defending Trump’s pronunciation of Uruguay as “You’re-a-Gay”?
Trump will always Double down on dumb! Double down on what’s absolutely wrong! Because doubling down is all he knows. Try being a leader that can admit a mistake &amp; be  empathetic &amp; compassionate. Be able to bring people together not tear them apart! Trump is incapable of it all!
1️⃣ Even if that were the case, Trump immediately corrected himself. None of this was a big deal, but then Dinesh and others had to rush in and say “no, he was right the first time, lol you faux sophisticated.”
Trump had a showy executive order signing ceremony on TV ("Look at me, I'm doing something!"), but hasn't published the text of the last order.  Basically Big Pharma's response is, "OK whatever."  🤡

It’s only for trump &amp; it costs $130,00 each time you go there.
Trump is doing more to get tik tok banned than he is to #SaveTheChildren
He's even worse than Trump.
Not really, but these are a couple of reasons why Trump is President.
Expect a court challenge to this order. Trump may not have the authority to do this.
The supreme irony is that Biden is a lifelong believer while there is no reason to believe the Trump has ever believed in or prayed.. to any god.  I must admit that I don't believe either. But I do believe in practicing kindness &amp; empathy for all, even Trump. Too bad he doesn't.
Um, I don’t buy your professed concern for the fate of our nation under 4 more years of a Trump administration.    If you truly believe in the dangers you list in your piece, you’d never ever play games with your vote. We need a landslide regardless of VP.
Funny trump supporters say my no vote is going to biden. 🤷🏿‍♂️
"Thank you for being the inspiration to me, President Trump," said Bill Hagerty after learning he'd won the Republican nomination for a Tenn. US Senate seat. Watch his full speech here:
And would have been more hopeful had Biden closed with “my faith teaches that even our enemies carry the divine image. My faith teaches to love and pray for our enemies, not disparage them. I encourage my supporters to join me in earnestly praying for Donald Trump.”
He stabs all his supporters in the back without even trying. Trump is that good of a back stabber. THE BEST!
Trump issued an executive order that would ban TikTok and WeChat from operating in the US in 45 days if they are not sold by their Chinese-owned parent companies. THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT! 🤦🏻‍♂️
No he’s not! He worked against the Trump campaign in 2016. He worked for the Jeb Bush campaign, then when Bush dropped out he backed Rubio. He’s a deep swamp Rino.
A new executive order could spell the end of TikTok in the US.
I voted for Bradshaw and I'm really glad a competent progressive won the primary,  but Tennessee is a *hard* red state. I'm pretty sure a bumper sticker with "trump 2020" on it would beat the best democrat in this state. I'd love to be wrong tho

Put a sock in it Levin.  The right person won.  Remember the disaster that happened in Alabama when the Trump endorsed candidate lost.
Hagerty’s TV adds were dirty lies. I will hold my nose in November and vote for him. He’s a Rino, hopefully he doesn’t follow his buddy Mittens Never Trump ways.  Dr. Manny was the true Conservative.

You could go to a grade school and randomly select a kid that would be more competent &amp; mature than Trump.
Trump sucks up to Putin while he pays terrorists to kill US soldiers. Trump has killed 155k+ citizens with his inaction, anti-science conspiracy theories, and incompetence. Anyone supporting Trump wants America to fail.
If you vote for Trump you should have to get it first.
His impressions are all pretty accurate, and he's adorable too.  I love when he switches in between Trump, Obama, and Bernie, and he does so flawlessly
Postal service has been fine for almost 50 years, Trump gets involved a few months and ruins it. Someone should tell him it isn’t a casino.
tRump won't be there
Mackler is the only hope of flipping that seat and it’s not looking likely he’ll make it. Mackler-Sethi would have been a solid race. The way it’s looking now, Hagerty is a couple million $$ in Trump-kissing ads away from Capitol Hill. Won’t even be a contest with Bradshaw
We didn’t know what a hot mess Trump was going to be then.
OH and WHO is pushing kids to go back to school in the middle of this deadly pandemic which is ALREADY backfiring? Trump and  politicians. You plan on restructuring American life on the deaths of our kids?  C'mon Kevin, What else you got? You vapid, America hating POS.
Errol Barnett's comment to Joe Biden was really unnecessary. Our Country is in trouble and we don't need him doing Trump's dirty work. Joe Biden is too intelligent for the question he asked. Maybe he's in the wrong job. Who in the hell hired him!  #smdh

Evangelical/Baptist leaders publicly torched and tried to oust Russell Moore when he criticized Trump's dehumanizing and abhorrent behavior.  I've been checking to see if the same guys have any critiques for Jerry Falwell Jr's scandalous and reckless behavior.  🦗 🦗 🦗
Pretty scathing (and accurate) assessment of President Trump and his reelection chances. Why can't we get even halfway decent major party presidential candidates anymore? We absolutely need another viable choice.
I am trying to understand why you hate Pres Trump so much.  We thought you were a Republican.  Are you?  If you are then stand up for the President.  If not then get out of the GOP and become a Democrat.
Oh, you meant Trump. Yea, him too.
UH OH TIME  Trump just named a NEW SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and it's causing quite the ruckus in the kitchen because it's THE CAKE BOSS.  Looks like his first act will be bombing.......*spins wheels*  Tunisia!
Lmao imagine voting for Mitt Hagerty think he’s a Trump guy when he supported Jeb Bush in 2016, is pals with Mitt Romney. Congratulations you played yourself.

These are the days, my friend. This breach of trust must end. We won’t get rid of Trump with votes alone. We need to interrupt, Defy and then obstruct. The marketplace is the real combat zone.
You can believe what you want. The bottom line on you Never-Trumpers is, you 'are' sometimes socialistic, Marxist assholes in wanting to side with the leftist DemonRATs. Today's Democrats are no longer the same as what they once were.  Trump isn't a conservative. Neither are you.
You completely missed the point. Just because the Pope is the leader doesn't mean that all Catholics question his religion. Just the GOP supporters.  I suppose they don't question tRump's lack of any religion at all.

I wonder why they couldn’t figure it out and fix it before Trump stepped in!?
True, and neither is talk radio. But the point is that the callers are listeners to the station that carries Rush Limbaugh and are presumably strong Trump supporters, and yet they are not taking his advice on who to vote for. The wider electorate may be even less likely to do so.
If this holds up in the actual election, Hagerty's scorched earth campaign style will have backfired, just as I've predicted. People here really don't like Hagerty's flimsy accusations that sound as bogus as what the Dems have been throwing at Trump.
I just don't see the Trump-Biden debates happening. Something will go down that'll stop it. Biden is gonna make a complete ass out of himself if they do happen, no way he can last 90 minutes with Trump. The democrats know his mind is about gone #Trump2020Landslide
Hopeful sign for  Sethi: Knoxville talk radio host Hallerin Hill sounding shocked that so many callers are backing Dr. Sethi and not Hagerty. Hill trying to question callers' support of Trump, and all are insisting that they are still for Trump, just not Hagerty!
Black Lives Matter is a racist organization that promotes Marxism and wants to end the nuclear family.  Why would Trump want to support an anti American organization
Not to mention Trump has 25 sexual assault cases against him, talks about dating his own daughter and has been accused of rape more than once. But sure, vote for him because he is not pro-choice. That makes him the better candidate to Christians right? 🙄
I called it. Left wing Twitter removed Clinton Foundation quick and replaced it with Trump killing Seniors 🙄 Twitter is shit

Stores should identify as supermarkets,  Churches as casinos,  Trump rallies as antifa protests,  No maskers as undercover cops,  Funerals as TV covered memorials for politicians.  Gun shops as "autonomous zones"   and bars need to identify as restaurants.

Is was better than seeing tRump talk about the test. It was a test about mental health.
Biden his policies are antichrist. I get it you don't like Trump the person but the policies head and shoulder over Democratic secular humanist antichrist policies. I hope your dad forgave before he met the Lord because you seem to walk in his footsteps of unforgiveness....
Trump stole from the GOP coffers to build his wall. We're all sorry that they can't control their dog. That's not a problem for the American people. Seems they have more to lose by not yielding.
Trump goes on wild, desperate rant in Cleveland claiming that Biden (a practicing Catholic) will “Take away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns.” 🙄
Trump's god is "power and wealth". He might worship the god of Abraham now because somebody said it was the most powerful, but he would worship whatever deity is the best.  He would switch gods in a heartbeat if it was an upgrade, promising a better Heaven.
Dear Republic Party leaders:  So why are you using it to protect Trump's hotel and increase defense spending?

The Republicans are trying to give Covid19 affected Americans relief with stimulus package checks and unemployment benefits extending at least 3 more months. The DEMONCRATs are stopping it from happening because the think it will hurt Trump. Who would hate Santa Claus???????????
For shit’s sake. The projection here is astounding, even now, even for him. What’s truly terrifying, though, is that in 30 seconds he said all some voters need to hear, veracity aside. So many of Trump’s EO’s have failed under constitutional scrutiny...
Mfers chose the only two people donald trump would beat in back to back elections lmaooooooo
What case? You didn't say anything that justified Trump ignoring Russia putting out bounties on American troops. "War good" is not an argument. But yeah, we're done here.

Everyone knows Trump will win the debate. It'll be embarrassing for Biden.

45 more days of tik tok according to Trump haha
Yes i did read it. That’s not true. Nowhere in there does it address my question. Just more attacks on Trump when he has ALWAYS supported legal immigrants so this book is not in sharp contrast.
Trump supporters are not burning the Bible in the streets.
Was it Trump sending covid patients into nursing homes? No. It was Cuomo, Whitmore, and a few other democrat governors. Whitmore is STILL doing it!
I think Biden should give a similar speech but say that if you re-elect Trump ice cream will be illegal. Trump hates babies. You won’t be able to ride bikes or watch TV...
How about that ! President Trump got their attention. TVA rescinds decision to outsource technology jobs
You forgot to add the option of “MS-13 Loving Joe Biden” like the survey put out by the official Trump campaign.
That’s ridiculous, I might live in TN but they are a bunch of redneck Trump supporters here, damn shameful 🤬
Lie lie and lie some more, keep trump  in office he will kill all of us, we won’t need police or guns we’ll all be DEAD 💀
and on top of that, our “president” responds to this by saying, “it is was it is.” fuck donald trump.
“Hurt the Bible. Hurt...God.” There was a strange pause in his speech. As if even he couldn’t believe what he was about to say, or that he wanted to say “Trump” instead.
That’s the same meaning. I thought maybe he started by saying, “I’m not going to make any insane accusations like...” So in fact that’s exactly what Trump said.
Latitia James ran on an anti Trump  platform. She is just another person with TDS who can't accept his presidency.

Democrats have STILL not learned that President Trump says things to get people to react. He gets them off their ass and gets them to do their jobs.  Its like when your wife asks you to do something and then says fine I'll do it and grabs your tools....
Maybe Trump should try posting only accurate information?
I don't watch Hannity. If you knew anything about filming, you would know the psychology of shots. The interviewer kept interrupting when Trump would make a point. The majority of you don't research anything, you just listen to what the media says to you.

Medically retired. You really want to go there? Trump has been harder on Putin then Obama was. And you follow the democrat party, which could be argued is worse than the nazi party bc of their history of slavery and racism.
Funny how Trump is actually showing his fascist tendencies but you are worried about Biden.  is the only real choice.
I do think Trump could have done better on the interview, but the interviewer did a horrible job. You let the person answer before you start another line of questions. The interviewer didn't care about the answers, just how he could spin it. Biden wouldn't do as well as Trump.
Trump stole Make America Great Again from Reagan or older Klan pictures and we don’t need to go into Melania’s theft of Michelle Obama’s speech.   Everyone associated with this administration steals, lies or grifts (or all three)
And 31% probably think Trump did just fine in that Swan interview...

Trump is not a leader. He is not someone that others should look up to or aspire to be. He has normalized this kind of talk &amp; behavior for the last 3 years and we as a nation are worse for it for allowing him to get away with it. His supporters continue to support and uplift him
He makes everything about himself. When asked about John Lewis’ legacy, Trump points out that Lewis didn’t come to his inauguration???? Why is that relevant? A man who has devoted his life to civil rights is gone and that’s all you can muster?
If Biden is such a tough guy as he says why is scared to Debate Trump, If not man enough to Debate  Trump not man enough to be President
Is Trump reading all this charts upside-down? Is he really so clueless or does he think Americans are?
I’m surprised Trump took that interview. He won’t make that mistake again! 😂
Imagine how Trump would complain if he got Covid.  “Nobody knew it could be so bad.” “No one has suffered as badly as me.”

Honestly at this point I wonder if being convicted of fraud would even stay in the news for more than a day. Would Trump lose ANY of his current supporters?
Kind of ironic since Trump has hired so many foreigners to work at his hotels, golf resorts and winery.
Does this also apply to when Trump was criticizing Obama for golfing?
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
It was GREAT! It covered every American with better coverage for less money! *checks notes* Sorry...that was what Trump promised BEFORE he was elected back in 2016 and the plan turned out to be no plan at all.  So now, 4 years later...?
I guess that Trump thinks he should get a cut because his threats brought the price down?
Putin couldn’t have said it better. He must be pinching himself. He’s watching America implode and Americans will die in even larger numbers. This blood will be on Trump’s hands.
Kinda awkward to do a remodel while Biden is measuring the drapes... I bet Trump plans one more giant skim. What does he plant to get off the top of that...$300 million?

Yeah I’m sure this is right because the whole world of governments love Trump so much right?  U can’t have it both ways.  We all know they are terrified of a Biden presidency don’t we?  Of course not. He is the best friend of America’s enemies.

Full Fledged BBQ.  Everything Trump can manipulate he will to win re-election.

But seriously, it’s hard to imagine who the springboard candidates are without Trump in office—we don’t get Gov. DeSantis (who was until recently, and may soon again, be a viable candidate), b/c no Trump endorsement matters. Haley is just an unknown SC Gov, etc.
But not by Trump’s Storm Troopers...
Hmm...Tucker “white nationalist” Carlson doesn’t like Obama bringing politics into the funeral of a politician? Meanwhile Trump skipped the funeral, did not visit John Lewis’s wake, flew the flag at half-staff for a day and barely mentioned his death.

If  is the demise of Tic Toc, each and every one of her Trump impersonations will have been worth it. What a treasure. Keep um coming!! Trump is such a wuss.
I trust what I see and I trust the testimony of church leaders and aggrieved victims, Trump has sinned and while it is not my place to judge his soul it is the place of the church to call out his sin in hope that he repents, yet he shows no desire to do so.
While we all stumble and fall and God is gracious it is important that we acknowledge our failures and attempt to make amends. But for Trump I have never once seen anything remotely near an apology or even sign of sincere regret, he seems to think he is always in the right.

But in this time please remember the warning of Ephesians, “Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.” I call out Trump not in hate but to expose darkness so it might be vanquished.

TIK TOK ORDER: President Trump issued an executive order yesterday barring U.S. companies from doing business with ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.
I’m not sure how those are worldly? I am a theologian and there are plenty of people who need help more than Trump. I wasn’t saying not to pray for Trump, only to remember our first duty is to God and to “the least of these”
Homeless man is asked to vote for Trump......
We are dying out here Pete! What Donald J. Trump and the GOP are doing is beyond tragedy.
I only like 5 people... and Trump happens to be one of them.
Democratic leaders launched a last-ditch effort to revive collapsing Washington talks on vital COVID-19 rescue money, summoning Trump administration negotiators to the Capitol on Friday in hopes of generating progress.
...elevate Trump to a special status as a hero of the faith despite him being a poor example of Christian living and a Christian truths. My faith is from both academic training and real life experience.
At an election polling location yesterday, I literally heard folks (yes, plural) say that the coronavirus will disappear right after the election if the Democrats win. They strongly believe that this event is being exaggerated to ruin Trump. Where do you suppose they got that?

You’re right, he’s not a religious leader but it concerns me how many religious people seem to trust his word. Our duty is to the church and Christ first and foremost and from what I’ve seen Trump is not a good example of what a Christian should be.

Great job President Trump.
it is trump v max headroom!!!
So what is your take on Biden's OBVIOUS racist comment from yesterday?? And then to try and explain what he actually meant and not even BOTHER to APOLOGIZE??? If Trump had said what Biden had said YOU WOULD BE RELENTLESSLY yelling at Trump. You're nothing but a hypocrite......
Also, let’s say Biden wins. Is he now God’s choice? Will you give him the same support you give Trump?
Are you siding with Nebuchadnezzar? Do you think Bonhoeffer should’ve let Hitler be? It is our duty to call out evil and injustice, just as Jesus called out the Pharisees. And how exactly is Trump delivering us from Satan,

Under Donald Trump’s Stable Leadership We Are Achieving Nuclear Stability in The World
Lol you people are so stupid. 2016 happened because they were sick of democratic politicians destroying this country with thier socialist views. They picked Hilary..the worst person possible to run for president. Trump was selected because there was no one better. Nothing w fb.
It is his base that are the poorer, less educated class, many of whom have not left their home states. That is why it is so easy to for Trump to dupe them, &amp; perhaps also why one of his few defenders is a dimwitted convicted felon who falls for easily disproved conspiracies. 3/3
Uh, no... Trump is white trash in an ill-fitting suit. He cheated his way into and thru college, he's prob not a billionaire (that disclosure is why he's fighting so hard to keep his taxes secret), and he's flown a lot, but had few travel experiences. He's a grifter. 1/3
Actually, we have a pretty good idea; Trump became involved in money laundering for several Russian oligarchs. To the tune of 2 billion a year. All oligarchs can only function with Putin's approval.   Trump has to toe the line Putin or his illegal actions become public knowledge.
Here's another thing I don't want to say. I've seen many people ask (unqualified) how could we reelection Trump, but if voters link Portland etc. violence to Biden, then they'll likely vote against him. Every election has a broad context.
Ex FBI Lovers Lisa and Peter said 100M to zero for Hilary C, but Trump is in the White House. It’s really BS!
“... in terms of physical size.”  is correct about that. Biden isn’t obese and doesn’t move around like Bigfoot.   FYI, we prefer Joe precisely because doesn’t behave like Trump. Trump is a mistake this country cannot remedy fast enough.
The GOP...  Is backing to the hilt Donald J. Trump. This tells me that they have NO other possible candidate in the whole country. This, to me, is a sure sign of the GOP being totally out of touch with the American people.   If the GOP is so crippled, and blind, who needs them.
Authoritarian,  ultranationalism , characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, as well as strong regimentation of society.  trump embodies fascism. Wake up.
Trump Will Lose in 2020
...Point being it’s unfair to claim God made Trump president, fallen man made Trump president just as we have every other, its a consequence of the fall that were often left to our own devices. But the beauty of God is he can work through our chaos to bring about his will.
So true. Nobody has ever done Mass murder as our CIC. 160,000 dead from the trump virus... 300,000 projected dead by December 2020.  You want US to re-elect you!?
I’m sorry you feel this way, but whatever your thoughts on me remember not to put all your faith in Trump, he is just a man and our loyalty is to Christ and the church before all others. I forgive you for your harsh words and may God bless you in whatever the future may hold.
I will run for office in the next couple years, but not sure I have any desire to be in Washington given its current state of dysfunction.  My point really is that our state is mimicking Washington. Politicians are getting older and older. I.e. Trump-Pelosi-McConnell-Schumer..
You think Trump's doing a good job?
We're not voting for Trump, that's for sure. #Biden2020
1,248 Coronavirus dead yesterday. A projected 300,000 dead by December. Donald Trump is a wonderful leader alright.
This whole tik tok thing Trump is doing  Lacks any real substance and is simply Trump playing to his GOP koolaide gang.

REST IN PEACE:  Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, will be mourned at a private funeral in Atlanta on Friday.
Washington talks on vital COVID-19 rescue money are teetering on the brink of collapse after a marathon meeting in the Capitol generated lots of recriminations but little progress on the top issues confronting negotiators.
As a theologian it’s important to remember that our country is not the new Israel, we are not God’s chosen nation. In the grand scheme of God’s plan, our country’s survival is not as important as our care towards the vulnerable who need our prayers and support more than Trump.

you spent months telling us it was on the way out there were only 15 cases and it was all under control. You still keep lying about the state of this virus in this country and you have failed every single American in your lack of care an effort to control the TRUMP VIRUS,
HAPPENING TODAY: Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, will be mourned at a private funeral in Atlanta on Friday.
I'd bet anything that if you'd do a tiny bit of research, you could easily find at least 100 statements from Trump that are far more insulting. Get real. That's all he does is attack, insult, divide, and get mad when he's asked any question that he doesn't like. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Kanye's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country, fueling suspicions he's being pushed to run by allies of President Trump hoping to siphon support away from Joe Biden.
I don't think you've been paying attention. I'm also an independent, but I def know our country was in better shape before Trump took office. It def wasn't nowhere near as divided as it is now. 99% of DT's Twitter page is basically trying to divide the people anyway he can.
I generally don’t have to assume bc where I’m from they’re almost always accompanied by a Confederate flag the same size, or a sticker on a window or bumper, or a Trump flag. *sigh*
Judging from the tenor of the comments, maybe Twitter isn't the best medium for a serious discussion.  I respect your position but I believe Trump is a bigger existential threat. It's actually hard to imagine how much more moral degradation another 4 years brings.
Don’t count on it. Hagerty is a trump wannabe. Won’t he be surprised when trump is voted out?!

STIMULUS TALKS STALLED: President Trump and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met at the White House Thursday night, searching for a way forward on vital COVID-19 rescue money. This as concerns mount that negotiations with Democrats might collapse.
This is a bs take and an excuse to vote Trump. A pile of glitter covered dog crap on the street of New York with a US flag stuck in it for festivities could be his VP pick amd the dog crap would be a better than Trump. It would cost us less as well as dog crap doesn't golf.
It is the Leftist Democrats who become enraged when conservatives, Republicans, or Trump supporters speak.  Cancel culture is the Democrats trying to silence opposing positions.  I would rather debate than silence people with bad ideas.
TVA reverses tech job decision after President Trump threatened more board firings.  This will save several local jobs.

so nice of trump to include ample time before the tiktok ban order goes into action so that all the lawsuits can pop in first
I'm an atheist and it even pissed Me off...... There is no bottom of the barrel for Trump. Let his poll numbers slip a little more and he'll be claiming that you barbeque live babies to serve at satanic rituals in your basement.
I'm pretty sure Q has a all of the military intelligence we could possibly need. As much as I hate to say it, there has to be a back up plan if something were to happen to Trump. I dont trust Pence, but he was in 2 wrecks in ONE day. Come on.

Quit being stupid. We cannot survive 4 more years of Trump.
If Sethi would have won, I certainly would have voted for him. However, I do support our president so wanted his choice and a fellow Tennessean to win.
I work in 11 of Georgia’s counties and the number of signs I see for Trump are astounding - I am not counting a single chicken until December 1
50% would be the worst performance among white people for a Republican presidential candidate since 1992, when Ross Perot split the GOP vote.  In other words, resounding, historic collapse of Trump’s support in the GOP’s base.
Please provide some examples of how Trump is racist. Saying you heard it on CNN doesn't count.
He looks like an egg with a face painted on it.  He banged a stripper and tried to unbang her by slipping a plan b pill in her smoothie.  He's exactly the type of person to defend Trump.
It sounded much more racist than any comment Trump has ever made. Stop being an apologist for a racist, demented, groper. Hold your own to the same standards.
Because that has NEVER happened to Trump?😂
My father was a Republican. I adored my father, too. But we have to accept what reality is now. The GOP is Donald Trump now. They are dead.
You have not accepted the fact that the GOP has bottom-trolled for so long that it allowed Donald Trump to happen.   He is the end product of turning a blind eye to racism and sexism. The trade off was votes.   Your father was a good man. The GOP is not his party anymore.
I have to wonder how many people who vote for Trump are just trying to live a vicarious existence.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States is reinstating a 10% import tax on Canadian aluminum, raising tensions with an American ally just weeks after his trade pact with Canada and Mexico took effect.

Perhaps you might suggest wearing mask from the beginning. Trump suggested that from that day one. The left gunned that idea down immediately on the advice of Fauchi. Mask only became an issue after Fauci changed the rules. The best manager is already in place.
Trump is the 70 something old man who struggles to read and is not patriotic enough to know how to pronounce our national parks. Most likely has never been in one.
No facts to back this up. But she refuses to look into Trump’s ties to Russian money.
Most likely not. Those who elect to live in mom’s basement wouldn’t have 5 grand. As for Trumps mismanagement, what would you have done? Banned travel to and from China? Trump did that and you dear leftist nut job Nancy held a demonstration in Chinatown to protest it.
Better check out Putin and Trump’s relationship. And how much money the Trumps have gotten over the years from the Russians.
Hard to believe, but this means one out of every two white males I meet support this dumbass.
Trump is so beholden to Putin. That’s the corruption and the treason.
I try to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, we'll come out on the other side of this awful administration finally willing to confront the problem of executive power. This is as much true for liberals (and some leftists) as it is for conservatives.
My Zoomer kids both ordered tickets to Tulsa to troll Trump. They also like Sarah Cooper and SNL.

If they had something on trump the deep state who own Deutsche Bank would have already obtained his records. Come on now. The IRS has seen his info every year and you best believe those returns have been combed over.
Great piece by  on the sad state of affairs in my home state
Point is, Trump is not on a murderous rampage. That’s a lie. Cuomo put covid patients in nursing homes with the elderly. Did Trump do that? NY accounts for over 50,000 of the deaths.
Why don’t we just shut down your account too? Seem fair?Why don’t we just trample all over your first amendment right? Think about your stance on this the next time you call Trump a fascist.
Who’s the deep state? The FDA is ran by a Trump appointee named Stephen Hahn they are the ones who banned it as a treatment for Covid so how does the “deep state” influence the use of the drug?
Trump doesn’t support abortion. Abortion kills over 1 million every year. That’s the immortal stance of the Dems. That’s your murderous rampage.

True!
I haven't got around to signing up for Gab and whatever. But if Trump quit Twitter and moved to another platform, I would sign up immediately. #Twitter #Jack #trumptweets #gab
Twitter is going to ban the most powerful person?  They better watch it.  It's not just Trump that wants to slap regulations on them.  Congress, as a whole, wants to do that.  It would serve them right though.
Trump tomorrow: I’m announcing today that my administration will sell Twitter to the Chinese in exhange for dirt on Joe Biden.    Republicans: that sounds reasonable. 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
Good to see lying ⁦ is not going to be able to mislead the American people once again. #Trump needs to go in November! Kick the bum out!
Lol.. What's so phony about my Twitter page? You don't like my photo? I don't know what makes you think I support abortion; I DO know that Donald Trump pretends he's a Christian, and you support him.  I hate America? I'm a desert storm vet.🤡
This is hilarious. President Trump, Impeached, will never turn the corner, he will never change. Wake up America.      #TrumpIsALaughingStock #SaveYourself #ItIsWhatItIs

You're referring to trump I presume.
Jeez. Again? Are you secretly a dem trying to kill off trump supporters? If not, wear a damn mask. Also, it takes up to 2 weeks to test positive. Ugh
All statements of trump or our government doing Jack all about the Coronavirus is pure propaganda.  We are still at SQUARE ONE!

I don't know why he allows it,,maybe because we all get such a Kick out of it?  😂🤣❤Trump!
except, of course, it's a pandemic. Of Course, he can always stroll across the street at do it at Trump International, highlighting the AMAZING restoration he did there.

didn't vote for Trump in 2016. will be voting for him in 2020. you people are crazy.
This is so sad &amp; infuriating that at the very least these families can't get answers from the state. Gov Cuomo sentenced these elderly Americans to death with his unnecessary executive order. NY never ran out of hospital beds thanks to President Trump &amp; thousands went unused!

Trump Admin took over the official counting of cases bypassing the CDC.  We know   and  are playing with the numbers.  What happens when kids and teachers die, it’s found out that numbers were manipulated? Can they be charged with murder? #TrumpFailedAmerica
Kills me how people comment on a story without reading it.  I'm against "mandated" masks. Hers was anti-police (F-12). Guess the powers that be didn't think thru possible messaging. I proudly wear my Trump 2020 mask unless going out to eat. Afraid of "additives." Dems!
There should be no debates unless there is serious fact checking on the verbal diarrhea that #Trump dishes out! Also let ⁦ release his taxes first. - Trump campaign seeks early September presidential debate - Axios
Yesssssss!!!!!!! Atleast they won't be fake like Congress did in 2019.  We ALL know Trump never does wrong and Dems ALWAYS does wrong.
Zuck and Trump teaming up to kill TikTok in USA!
Yes, Trump is doing all the right things. They just hate, hate, hate.
Damn right they did and should have done more, like arrest Trump and his entire campaign before the election.
Nope, That's Obama and all his crimes. They'll be in PRISON where they all belong. Soon all that is against Trump will be either thrown out or bailed. Then only then will we be truly free and what our forefathers meant us to be.
EXACTLY!? Trump is going after all the corrupt demons. They need to DEAL WITH IT. Finally have a President that is honest, loving,and won't put up with any wrong doing from anyone. Greatest man to ever live.
And that's what Obama did. Trump has never done ANYTHING wrong.
Yes, you are the only one that can bring law and order to America. You're so honest capable and a true PATRIOT. YOU ARE THE BEST EBER. Trump FOEVER. 😍😍😍😍😍😍 SO PROUD TO BE AMERICAN!.

Where did ALL the PPE come from that Trump sent to China in what, March?
That the guy killed many while Trump is saving us. But you Dems are obstructing our great leader.
Yes, He's a MM URDERER. Trump is working hard 24/7 to save us. He loves America and Americans and will only do what is right. Dens are the ones killing people not Trump.
Trump is the most incompetent, corrupt man alive.
Ok and Trump has already offered assistance as has Israel. Are you going to start fundraising for them (yourself) like you did for Haiti? BTW they’re still waiting.
NEW: U.S. officials said Wednesday there is no indication the massive explosion in Lebanon that killed at least 100 people was an attack, contradicting President Trump who said American generals told him it was likely caused by a bomb.
UPDATE: President Trump said Wednesday he's considering delivering his Republican convention acceptance speech from the White House after his initial plans to hold the event in 2 battleground states were foiled by coronavirus concerns &amp; health restrictions
Probably because they don't want to waste their time on vague, broad accusations from a senator who was never actually elected, but on specific, real problems. Like the out of control pandemic that Trump doesn't even seem to understand. You and the GOP have enabled this disaster.
NEW: "Why the hell would I take a test?" Joe Biden is pushing back at Republican assertions that he should take a cognitive test to disprove President Trump's claim that the Democrat isn't fit for the Oval Office.

Yes, Trump Should Do This
Hahaha of course abc tried to flip in on trump. 4 years every day negative on trump and you couldn’t let joe have one negative story without tossing trump in it
did not cover it for one second if trump said that it would be a week solid coverage. Very good tools to show friends how completely bias the media is.
Nice a liberal telling blacks they never really votes for trump. All liberals do is see a black person for a vote.

Help President Trump and get our Democracy and freedom back. People want to come to America because we have the freedom to say and do what we want for or family. If you try that in a Socialist Country you will go to jail or be killed.
It is time for Americans to wake up. The Democratic Party has done nothing to help Americans. President Trump has brought jobs to America and is doing everything that can be done to fight the Virus.
Come at me, Libtards. Trump is the future. He is king. He’s the role model my children deserve. #MAGA
Ok based on these results I feel I have to remind you guys that a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. It’s all well and good to vote your conscience until it splits the vote. Then it’s Trump 4 more years.
When tRump declared he was The Chosen One, I really started fighting back. With religion. With Scripture. With The Constitution. And if I could get by with it, I’d give him a black eye...or maybe just pull his hair 😂.

Why ask him to step down? I don’t get it? So they can replace joe with someone who hasn’t had any negative ads run against them? Just have trump spend millions on ads against Biden only to make the campaign turnaround and start oppo on new candidate 85 days out?
won’t show a full trump speech because they don’t think it’s fair and balanced to joe Biden. What crap. Not our fault joe won’t give a speech so it’s actually unfair and balanced by a bias finger at fox

working for trump,  a true sellout
If you believe in entrapment sure. An illegal allegation was framed on trump so they went after people to get them to lie and say trump was a Russian and get off Scott free
If this is a "Flight 93" election, that metaphor requires to GOP to deliberately lose (AKA crash) the election for Trump for the good of the country.  I cannot think that that's in them based on past (lack of) performance.
Oh, please, Trump traded his soul in forty-odd years ago for a loan extension, more-than-likely.
Which he knows.  And you're assuming he'll be like Trump and do a lot of stuff through Ex. Orders.  He likely won't (except to reverse most of Trump Ex. Ords).  I kind of hope for a 51-49 GOP Senate if the GOP will dump the Turtle for maybe Mitt Romney.  Biden-Romney could work.

Twelve years of Hitler &amp; twelve years of Trump are both too long. And a nightmare.

If joe won’t trump should offer for Obama to take his place
Huge swing in momentum towards trump in the last 2 weeks. I feel like the Democrat Marxist showed their desperation at Lewis funeral with obama acting so crazy
I would not call it ironic as I’m showing through do the same intentionally. Yet I am also proving a point that abortion is more serious than Covid. While I do not like Trump he is not fighting FOR Covid and is fighting AGAINST abortion. I can not say the same for Biden.
Again - my point is directed at the OP and her use of persuasion - not the incompetence of Trump. - To use this to pass blame on the image &amp; then to put an election count down as a header is persuasive rhetoric. I could do the same w/ an abortion ad/Biden &amp; put the countdown
Trump fires TVA chair, cites hiring of foreign workers.
You could also easily argue that Trump downplaying the virus absolutely led to deaths.

So a little more than one days worth of killing babies through abortion. Who is fighting to support abortion and who is not? Im not a Trump fan but to use these numbers to drive a political motive is just silly when compared to the democrat motive to support and fund abortion .
Trump has FAILED
I don't think this is that sort of thing. I'd say Trump is both authentic and frequently disturbing. I'd also say Joe Biden is objectively in cognitive decline.

No. Donald J. Trump is the "worst domestic terrorist since 9/11."  More than 154,000 Americans dead so far. No relief in sight.

President Trump... As I completely understand your reasoning behind wanting to do this, I strongly believe that this is not the time to be making this decision.  Your country supports you on TikTok.   Your people are making themselves loud and clear using this format.

Trump added Alabama to the list. Again. He’s clueless about the geography of the U.S. — and pretty much anything else.
Trump should ban any apple product assembled in China from entering America
Wow every single day the liberals push a new low. I pray so hard America isn’t being overloaded with anti trump media every where you look
My 2 cousins from Chicago hated trump 3 months ago and now are voting for trump. Columbus was last straw
Trump represents himself. Period. He doesn’t care about America or Americans. If you live under that illusion, you’re deluded.
I've seen several ppl both blaming him for going and Trump for holding the rally ("in the middle of a pandemic!")
It is absolutely shameful that President Trump used the funeral of Rep. John Lewis to lambaste President Trump!
Maybe I'm being hopelessly optimistic and naive, but I think the Democrats will "fetter" themselves to some degree.  Pelosi and Shumer were there for Obamacare and the Tea Party were broke their majority and ended up leading to GOP control under Trump.  Neither wants that again.
The never ending attack is driving people to trump. My cousins no fan of trump are upset because they feel like they are now forced to vote trump

EDITORIAL: TRUMP – Existential Threat to New World Order
I think Trump's tweet hinting at delaying the election was a tactic of distraction from the bad GDP news yesterday, not a serious proposal.  Even so, it's self-contradictory to push (rightly) to reopen schools and then float an idea like that one. We can hold a normal election.
Every institution in this country is under assault by the Left! We must defend our institutions and traditions! Vote Trump in November! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You are absolutely right! President Trump! Mail in Voting is Corrupting America! We The People of America need to make Voting going to the Polls only! IN GOD WE TRUST! AMEN!

Good Lord, YES!! If I have to dress in a Hefty Trash Bag, swim goggles and an N95, I WILL BE VOTING against Donald Trump, and any other Republican sycophantic enablers on the ballot.
You can hate Trump that is your right, however voter fraud is a serious issue and no matter who you support for POTOS we all should want honest elections.Trump’s fault. Orange man bad. 😸

Trump wasn't on the ballot dude  I early voted and would like to praise how easy and simple it is unlike the cowardice that is mailing an absentee ballot when you're my age and healthy.

Don't think you can blame Trump for your lifetime of hate. .
You know with trump throwing such a fit over tiktok lately maybe this guy misunderstood how it worked...?
That was the case in 2016 too. Personally I think Hillary was a better candidate than Biden yet we ended up with trump then. I’d like to think people learned their lesson but....
Let’s face it. This is Biden we’re talking about. He’ll find a way to screw this up somehow. We’re all just gonna have to suck it up and deal with it to get rid of trump.
Cruz was my choice before Trump won me over...

Jonathan Swan did do an excellent job. Full stop. No doubting that. I would like to point out, however, that Trump showed deference and respect to Swan that he absolutely doesn't give to female interviewers and journalists.
Is that symbolic of all of the Americans Trump has KILLED in the last 5 months? You are going to need a MUCH bigger yard. But thank you for pointing it out to his blind &amp; sorry followers....
This is why I like Trump, first blatantly honest Non-politician or lawyer in government!!!
We all are and must get out and vote in massive numbers for Trump so there is no question who is going to Win!
1/ So, I watched the entire interview and it was one of the hardest things I’ve watched in a while. There are so many things Trump says that make me facepalm and worry about this country under his reign. Jonathan did a phenomenal job holding his ground and asking tough questions.

Of course because this dude is outside his mind people jump straight to blame it on President Trump. Guess that's the easy thing to do for people. Put the blame on someone else, fuck the fact that this guy was this way long before.

Trump was never going to ban TikTok. The U.S. makes up a majority of its users.   He threatened ByteDance (Chinese company) to give up the app so Microsoft could buy it and make it a US company app. Bytedance caved to Microsofts demands and now TikTok is here to stay
The fact that Trump is banning TikTok bc he’s butthurt that we reserved the seats at his stupid rally and is covering it up with the pretense of security is so ridiculously funny to me oh my god
Oh and he compared  Trump to (#Democrats) George Wallace and Bull Connor....you can’t make this 💩 up!
People call Trump supporters white supremacist, so does that make Biden supporters pedophiles?

My opinion is he wasn't tested just trying to keep President Trump out of the state of ohio but if that's the case it didn't work so now to go about trying to be around people he now says he wasn't positive I don't believe it it was another dem crap job
They thought President Trump maybe wouldn't come just another dem lie I don't think he was tested at all!

That’s a theme with the gop.  Ask that same question about Mitch McConnell. W. Nunes. Any of them. Don’t think for one second just because you don’t like Trump we’re giving you a pass on the rest.
The sad thing is most trump supporters can’t own up to their stupid mistake. He is a disaster. His failure is killing Americans, daily.

Oof. I honestly feel like this is one of those where “does it need to be done? Probably yes.” The thing is, Trump is really good at taking things that have no actual bearing on his performance as tools to fire up his base. In a macro sense, this isn’t good for right now.
So  just said that black people all think alike, unlike the Latino community has diverse thought. Interesting 🤔. I bet Twitter would catch fire 🔥 if Trump said this, but, nobody will say anything since Joe is a Democrat. #itsoktobearacistifyouaredemocrat

In a 2002 statement in New York Magazine, Trump said “I’ve known Jeff (Epstein) for fifteen years. Terrific guy . . . It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
This is from last year
Ah, so your belief is Trump found about Epstein, but instead of blowing the whistle &amp; starting an investigation, he just banned him from his resorts? 😂  GTFO. I'm not supporting anyone even somewhat connected with Epstein. It's a shame you're allowing partisanship to blind you.
No. It's not.  Flight logs:   Wishing Maxwell "well:"   Neighbors in Florida:
Trump was on the flight logs, recently said he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell "well" in her trial, and was neighbors with them in Palm Beach, FL for a decade. What are you talking about?
Same. As much as I dislike Trump, it was an opportunity for him to shape a narrative where he could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, &amp; been a hero. Nah. Dude is worse than a villain out of a bad movie. Too worried about that re-election and looking bad.

This is the greatest PR mistake that Bush and Obama made, pushing wars on the national credit card and asking people to sacrifice nothing tangible. No buy-in. It appears that Trump is not learning from their mistakes.
What Trump us missing out on - and the Left is not - is that to motivate people and get them on your side, you must ask something of them (wearing masks, rationing in WWII). It can be purely symbolic, but you have to get the buy-in.

It doesn’t matter. People are going to believe what they want to believe. If they inherently believe that COVID is a hoax like Trump said at the beginning, every doctor that says otherwise will be the enemy. People just want to do what they want to do.

The real reason Trump is banning Tik Tok is because a bunch of teens made him look bad. It has nothing to do with China.
It's October 2020. At a speech on prison reform, Biden mentions that black people commit half of all murders. Trump calls it "disgraceful."  tweets out the clip, saying "Racist Joe Biden just lost black voters!" Two weeks later, Biden wins 94% of the black vote.
Imagine if Trump said what Joey said 😳

I think the short answer is: money.   Money from donors. For Advertising, TV air time.   In Trump’s case, he had never ran for any office, but because of celebrity status he could have ran 3rd party. Instead , he chose to attach himself to the one he could easily manipulate.
Biden: Worked under Obama for 8 years and his campaign rescued by Jim Clyburn. Trump violated FAIR housing and has been known to be a prolific user of racial slurs.

There is a real fight for your headspace right now.  I would second-guess any site that defends itself in its own title (“Real Honest Journalism”).  Stay alert, friends.
Plus, Trump didn’t know who Thune is. Maybe now he does.

this is the straw that broke the camels back
News media will never give Pres. Trump credit. The media twist thing around to make Trump look as bad as they can. Media is all bullshit.
Another thing is the news media cleaned up this statement for Biden. Have they ever did that for Pres. Trump? NO!
Joe Biden says just as much if not more controversial things than Trump does soooo maybe vote third party (?)
News media make it sound like Pres Trump is at fault for everything. The President will go down in history as one of the greatest presidents ever. So what you don't like his tweets mine tweets are right with him.
I live in TN and have been arguing with Trumpers over masks for weeks now and was disgusted with parents of my county’s school parent group over wearing masks. And the many who were saying “but they don’t die, they don’t get sick” Trump has really done irrevocable harm. 😔
Scared Trump will destroy China Joe?
I am reminded of what Trump's Econ prof at Penn said. "He was the dumbest goddam student I ever had." And it makes sense why Trump didn't mention his Administration's catastrophic FAILURE ON TESTS for #Coronavirus. Persistent test failure is a sore point for #Q’s #StableGenius!

Obama was better than Trump in every measurable economic metric PRE-COVID!
I thought Bredesen would have done better against Blackburn. Well liked mayor and governor. Maybe times are changing though. It was a race to the bottom on the GOP side. Maybe the fervor to oust Trump can affect this.
Yet they parrot Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, repeat their talking points.
Hey, you know people can still support him and also think he made a weird statement.  I'll take Joe "My dad could drive a car" Biden over Donald "Grab em by the pussy" Trump any day.  Doesn't make it not a goofy thing to say.
Trump really needs to learn how to apply his makeup better. He never blends it down to his neck 😁

I remember the first time trump did the whole “we need to test less so there are fewer cases” things in front of a crowd. They kind of awkwardly chuckled assuming it was a joke. Then he very sincerely repeated it again.   It’s unbelievable that he’s incapable of anything better.

I believe it’s too late. The church is afraid, asleep. It’s not waking up. The groundswell of liberalism is not being resisted sufficiently. The “conservative leaning” Supreme Court is voting liberal. Half the Christians hate Trump. The Lord is about to call us home. 🌎👆🏼🌥
At the same time, it does feel like the Left is simply more resistant to neoliberal establishment critiques than the Right is. The Trump movement totally buckled under accusations of racism (see: First Step Act). Most leftists just kinda laugh off anti-semitism accusations.
Did Democrats introduce a weak on crime bill that the entire GOP supported? Oh wait that was Tim Scott.  Did Democrats sign the First Step jailbreak bill? Oh wait that was President Trump.  Did Democrats give felons voting rights? Oh wait that was Republican Governor Reynolds.

This is the problem with the left's extreme rhetoric on things like climate change. If they *really* thought the world was ending in 20 years, they would take Biden over Trump--at least he'd rejoin Paris accords, etc.  By refusing to endorse Biden, they admit they're bluffing.
Sorry TN GOP Senate candidates, broad stereotypes about ultra-conservative southern buffoons trying to out-bootlick each other are no longer believable.   We suggest a pivot to “Trump-hating rednecks,” a sure-fire recipe for success in 2020.

Trump has announced his intention to give his nomination acceptance speech from the White House (see Hatch Act).  Laws don't matter to him. The more outrageous the breach of decorum, the more he's drawn to it.   So we'll all look at his new distraction, and ignore the rest.

Think about mail-in voting. How many Republicans really felt strongly about it four years ago? Barely any. But now that Trump, whom they admire, mentioned it, every Republican is passionately against it.
So, to quote a wise man, What Is To Be Done?  We have to find leaders who appeal to GOP voters for the dumb superficial reasons they care about ("he's a fighter! Trump endorsed him!") while also incidentally being good on our issues. The obvious example to me is Tucker.
That was early.   You do understand New York City has a lot of people?
The hard pill to swallow is that Republican voters are, by and large, satisfied with Mitch McConnell, Steve Scalise, and Kevin McCarthy. They don't really understand the difference between MAGA rhetoric ("I stand with President Trump!") and actual America First tangible issues.

Not only has the GOP not shifted toward restrictionism since Trump's election, it has actually gone the opposite way. Since 2016 we've lost out on:  - Sessions - Kobach - Brat - Steve King - Barletta  And who have we gained? Dan Crenshaw, Mitt Romney, and Madison Cawthorn.
I annotated  interview with       How did I do       ?
Yeah. Not to mention they have an older voter base, whom I have to imagine would be more favorable toward snail mail than young people.  It's totally illogical. Trump said "mail-in bad", so Republicans fell in line. I really think it's that simple.

Warren Buffett?  2017 - GOP and Trump gave Berkshire-Hathaway $29 Billion (with a B!)
Did they think Trump wasn't going to keep tabs on that money 😂
Trump’s fault? The guy is a Jewish real estate guy in New Jersey. Guess for which party Jews overwhelmingly vote? Guess which political party runs Jersey.😂
True, but the GOP came out in force against him. The former Republican governor endorsed his Democratic opponent. My point is a GOP where Trump actually pressures them to endorse populists and restrictionists, rather than let McConnell and co. run the show.
The worst part is how easy it is to imagine a scenario where Trump backed restrictionists since his election. Sessions in Alabama (if he'd even have to run), Kobach in Kansas, Brat in Virginia. Instead, we're now at a point where the GOP has *fewer* restrictionists than in 2015.
Trump could come out tomorrow and say that he loves puppies and that they're the best and the left would immediately call him a racist for not liking cats
What does he have to gain? He’s far more intelligent, experienced, and has public perception on his side. Not saying it wouldn’t be entertaining but al it would be is Trump lies and Biden tries to talk about his policies (exactly what Hillary did). Completely pointless

No, but there's that guy who lived in Trump Tower. Thinking his name was Lou Tenant.
"Do you find him impressive?"  "Uhh, I don't know, I can't say one way or the other, I find many people impressive, I find many people not impressive, but uhhhh no."  "He didn't come to my inauguration."  "He should've come, I think he made a big mistake"  -Trump on John Lewis
Amazing how MSM has topped the #FakeNews lies &amp; sends out 2 lies (at least) for every one they claim Trump has.  The #SnowFlakes are scared!🤣🤣
Like Melania Trump did during the #2016election,  has plagiarized  campaign slogan: “#LetTrumpBeTrump!” LOL
This is Pelosi's way to make everyone suffer till she gets her way. With Pres. Trump, it doesn't work that way.
Conservatives were willing to lynch Hillary up for her "at this point what difference does it make" comment. Trump just said that a thousand daily American deaths is "it is what it is". Crickets from the 'pro-life' peanut gallery.
Guess he’s following Trump. The GOP’s “It is what it is” faithless leader.
I’m home now but if there’s one thing I learned while in Pigeon Forge; they sure do love Trump there! 😂🤣
The final seconds were cut from  incredible interview of  on  Trump’s reaction is priceless!👇

I smell a rat. To those who utilize the mail-in ballot option, be sure to mail the ballots early!                 In apparent reversal, Trump encourages Floridians to vote by mail
So Democrats problem with Trump is not that he attempted a coup against a democratically elected foreign leader, it's that it failed. Beyond parody.
If you haven't watched the full interview, you should. If you haven't already decided to vote against Trump, you should.
#DonaldTheDeplorable is an anamoly. Don’t pay more attention to him than you would a train wreck. Read  book “#TooMuchAndNeverEnough” to understand the pathological conditions of the Trump family’s #BasketOfDeplorables.  The real problem is our national failing!
That's always been my philosophy. Trust my instincts, and believe in people's better nature.   Trump's term in office has taught me I was right to trust my instincts, wrong to believe in people's character. I've learned a lot about "friends" and family with this Reign of Error.

The Democrats call President Trump a racist but it's Joe Biden that says he is going to pick a black female to be his VP. Hey Joe it should be who has the best qualifications to be VP not the color of someone's skin or actually not just female. Who's the racist now Sleepy Joe? 🇺🇲
Trump is not fit to lick the soles of John Lewis’ shoes. ⁦
Awwww, have a problem wishing EVERYONE well, or only when it's Trump?
#MAGA cult members overlook many of #DonaldTheDeplorable’s scandals because “at least he was never involved in a child sex-trafficking ring, like the one at #CometPizza that Hillary belonged to!”  They believe this because #Qanon told them so. Will Trump’s own words awake them?
Well, mail-in voting is a freaking nightmare already but do the Democrats care. Hell no. That's the only way they think they can win in 2020. And that is to steal it from president Donald Trump. They hate that man more then they love the country. A bunch of freaking idiots.🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲

They had no plan, 0, zilch to make a deal .. they set this up for Trump to save the day and boost his election prospects!!! This had been as plain as the nose on your face to me..
This is just to plan for next week when they say it was all trump supporters.
All the GOP plan.. to not deal so Trump can come in and supposedly save the day.. all abt the campaign.. Dems y’all better wake up..
Kelli I have been saying  there would not be a deal.. it was on purpose to make trump be a hero.  I knew it! All planned by the GOP at the expense of those hanging on by a thread.. he will save the day now! #allplanned
has penned a masterful article:   "Trump’s language is carnal and bombastic. Strickland’s is more measured. But their message is the same: Only police can keep us safe..."   Structural reform be damned.
Trump looks like CGI green screen for this press conference.  I'm not sure he's at Bedminster y'all.
Trump doing something good with this executive order and I’m still voting him out.
You have to go back to 1973 to find something on Trump yet I can go back two days on something on Biden!
The Burnt Orange Heresy isn't about the Trump administration?
Yes...don’t know where Strickland’s staff found his data points, but might have been in the same place Trump’s staff finds his charts...
How long until Trump literally blows us all up? This is a fight for the Republic. Let people who want to fight for the country help and you can argue policy later. Stop trying to win each what if argument. Start trying to win elections.
Doesn’t really matter what we think now, it all depends on election. If Biden wins, how much you want to bet these two get a “get out of jail free” card? Maybe they get their license suspended for a time, but I doubt that would even happen. There would only be justice if Trump 👍
Nope. Rudy is going to hate it when Trump loses and there is no more cover.
It also doesn't matter because even if super-smart people pronounced it "Thighland", Trump is an idiot and wouldn't know about it.

How much does it cost us TAX PAYERS for trump to give political rally  / LYING / news conference from his private golf club

Of course Trump is letting it happen. It's a central component of he reelection strategy.

Trump is such a GREAT PRESIDENT. Thank you for all that you do.
He never apologized and just said a similar thing again, the guy is a racist, way worse than Trump. But hey he's elevating the public discourse. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Hey. You do what you feel as long as you understand trump can win again. His base of racists are a multitude that has made this country ugly.
I don’t, but I think it’s gonna be just as bad with either, which is why I gotta vote with my conscience. Imagine...we vote for those two hawks (Dems) because we hate Trump...then they do some super fucked up shit and you gotta justify your your grandkids-
Why would you prefer trump over Hillary though. I know it’s not because of the spies who got caught.

Nonsense. Trump's inaction on the virus crippled the economy.
Didn’t think anyone could fumble the bag against Trump this year but dammit Joe.. u just might.. ahh
See, now you think I would have voted for Hilary, which I’d still rather have Trump than her. And you are completely missing my point...
Man I’d love for you to find where I gave Trump a pass
You waited months to come up with something. You waited until everything expired. Dems had a plan for months that you ignored. This is all your fault. Negotiate. Your plan is not enough, it falls well short of supporting Americans while helping Trump business and corporations.
That’s truly a wasted vote. You got no skin in the game, and that’s how trump got in . People took their ball and went home.
All of them got baggage. All of them. Right now ain’t the time to give trump a pass doe.

Why President Trump is Our Only Hope | Frontpage Mag
He launders money. He has failed at his businesses to the tune fo six bankruptcies. Trump is not a billionaire. That is why he acts like a pussy wussy trying to keep people from seeing his taxes. That is all about to end.
Before we can determine what police reform Memphis needs, we must understand how deep the city’s resistance is. Mayor Strickland has been aligned with Trump’s law enforcement officials for years, and now federal agents are coming to town.
Aside from the dollars, Memphis policing has also gotten lots of love from the highest levels of the Trump administration since Strickland took office. (Ask us what we thought about Jeff Sessions’ 2017 visit.)
The Trump partnership announcement dovetails nicely with  campaign to fortify  After the wave of Black Lives Matter protests this summer, Mayor Strickland doubled down and pledged to hire 700 additional officers.
Memphis is a site of #OperationLegend, Trump’s initiative to roll out federal officers to quell "gangs, guns and drugs" in cities. Memphis will see 40 federal officers staff up police districts in Black neighborhoods and $300,000 in support funds.
This is some deep analysis by  a longtime Memphian and  professor of political rhetoric. When it comes to policing,  and Trump have an “unhealthy and compulsive devotion to police.” They’re like this🤞
How did Memphis, a majority-Black blue dot in a red state, become a welcome mat for federal agents? Follow the steady stream of money and personnel D.C. has funneled to Memphis to increase the size and lethality of its police force.
We’ve got over 160,000 deaths in our country and Trump signs an executive order regarding Tik Tok.
Are you serious? Trump completely botched the response to this pandemic. He politicized it. He politicized wearing masks. The virus is surging. I can’t imagine anyone doing worse. He wants testing slowed. He says it is what is and will go away. That is bull. #TrumpVirus
Trump doesn't lie to me daily. Maybe he lies to you.
Only time will tell what's really going to happen!  I can only tell people what has happened with people that I actually know... in real life... And for me the numbers trend toward Trump... Not away. I guess we will all know soon enough.
I can dig it. But America will NEVER have a female president. EVER. And it's not the men that will make sure it won't happen. It's the women. The same women that voted for Trump. Even if the candidate is a white woman. Still won't happen in our lifetime.
Depends. Biden wins, the epidemic ends.  Trump wins, keep adding up
To be fair: Trump said "Yo-semite" because he is functionally illiterate &amp; was sounding out the word. Unfortunately for him, English isn't phonetic, "Yosemite" isn't spelled the way it sounds, &amp; Trump is too arrogant to review speeches with aides before making an ass of himself.

I'm citing an article that includes the transcript of the plea agreement Flynn signed.  Take it up with him.  Trump fired him.
If Russia was interfering in the election (they are) and Biden's orbit were talking to and meeting with Russians and not including dealings on disclosures &amp; denying meetings &amp; phone calls, and lying about adoptions, etc. I would hope Trump/DOJ/FBI would look at those individuals
Compare the racist &amp; other gaffes of Biden to that of Trump, &amp; the fact that you &amp; your GOP colleagues have never spoken to that, makes you no better than him. A gaffe, btw, is defined as an unintentional act or remark, which shows no willful intent, which can't be said of Trump.
And please tell me how what Biden has done is worse than Trump saying “grab them by their pussy” 20 years ago....

I know what you mean, and glad to have you!  From everything I can see, the vast majority of the "switching" has been towards him, not away from him.  Also, there are definitely "shy Trump voters"... people who won't admit it, but WILL vote for him.   We've got this! 🙂👍
So Trump is a rich snob? That seems like an odd hill to set up camp on.
I really believe that whether or not someone cares for Trump's personality, he was an absolute necessity after 35 years of weak-willed Republican capitulation.  Trump's personality was much-needed.  We can become less brash later on.  For now, we've got a country to save.

Are you advocating that Trump make a comparison of how his family made their money versus Biden?  Themes of mob, Russia, slum lord, fraud, bankruptcies, tax evasion, Trump U lawsuit, tax returns, emoluments, porn tar payoffs, etc. seem to suggest that’s risky
I think Biden's promise to reverse the Hyde Amendment has really jeopardized his chances of wooing evangelicals who don't like Trump.  There is a huge segment of America that sees this position as a deal breaker.  If it weren't for that one thing, he might win by a landslide.

Trump is a self saboteur.   Fuckboy could have easily listened to experts and have the curve lower and taken ALL THE CREDIT.   Like, how dumb can you be?   Also, it’s funny that MAGA can’t defend that abhorrent Axios interview, but defend that racist shit he spews
If Kafka had written a novel that described the Trump presidency in exact terms, it would have been considered his most surreal work. Although I think it would have had the same impact as the fictional play "The King in Yellow" and driven its readers insane.

Since Dems don’t give a damn about the American public. Trump is going to use Executive orders to provide relief to Americans. He is going to let the mismanaged Dem state and local governments choke on their nazi destructive lockdown. This is going to be good.

Trump.. Biden..USA. 🇺🇸 #USElection2020
I thought he was positive. I saw him on cnn. That test Trump uses may not be as accurate as some. I hope he doesn’t have it.
Truly disgusting what this man did. But you not gone sit here and act like trump supporters, and/or ppl against BLM are angels. I bet 1million dollars if you search through some of the ppl with your same views you’ll find sexual deviants, murderers, etc. no its not enough sir
FROM MEMPHIS TN, TO MAINE, TO FLORIDA, TO ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK &amp; EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. THE #'S OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE HIGHER THAN YOU THINK! WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION!
I mean he did say the African American community. So there’s definitely non-black Africans. And you’re crazy if you think someone stating that a massive part of America’s population doesn’t have a diversity of ideas isn’t horrible. (P.s. I know Trump says sanitary and worse)
He’s doing it himself...like every day. At this point, I question why you would vote for him over Trump. It just doesn’t feel like an upgrade at this point.
Love it. Tiger is a Trump supporting patriot!!!✊
I’d stand in line 16 -hours to vote out Trump
Cause she's an idiot. And if she votes for Trump, she loses nothing. But her father wouldn't vote for him.
I've been saying this since April!! Some of these crazy people like my Governor of MS  listening to a dead brain like Trump.
Oh Maxine, How can you go on TV and completely lie?  President Trump has been a great leader through all of this and continues to be a great leader. He is not telling the schools what to do.

TRUMP for president
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump
Found &amp; re-watched this tonight. Hillary roasting Trump* is everything. Even if you didn't think she was the better candidate (she was), you have to agree that we would be in a VASTLY better place right now had she been elected.  Please vote for Biden.
JOkE BIDEN I’m looking for a real president. A president with balls. A president like DONALD TRUMP.  Thank you TRUMP for all that you do for America.
Biden did not write this. The person over his Twitter account did. Trump for president.
The Trump Administration.
No.  The term was always part Trump's campaign slogan.  I think MAGA was the subtitle of one of his books.
Guys, I think this it.  President Trump just told us we won't see him for a while.  I think he will be safe on Air Force 1 while arrests are made, just like Cue told us on Nov. 1, 2017.  It might really be happening.
Thanks for the update but I’m still pissed at you for the whole “Trump” thing
By comparison. Just saying, to the average person who is conscious of the evils in the world, the points you all try to make against Trump don't really hit home. Also his policies are beneficial. I appreciate him for bringing awareness to things politicians don't talk about also.
Potential Biden VP Has Major Problems, Including Her Son Being a Massive Trump Supporter
haggerty won 😔 poophead 😔 literally your only personality trait is being endorsed by trump 😔
You don't believe that there are darker things happening in the world than Trump speaking about experiences, with women, to other men, privately?
Yes, much darker thinks are happening in the world. I believe for those who are looking at the bigger picture, Trump is like a saint.
Seven Times President Trump Has Defunded the Planned Parenthood Abortion Business |
You are right, so right the MSM and Dems have taken a 60 year old FDA approved prescription off the market because Pres.Trump acknowledged its success. These same people have the blood of millions on their souls. They are damned for their lust for power.
Yes, that’s exactly why trump said it like that 🙄
This list the same way Trump got elected 💀
So earlier in the day, someone asked if we could wish one thing would disappear forever, I said anyone with Trump DNA or married to/dating a Trump. However, I would ask that you be exempt. #fucktheNRA #MOMSDEMAND #Everytown #March4OurLives #OurPower
Trump is explicit in his racism. He touts it. It’s his whole brand. He’s a morbidly obese white supremacist and he appeals to that portion of the country that shares those features with him.
Make no mistake, President Trump is the only one we can depend on to save this country. Both sides of the aisle are dirty.
The problem with Trump’s Executive Order is that it really solves nothing. The Chinese are still going to infiltrate. The problem lies in the majority of our elected officials not understanding technology and the difference between Twitter and Facebook.
I thought you said you were not going to tweet like PRESIDENT TRUMP...this is a BAD start!

The way he talks to the interviewers... no wonder his inner Circle are scared for him to appear in public let alone debate Trump.  He can’t even get very short interviews right with a speaker in his ear and teleprompter.
trump is due ZERO respect
Great timing! My brand new book literally contrasts scripture with Trump’s words!
Better late than never. Still, how many people have died because they believed everything he said?  Facebook, Twitter penalize Trump for posts containing coronavirus misinformation
Trump is a wounded, scared animal. There is not bottom he won't go to stay out of jail.
Think what a disaster it would be if Biden picked Ginsburg replacement for the Supreme Court.  Trump has shown he will elect Constitutional respecting justices.

President Trump use your executive order. Payroll tax holiday, delay evictions, reasonable unemployment. The Dems will look rediculous if they try to stop you.

President Trump : So I have a lot of enemies out there- this may be the last time you'll see me for a while- lot of very, very rich enemies- but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure we have one chance to do it and no other president's going to do what I do."

This felt tighter over the last week. Sort of surprised. I guess the Trump brand/endorsement is still STRONG across the state.

Trump Totally delusional’s!!!!! God is he dumb!
Yo “simight park” is he that dumb??? Trump can”t speak!!!  PERIOD!!!!!
Weird, because I see crime statistics all over the country saying things are “worse” since 2016, but that’s when the “Law &amp; Order” candidate was elected. He keeps warning about “Biden’s America” but “Trump’s America” is the problem.
TRUMP AGAIN 2020 ! GET USE TO THE BEST PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He will pick Harris and Trump will dump Pence for Nicky.
It’s official!  Our President has lost his mind! 😥
I have unfolloweded some that like what trump post
Someone told me Joe Biden is less of a white supremacist than Trump. My response was white supremacy is white supremacy. Trump will burn a cross in your front yard, Joe Biden will create policy that will destroy lives. But I choose Biden to preserve the Union.
Happy birthday! Trump 2020!

“I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER, BUT IM A HONEST MAN” -   LMFAOOOOOOOO FACTS
And remember, Trump's base still believes Obama is not even as American citizen.  So they're already a lost cause.
You’re right, because he doesn’t listen to Fauci and Birx, leading EXPERTS in investigating the pandemic. Let me answer that question with another question: Who are the experts that Trump listens to? Conspiracy theorists? Neo-Nazis? I’ll wait.
Did these government agencies also shut down Muslim prayer at mosques too?
Funny you call someone who didn’t vote for Trump a Trumper. 🙄
People are over-reacting to an off-the-cuff figurative comment. It's a nothing burger.
But Trump supporters don’t know the difference.
But the Trump supporters will think we’re taking their guns away.
Maybe the only person who can defeat Trump is also an old white man? Toe 2 toe for the soul of our nation..VP debates gonn be lit though. I put $$ on

This is Trump’s base. Sad.
Extemporaneous figurative comment.  No need to read too much into the comment nor over react to it. Sometime Trump just rambles.
All of them trump supporters.

‘See you in court’: ACLU files nearly 400 cases versus Trump
Both are wild cards, Trump can flip flop based on the word of the day. Biden is definitely gonna be a DNC puppet. Trump gives a better chance for the Democratic Party to change while Biden makes us stuck with the same crap. Trump does go against the est. at times at least
The Trump years.
Gladly,  Graham's time is up.  He gave the rest of his time to Trump.
TRUMP IS SMARTER THAN YOU
I am 50/50 on it. Biden was part of the Obama administration that helped us get out of the last recession and the Trump administration stacked onto it. Part of me wants to test Trump and the other part feels like Biden brings needed stability
Thighland is definitely a strip club trump went to in New York in 1987
Biden is a million times more a Christian than Trump. And there’s more to being a Christian than just one political issue. Maybe you should reexamine ur views on putting babies in cages, death penalty, denying access to food and health insurance -things Jesus actually cared about
Future Trump supporters. Vote Trump 2050
"we need more officers to investigate violent crimes to get violent criminals off our streets. As long as these federal agents are focused on this task, we will be supportive," said  who is so singularly focused on policing that he'll partner with Trump DOJ.

Pulling at the threads of our republic
Yeah his strategy in 2016 was good. I also predict Trump losing because of the economy crash and a crashed economy usually makes people want a change. Before the pandemic I would have said Trump wins in a landslide
More police and more active federal agents in an operation coming out of the Trump Administration. What could go wrong? Right! A lot could.  via
So according to Dana basically trump is never at fault because...
Biden being far left is so laughable. Their arguement is since he is working with Bernie and AOC they will push him far left 😂. Trump would be smarter to attack him on corruption and his voting record like he did with Hilary
Rob Reiner is a pathetic excuse for a human being. The upside is President Trump lives in his head 24/7 .It must be terrible to live in torment. Most in this country laugh at you!
I disagree!! Trump wants to show the American people he is the better candidate.
What lies? Did he lie about stuff that I even care about? What's wrong with golfing? Also, why do you believe Trump is responsible for COVID? I think it is a stretch to say he caused or is perpetuating the virus.
It’s August 6th and President Trump is still living rent free in Cryin Chucks head!
OMG THIS! Trump couldn't even come up with "Jesus wept". TODDLERS know "Jesus wept".
So feds are coming to Memphis to help "fight crime". Kewl. We shoot folks on the interstate for fun, so good luck with that Trump bois
Nah. The plan is to replace trump and stabilize the country.  But thank you for playing the weird conspiracy theory game.  You entry was topped by "vaccines are a weapon to target children for abduction."
Try posting a postive message on Trump's timeline and go back a hour later and see if it's still there. Seems Twitter promotes mostly negative only comments on Trump's timeline and deletes and/or restricts Trump followers there.
Anybody that voted for #Trump will do so again. #DogShitPeople then #DogShitPeople now. I'll need video evidence before I believe a "former" #Trump voter. 🤷‍♂️

It means Trump and anyone who ever defended, supported or covered for him #VoteBlue2020
LOL. Im with you there. So much could go wrong with the let Trump burn it all down and the people will come running to us because we were right all along and they have no choice but to implement our all power to the people program.
But trump is the one who should be locked in one.

Biden’s a devout Catholic, whereas Trump has never been to church service or seen a Bible in person (except the one in the chirch photo op a month ago).
If it wasn't obvious before that Trump just exploits Christians, then this equivalent of going, "Hey, Christians, BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA! BIDEN IS SCARY!" should be.
Thats exactly right !  For the life of me I cant understand why you Hate Trump so much.  Still ❤ you tho.😃

Did he just say the reports trump the facts? Wow.
You cannot be serious. It's either Trump or your VP pick? I don't even know who you want, but this is insane and embarrassing.
Trump better not stand outside very long, karma is a bitch and her name is God in this instance:
I almost want biden to win so liberal ass hats who took Trump to task for every out-of-context remark, will now have to spend every day with these "what he was saying was" tweets.
Reread al your responses and point me to one comment that is t talking about Trump even though the discussion is clearly about Obama...  Trump being evil doesn’t mean we should overlook these atrocities and “blame it on the banks” are you fucking kidding me?
yeah, I'm sure that quote will make them dump Trump is vote for the baby killers.  brilliant.
These Republicans in Washington are losers and they take their place gleefully. Trump have them nervous as hell
Why are you diverting the conversation to Trump when this discussion is clearly about Obama and his atrocities? Jesus Christ the rhetorical fallacies are crazy in this thread
So, ahhh, can you tell me in what ways is this picture harming America? I can give you boo koos of ways that Trump is doing it. Let me know when you're ready.  Question, why is it that the only "debate" a Trumper has are memes? Asking for a friend.

It better be though cause he’s losing me. I ain’t voting for Trump, but I have no confidence in Biden.

The Trump campaign interpreting &amp; spinning Biden's statements, mixed w/his occasional gaffes does not equal senility.   Suggesting such while ignoring and/or excusing such remarks as "windmills cause cancer" or retweets of "kids are immune to covid" is where the hypocrisy lies.

Trump. Honestly I think everything would fall in to place with him gone.

President Trump bests Biden in July fundraising but money gap between the campaigns has essentially closed
Of course, Trump says they should just move to Texas now. 😑
Yes it’s very dangerous. For example, the mere fact that Trump said in a video that children are “almost immune” to COVID-19 sets a pretty dangerous narrative that some of his followers would immediately believe and send their kids to school day 1 just to have schools close day 2
I think people are obsessed with driving themselves psycho about this bc the average black person isn’t worried. For us life was tangibly worse under bush for example. No black person’s material reality is any different bc of trump imo

Polls are not what you should be paying attention to. Primaries are what you need to look at. Trump has more votes in the primaries than any other incumbent. Most of his primary numbers beats Biden’s.
A) Any donations to NRA are going to legal fees going forward (yay!) and B) NRA stans were going to vote for Trump anyway. Politically, nothing changes, except that the NRA will now find it harder to launder Russion money to GOP candidates.
Donald Trump is the best, most well spoken President ever. I ❤️ him. Plus, I hate Chardonnay.
Maybe Flynn and Trump should not have committing treason. Speaking of which, is this a good time to mention Kline Preston, Russia and the NRA? Any thoughts?
I do think the NRA is corrupt but maybe we should have found a better way to investigate them other than make a national announcement to dissolve them 3 months before an election. This is a gift to Trump to fundraise and rally his troops. Read the room.

I kinda dislike how Twitter locked Trump's account. He may suck, but free speech is important.
No debate till Trump releases his taxes.
The same one keeps popping up on a mobile game I play and the entire premise is that Manny is "too liberal for TN" because he didn't donate to Trump and he "supported gun control in middle schools." That's the whole ad.
You have zero idea about who I adore. Hating trump doesn’t always have the same flip side for everyone.
Campaign commercials in full swing. So Hagerty’s strategy is to point out that Sethi didn’t want guns in middle schools and didn’t donate to Trump in 2016?  Bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it pays off.

"Republicans’ plan to help struggling Americans who are facing the mounting consequences of Democrats' inaction."  Moscow Mitch lying again. With nearly everything coming out of Trump's mouth being a distortion or fiction, we've been desensitized to Republicans' constant lying.
I can read your tweets, but it would be nice if you could provide evidence as to why you think Trump doesn't give a shit about America. You have to know that what you're saying can come off a bit harsh to someone who wants to know how to vote in such a polarized election.
He is destroying the country, it will make a difference. It is obvious you are a member of the Trump Cult, just own it. Character matters. The issue isnt anti establishment, the issue is character
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess:  via   #Election2020 #politics #voteYou know who Trump can pass the torch to for Prez in 2024?  . He's a great choice to welcome shell-shocked moderates back into reality, while continuing to spray political Round-Up on the weeds of progressivism.
I'm pretty sure that every time Biden mutters some incoherent thought, appended by a "C'Mon Man!..."  it boosts Trump far more than any Russian support. In all seriousness, with the direct exposure of today, Trump himself wins or loses his own votes. Russia influence not so much

It is heartbreaking that the trump campaign lawyer would stoop so low as to use a person having a mental health crisis as a pawn. You would think there would be laws - or at least ethics for a lawyer doing this.
Why have you never pointed out a single lie by Donald Trump. Yet you feign outrage here.

The FBI lied 17 different times and inflated evidence to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser.
Doesn’t matter what Biden does, the election is a referendum on Trump, pure and simple.  If I were advising Biden, I’d tell him to lay as low as possible.  In 2016 Trump won against the most unpopular candidate in USA, this time its totally about him.
Y’all this is almost uncomfortable... I know y’all don’t want to see trump or whatever but holy shit.. this your guy?
We must prosecute the FBI agents that lied to a federal judge in order to spy on the Trump campaign.

Correct.  Biden is running for VP again and no one told him. Not that he would know the difference.
People are already referring to it as the Harris/Biden Campaign.

Dan &amp; most of the guys at NRO really seem to be way out there in LaLa land. Biden said whomever became his running mate must be "strong" &amp; "able to be President on day one". That does not sound like a powerless VP to me.
Excuse me. But I'm certain Barack Obama had input on Biden's VP decision. He was a constitutional law teacher too. AND HE WAS HOUNDED BY BIRTHERS. I see absolutely no reason to waste anymore time on anything Eastman says. He just wants to attract attention to himself.

Definitely a DNC pick.  No way, Biden would, if he was in his Right Mind.
Looks like more people will vote against Harris than will vote for Biden. 😂😂😂
Yes and all of stocks would plummet. So pray Biden never wins.
Biden is a Catholic.  However, religion is not a factor in a good candidate.
Candidates do not schedule debates.  The election commissioner does.  Biden has NOT refused any debate.
Do you really think Joe Biden doesn't know that? Joe Biden???
Gentle reminder that one of the last pieces of merchandise the Kamala 2020 campaign created was a shirt highlighting Joe Biden's racist opposition to school busing, a policy which Kamala directly benefited from as a child. And now she's his VP nominee.
This is not the entire statement she made.  Maybe she did believe the first statement.  Then the stories started changing.  This definitely won’t stop Biden/Harris from being our next President.

OK, #LeftTwitter, let's take the same approach to #Harris we needed to take with #Biden. Is she perfect? No. Is she better than any Republican? Damn Straight. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho applies to the VP, too. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #BidenVP #BidenHarris2020
Alright y’all, I’m not thrilled about Kamala, but here are some of the silver linings:  1) we know from the primary that Kamala is wishy-washy on her stances. So we need to be the loudest voices, pushing #MedicareForAll and #GreenNewDeal. Biden is older, she could become POTUS
Good Lord.  Biden has been on line speaking all the time.  GOP doesn’t make the debate calls.  Anyone listening to Biden’s entire speeches (which the GOP is not doing) knows where Biden stands.  Trump never talks policies, just lies &amp; brags on himself.
Biden didn’t pick.  His handlers did.

No it's not, all of the Democrat candidates were asked this during a debate, who supported giving undocumented people free healthcare, and everyone of them raised their hand including Biden.
Why do you support Biden? I don't claim to be a doctor but just watching him on TV makes me wonder if he does have some issues with dementia or something. He said he was running for US Senate, couldn't remember where he was and told people they weren't black if they voted Trump
Your fault my favorite thing in the world as a pass time is not going to take place this fall. Definitely have changed my vote to Biden!
‘‘This whole thing sucks. I’ve got friends and family who are posting on FB that Dems are communists and other hate filled lies about Biden that’s pure trash. I most definitely #BlameTrump for all this division and hate. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
No I hated Biden talking about China himself, saying they aren't that bad. Plus the statement about healthcare for illegals was a question asked in a Democrat debate where all the candidates supported giving free healthcare to illegals.
Funny conversation between you 2, I think you've got your wires crossed somewhere because from where I'm standing, looks like you both are Biden supporters and don't like President Trump. But your arguing....
Yeah they're already saying Russia is helping him again. I don't see how, most people have already made up their minds who they are voting for, Russia can't vote for us. China and Iran are meddling too but for Biden...
What I commented has been on national news more than once, not something I just made up. What about when Biden said if you don't vote for him you ain't black? Did I make that up too
I'm not even going there on name calling, most liberals call me names daily. As for the bounties that's been gone over several times, not even going to try to tell it again. How many lies had Biden told? Plenty all able to be fact checked too. Politicians lie
Okay Joe Biden, where’s that VP choice you were gonna decide on last week?

Y’all have set the standard for how to do it right!  I’m glad the Biden campaign is going strong. 💪🏻
If I honestly and sincerely discuss Trump or policing in America, I’m helping Biden? Kind of sounds like you’re stumping for the Democrat.  Biden is very pro-police, though, so I gotta disagree with you there.
I do not support Biden, but nice whataboutism.
Not really sure we should be advocating to replace Trump’s patronage and nepotism with Biden’s patronage and nepotism.
So excited about Biden/Harris! 💕
In short...the New World Order would prefer Biden
IF Biden gets elected, the left will turn against him, deam him “incompetent because of his health”, and this woman will become the first African American Woman President. Take it to the bank.   Pretty sure this has been the plan all along. 🤔
That has not been my experience, though Biden certainly would fall into that category.

What action (if any) has Joe Biden taken against this, given its sorta gonna greatly affect how he gets elected?
Can you image the media shitstorm if Trump had made any one of the Biden racial gaffes?
Yup, and the matter is treated as if it's not even up for reasonable debate. You're a RINO or a SQUISH if you don't believe that America is over if Biden wins.
Let's not waste time on this. It makes us seem desparate. There is plenty of horrible actions from biden and Harris to focus on.
The usual sexism and disrespect from a guy used to bullying women.
Stacey did you see the exhaustion from Biden in this speech?   But really, Biden who wasn’t wearing a mask when he made the speech wants us all to be chained to a mask whenever we leave the house.  or else.  Can someone ask him the limits of his authoritarianism?
I can tell this is sarcastic, but for any overly credulous readers: Clinton was arguably more effective than either Bush at getting major conservative reforms passed into law. Biden is very much of the same mold.
Amanda...how about this video   Is there any authoritarian that Biden and Harris won't take?
You &amp; Biden are socialist liberal democrats wanting to destroy our constitution &amp; American Values, Another Lie from a socialist! President  built the best economy in our history!
Trump needs to be in prison. Vote Biden-Harris!
Shit, got'em. Maybe this punitive law enforcement model actively perpetuated by both Biden and Harris is a complete failure all around.
I get the sense that a lot of liberals are in for an unpleasant surprise once Biden-Harris are in charge.  Maybe not, though, since the goal seems to be getting Trump out of office and then going back to ignoring politics altogether.
that doesn’t make sense.  So Biden wouldn’t be running (for the third time) if Trump wasn’t in office?   So what was his reason to run in 2008?
You’re funny! Joltin’ Joe Biden is going to kick trumps fat ass. Why does trump wear more make up than Kamala?
If there weren't already overwhelming reason to vote for Trump over Biden, this single policy statement singlehandedly 100% guarantees I would vote against Biden.

Biden is an old-fashioned "law &amp; order" racist, and Kamala is a cop. They're going to come down hard on the continuing protests, and I'm betting liberal sycophants are going to either turn a blind eye to their abuses or try to justify them.
Looking forward to your defense of the Biden-Harris anti-BLM police surge.
This what LEADERSHIP looks like! Thank you President Trump for cleaning up the mess Joe Biden and Obama created
I agree, it does give an idea of how many people support a candidate in the end. That's why it's important that people in non-swing states do not capitulate to the demands they vote for Biden. If Biden wins, best-case scenario is he just scrapes by.
She really was one of the worst picks Biden could have made.  She probably hurts him more than she helps him, and she doesn’t bring any significant demo to the table for votes

Trump got people fired up with his awfulness. I guess you can call that a positive. I don't doubt that more people are recognizing the value of social democracy, for instance, but Biden isn't and DNC types are pushing back. I'm arguing against complacency, not for pessimism.
Well then Biden gone win lol
Biden has said he would veto M4A. The wing of the Democratic Party that houses Biden and Harris is the wing that attempted to primary all those progressive candidates. They're not on our side.
By that logic, choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate means Biden is for Trump.
It is going to be interesting watching how the press spins up the Biden VP pick after the party dumped her in the primaries.  Get ready for Oprah to jump on board.  #Trump2020
Kristol already making excuses for Biden.  I feel for the guy and the senior abuse he is taking but the Dems have sent him to the stage so all is fair at this point.  Just hard to watch.
Actually it was right last time. It's all percentages.. Flip a coin 10 times, you're going to get 7 Bidens and 3 Trumps. Not that dissimilar from 2016.. Biden is favored, but Trump still has meaningful chance, as nauseating as that sounds..
It surprised me because I thought his handlers would be able to overrule Biden's consistently terrible judgment in this instance. That they were unable to keep him from selecting a cop in the current political climate bodes ill for a Biden presidency.
Those acts are probably much closer to Biden's instincts than anything remotely "progressive."
No true republican would vote for biden ticket. These fake posts are ridiculous
oops...hinting Biden is racist (by hanging out with the wrong ppl and "racist" policies.   yes to banning guns by executive order, yes to getting rid of cash bail, provide full govt healthcare to illegal immigrants, Abolishing private health insurance for citizens. just my take..
Don't let optimism make you a sucker. Biden has been in politics his entire life, and he's been remarkably consistent his entire career. He's not suddenly becoming a progressive in his seventies.   The man just chose a cop as a running mate. Use some sense.
the pandering comes from her saying yes to everything everyone asked her because she thought it would give her votes (i didn't). Yes to banning plastic straws, yes to the greennew deal, yes that biden is a racist and she believes he sexually assaulted women...
Well said, April! You endured a lot from those evil racist people, but with God’s Grace and Love you made it through! I am ecstatic about Vice President Biden’s, VP pick! Sen. Kamala Harris is going to be our first black VP, and she will be amazing! We have to make it happen! 🙏🏾
Voting Green puts them closer to the 5% that triggers federal funding, and it tells Dems they are losing voters to the left. A Biden vote is reassurance Dems can keep drifting right.  I don't blame anyone in a swing state for voting Biden, but we're not all hostages.
Biden is a serial liar with fascist inclinations and a solid history writing racist "law and order" legislation. He just picked a cop for a running mate. If you think he's going to make anything "progressive" on his website a priority, you're kidding yourself.
Something tells me that Biden/Harris will not be the ultimate ticket for the dems.
Somehow I believe Biden/Harris will not be the final ticket for the Dems. Are they just placeholders?
Y’all worried about Biden’s running mate, and yet you have a man in office who don’t care whether or not you watch your family members die (via Skype, FaceTime, or Zoom) from a virus 🦠 he initially called a HOAX! I’m voting BLUE!
Kamala is a cop. Biden-Harris is still better than Trump-Pence, but let's not kid ourselves—that these our the choices is a failure of democracy.
It took her that long to figure this out??  That was the whole reason/purpose for choosing a black woman v.p.!  Just another step in their grand scheme - no way Biden will last 1 yr in office if elected.
Does anyone really believe that Biden/Harris will be on the final ticket for the Dems?
I can’t say that Biden will be different from most national politicians who might be President. He is for the Afforadable Care Act and preserving Social Security. I am too. Generally, he is moderate on most issues and so am I. He respects and supports the military. He is calm! 👍

I told a friend that he'd probably pick Harris because he seems to make the wrong choice every chance he gets. I guess that was less a joke and more an observation.   I'm not excited about Biden and have no intention of voting for him. Harris pushes me away, not toward.
So is Biden still a racist?? Oh well who cares! Smh , so she is an African American? Hmm India born mother and Jamaican father ? Guess that makes you a black woman married to a white powerful lawyer . How convenient to call yourself any race you want.

It's amazing how Harris can denounce Biden so stridently during the debates, and now it's all hunky dory, and Dems are orgasmic about this union.  No wonder politicians are universally viewed as lubricious opportunists who will sacrifice every shred of integrity for selfish gain.
Agreed with you, Heath. Momentous for all Americans for sure.  We’ll see how this plays out, but I’m hopeful w/ Biden’s history of moderacy we’ll truly see some, &amp; I hate to use the term, but, ‘reaching across the aisle’ to enact legislation to benefit the America ppl as a whole

Joe Biden just lost the election! He might have had a chance if he had picked Tulsi.

TOP ADVISERS HAVE REVEALED NEXT PRESIDENT PICK TO BIDEN.
Biggest dangears facing Biden is how far Barr, Guiliani McConnell,Graham, trump willing to go!
Rice would make a terrible VP and Harris a terrible AG. Biden and his administration is not what America needs right now. Are we really going to elect the same elites that we just recently removed form office.
For real? Because they said first week of August so I don't really believe their timeline at this point... (Totally voting for Biden/? ticket, just frustrated with all the delays)
I would love to been there when he saw the footage of Biden on the bike. He knows he couldn't possibly do that.
😂😂 I didn’t say it wasn’t bad.  But he’s got nothin on Biden 😂😂
Please, Even the democrats deplore Biden. If he was really ahead we wouldn't be seeing all this Covid,  BLM , and mail in voting BS.
Obviously a gaffe.  But if you push political beliefs aside, Biden is the king of gaffes.  In one day he asked an AA journalist if he did a cocaine test, stuttered when trying to say mental fitness and the said all black people think the same....unlike Hispanics. 🤦‍♂️
I think Biden would be better off without Hillary.
Mayor Pete as VP, or having any important role in Joe Biden’s cabinet, is possibly the worst timeline.
Mail in ballots are rejected at far higher rates than in person voting (due to voter error). Because of this, “... Joe Biden may need to be running ahead of Trump by more than 5 points with people who intend to vote to actually receive more valid votes in the final count.”
#Democrats need to STOP encouraging over-reliance on absentee voting. Why? In a study from Georgia in 2018, the rejection rate for absentee ballots was as high as 17%. That means Biden would need a significantly higher portion of the vote. #MaskUp #VoteEarly #VoteInPerson
I’m sure Biden will lead the way on that.   TRUE GUTS and GLORY MAN.         no dis respect of your opinion but this is a once in a lifetime event that had a herd mentality of sickness And healing.   China will have to pay for this and the leader that preaches that wins.
A classic from Conway:  I believe it’s normal for the president to say “Yo Semites” and “Yo Seminites,” “Thigh Land,” “Minne-a-napolis,” “toe-tally-taria-tism,” “Thomas Jeffers” and “Ulyss-eus S. Grant.” I believe it’s Biden who’s cognitively impaired.
Biden’s VP pick will not be what you expect or want.
Biden picking Mayor Pete as VP or announcing him as a high ranking cabinet secretary overshadowing a female vp would be pure comedy.
Does Biden even know what he is saying, or for that matter where the Hell he is even at?
Wishing/hoping China's despots care at all abt human rights or climate change or anything we care abt is foolish unless we (and everyone else) is tough with them.  Do you really think Saudi Arabia, Germany (just to name two) will support full sanctions on China? Or Joe Biden?

Joe (joe's handlers), You do know that this is false, investigated by the Obama/Biden justice department and determined that Michael Brown did in fact attempt to take the officer's pistol before he was killed in a justified shooting? Might need to fact check before tweeting.

Democrat Byrd was openly racist till mid-80s. Democrat Biden supported his anti-desegregation bills in MODERN history. Not 50s, 60s, 70s!  If David Duke apologized would you vote for him as Congressman or President? Seems “KKK Leader” would be irredeemable like the swastika.
So what’s your point? Biden is being asked to take it for a reason. And whatever reason President Trump took it.... he passed. TRUMP2020!!
- since Michael Brown tried to grab an officers gun through the car window and punched him repeatedly. Our, Obama and Biden, DOJ ruled as much. -  There. I fixed it for you. 🖕🏻🤦🏻‍♂️

Believe me Putin wants Biden as president of AmericaJust use plain paper. Or just permit assignment of voting rights since the win margin for Biden (if he wins) will be less than the number of illegal votes. Dems are going to cheat anyway.
Trump assertion that Biden would "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God" shows an astounding lack of understanding of Christian theology as well as a cynical politicalization of it.

Do you not see that Joe Biden is a weak feeble old man that can’t put one coherent sentence together? He’s unqualified. You can hate Trump all you want but Biden is unfit mentally and corrupt with his past dealings with China.
Yes, Biden got rich selling influence. You can't be that uninformed...
He got his son millions out of  Ukraine. Trump didn't get his money out of selling influence in office. Joe Biden, don't have a business, where did his money come from. Wake up!!!!! He sold our manufacturing base to China and Mexico.
She’s horrible. Crooked as the day is long. She left people to die in Benghazi. Nobody wants to see or hear from her. Other than that, she’s great.   Biden isn’t going to win the election anyway.
They can’t! They only believe what they are told. No free thinking! Biden-Kamala will do all that for him!
Show some stats of expert stated facts!? That right, Biden truth over facts! Who’s truth?!
As long as Biden/Harris are stepping all over our Constitutional rights forcing ALL people to wear masks - suggest they mandate that ALL people must wear underwear - pubic hairs falling out can spread the Virus

He is working for the America people. Joe Biden was in Washington for 40 years, he didn't work for the people. He got Joe and his family rich.
In January, while Trump was dismissing it, Joe Biden said:
I have hope that Joe Biden will restore our democracy as it was before Trump stepped in.
Kamala Harris only speaks knowledge of what she knows that’s happened between her legs . When uncle Joe Biden miss pronounced her name she was probably on her knees giving him a pump up job . That’s why sleeping Joe was smiling and said her name wrong.  Great for each other
"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or for Trump, then you ain't black."  -Joe Biden
how are you making this criticism while still promoting and endorsing joe biden. do you hear your hypocrisy?
you were the one tweeting that bernie delegates needed to meet biden &amp; team with *charm* and be friendly, all while the tara reade story was breaking, survivors were ignored, &amp; i was losing my hair b/c bernie endorsed the alleged rapist without hesitation
Old Captain America look a tad too much like Joe Biden.
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
4 Biden signs just on my mostly apolitical street. My neighbor who voted for Trump is as nice as he's ever been. And there's one lonely Trump flag a few streets over.  It's kind of tied itself into knots around the pole. I don't think the owner knows or cares.  A metaphor.
Biden gave the nation hope today, I made a donation to his campaign.
If Biden is elected I will get  感谢主 tattooed on my arm!
Please hold all Biden/Harris complaints until they've won the race. We need people to vote, and constant complaining will cause some to abstain.

No, thank you for admitting Biden has mental issues. Trump had the economy going... Stood up to China, while Biden took money from China. Now, In America we can't get Lysol and  91% alcohol, why, because people like Biden cut deals with the Chi-Cons...
its y’all talking about kamala harris like her nd biden aint our only choice fa me
If Trump don't know that fact, hell look it up.... Google it, general knowledge don't make you smart. Specialize knowledge is everything. Joe Biden, 40 years in Washington, what did he accomplished.

Just got off the road, purposely avoided the news the whole drive back. I’m glad Biden selected  Lets do this!
This election is Trump vs. Biden. There is no 3rd option, there is no “neither” option. Trump or Biden. Take your pick, America.
If Biden wanted to win all he had to do was pick Bernie Sanders as his VP
I am planning on voting / supporting Biden regardless. Kamala is not my first choice but I will get behind her 100%. ❤️ And, I’m also very happy for Maya Rudolph too, looks like she’ll have plenty of work for a while. 😂
Biden didn’t pick her. The Dems did.

BREAKING: Biden to announce VP pick on  #KHive
Just hear me out... if Biden announced his VP pick was Ivanka then probably Trump would spontaneously combust. We could elect whomever we want because shark = jumped. This is actually a brilliant plan that you should sit with for a moment.
.  who do you think Biden will pick to finish out the last 3 years and 11 months of his term?
You sister are getting that check. I get it, but you should be ashamed of yourself. Biden need to be under some care of a doctor, not on a campaign trail, or hiding in the basement. Too much stress for this old man. Come on man!
Biden's bike ride the other day must have really hit a sensitive nerve with Trumpsters. I'm seeing a lot of ridicule about it on FB.
And Biden is the one with cognitive issues?
NO WE CAN’T GET HIM OUT OF HERE !!!!!! Go Mr. Biden get him out.
What a contrast, Trump facing the fire “Do I seem rattled?” Biden cowering in his basement.
Wow, Biden is falling in the polls. May be time to campaign.
I am patient. I do not care who he chooses.  Harris would be my choice, but I will vote Biden no matter what.  ❤ There is your damn heart.
joe biden: a woman in power
Biden can not even get a neighborhood pot luck basement party.
Biden called reporter a junkie and insulted the African American community. Bet Dems are proud of him.
Sounds like Obama/Biden
With regard to Biden on his bycycle. Serous issue. Should he be driving at his age? Did you see him swerving. Every American family must stop reckless incompetent seniors when they have lost it. Time to take his license?
Wow Trump is surging in the polls. Biden you can run, but you can’t hide. I’m sorry, it’s time to face the music. America can not stomach a coward. Show up or step aside!
My prayer is that Biden wins in such a landslide that all arguments against it are moot.
Tell me this, which ones did Biden help while he’s been in office for 40 years? I’ll wait.
Not me! Incomprehensible,  even for Joe Biden.
Why isn’t Joe Biden coming out in public to explain his racist comments. Who knows if he even wrote a retraction tweet. He needs to explain to Chris Wallace if he is being misunderstood. It sounded racist to me.
Joe Biden doesn't even have a plan for his next pudding.
Not Joe Biden being All for One lmaooooo
"Oh Lord, please keep thyself safe from Joe Biden. Word is he's out to hurt you."
Man, you Biden worshippers can’t form a sentence without mentioning Trump.
I think it is so mean how Biden’s handlers hide him away in a basement all day. Then they bring him out and try to parade him out like a trick pony and hope he doesn’t screw up. But he is just not able to even perform for even a few minutes. He obviously is not up to this.
Why has the Democrat establishment dumped Biden on us as our choice for President? Real sick how his handlers hide him in a basement. Then parade him out and hope he doesn’t screw up. But he is demented and embarrasses himself every time.
When Biden says something racist, it’s a gaffe.  That’s just bullshit.
You have to go back to 1973 to find something on Trump yet I can go back two days on something on Biden!
Have you listened to Biden?So much poetic justice. We must work very, very hard to make sure we can say President Biden. Or maybe Obama as AG

Joe Biden will not take the presidency this November.
In disbelief. Def not w/ voting. Trump 2020. Trump is doing great and hasn't harmed his campiagn like Biden has. She was no help cause she can b bought. She hated him now his  VP ? She called him a racist and backed that woman he molested. Now she is his running mate. She has a $
You are still vile...
Yep.  dem debates were rigged so Biden would win. Bernie has been cheated out of it twice cause he /warren don't fit the plan. They need a puppet or one involved in their plan. Kamaala called him racist and the woman that came out she backed over the sexual attacks. She has a $
Joe Biden has suffered some absolutely horrible losses in his life. His wife &amp; daughter in a car accident, and son to cancer... I will never celebrate that or think in my head “wrong Biden”... bc I can’t imagine what he’s gone through. My issues w/him are political. Not personal
The  USPS has ceased to be as efficient or effective as its competitors. They consistently lose money that all of us pay the price for. Obama ignored this in order to placate unions &amp; voters. So did Biden. Blame them for not repairing it and passing the buck. It's time.

Biden Raises $48 Million in 48 Hours After Picking Harris as VP
Someone needs to ask her if she still believes Biden’s accuser and of so why would she work for someone like that.
Biden can win the popular vote by 5 million but lose the electoral college. we need a constitutional amendment to get rid of it but we need to get rid of the electoral college it doesn't make Sense 21st century. The GOP has gerrymanderedwhere it's impossible for the Dems to win
I thank them for their service 🇺🇸. But Biden will be controlled by the far left. I like Trumps policies much more than Biden. I also think Biden is unfit to be President due to his declining mental health, very rapid. He also doesn’t take questions which worries me!
Congratulation ISREAL and UAE for having a historic deal of the 2020s decade. However, Iran, China and even the Biden’s supporters don’t want to see this success of  being in the middle of this deal #goodjobuae #goodjobisrael

I'm so confused by this. So you are a black indian jamaican American? Or are we just pander to voters based off race now? When she was selected by Biden. CNN only called her the first black women selected. Never mentioned her Indian heritage. Interesting.
Biden is tainted to the core.   He’s the worst of all political animals.   A long term “grip and grin” politico seeking to enrich an entire family. And an extended family.
How the hell could any police union or department not endorse the President over Biden
Just curious. When you later find out that Trump lied to make a point, does that discredit him for you or does it matter?  Is there any policy position stated during a  debate in which Trump would lose your vote or Biden would gain your vote?
Oh u like pedi biden. Nvm this convo
Well I already heard voting for anyone but Biden is just voting for trump....... people are dumb..
Well if Biden would have been leading he would have quadrupled our problem by not doing a travel ban so he could be more woke like you...    You’re just as much a fraud as mass mail in ballots

Biden is probably forbidden by his handlers to do 1 on 1 interviews after the disasters that have happened when they let him go off script. Biden is a train wreck.

Yes, I do think so. Freedom of speech is crucial. Biden may try to limit our freedom of speech, but he is constrained: He has to look like he is not limiting speech. Trump has no such constraint.
Ma’am, all due respect, Joe Biden is DO disrespectful to black communities. You can go WAAY back. Look up interviews of Trump and Biden back before they became famous. I am NOT a Trump supporter - just investigate everything. That is all we are saying!
This guy is a keyboard hero, like Biden, leaks  his true nature and doesn't even know it.  We stick to our values, our beliefs and our founding principles, he changes his with the wind.  Run along little rabbit...

Girl. Joe Biden literally told Black ppl they aint Black if they DONT vote for him. Words &lt; actions. Pay attention. You dont even have to like Trump bc he does say ignorant things, but Kamala &amp; Joe, are playing us as we speak.
Freedom of the press is abused by the press. Corporate control of content messaging,reporters looking for sensationalism,hoping to be first to report even if it’s not true is causing deep distrust. If Biden can fit another issue I hope he tackles media monopolies.
Biden or Harris should do one after fact checking him   please do this🙏🏻
Biden is just like your music: remarkably insipid and better ten years ago.
If they had endorsed Biden/Harris, your tweet wouldn't exist.
I think newspapers endorsing candidates is potentially more harmful. Also, I think groups endorsing a candidate is a silly tradition. However, I imagine if the NYPD union had endorsed Joe Biden, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wouldn’t have had any issue with it.
I’m not “Bernie or Bust,” but I’m also not in favor of shaming disenfranchised voters for not wanting to participate in a broken system. However, I am in favor of shaming Biden for not doing enough to appeal to progressives. If he loses, it’s his fault, not the voters’.

I agree and everyone else does, we just need a clown show, some intertertainment, for old times sake. And what better clown than Biden? Kamala adds the spice, and it’s nice. They cannot give support to the current potus, without spoiling the 2-party delusion which runs currently.

African-American is a label that they give you when you are born African-American. I dont deny her heritage , im concerned why she wait 55 years to actually identify as one. Im concerned why she called Joe Biden a Segragationist aka a racist and then agree to be his VP.
The for-profit prison industry—including TN-based CoreCivic—is backing Trump’s re-election. Joe Biden is a critic of private prisons.
Im tired of this race narrative. It becoming abusive.  We just had a black president for Christ sake. We need to stand up and know when we are being pushed around. Ain’t no one racist except for the people carrying on about race... oh and Joe Biden.
Black People are brainwashed by democrats... if they actually looked up what joe biden has done for black people and compare that to trump.... Trump would be the one who did the most.
“Trump has the tendency of being an authoritarian and may damage the American fabric, American democracy permanently because that is what our adversaries and his biggest benefactor, Russia, wants."

Liar. Actual Leftists agree: Trump's dangerous, evil, &amp; must go. But so must Biden &amp; centrism. We see NO hope in your party &amp; none (and even less humanity) -- in   feign "wokeness" yet ignore the poor while insisting they OWN us.  We're done. #ItsTheSystemStupid
If you think 78 year old feeble Joe Biden is “all of sudden” going to fix and bring changes in 2021 after he has spent 47 years in the government and was the VICE PRESIDENT for 2 terms. You’re the problem and you’re just not that smart and very blinded. #dobetter #Trump2020
You forget that Trump is running against Biden. And Trump losing by a large margin even in most swing states. Keep hanging onto his coattails. You deserve to go together. You will be 4 yrs behind, but gone, nonetheless.
Indefensible that kneeling is unpatriotic but stealing USPS mail boxes is.  Ds aren’t interested in this chaos, Biden’s winning and Trump knows it. They’re more likely to vote by mail b/c of Covid. Rs are more likely to vote in person.  Trump knows if he loses he’s going to jail.
If you honestly believe there is nothing wrong with Biden, and chose to ignore his cognitive decline, you might be more oblivious than him.
I feel like if Barr can get to the bottom of #RussiaGate he can hold people accountable for #BengaziGate. Oddly enough it's almost the same exact people. Clinton, Biden, Rice and Obama need to be locked up for a long time and major damages paid to the families of the 4 heroes.
Joe Biden is not fucking chicken.

You can't have everything you want.. but you better believe if Biden wins.. you won't have squat left for retirement.. and YOU vote for him? Then it's your own damn fault.
Joe Biden is making his point with his speeches. He is also being smart by watching you Donald implode by your nonsensical word search during your speeches &amp; total lack of intellect &amp; integrity in trying to answer reporters questions.
On Twitter people are like: “Biden has a lead but we can’t let up. Keep the preasure on through election day so he will win.”  On Facebook: “The DEMs are trying to lose on purpose so Leftists can keep attacking Trump.”  It’s two worlds.

Opinion | How Jennifer O’Malley Dillon transformed Joe Biden’s campaign
Of coarse you dont... no one seems to care about joe biden telling us we wasnt black if we didnt vote for him, or say we weren't ass diverse as the Latino community and callin a black reporter a junkie, how about his 1994 crime bill, locking up thousands of blacks
That is easy to answer, Joe Biden is not causing corruption and destruction hourly like you
Thats not good enough of an excuse. Joe Biden told everyone we wasn't Black if we didnt vote for him then she pretends to be Black. Thats not differences aside thats her wanting power.... Trump fends for himself while being attacked by the media all day. #Trump2020
The principal of an elementary school in Tennessee (Marion County) is being investigated for posting offensive images of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, on social media.
ENTHUSIASM for Joe Biden, absolutely.  ENTHUSIASM to rid the country of trump, GOD YES!  2016 you bitched and moaned about illegal voting and YOU WON.  IS an ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT
That’s what I figured, because Biden who is senile and creepy around kids with a VP that was corrupt and locked up a ton in California would be a lot better. And China endorsed Biden per pelosi
It’s shocking that people would vote for Biden thinking he’ll do better while he doesn’t know what he’s saying in appearances or where he is on campaign visits.
I’d love to have a discussion with someone that legit thinks he is going to be a better president vs “I’m voting for Biden because I hate trump”
Neither does Biden-Harris in videos. Even hugging people. Hypocrites! #trump2020

Because they have records of doing the opposite. Biden's is pretty extensive. So you're either voting for someone who is atrocious or someone who has an atrocious record. Hence electoralism is bs.

with ranked choice there wouldn't have to have been the mass dropping out of other candidates all rallying behind biden; polls had shown sanders support among many of the candidates that dropped for biden. he would have had a larger chance to win
Joe Biden tells me I'm not Black if I dont vote him.  Told me that Latinos are more diverse than me Asked a Black Reporter was he a junkie Has a History of Segragation and hate for the gay community. I assure you Trump is not a racist

Or, as one former Biden official put it: “I don’t think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he’s the nominee.”  Lol

Is Biden using his clairvoyant skills when predicting we need to wear mask “at least 3 more months” or is it a coincidence that date falls right after the election?  Hmmm? 🤔

Nobody said it's all him, but it's a counterpoint to the idea that reform would be more likely under Biden.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden called for governors to implement mask mandates for the next three months on Thursday.
the reason it's fine to criticize Biden and Kamala isn't because anybody wants Trump to be president.   it's because the weaker and more beleaguered they are stumbling into the white house, the easier it will be for the Congress to set an agenda, even over Biden's objections
Biden says Trump don't want an Election, and that's a complete Lie!
Let's hope Biden doesn't dissappoint with one of his insane gaffes live😅

memo to  birther contingent:  save your breath. you’re wasting hour time.  every one of us have made peace with the ticket.  Biden wasn’t even in my top five, and i’ve made peace with voting for him - you really think you stand a chance in hell of scaring me NOW?  fuck off.
I really can’t believe that people are going to keep on voting for the lesser of two evils. Joe and Kamala are going to maintain the status quo. All the BLM protests in vain if we elect Biden who wrote the infamous crime bill and cop, Kamala, who didn’t prosecute the SoT Mnuchin.
One of the things that scares the hell out of me about Harris is her continued support for busing. The only good thing I can say about Joe Biden is that he at least at one time opposed this atrocious policy.  This is something they both should be asked about.
Picture it: Nov 3, 2020. Biden has just been elected POTUS. Taylor Swift &amp; I sneak into Trump election night HQ and perform the We Are Never Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things mashup from the Rep Tour. We stream it on TikTok. Invites sent via USPS.
Before you trip about a potential Biden and Kamala presidency, remember that we survived:  Carter Wilson FDR  And many will even add Trump to the list.  The republic isn’t falling, it’s just doing what republics do.  We had internment camps a lifetime ago. Masks aren’t that.
Biden and Harris lie every time they open their mouth!  However, Biden doesn’t even remember it bc of his dementia!!
There’s an irony in people accusing Trump of signaling racism when Biden wrote it into law.

Trump calling Biden "anti-science" is HILARIOUS.
So you actually want Biden to win?  Why?
If we flip the Senate Trump will not be able to pass anything. If we do not flip the Senate Biden will not be able to pass anything or get any of his agenda  executed. Congress has more power than the president. Plus they will continue to place biased judges.
I mean Biden is not going to make it through the term. How long is he going to be in charge without all his facilities? There will be no stability in the white house till he steps down and then no telling what happens
Been saying this for weeks. He's biding his time and likely will announce some phoney criminal investigation into Biden in October simply to stir additional chaos before the election. Any accusation doesn't have to be true, it simply needs to be announced.
How is waving the holy scripture outside of church blasphemy? The threatening comments must stop! I’ve lived a long life. As a woman I fully support trump. Everyone has said or done things when they were young, Biden voted for segregation back in the day before your time
Wow my heart is actually lifted today with the thought of Biden &amp; Harris 2020. And 2024 who knows Harris and ?

Great points by Lewis. Need to vote in person where possible, so that it will be obvious on Election Day that that Biden is the clear cut winner. If results are delayed, Trump will cause more disruption and doubt.

And one that is adaptable.  Like calling Biden a segregationist and a womanizer, then standing with him.  The opportunity for power is an amazing thing.
Heaven help you if you seriously bank on Biden/Harris to do anything, ever.
We need to flip the Senate almost more than get Trump out. He will be a lame duck president if we flip the Senate. Biden will be if we do not.
I thought Biden won because he was endorsed by Clyburn.
MSNBC &amp; CNN is for Joe Biden. FOX is for President Trump. You want unbiased coverage, switch it to the Local network. #FridayThoughts
Now: After his first coronavirus briefing, Joe Biden gives a new specific request - Every governor should mandate masks.  "When I get occasionally confronted by a person in public about wearing a mask, I say 'Look, this is America. Be a patriot.'"  So, here’s my question... 2/x
1) May 20th - Biden’s first major public appearance since the COVID outbreak. 2) June 20th - Herman Cain at Trump’s Tulsa rally. 3) July 11th - President Trump at Walter Reed, the first time wearing a mask in public. 1/x
TRUST FACTOR: Who do you trust more to handle the COVID-19 response? Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris?
You're proud mean that racist?? Her family owned slaves no more than 250 years ago. Her family profited off human trafficking &amp; you're posting a picture of you smiling with her that's sick. How many POC ancestors were hurt &amp; killed by her family?? She called Joe Biden a racist
Which is why Biden picked her. . . .
While I was in HotSprings Arkansas yesterday I saw patriots putting this sign up as that very reminder that our religious rights will be taken away under a Biden and Harris presidency.  Vote Trump!  #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica  #Trump2020
Obama is running point for Biden camp via Harris ... The comrade abides.... any takers?
Sure the #Kurds are cheering on this act of political opportunism with ya Sen  Abandoned compassionate conservatism, McCain &amp; Biden family as friends &amp; now enjoying recess after abandoning tens of million COVID unemployed.  Coward
😎Donald Trump Jr. Releases Video Showcasing Joe Biden's 'Creepiest Hits'
And yes the Ukraine phone call was all good. Nothing illegal which means the impeachment was a false impeachment. also your silent about Joe biden's quid pro quo when he fired verisma investigator and bragged about holding up billions of dollars. Kamala Harris family owned slaves
Fuck your bias. Biden didn’t select Harris....
At yesterday’s coronavirus “briefing,” President Trump launched a partisan attack of Joe Biden, calling him "regressive," "anti-scientific" and "defeatist."
Add that the DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY leaders EMBRACE the LOOTERS and high crime. So you think a vice president CANDIDATE who once thought that Joe Biden was racist and a sexual harrassment candidate....the Miss KAMALA HARRIS is going to fool the voters?
Pence warns of what will happen to middle class during a Biden presidency  via  America could not sustain even one term with Biden/Harris. They, together, would transform America to become a Socialist or Communist State. We would forfeit all...
This must be another Joe Biden Plagiarism!
Does Joe Biden have more hair now? A quicker wit now? Makes better choices now? These questions are a diversion. Joe is a diversion for Lady K!
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back
Next level pearl-clutching from fucker carlson here. Not surprising, but just talk to a leftist. We are not excited about voting for Biden. We are not expecting to “move” him to the left. We ARE excited to do whatever necessary to remove shitstain fledgling dictator trump nov 3rd
It all came through pragmatic leaders slowly making progress. Biden and Harris are part of that legacy and will help make things better.
Kamala,  do you honestly think you and Biden are going to win? Especially when you can't stand him?
Joe Biden likes it when kids rub the hairs on his legs and jump on his lap. And he calls them roaches.
VP PENCE: “We're not gonna let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!”
How many questions can Joe Biden answer in 1 hour?
Biden wants every American citizen to wear a mask, but what about all those other people?
He can’t bankrupt his way out of a loss that he won’t be able to accept. He is literally destroying a staple of America dating back to the 1800s for political purposes. Saying it with his chest and nobody in government going to stop him. Some helping him. But Joe Biden 😂😂
Commentary: Joe Biden Goes All in on Defund the Police with Kamala Harris VP Pick
Dr. Carol M. Swain Explains Why Kamala Harris Is a Bad Choice for Joe Biden
There’s no win here for the American middle class. If Trump wins, it’s another 4 years of investigations and riots. If Biden wins, it’s a massive re-regulation of business and tax hikes.
Biden better look out. Looks like he’s next.
Joe Biden doesn’t drink alcohol? Wow.
If she is not eligible to be POTUS, she can not be VP either. This needs to be investigated asap. If Biden wins ::shudder:: and decides to step back, and heels-up is found to be ineligible, then Nancy ::hic:: Pelosi becomes POTUS. And we CANNOT let that happen! 😠😠😠😠
Exactly.  This could hurt Biden/Harris just a little bit.
Newt, who taught the GOP to bastardize the English language to make politics the cesspool of stupidity it is today. His PAC has a special place in hell. Biden is worth a million Gingriches. As are Ms. Harris and Ms. Pelosi. They have what Newt lacks. A conscience and courage.
Masks need to be worn!  Kamala Harris has to wear a mask so she doesn’t randomly put phallic objects in her mouth. Joe Biden has to wear a mask so he doesn’t randomly sniff underage girls.
😂😂😂😂😂Your lying arse is hanging mate Biden has you by over 10 points..get packing your gonna be history at long last.
Add it to the list of what "Biden gets wrong"
This is kinda worst case scenario. The Trump admin might not be able to simply jail Biden a la Brazil/Lula but this sure does feel like another way to straight up kill democracy in the 21st century. The GOP couldn’t care less.
Kamala will be president a week after biden is elected
Oopsie! Looks like Biden's camp  made a booboo with a meandering sentence that is easily misread! Donald Trump would never make/say/do anything as "clueless" as this!
I need a Biden sign as big as the fence in my backyard since my neighbor it backs up to put up a trump flag.
Hey, dumbass... Biden was Vice-President when we got Bin Laden.
Responses are timed.  If nothing else, Biden can simply say: "Folks, let that response sink in," and wait out the time.  Most of what Trump has to say cannot survive reflection.
I’m voting for Joe Biden... I’ve vote for Kamala Harris twice before... attorney general and senator... what’s your record?
I can’t believe there is One. Single. Vote. For a dementia patient.   Biden is a loser.    No matter the poll.
Biden/Harris pee anywhere for all of America.

You and little whiney Acosta just make everyone see what a great  we have. I hear Biden's out of his basement, go ask him some questions. Oh wait, that's right, QuidProJoe doesn't answer questions. Oh well, you gave it your best shot!! #MAGA #Trump2020 #KAG  #NoJoe
I’m sure Lee does what he does to please the WH. However I wouldnt start packing cause I don’t think Biden would let that stick!
I hear you. Biden talking about a federal mask mandate. Let's see you enforce that. Biden can kiss my a55!
Harris is not for as anything. Look at her record which ever the way the wind blows. She is for Harris. But as she and Biden says first things taxes up 300%, energy jobs gone, jobs that are left given to foreigners, you will have 100 days to give up your guns on and on
Who are they polling?  I talk to dozens of people every day and I never hear anyone say they are for Biden. They all think he has left the building and that's being nice. Today after VP pick everybody is laughing about he sure doesn't want to win. They are having a hoot
She’ll roll that into the Biden campaign.
Having a lot of money is never a problem but there is coming a point in the campaign cycle where each side is going become much more cautious and focused on how they spend. My inclination is that Biden will invest in traditional media + digital while Trump in organizing + digital
You aren’t an Average American, I refuse to believe that the Average American shares your lack of intelligence. Regardless, Basement Biden is going to get beat like a rent mule come November. Find a sports book and bet on Trump bc that will be the only thing you’ve winning in Nov
"Schools should have never been political" says the President of the nation's largest teachers union while also giving her open support to Joe Biden. Let the kids go back to school, teachers want to teach. COVID stats are being distorted and misconstrued to create panic
Hot take: this is more interesting than your opinion of Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate.
how dare he let kids gaze upon our Gods creation. And don't even pretend like you haven't seen ol' Biden screw up a speech either. You see his mandatory mask speech? the old battleaxe kamala harris backed him up on it, AND THEY WALKED AWAY CUZ THEY WERE TOO SCARED 4 QUESTIONS!!!!
being on this platform full of idiotic people as yourself. and REPUBLICANS FOR BIDEN? How does that make sense, AT ALL?
But Biden did say FDR spoke to the Country on TV during the Great Depression. That was pre dementia
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Trump nor Biden, get my vote. My voice matters,  this I know So, My hallelujah is for the Trumpet of GOD to Blow.  #2020Election #Trending #JesusSaves #fixitjesus #
This statement alone should make you not vote for Biden/Harris. ICE is in no way like the KKK. Our ICE officials need to be allowed to do their jobs not be hindered by liberal Democrats. Period!! Illegal is not a race.
Just wks ago Biden lost 3M of Clinton's 2016 TX vote to progressives including demos Dems need    Hispanics: He got 29% to Clinton's 71%.  18-29: He got 13% to Clinton's 40%  Yet no convention speeches from TX superstars, Beto+Castro, who win both-Announcing they need Bloomberg!

If Biden and Kamala get elected and this gets 100k retweets I’ll get the Andy Bernard Nard Dog tattooed on my ass
I mean, she sprinted backwards in an interview after raising her hand. Not surprised at all, plus Biden said it will not cross his desk in the NPR interview.
You trying to buy some Biden merch? I told myself screw it and bought some stickers and mugs, I honestly don't care how it looks in the future to anyone snooping in my business tbh
Harris was a champion of women, Blasey-Ford &amp; believe all women. She doggedly went after Kavenaugh when she believed he was a teenage, sexual predator. She is now the champion of Joe Biden. Has she changed her mind or sold her soul for power? Can’t be both!
So long story short, I gave the Biden campaign $1, can’t say I didn’t do anything
Yeah I’m there with you. This tweet came from me wanting a Biden sign to put in my yard because Trump signs plaque my area so I wanted to throw a little spice in there, but it’s this weird thought process because I don’t want people to think I like him either 😂
Outnumbered 8/13/20 FULL| Breaking News Today August 13, 2020  via  Neither Biden or Harris are worthy of the offices they are running for. Harris is by far a very racist individual, and together they would love to destroy America’s financial wealth
I'm not a supporter of Biden. But I will tell you there are significant numbers of Indian Americans that support him. I do not know why but they do.
Good riddance to anyone not supporting Biden. This is what you serve.
And at the press conference today, Biden and Heels Up announced their proposed national mask mandate.  But why do they take off their silly masks to speak?
Don’t worry everyone we are going to hold Joe Biden accountable
The idea that a per formative act such as putting pronouns in a bio should inspire hope is incredibly lazy. She has been the VP nom for not even a week and has abandoned every progressive stance she had. Mfa, believe women, he opposition to Biden’s racism, all gone instantly.
It is horrible that birtherism is again an issue. It is horrible that, according to the NYT, the Biden campaign had to consider it w/r/t Senator Duckworth. And it is horrible that too many people are indulging in this racist rhetoric, and too many are willing to not call it out.
Curious, since she's running with Joe Biden, one of whose most endearing qualities was his willingness when young not to prioritize his career at the expense of *his* family.  A good dad and a good mom--what's not to like?
I think I saw you mention this a while ago, but I'd be really interested in seeing a video on how you think Trump will attack Biden from the left during this election cycle. Foreign policy is obvious, but do you think he has the balls to go for UBI?
Joe Biden will never ever ever be President...ever.
What American families want and demand is for you to do your job; at the very least, pretend harder that you’re an empathetic, Christian man.  Some people age with grace, like Joe Biden. Some people turn into Ebenezer Scrooge - that would be you.  Hopefully ghosts will visit you.
I really think Biden/Harris are going to win!

Kamala Harris is going to be a fantastic vice president. The nation will be lucky to have her. She and Joe Biden will make a good team, they complement each other very well.
Biden voted for segregation back before your time! Would a Catholic do that? Is that the Christian way?
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.

The One Tweet That Pretty Much Captures How Progressives Feel About Kamala Harris as Biden's VP Pick
Those aren't federal laws. So your argument would be that the tens of thousands of people in prison now for small-time possession (courtesy of both Biden and Harris) are there to keep me safe? All laws are good if their makers had good intentions?
Similar here in Central PA, I have seen one Biden yard sign this summer.
Also, are we fighting all Nashvillians for Biden?
What we should be asking is why did Biden choose a cop as VP during the year of #BLM? Kamala spent her career locking up minorities for nonviolent crimes.
Is Biden president already? No. This is Trump projecting and placing blame elsewhere for exactly what he has done
Very bold of you to not also acknowledge the possibility of an electoral college tie, but maybe you’re right that either Biden or Trump will win outright.

JOE BIDEN: "Every single American should be wearing a mask when they are outside for the next three months at a minimum."   "The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives."  "It's not about your rights. It's about your responsibility."
To be fair, I think any candidate in Biden’s shoes would be chosen for the same reason.  Trump is THAT awful.  If it were Bernie, I imagine people would be giving the same reason.
The policy that Trump overturned was enacted by the Obama/Biden admin. I suppose that is the extent of his relevance to the topic. I thought we were speaking of the fact that suburbanites overwhelmingly support the president’s decision.
I don't want to sound alarmist, but at what point in October is Biden forced to tell people to vote in person, since the USPS cannot be trusted?

Biden and Harris are not above criticism, but it’s not right to be like this just because someone like Sanders or Warren didn’t win the nomination. Bigger issues than Democrats not being progressive enough for some
Why the HELL would anyone vote for a Biden Presidency.
Umm they support Biden
I’m not an extremist, I’m just not a moron...  I’m not voting for a guy in Biden that has dementia, and a extremely progressive person like Harris. Let me know if you need someone to talk to on Nov 4th, because you apparently believe the polls and are in for a shock.

a reminder: kamala harris is not our savior. joe biden is not our savior. they are the only vehicle we have to transport us closer to a better and more equitable future.
I'm also confident that Biden and Harris will work very hard to re-establish our good relationships with our allies around the world. And that's going to take some work, there is a lot that needs to be repaired
I wish Trump would say anything biden said. Just once. Let them go bananas for a day then the next day reveal what he did.
They must secretly have some sadomasochistic hope that Trump is going to win and push us further toward the brink, if we’re not already there. I see no political advantage in his continuance. Biden is an unfortunate reality. Kamala is a good move.

Baby. I was going to vote Biden any way. Whoever he picked.
THIS is our greatest concern as a nation at this moment. All polls show that the Biden/Harris ticket will win—in a FAIR election. The only way Trump can prevail is by cheating.   WHAT DO WE DO TO STOP HIM?
Right!  Biden will be the end of America.  Wake up America.  He and Harris already said they will raise taxes.
Exactly.  Biden is a liar and worse, a corrupt criminal politician.

The numbers are inflated by using probable cases. The numbers are wrong with false positives &amp; negatives &amp; people receiving results when they were never tested. And, like it or not the motive it political. The left (look at Biden/Harris) are using to run against the POTUS.

No ones listening to either one of them. Its blah blah at this point. I think most Democrats can see what side thier breads buttered on. They want jobs an money an insurance etc they can hear the lies these two biden/Harris are spewing. Democrats are not dumb they see the crap
They’re terrified of BIDEN-HARRIS. This is just the tip of the iceberg of how desperate they will get.

trump is not just scared of Biden/Harris, he’s terrified. Mission accomplished!
Dan is as senile as Biden if he believes that.  She won less than 1% in her own party against a senile old man.  The media will boost her big time but she is a lousy candidate with a bad record.  She does nothing to help their ticket as her few constituents are already on board.
Clearly, Joe Biden doesn't have money in the stock market... the economy seems pretty good from where I am sitting!

Trump isn’t taking away social security.                                                             Biden had 40+ years  to do something, he has done nothing. 8 years as VP, he did nothing.
Love it!  Then Biden counters asking for all of Ivanka’s/Jared’s businesses dealings with China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.   As long as we are looking into the kids, toss in Donnie-boy and Eric’s  business dealings with any foreign interest since Trump became Pres. Great idea!
SO DOES KAMALA HARRIS STILL BELIEVE JOE BIDEN'S SEXUAL ACCUSERS?
I am onboard the Biden ticket, however, I do not see it fair or honorable that those practicing their faith should be ostracized and not supported equally,  just as the LGBTQ community seeks support. Why should it be a one-way street? Biden/Harris must be tread carefully here.
Felt the same way as I watched the presser alone. Wondering if others were as inspired &amp; as excited about the Biden/Harris ticket. Still depressed at the demonic forces going after them. Praying,  for this win, our return to sanity,  and their protection from the tRump cult💙
The coalition needs to be large enough and influential enough to be *capable* of forming a militia or turning violent at the very least, but building that coalition will, as a matter of fact, be more intensive under a Trump administration than a Biden administration.
Thank you Joe Biden for remembering Heather
Biden said he would select an African-American woman as his VP. He chose Kamala Harris who is NOT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN.  Harris is Indian (India) &amp; Jamaican.  Her ancestors were Slave owners according to her Father, a Stanford University Professor.  WTF? LMAO! Biden is a RACIST!
Wow! All that can be done by Joe Biden. He is incredible!

Sorry, let’s elect Biden to rid us of the Trump Covid-19
Trump can speak extemporaneously for two hours straight. Biden needs a teleprompter to say "I'm Joe Biden and I'm running for... you know... the thing..."
That's because Trump and Biden both have Dementia. Boring,,boring. Lol
While we're here, I want to emphasize that the Trump campaign is using a dead man's Twitter account to call Biden's campaign nuts
There must be someone writing Biden’s tweets for him too, not sure he could type out any kind of thought on his own
Trump supporters are sycophants. Not conservatives. John McCain was a conservative. The Lincoln Project are conservatives. Republicans for Biden are conservatives. Trump is a disgrace, and the GOP will have a massive reckoning to rebuild the party. It's a joke right now. A joke.

We seriously can’t afford this right now. No, we shouldn’t go easy on Biden and Harris but we also can’t afford to risk 4 (?) more years of trump.

You can bet your ass that Butt-plug will be appointed to a significant national security agency if Biden wins. People on here laughed at me last year when I said that he would be a top 3 primary contender. Sure enough, he wins Iowa &amp; New Hampshire. They're forcing the ghey agenda
wondering if rump etal will throw him to the curb since their plot to draw all black voters to him has been thwarted by Biden's evil genius. (joking, but I really feel sorry for Kanye, he's being so used!)

I really don’t like Biden, and I think Harris was a terrible choice. And yet he’s roughly 150x better choice than the alternative. Voted for Bush, McCain, Romney. ‘16 I voted 3rd party, but I have to vote for Biden this year. Trump isn’t acceptable. #LincolnVoter

I am so hopeful in you and Joe Biden to get us out of this mess and civil liberties to be equal. Please please do the right thing!
Both of those are lies. Trump has a presser everyday this week. Last time Biden answered questions he had a list of friendly reporters to call on. This isn't my opinion. All news networks are complaining Biden won't take questions. Not a good look.
Never is, apparently. Why are they so scared to let Biden talk? Trump takes 100 questions a day.

Let me be very clear though. Biden and Harris don’t care about the average citizen, but the do care greatly about their wealthy donors. The amount of pressure even bigger amounts of unrest will press on them from those donors losing money is why they will act. It takes a nation.

Hey, she was chosen only because she was a Black woman. With her, Biden was able to mark all the check boxes and satisfy his base. Her job now is to emphasize her race and gender, mute the conversation and label anyone who criticizes her as racist. Anything but talk the issues

I'm so happy. Thank you Joe Biden for picking  ! Love you both!
I don't think attacking the Dem ticket will get us where we need to be on police reform and justice. Biden and Harris will make informed decisions on making the needed changes with input from their left. She did her job as Prosecutor now she has a new job.

Or a huge increase in Biden’s first term.  Can’t hardly wait! 💰💰💰💰
I’m OK with Trump’s actions because it highlights the fecklessness of the GOP Senate and sets a nice precedent for President Joe Biden to do whatever he damn well pleases in 2021.  Not to mention the precedent that Trump’s actions set for a future President AOC.

I've been betting as many people as possible lol, everyone think I like trump, it's actually quite the opposite, I'm betting with the uneducated, uniformed, racist bigotry. I got my money on white supremacy this November plus I think Joe Biden was the wrong candidate

Good thing there is no evidence or proof to support that lie. Obama/Biden destroyed our manufacturing and economy until Trump and magic wand undid Obama/Biden damage. BTW you are not constitutionally eligible to hold the office of VP or President.
So just because I’m black.. ppl feel I’m automatically voting for Biden that’s really fucked up i think.

It is scary to have a president like Biden with his pedophilic behavior.

No! I knew that’s was Trump attention when I seen them two idiots hugging. Trump trying to get some votes 🗳 away from Biden. The only people I see voting for West is prostitutes. Maybe them. No one can be that stupid..... I don’t think!?
The boomers listened to the msm and voted Biden. So they can go forth into November without me.

This person slept her way into power, lied to keep people on death row, locked up more POC in prison then any other state AG in California history, called Biden a racist, got only 3% of the Democrats vote in primaries??  Ya, ok, she da one!! Already lost the race!
Biden is just as racist as trump if not more
Libs need to get a grip. Joe Biden is trash
I totally support Biden/Harris. We must continue to fight the good fight.
It’s hilarious to see the right try and attack Biden or Kamala when trump has done everything they are saying but 10 times worse 😂 electing trump has given the reps no ground to stand on. you’re all hypocrits idk how much more I can watch. Bout time to check out for the election
Joe biden? You reading this?
What’s real crazy about all this is that I bet some of the people Trump has pardoned for non-violent drug offenses were in prison as a result of Joe Biden’s crime bill.
I can’t vote for either of them. I’m going to sit this presidential election out again. Did the same thing last time. I damn sure ain’t voting for the DNC ticket. Between her and the Biden bill, I bet 500,000 people have gone to jail for non violent Crimes.
chastised  for being racist, but now intends to serve as his VP? Why? Because she won’t actually have to serve with him. Biden finally confessed that he was too old to serve as President, and Harris would take the reigns in 2021.  #TrumpPence2020 #WalkAway
I'm most definitely betting with trump over Biden and that weak ass Vp selection
Well, that was not a subtle way to say Biden would make a fool of himself. What are you scared of Billie??
Wonder what happens the first time Biden tries to squeeze her ass? Going to happen! He will squeeze her ass &amp; she will become President! First Black female President after being picked by dementia Joe's handlers &amp; getting her ass squeezed! We should be proud! Biden must lose!
No real progressive is voting Biden. I know I won’t.

Y’all gave me a Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence ticket but in the same breath will look down on me for looking 3rd party....
Remember her unwillingness to follow the law and release innocents from jail.  Jailing parents for kids missing school.  Stealing parental custody when  parents were put in jail because of her policies.  Letting Mnuchin free for a donation.  Biden/Harris 2020 NO!
I really hope Biden was not counting on Bernie voters to support him. Harris is the perfect example of Corporate politician. She has proven to say and do what is necessary for a vote and then shove it in your face by making your life harder while lining her bank account.

To be fair, I think it was the best choice for Biden because she was surprisingly well-liked. However,  took her DOWN in the debates; pointing out her hypocrisy and her "establishment" agenda. Independent Conservatives aren't scared. She's just another problem IMO.
Thank You, President Biden.
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Biden Harris 2020 is finally real
Considering having Trump these last 3+years Biden would have to nuke the planet to be any worse
Hard to win an election when your party defects to the other side. Trump "does well" with GOP because the sane ones all ran for the hills when his corrupt, incompetent, racist ass came along.  But congrats being down 10 points and Biden over 50%: a good poll for Trump. Lmao.
Trump has pretty much never led a national poll in 2 election cycles. Even if he's "only" down 7, that's at least a Biden win and likely an ass whoopin. Obama beat McCain by 7 points and that translated to a 365 to 173 victory.
I don’t know how she can say that the President has done a lot to bring the country together when every time I listen to him speak I feel as if he is attacking me and anyone who thinks like me. He has never made me fill as if he represented me. #Biden 2020

Please show me how? When biden was for segregation, bernie was marching for civil rights. Bernie marched for abortion rights. Bernie has always been that guy while biden is a literal republican by voting record 😂
Biden doesn't have a history of sexually assaulting women, bankrupting 6 companies, fraud, stealing from a child's cancer charity, laundering money for Russians, telling 25+ lies, etc. etc. He's practically Holy in comparison. WTF are YOU smoking?
I’m never on the side of giving Democrats 4 more years of not doing shit. And I’m super sick of liberals acting like it’s my responsibility to vote for joe biden when he doesn’t represent me whatsoever

I have said for weeks that Biden will not debate the President because he cannot even coherently even talk. His handlers know it &amp; so does Biden's wife. He should not even see the oval office.
Biden cares for people!
They are already laughing at you. Joe Biden winning would allow them to take a break to catch their breath.
No surprise as she gets older she loses her faculties just like KKK-lovin’ Joe Hidin’ Biden. BLM is a Marxist organization and Dolly is too naive to believe anyone born here in America is a spoiled evil communist
I’m sure Fox can’t wait to criticize Biden for the same things Trump has done for the last 4 years. I’m looking forward to the greatest hits like the tan suit scandal and the great mustard debacle.
Vote for Biden. Period.
Because I don’t disagree? I will say Biden obviously isn’t a segregationist now, but I don’t have positive things to say about them. That’s not what this is about though. This is about the GOP’s hand being up your ass and using you like a puppet.
Both of my parents were in prison for marijuana charges. (Thanks joe biden)
Now do Joe Biden praising KKK Robert Byrd as a mentor and friend. Yeah, that was just 10 years ago.  I'll wait.
Marsha is really selling this Biden/Harris ticket.
Why can’t you be a unifier Mr.Biden?  Smearing the president will help you with leftist, Antifa, BLM and other Democrats but Not for moderate republicans or independents! Stop “stirring up the pot”!
Biden will hand this country over to China!
I propose that Biden’s handlers make sure his basement is well stocked with Depends (maybe 4  years worth), make sure his meals are puréed and his meds get taken.  We’ll check back in for the next 2024 Convention.
#BCPTODAY #TRUMPQNEWS #BCPNEWS THIS IS WHO MITT WANTS TO PROTECT BY BLOCKING COMEY SUBPOENA! BIDEN SLIDES IN POLLS. GREAT ECON NEWS
They've got nothing left but lies and gaslighting. They are counting 100% on the ignorance of their base and cheating. This party is dead. They know it, we know it, they know we know it. They also know many of then are facing prison when Biden is elected. They're desperate.
Fk you Joe Biden and the Kamal Harris you rode in on
takes you to the BIDEN &amp; HARRIS WEB-SIGHT
Unlike the Biden approach, your approach is guided by a total disregard for the lives of Americans, and has destroyed the American economy.
Joe Biden might have dementia but he’s still brighter than 45
Biden won’t debate
Our country did much better under Obama/Biden. We came back from the abyss. You brought us there again. Now we need a democrat to fix it. You and the GOP are the party of losers.

Lol you are vacuous Joe Biden
Harris is looking to be President soon as Biden has his accident.
Beijing Joe Biden is pretending to be Presidential and claimed he would institute masks Nationwide. He’s gambling that most people don’t know a President can’t order it, just request Governors to do so. Biden is good at getting $1.5 Billion dollar bribe from the Communist Chinese
She'll be President Kamala's pick for VP when Biden steps down for health reasons in March.
He’s now taking questions, somethibg that Biden refused to do
Nobody wants to hear from Biden. He never comes out of his basement, anyway
Then it’s equally illegal for Biden and Harris to do it.
Biden and Harris look presidential and Trump is dismantling the postal service.
Can be secure, definitely not the most secure though.  Biden campaign says casting ballots by mail is 'most secure form of voting,' as Trump warns of fraud
Fuck you Joe Biden and your fucking mask mandate iv worked this whole pandemic and not wore a mask and been around everybody 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕

Google Joe Biden racist comments and you will soon see that the NAACP would not have very good judgment if they ever endorsed Biden.

I am not necessarily in favor of Biden, but this douche needs his current political power taken away and fast. 🤮
So...we just learned fm WHO &amp; CDC that asymptomatic ppl arent infectious-no reason for masks or to social distance w/o symptoms! Yet Biden &amp; Harris show their draconian dictatorship! Wake up America! Biden calls for mandating Americans to wear masks
Just a snippet of what we are in for if this guy gets elected.

Why is  so afraid to debate  ? Why is  afraid to let Biden debate  before Americans start to vote? Voters deserve to see their candidates before a single vote is cast. #HigingBiden #LetBidenDebate

I get being hopeful that Biden can be a modicum of change. And he might. But he will still be against my best interest.  Don't get me wrong. I'm voting. Just not presidential. I will still be voting for my local and state representatives. I'm not giving up hope.
Asking me to vote for Biden as if he's genuinely better is ignoring that the system is broken. All Trump has done is set the new tone.  The Democrats are no more willing to help us than the Republicans. They're just okay sitting by and letting the GOP do the heavy lifting.

Thats right only adult children not only cause the young ones can't vote but Biden will most certainly molest them.
All sniveling GOPers involved to your eyeballs in trumpism grab your shirts. 75% of voters are fed up with third-grade style of cowardly name-shaming against Biden/Harris team 4 whom we’re voting November 3 through rain, snow, sleet or hail, with/without mail.    #TrumpKillsUSPS

1) Where have I mentioned Trump’s personality and personal history in our exchange?  2) When have I ignored Biden/Harris policies? I don’t agree with them either.  Learn how to not miss the point.
Corrupted GOP leadership is hamstrung from responding in America's best interests. Looking forward to having Biden in office to help us deal with threats to our security seriously.
Holiday-themed masks, Valentine's-themed, Easter-themed, Fourth of July-themed. I am hopeful that a Biden administration will implement a national pandemic response strategy that will keep us from having to see Halloween themed masks. But if we have four more years of Cheeto...

Ok so now do it to joe biden #fuckjoebiden
Hey David, fuck joe biden.
It’s because biden is the literal same. 🤣 it’s not a purity test. We just hold him to the same standard we hold trump to.
Just ignore her!     Biden is running, not her! Thanks
Biden/Harris are getting my vote but that doesn’t mean I like them.
So basically there’s about to be more people in prison for no reason if Biden gets elected...

When it’s held in November, Biden/Harris will win.
This is what we get to look forward to in the event that Biden wins - constant lying from the Biden camp !!!
With a straight face, Biden just said President Trump has been coddling terrorists around the world.🧐After Biden advised AGAINST taking out Bin Laden, now he’s ignoring that it was Pres. Trump who had Soleimani &amp; al-Baghdadi killed, the ISIS caliphate eliminated, and far more.
I agree it’s important to know more about him but he is such a small part of the picture. This is possibly the most important election ever. We don’t need to lose our focus. Get Biden into office. Hold him accountable and fight like hell for the changes we need.
Did you care about Mrs Kaine? Or Dr Biden? It seems like such a small thing to be concerned abt when the choice is literally our democracy or an authoritarian regime bent on destroying all social safety nets &amp; starting another civil war. I have other things to worry about.
Do you do so mindful of the women that Joe Biden sexually assaulted? ... or do you not believe them now?
Fuck. Joe. Biden.
I know Bernie was paid to go away but it would piss me off to know that Biden was the pick and most likely (if he were to win) have to step down next year and Harris would be the President.  Dang what games the Democrats play!
I’m no fan of his either, brother. But if my political science and voter math mind is working. I actually think Trump (politically) is much more intelligent than Biden. Trump knows exactly what base he needs to galvanize. Biden’s hiccups are misspeaks (often his actual thoughts).
It is a sad day in the mockery of Biden’s candidacy, and now, corrupt, no morals, Kamala Harris.
Nah. I’m not a billionaire and I have my biggest political donation yet to Biden/Harris today.
Where was Richard when this afternoon  Biden mispronounced "Kamala"...LOL
Yeah... none of those are Republicians... What part of Biden is Moderate and why would you want a leader to be moderate? You realize you are voting for a leader, right?
MY 4 brown daughters and sons are Born Again and they recognize Biden is a man of the World and Harris is an immoral women. All 4 will be voting for the first time and they are praying and voting for 45 to have 4 more years of prosperity!
Trump nor Biden* I just loathe both.
You didn’t hit a nerve at all. I just don’t really like politics that much in Twitterr. I try and leave that alone. But, I will say I won’t be swayed into voting Trump not Biden.
It’s not Bizarre. He’s in the race to damage Biden’s chances of winning.
Then you must dislike Biden...he likes &amp; is a pedophile. That is fact...yet with Pence you spew opinion and no peskyfacts to back up accusations about sexual predators. Can’t like one &amp; detest the other...that’s called hypocrisy. You aren’t that. Just overly bias &amp; a Sheepeople
Biden is going to get the shit kicked out of him.
You only ask for proof if you are defending a belief. Opinions on commitment vary from doctrine to doctrine. Obama and Biden basically ignored any and all faith based organizations. Additionally they ignored race relations. Accomplished nothing.
Can we elect Biden just to get these memes again?
Meanwhile Joe Biden mispronounced the DNC pick for his VP Candidate today the same one who called him a racist but you know Bad Orange Man  said a word. While Senile Joe proves why he stays in the basement. Debates will be a disaster for him.

RNC Chair McDaniel: Biden-Harris ticket shows radical extremists have seized control of Democratic Party
I’m looking forward to your meltdown and excuses when Biden wins in November. It’s a long term commitment seeing your posts but it’ll be worth it.
Joe biden authored the “tough on crime bill”  Joe biden supports cutting Medicare/social security (it’s on video so don’t deny it)  Joe biden is the reason protestors are being kidnapped currently.
In all seriousness though guys, the people who write Biden’s tweets completely lied. It is ESSENTIAL that both sides do not lie about the other side. It’s awful and deceptive and will continue to divide. Stand for truth :)
Biden isn’t left enough at all. He’s just as bought and sold by corporate America as anyone else. I don’t owe him shit.
You’re complicit in Americans dying from lack of healthcare. Trump outflanks biden on that by a long shot. A HUGE long shot
wow Biden just got caught by some guy named “I care about all chickens.” How embarrassing😂
THIS JUST IN. I AM A NAZI BECAUSE I EXPECT BETTER FROM A CANDIDTAE THAN JOE BIDEN
They don’t wanna stop it tho. Your candidate has CONSISTENTLY been for Continuing warfare in the Middle East. He is one of the most guilty people of furthering the prison industrial complex. If you were against those, you wouldn’t be voting biden period.
You’re for the continuing of endless war in other countries. You’re for the continuation of the prison industrial complex. You’re for the continuing of Americans dying from lack of healthcare. None of that is going to change under joe biden. Absolutely none of it.
Bishop I look up to you, always have and always will. But I have not forgotten her track record. Now I understand that in Nov. we HAVE to vote for someone and although I despise the current administration let’s not assume Biden and Harris will be our saving grace.
Yet somehow you think I have to vote for joe biden despite him not earning it from me.
I didn't vote for either Hillary or Trump in 2016. I won't make that mistake again. With Harris as VP I am excited to vote for Biden! #VoteBidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Actually, I’m looking forward to the night that Biden has to quarantine because of a potential Covid contact and sends in Harris to sub for him in a debate against T***p.
Biden and Harris need to be in prison along with the thugs from antifa
I was a huge Biden supporter in 1988....it’s good to be vindicated FINALLY....and Kamala Harris was my first choice this time around, so having the two of them together is just PERFECT!  What a great ticket we have, now let’s make it happen!
“Biden sometimes misspeaks”.  Seriously, sometimes? NO; His thoughts and words are incoherent, rambling and sometimes gibberish!  Our president took the cognitive test because of progressives pressures!  Lets see your nominee take one; doubt he could pass it!
I’m voting for Biden bc John Krasinski is not running.
That picture says nothing about Biden or Harris but everything about you. #TrumpHatesWomen

Tell us why that site is directed to Biden’s page?
Calling Joe Biden a creep and posting legitimate photos of him invading the personal space of others is against Facebook's community standards. Perhaps  and members of congress should hold Facebook accountable for their obvious bias
No reason to be insulting (although that’s typical of the left these days). I’m well educated about the issues. What, pray tell, do you think Biden will do now that he hasn’t cared to do over the last 40 years? And do you care about the proven persistent lies from Biden &amp; Kamala?
Nice.... some teenagers read tweets and yours is vulgar!  Be more thoughtful and think before you send tweets. What do you want the American people to do wear masks while hiking, riding bikes like ignorant Joe Biden,what’s your solution?  We need masks indoor and social distance
And how many questions did Biden/ Harris take today?
I hate Kamala Harris as much as the next person. She’s performative and she’s a hypocrite. But what I’m not about to do is single her out for backing Biden despite attacking him in the primaries. Every rational candidate would do the same. Warren? She did it. Sanders? He did it.
Electing Joe Biden is a step backwards...electing trump is two steps backward. Good luck everybody!
Biden has embraced Cory Booker’s strategy for ending single-family zoning in the suburbs and creating what you might call “little downtowns” in the suburbs.
After watching Joe Biden at his press conference. Democrats will never allow him to Debate Trump

Oh please, the media would've still ignored the story even without Biden's announcement.
If y’all really don’t think Biden is being used as a puppet you’re delusional
Exactly the opposite, Joe Biden is a pandering racist!  Did you forget that he called Barack Obama in 2007 in the Democratic debates “a clean, ... African American,” tell me that’s Not racist? You’re quite delusional! You give NO evidence of our president being one.
Amee’s post is literally the same mindset as Biden’s “poor kids are just as bright as white kids” comment. It’s toxic and terrible
Everyone knows Biden is just a placeholder. I would expect within his first month in office he would resign due to health reasons. He is like a house you buy just for the land. Fortunately, he'll be destroyed if he attempts a debate.
🤔 The left will call you a racist if you support Trump, but they are okay with Biden supporting a leader within the KKK.. 🤦‍♀️🤔
Joe Biden is a “devout” backer of abortion on demand and Now for the American people to pay for abortions with our tax dollars!  Disgusting
Seriously?  Mike Pence can’t give a speech but Miss Harris can?  We’ll see.  You should be Terribly worried about Joe Biden debating Trump!  He’s the weakest presidential candidate in HISTORY!  Mr.Biden can’t string a long one coherent thought, anytime anywhere! “Come on Man!”

People aren’t voting for Biden peaple are voting for Harris. She stood no chance of winning when she was a candidate. What makes her so special now?
Joe Biden has ran for President since 1984, he has never won the nomination. Not sure he will this time either.
If Biden wins, Trump will not humbly accept defeat. And a large swath of the country will view the election results as fraudulent.   Foreign adversaries, including Russia, will circulate conspiracies of massive voter fraud.   And Trump will undermine Biden and promote it all.
Kellyanne Conway Reacts To Kamala Harris Chosen As Biden's VP
Here’s your regular reminder that good, upstanding, honest folks will vote for Trump and good, upstanding, honest folks will vote for Biden. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
When I did this for Biden previously, it was pretty easy.
if Biden is elected, this country will embrace socialism. Do you not think that the statements Biden has made are racist?
I’m not sure she wouldn’t support the socialists in her party (Bernie, The Squad, Warren) given the power.  Heck, I’m not really sure what her convictions are about anything.  She attacked Biden for not supporting busing when she herself didn’t support the same policy.
Biden picking Harris shows me Biden isn’t a petty or vindictive person.   I remember Harris taking a big cheap shot at Biden in the debates.
Some are saying Hillary/Obama as V.P. Anyone have other ideas? It's been discovered that pedophile John Podesta, DNC campaign official, played the role of Biden while wargaming possible strategies; refusing to concede, 3 states threatened to leave in protest of Trump's 2nd term.
My Vote Blue No Matter Who mom trusts Biden/Kamala to take defunding the police seriously &amp; yells at me when I call Kamala a cop
Am I correct in thinking if something happens to Biden (worse than his current condition), Kamala would be president and Nancy Pelosi would become VP?!?!  Elon, I am going to need a spot for the Mars trip.
Wait, why do people think it’s bad that Biden read from notes when selecting Harris? Has Trump really denigrated the office of President so completely that y’all think preparedness is a weakness? This is Biden’s biggest move yet as a candidate, I wouldnt want him to just wing it.
To hear Biden quoted by another person is like the ramblings of somebody on a bad LSD trip.
This would be the essence of a Biden administration. It would challenge ideas and result in better solutions. It would also allow more progressives a a seat at the table, preferably in the cabinet.
I’ve wondered this, too. What’s to be gained for Biden? Trump will obfuscate at best &amp;, more likely, just ramble incoherent nonsense. Moderators won’t hold him accountable. There’d be no real “debate” with Trump, either. Biden should just continue focused ads and stay on message.
I don’t see Biden or Harris on the ticket come November.

I was in the crowd in Knoxville last March and was deciding between your candidacy and that of Kamala Harris. You both withdrew in time for me to cast my vote for Joe Biden. I am proud of you for withdrawing from the VP choices, making Kamala the only logical choice. Perfection.

As long as it looks good who cares what they stand for.   Oooh I hope we can redecorate the child concentration camps that started when Biden was VP! Gotta fix up then optics baby.
Trump calls Democratic rival Biden's running mate Kamala Harris ‘meanest’, ‘most horrible’ senator, United States News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times
I’m upset a COP got chosen. Joe biden just spat in the faces of protestors by choosing her.
That’s not factual at all. We just care that she is a COP. Does that not get through your head? During the black lives matter movement, Joe Biden chose a cop. That says enough about where he stands
I'm not for Biden nor Kamala, but if we don't get Trump and Pence ass up outta there, it's gonna be straight up chaos... cause ain't nobody bout to keep dealing with these racist POS thinking they can do wtf they want wtf they want.
So I guess she’s voting for Trump. Per Biden.
Vote, just not for Biden
I can’t conceive of one thing in Harris’ background that would prevent anti-Trump Republicans from opposing Biden. Did they forget that Trump wouldn’t help and therefore let more people die of covid in states if the governor there didn’t praise Trump enough?!
Hey everyone tear down Biden and Harris so we get stuck with trump for another 4 years
The right wing fear tactic is back on full display, especially now that Biden chose Harris as his running mate.
If you’re 18+ you better go and vote Biden
Makes sense, Kamala Harris, Republicans hate her, progressives hate her, she hates Biden curious to see if this gives a boost or a dip or a stagnation in Biden’s numbers
Wait... is this the same Kamala Harris whom just last year, said that she believed “women who say they felt uncomfortable after receiving unwanted touching from former Vice President Joe Biden,”? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris could inherit a 21st-century National Space Council

So the damage wasn't so great that you wouldn't have voted for Biden but since you don't like his pick the damage is too great to vote for Biden? How does that make sense?

President  Reacts To Biden, Kamala Harris Ticket Exclusively On 'Hannity' | PART 1
Flashback: Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching
By picking Harris, Biden has officially elevated the establishment's second-favorite candidate (after the aging &amp; degenerating former VP) to front-runner for the 2024 nomination (Biden isn't wont run for a second term, &amp;  it's likely he won't finish out his first.
i'll admit i was getting kind of close to swallowing my pride and voting for Biden but Kamala? nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
What's Biden going to do to earn my vote? Not be Trump? Give me something to care about.
I think she might help Biden lose!!!! 🤔

They should use that in a Biden ad...
You endorsed Biden and you expect us to trust you to deliver our ballots?! No thanks!
the only way Biden wins is through mass voter fraud! Nobody has to prove citizenship, no chain of custody for ballots, no signature verification, party and signatures on the outside of envelopes in some counties, ballot-harvesting, dirty voter rolls...wth?!
Oh no!  The sorting machines!  Woe is me!  The horror!  What will they think of next to explain away Biden’s loss??
Biden should not be allowed to run for office if he is I'll. He should have to produce his health records.
Just stay in your basement Biden where you belong.
We know who will win, you are in denial!! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 !!!
I am in Tennessee and there are Trump signs EVERYWHERE!  I know it’s a red state, but to think there are still people that are all in for Trump after his disastrous first term is mind blowing.  I am not excited about Biden, but I can’t do another four years of killer Trump.
I tell you what. I appreciate the civil way you communicate with me. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. My two biggest issues are as follows:  I'm Anti-Gun (Democratic Lean) I'm Pro-Life (Republican Lean)  I don't trust Trump I don't trust Biden  Debating might sway my vote.
Joe Biden got caught rubbing on kamala Harris and people said that's joe dang.

You’re finished Biden. Sorry have your wife read this for you.
The image allegedly posted by Smith consisted of photos of presidential nominee Joe Biden &amp; his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, titled "The New Pad Party," labeling Biden with "pee pads" to mock his age &amp; labeling Harris "knee pads" in an offensive reference to sexual activity.
If they keep talking we can really drain the swamp
Just because she is a woman of color doesn’t mean she gets a pass! She is a terrible woman who would destroy this Country! You know good and well it is her that is running! Biden will end up “stepping aside” as CNN says.
Today you said you would have Congress pass a weapon confiscation Bill and if they didn’t act quickly enough “you “ would issue an Executive Order immediately. Whow, Nelly - the VP do squat! Unless you plan to off President Biden first. Sounds you’re dreaming!
Mr. Biden thanks for the suggestion on the mask. I think I will follow the leadership of my President Trump  !
Unfortunately ignoring a better candidate is even worse. I cannot support a man who is responsible for the state of our nation at the moment. Funny how that describes both Biden and Trump.
I am not a leftist but I am voting third party. The Libertarian candidate is more than capable. I will not support Trump or Biden, who helped create the mess we have. Third party is currently the best choice we have.
Absolute BS. And at the same time Biden doesn’t even allow questions. Such unfair garbage.
The Obama/Biden administration treated Israel horribly! You funded Iranian terrorists!
Ridiculous! Obama and Biden treated Israel horribly and sided with Iran, the biggest sponsor of terror, sending them pallets of cash in the middle of the night! Biden funded terrorists!

I'm so bummed that Bernie got screwed over. He was my choice. That doesn't mean I'm not gonna suck it up and vote Biden but..... Biden/Harris doesn't make me jump for joy either.
Biden/Harris 2020 swag bought.   Oh man.   Folks in SE Tennessee are going to just love me.
That makes Biden look pretty fit! And while we know that Biden can still ride a bike poor Trump can’t walk down a ramp...
So I can't criticize Biden or Harris about anything? Ever?
Biden doesn't stand a chance against Trump in the debates.
How about the people that feel Trump and Biden are not worth anything and do not know of 3rd parties?
Warm feeling watching Democrats melting down into globs while all Biden can can say is “Comon man”.
I'll vote for Biden/Harris, just to see Maya Rudolph for the next four years. One of my favorite actresses! #MayaRudolph
Obama-Biden's slogan was "Yes we can!"  I think Biden-Kamala's should be "We can try."
I hate that you feel that way. Biden’s mental incompetence is a sad situation. It’s pitiful that he’s made a laughing stock every time he says anything.
Vp debate will be the only good one. Trump is going to wipe the floor with Biden. They would be better off letting Harris and trump go at it 💯
I'll vote Biden but geez I'll always be disappointed Bernie got screwed...again.
Trump destroyed Hillary in the debates. He can definitely destroy a racist like Joe Biden.
Her family owned slaves. Her prosecutions of Black males goes right along with Biden’s 1994 crime bill.
I want my Biden/Harris 2020 bumper sticker immediately.
I’m not thrilled with Biden’s VP pick. I think Harris has a troubling record regarding police and justice reform in California. But I’m willing to listen, and I’m happy to be proved wrong. Still an easy vote for me.
She went out of her way to prosecute and jail Black men. Fits with Biden’s 1994 crime bill perfectly.
Biden didn’t pick anything! His handlers have chosen!
I call BS! All you have to do is look around at all the boat parades and pro-police rallies! Look at all the Trump signs versus Biden signs! They must be planning on doing some heavy cheating with mass mail-in voting! God will not be mocked!
Has anyone seen a Biden sign for president?  I see nothing but trump signs
Robin Williams died in 2014.  Biden was joke then &amp; has been a joke since then.
Michael Cohen claim Trump made NUMEROUS racist comments in talks. Actually several claim Trump has made such comments. *I am not excusing Biden in any way.
And now for some pure nonsense news from the world’s greatest source of nonsense news! 🤦🏻  Apparently, Biden riding a bike is 100% proof that he’s not only in tip-top physical shape, but fully mentally competent, as well.  Great journalism, #CNN 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait...is that “MS-13 Loving Now Biden”? They are really taking pains to keep it unbiased!
Really? Biden? So it's cool he can't put together an actual sentence, has a history groping kids and supports a party of historical racism. You see out of touch with reality.
As if Biden already hasn't said enough dumb stuff about black people, let's vote for a man who can't put together a coherent sentence while thinking about sniffing and touching children. Way to support the party of historical racism, the democratic party.
At least Biden can ride a bike while Trump can’t walk down a ramp...
Do you remember last election when the press said he wouldn't disavow white supremacist, even though he did it almost every interview?   So why won't Biden or Pelosi condemn this behavior? It hurts businesses and people just trying to live their life.
These are people that hate Trump. If Biden is elected, it will only embolden them to do more of this. These people rioted under obama as well, they are anarchist. Democrats keep pandering to them.
They all do it. Look at illan omar, she has paid her new husband 1.6 million. Trump was rich before he became president. He doesn't take a salary, neither does Ivanka and Jared. He can not make business decisions for Trump properties. Biden is not innocent in stocks either.
Same here, I have seen one Biden sign in our entire country and Trump signs everywhere

Exactly what policy of Biden do you support? Abortion until birth? Open borders? Defunding police? Getting rid of fossil fuels? Getting rid of our 2nd Amendment? Free healthcare to illegals at the expense of tax-paying citizens? The promise of higher taxes?
Except Trump can’t golf while in the White House so I doubt he can stay in there very long and Biden will just waltz right in.
I didn’t like legislation via executive order under Obama. Don’t like it under Trump. Won’t like it under Biden. We have three branches for a reason.
Gingrich: Biden embraces Chinese dictatorship   I wholeheartedly agree!
Thats how Biden chases kids!
I so love you. I wish I had the ease to share you cross platform. Your Biden is the best I have ever seen.Guess how many Biden flags were out on the water today
She still is obligated to vote with the people who voted in her primary on the first vote. It's literally how the convention is supposed to work. It doesn't matter if it's brokered. Biden still wins, but she still represents the voters
Such contempt for such a large voting block that he just begged for votes.
MSM keeps touting that Biden received over $40m in donations. Ask yourself how much of that was transferred from the BLM ActBlue account?
Where are all the Biden stores?  I’ve received three donation emails today! The merch should be for sale in campaign offices. #Democrats need to take a page out of the fleecer’s handbook.

No you're taking a position that more left leaning and liberal dems hold and trying to apply it to Biden, a solid centrist by all measures.  Just because the media says Biden is a 'radical leftist' doesn't make it so.
Biden has literally never been pro-de-fund the police. Trump was asked where he got that from in an interview, was given the "source" by his staff member, and couldn't find it in there on a Fox interview.

I'm wondering where West's 2% is coming from.   Trump has 14% of African American support now.   People are assuming the 2% is being peeled off of Biden's  numbers but I'm not so sure at least some of it isn't coming off of Trump's.   If so their scheme may backfire on them.
Poor old geriatric fool scratch and sniff pedophile joe blows Biden talks about failure of the most successful president in modern day history.that loves all Americans and liberty,Joe Biden is a sellout Ukraine and money laundries in fake CEO Hunter Biden to steal tax dollars.
BAWHAHA LOL JOE BLOWS BIDEN AND THE FART TART TURTLES.
I will most certainly vote early and would crawl across glass to cast my vote for Biden/Harris and send 45 packing.
I'm leaning toward Trump tries to steal the election which leads to a constitutional crisis. Courts hand it to Biden and then Biden sets to work being our version of Hoover but with no FDR to follow. By 2024 there is mass urban unrest and low level rural insurrection
Im quit puzzled on your stance. Uh, the Trumps don’t support this method of voting. Seems more likely that Hunter Biden would do that.
You have heard of Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden , right? The “devout Catholics” that have a consistent record of fighting for policies which are an utter abomination to the church, right?

Biden will be a force for reason and moderation.
Trump:  They will appoint radical left Supreme Court Justices. Truth:  Probably not.  Biden will more likely appoint moderate justices who are in line with mainstream America.
Trump:  They will open the borders. Truth:  Obama was called the "deporter in chief".  Biden/Harris will, most likely, implement reasonable policies, like allowing citizenship for "Dreamers."
Trump: They are not for Law and Order Truth: Biden was key player in 1994 landmark Crime bill; Harris a remarkably tough and effective prosecutor against crime.  They both will handle race relations better, and help things to calm down.
Trump: "They will take your guns." Truth:  They will get rid of loopholes that allow criminals to guy guns at gun shows (and online?) Trump:  They will bring socialized medicine. Truth:  Biden/Harris will keep Medicare, and shore up/improve Obamacare as needed.
Trump lies about Biden/Harris- corrected... (from FB, written by a friend)  Trump:  "Biden/Harris will raise your taxes" Truth:  They will get rid of the tax cuts for the rich, and maybe big businesses.
So, Biden wins, 102-94. Boom.

With her deep and long-standing ties to the Silicon Valley elite, Harris’s selection as Biden’s running mate has corporate leaders breathing a deep sigh of relief. Biden couldn’t be clearer he will be dedicated to shoring up a crumbling status quo.
I see the plan. In multiple democratic voting states sorting machines have been removed ect. In other states he will use Kanye to siphon off votes. If he wins Biden should not concede but challenge.

White supremacist are a group of old Democrats who hung with Robert Byrd. Like Biden, Hillary and many other old Democrats.
Wut.  No read between the lines here. They want someone for 12 years. They want to pass off the presidency to the VP after Biden's first term, and she doesn't want to commit 12 years. I don't know if she actually wanted to commit to 8, but 12 is a long time at that age.
The more I see the more I believe that this country is so divided. Just like the days before the civil war. I am dreading the election this year. Nobody will win. Because if Trump wins every thing burns if Biden wins every thing burns. This is what I have been tweeting and seeing

Question: would it be a sin if someone voted for Biden simply because they liked his name, or his appearance, or the state he is from, etc., while they personally knew nothing about his policies, beliefs, or convictions whatsoever?
saw a post on this earlier. someone sughested it’s based on the distinctiveness of the name. lots of ppl named Joe &amp; Donald, thus Biden and Trump. argued we call Pelosi by last name. Hillary by her first name so as to not confuse with the former president. 🤷‍♂️
This Suburban housewife will do everything I can to ensure Biden wins &amp; you go to prison for life along with your entire criminal family. Pedophiles, rapists, &amp; Mobsters belong behind bars. This suburban housewife finds you as a threat to women, children and the rule of law.
Kamala just made Biden’s campaign 1000x more hype

Maybe you should remind Mr. Biden how to pronounce Kamala before you make statements about someone else.
CNN and others freak out when Tucker says Kamala Harris wrong, what about when Biden pronounces it wrong at their first meeting together today? Hilarious. #Pridefamily  #FakeNews
Can’t wait to see you school Mike Pence. Ignore all the haters look who they voted for... if they can’t see how much Trump has damaged us here &amp; around the world -we are a laughing stock. Biden/Harris
Complete contrast - lovely inspired speeches by both! Not lying, made a few tears come.  Vote America! Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on November 3, 2020!
You are NOT wrong and I don’t believe that video exists.  Of course, Biden will say whatever they tell him to say.
If they can just get O Biden elected, it will all disappear
His act is due to hit the road to NYC on or about January 21st.   Biden &amp; Harris were inspired today!
I heard numerous people say the virus would disappear right after the election if Biden wins. He’s still perpetuating the horrible myth that the pandemic is a hoax.

Never. But Joe Biden and Ms Harris did a little while ago.
WOW!  Biden and Harris knocked it out of the Ball Park with their speeches this afternoon?   The trump presidency just had it's skids greased and it is up to YOU and I to shove it out of our White House on   November 3rd. Vote Americans, vote this cancer OUT!
it's sad that you are allowed in the  to give questions with such misinformation.  on Google doesn't go to Biden's website.  Just stop.  #LincolnVoter
DEBATE SCHEDULED: With Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden's vice-presidential pick, a match-up between the California senator and Vice President Mike Pence on the debate stage is now planned for October.
I changed the channel as soon as I heard this foolishness, would he prefer Biden held it in a country club like Trump? I am so glad they are expanding Deadline Whitehouse to two hours.
HARRIS &amp; HAMILTON COUNTY: Sen. Kamala Harris' candidacy is groundbreaking in more ways than one. Today,  spoke with local trailblazers to get their take on a Biden-Harris ticket.
I’im right behind the Biden Harris ticket. !!! Let’s kick some Butt n get that SATAN out of office
Hillary is evil and so is Kamala and Biden hope you have a good day and dont vote again!!!
Finally someone with something to say about Biden/Harris that doesn’t boil down to #NotTrump. Thank you  for actually giving me things to think about.
The reason Biden chose kamala is so that he can bring up his dead son in every single speaking engagement.
CNN was sore at  and did a whole segment on him for miss pronouncing Kamala’s  name last night. I wonder if they will be sore at Biden doing it tonight ? Lol. Hide your wallets if these two get the reins folks !

Agreed. But there are also a big chunk in the middle who support the BLM movement without supporting some sort of intense police reform. Trump himself has been saying “Don’t vote for Biden. He’ll abolish the police”. Now that argument goes out the window.

Williams says that she will still vote for the Biden-Harris ticket, calling it the "lesser of two evils."   "In a perfect world, we would have candidates that we can throw our full weight behind, but we don't. This is our reality," said Williams.
Some others are less enthusiastic, like Chattanooga pastor and Black Lives Matter activist Charlotte Williams.   "Her hands are not clean. Joe Biden's hands are not clean, but as I say, sometimes its best to deal with the devil that you know," said Williams.
It’s literally mentioned in every article before her political experience.  So not necessarily Biden’s team touting so much as MSM prioritizing that ahead of her accomplishments and qualifications.
"That's not a glass ceiling. That's a concrete ceiling," said Former Tennessee State House Rep. JoAnne Favors.  Favors is a longtime Biden supporter &amp; is beyond please with his running mate.   "I got a text message from Joe Biden's campaign. I was so excited. I was screaming."
Kamala Harris is on the brink of breaking the tallest glass ceiling in America.   Today, I spoke with two prominent Chattanooga women to get their take on Biden's historic VP pick.
So Biden needs to address the Tara Reid accusation again? Really? What exactly should he say? He has said it didn't happen and she's been shown to be an attention seeking liar. He's always been a bit too touchy feely but to call him a rapist is going too far. Let this go.
“She got out because she was considered not a good campaigner and she didn’t raise any money"
I don’t care what other people would think or not. That’s on them for being Hippocrits. I gave Biden credit for speaking up, he didn’t have to.
I’m donating $20.20 to the Biden/Harris campaign in my name, and another $20.20 to them in Doofus Donald Trumps name.
Point taken. I would love to see Biden interacting with our press corps in a free exchange, not some canned production
The question is who owns the domain for it. Did biden buy it to gain ground or did trump buy it to push the fact hes radical?
#BidenHarris2020  So latest slight is that when Biden loses his mind as president, Harris will be president. Somehow that's 'bad'. Bad like a woman president, or Bad like the POTUS thinks the 1917 pandemic ended WWII? Which one was more BAD?
For an account with a timeline like this one to be calling anything a joke is a massive joke unto itself. Biden??? GTFO.
Vice presidents hardly ever win the presidency. That would be a horrible mistake. They're going to retire Biden &amp; move Kamala in during the 1st term  They planned this. This is why Kamala got so much undue media attention in the primary. This is why Biden was spoofed to us.
And then eventually move on to "Biden can't drink water" "Biden can't handle ramps" and "Biden abused Einstein visas and chain migration for his wife and their family" because that's how much truth actually means to them.
Not only that but Biden was one of the first major politicians to come out for same sex marriage.   People’s opinions change.
NEW:  has local reaction to Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate:
I saw someone on here the otjer day going all through a thread trying to convince everyone why they should vote Biden. This person had “defund the police” in their username.  I had to tell them if you’re trying to justify him you should change that. It would be even more true now
I guess she changed her mind?

But Misha, Biden's not rich and he's never run the government.
In the weeks before Joe Biden named Kamala Harris his running mate, women's groups were readying a campaign of their own: shutting down sexist coverage &amp; disinformation about a nominee they say is headed for "brutal” attacks from internet haters.
If Leslie Knope knew that 2020 would yield a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket, she would the heck pass out.
Exactly. Don’t get me wrong Biden isn’t so great either but this is choosing lesser of 2 evils and a smart one would go with something else at this point before we rank ourselves
Wait there’s a core Biden base?
Joe Biden picks the black woman that accused him of being a racist for his Vice President in order to convince voters he’s not a racist! #UltimatePander
Priorities Biden/Harris  1. Bring this awful Coronavirus under control. 2. Fumigate the White House! 3. Make America Normal Again! 4. Cxl those worthless Executive Orders. 5. Take a deep breath, do not go golfing. 6. Start second day in office.
Accurate so do more. There are hundreds of Biden quotes that are just as damning as these. Put out a new one each week and start doing them on Harris now. Then include schiff for brains, masker and pelosi and you have a winning trifecta

For all those complaining, Biden could have picked Elmo from Sesame Street and I would have voted for him.   It’s either Biden or Trump, theres no in between here. We have 83 days to get our act together or 1,460 more days of the incompetent Trump Administration!
Dumbest thing you've heard so far...I guess that means you haven't heard that Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate and she identifies as African American.  Her dad is Jamician and her mom is from India.
Biden "picked" the only person with a worse record with black men.. #trainwreck better hop on the #TrumpTrain now!
You need to make an ad of the Democrat debates where Harris and Biden went after each other.  All the times she called him a racist would be good to show people.
With Kamyria Harris in office if Biden win it will be Massive voter fraud, Harris will have Mexican people here legally or not to vote for Biden, The dirty Democrates need to win so they can destroy our nation !!

Dude you are endorsing one of the authors of today's incarceration issue. They do not want to end the war on drugs, they do not want to support the American people. The only thing the Democrats have going for with Joe Biden is he isn't Trump. Vote Jo Jorgensen 2020 #Letherspeak
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.
Yep, Biden gets elected, then he is unable to serve. Harris is next up. Say NO.
Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris. Really terrible major party tickets for proponents of criminal justice reform. 2020 just keeps on giving.
At the end of the day, I am voting against Tr*mp. If you don’t vote Biden/Harris, you are voting for Tr*mp. Any argument against this ignores the reality of the US Electoral College System. If you want hope for all Americans, 4 more years isn’t gonna do it.

Where's the Biden Harris merch??? Joe, you're slacking!
Great adjectives all fit her completely. We all know how far she is willing to go to climb the ladder. Biden is sure that she will bend a knee to him also. The pervert and princess prostitute wasn’t hard to figure that ticket out.
I'm gonna have to sit down for a minute. My side hurts from laughing.  A Joe Biden / Kamala Harris ticket was just announced.  And the slogan is: #OneKneelsTheOtherFeels.  I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣
A lot of women of all colors will also be in Biden's Administration. Finally, it will really look like America. The days of White guys are gone and it is about time.
I don't think she is a great choice, the question is whether Biden , Harris is better than Trump , Pence. What do you think?
I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED I'M CRYING IN MY CAR AT WORK THIS IS SUCH GOOD NEWS THE FIRST IN TOO LONG!  Let's rebuild America better with Biden/Harris 2020.

Biden just sealed his defeat with this pick. Trump wins in November.

Evidently, some are ok with the serial predators.
Well, that's a compelling argument. You've certainly changed my mind! Biden has a 40+ year history of supporting conservative policy. You can literally pull it up on YouTube. If Ronald Regan came back to life, here be considered a moderate Democrat today.

Don't forget a vote for Joe Biden is for communism. A vote for Joe Biden is for more looting rioting and what peaceful protest
Not likely. All Biden has to do is hold the states that Clinton won in '16 and get Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania back. Those are traditionally blue wall states the Trump barely won. Biden is up by considerable margins in all three.

Well, Biden would be better than Trump, but that's a bar set so low it's underground.  Pence would probably be better than either (though his near pet-like devotion to Trump makes him not much better) and Harris would be better than Pence.  So... Harris &gt; Pence &gt; Biden &gt; Trump.
Biden waited very long on picking a VP so he could have an amazing week instead it was crappy and great for Trump!

Biden/Harris are the most hypocritical and definitely not religious of any kind as they openly support murder to even the smallest of human beings and government expense...
When more people say they will vote for Biden, but also more think their neighbors will vote Trump, you have an indication of a strong presence of the "shy Trump voter," resulting in skewed polls.

I would be overjoyed to hear Joe Biden condemn the riotous mobs that are destroying cities today in the same terms that Trump condemned the Charlottesville event, even given Trump's inadequate words at the time. So far, Biden has said nothing.
Uhhhh this was whole reason for Harris...to distract y’all from Biden...who cares about Harris stay focused on joe
Paging Team Trump: Here’s Your Pivot Point on Biden-Harris
Trump needs to call Biden an old sick demented person for lying and claiming trump called neo nazis very fine people. Accuse him of trying to start more riots

Constitution be Damned: Biden Announces Ineligible, Dual-Citizen, Sen. Kamala Harris as his Running Mate
why is this not fact checked or removed? We are dealing in very racially charged times and this will incite more riots and violence especially in Biden stronghold of Portland

Yet you are excluding the evil of abortion as Biden does not recognize it is an evil so you cannot say ALL in your candidate or your personal fight.
I would honestly rather have Sen. Harris as the actual democratic presidential candidate over Biden..   Biden just looks like somebody is forcing him to run 😂😂..
Biden doesn’t recognize life starts in the womb so you cannot agree with him/vote for him and then state you want justice for all including the unborn.
Joe Biden voted to give blacks a life sentence for crack and 30 years later he is a heartbeat away from legalizing crack. Joe is like a leaf in the wind
Biden and Harris have been responsible for funneling black men into the prison pipeline for years.. black America made the mistake of ignoring that same situation with President Clinton and a lot of black men faced and are still facing unjust sentences for criminal offenses..
I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER... I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.... I DO NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP...   However, I do like a few of his policies more than I like Biden’s
Yes Ms Pelosi we need you or Joe Biden. I like the person who’s running with Biden. This will be a great election year.
Last three times Biden was allowed to talk to people he called an old man fat, called a young woman a dog face pony soldier and called a young man at the car plant a jackass and told his staff to be quiet. All three asked very reasonable questions. Joe is reckless

So everyone knows that the VP will be president and she didn’t make it 1/2 way through the primary season.   That means that they expect Biden to at least make it to the election before they vote him off the island.   This whole thing is so weird.

How can biden release a commercial blaming trump for people dying of covid due to late response? Fauci wanted to keep America open trump didn’t, Biden wanted America open trump didn’t, pelosi wanted people in China town trump didn’t. Why would a Latino lady let her family be used

Four Americans died at Benghazi due to incompetence.  2997 died on 9-11 due, again, to incompetence.  How many Americans are dead and keep dying due to COVID-19 incompetence?   The GOP can scream "Benghazi!" all day on long TV and Biden just needs to say "Corona" in response.

Great of Biden to keep his emissions down like that 👍
We seriously can’t afford this right now. No, we shouldn’t go easy on Biden and Harris but we also can’t afford to risk 4 (?) more years of trump.
I’m amazed at the mainstream media. All the local and cable news outlets including Fox News showed the Biden news conference. But, when President Trump speaks, all the lib local and cable outlets don’t show it, except for Fox and OLN.
Why is Kamala speaking in a different voice...sounds like she's immitating a white middle class housewife.  Now she's praising Biden's deceased son... What about his other hiding criminal Hunter son!
I love the way Biden keeps pronouncing Kamala's name different Everytime he says it... hilarious!
Wonder how long Biden had to be rehearsed for his  inaccurate speech he is spewing.  What a bunch of bull?

Because they have records of doing the opposite. Biden's is pretty extensive. So you're either voting for someone who is atrocious or someone who has an atrocious record. Hence electoralism is bs.
Why in the world would Democrats, with Biden’s HUGE lead, want to chance losing ANY votes or  uncounted votes due to poor mail service or voters forgetting to mail back? Aren’t they afraid Biden May lose his victory? Fishy... very fishy... winners don’t take chances!
Is Biden using his clairvoyant skills when predicting we need to wear mask “at least 3 more months” or is it a coincidence that date falls right after the election?  Hmmm? 🤔

The ONLY thing Biden knows about the Corona virus is his basement! Has he met with business owners, families or patients for a first hand account? Has he been to different parts of the country to see the impact?  What makes him qualified in Covid...Google?
The President doesn't even make laws. Focusing on these issues with these candidates is pointless. And we've seen how Biden handles protest. Has everyone forgotten Occupy and Standing Rock?
Nobody said it's all him, but it's a counterpoint to the idea that reform would be more likely under Biden.
I really can’t believe that people are going to keep on voting for the lesser of two evils. Joe and Kamala are going to maintain the status quo. All the BLM protests in vain if we elect Biden who wrote the infamous crime bill and cop, Kamala, who didn’t prosecute the SoT Mnuchin.
Biden -leadership?????
Harris was a champion of women, Blasey-Ford &amp; believe all women. She doggedly went after Kavenaugh when she believed he was a teenage, sexual predator. She is now the champion of Joe Biden. Has she changed her mind or sold her soul for power? Can’t be both!
What we should be asking is why did Biden choose a cop as VP during the year of #BLM? Kamala spent her career locking up minorities for nonviolent crimes.
If Biden were to win.... how will there be an Inauguration? How will he serve as POTUS if he can’t come out of the basement? Do the  pandemic-clairvoyant-Democrats KNOW we won’t be dealing with the Pandemic by Inauguration Day?  Hmmm? 🤔

That is not what I said. Biden record is shit and he doesn’t support the agenda Americans need. I’m voting for him but I’m not going to white wash him and pretend he is the best candidate or even a decent candidate.
You can’t tell him anything. A complete thought has not been able to penetrate that hair glue. That’s why he repeats the same 35 words endlessly(&amp;bigly).  I am so looking forward to VP Biden &amp; “that nasty woman” to wipe the floor with him &amp; VP Jesus

Superman Biden now got Wonder Women Harris by his side. It now time to work.
I would have trouble voting for Biden so that will make it difficult. History has been made though which is good.
I had a shred of hope that a Biden administration might be more "normal" than a Trump administration. I was kind of right; but in a really horrible way. #MoreMassIncarceration
What an awkward conversation it must be for Kamala Harris to have with VP Biden that she believes his accusers. But I guess all that sexual stuff is old news at this point, right? (Unless there’s a R by your name.)
And Biden?
Of course Biden would be President. Doesn't that scare you?
Biden is “riding the fence” with his VP pick cause “she ain’t black”!
She was Barack Obama's pick that's who he wanted so they can move joe out jill biden will get alot of money as long as she lives and kamala harris will be President following bo orders for taking over this country that's the plan I think!
I think Biden should have picked a gay Asian male but you know the whole party is racist , anti gay , and anti male  so to bad there Georgie ....the fires are in the Dems hood sir , might want to pay a little more attention 😂😂😂
To bad the pick was mandated that it had to be a black woman rather than picking the best person for the job regardless of race or gender. If Biden goes into Alzheimer’s home then she is next in line... clever move by his handlers.
Well, at least the GOP can't say the Democrats want to defund the police anymore. Biden's working to elect one as VP!

No, but I have seen the  saddest President wanting to have his face on Mount Rushmore. What an ugly sight. Biden is smart, he’s letting you know who do all the talking. Another term of you kno who and America is gone.
Lol like when the GOP is actually campaigning for Joe Biden and doing a better job than progressive democrats
Biden sheep
To your original point, the Republican-led committee found that he did receive Russian help in the election &amp; that he did pressure Ukraine for info on Biden. If a Pres gets impeached, he/she has kind of asked for it
Biden will never debate trump...book it. The minute he does it’s over for him.
Tone-deaf campaign. Michael Brown was a victim of his own behavior, not police malfeasance. The Obama-Biden Justice Dept. vindicated the officer involved. Add to that the circumstances igniting the Ferguson powder keg were created by Democrat policies. Many by Biden specifically.
Hope that Biden ticket works out well for you. You probably wish we had another Romney or McCain -two guys who really gave us a chance to win. My advice-walk out the GOP door and never come back. The dems deserve you.

Biden doesn't even know he picked
I thought you were for American workers....   Why are your campaign hats produced in China?   Joe Biden's hats are union made right here in the U.S.A.  Sorry, I guess I'll vote Joe!
Check out where these campaign hats are produced. Trump's MAGA shit is from "Jina", and Biden's hats are union made in America.   What else do you need to know?
Despite democrats’ best effort to create virus fear porn and burn their own cities in the name of nearly-non-existent police racial brutality, Trump’s economy, stock market, and unemployment rates ARE STILL BETTER than when Joe Biden &amp; Obama left office.
There will be thousands of people employed making Biden/Harris campaign signs in the next few weeks.
I’d rather vote trump than Biden tbh 🤷‍♂️
Joe Biden's campaign tweeting about little girls; lots of reasons for thoughtful folks to support Biden, but maybe a bit of self-reflection, &amp; caution here, &amp; that YUCH reflex? Maybe Sen Harris' team should take over? Maybe?
It's "Joe Biden is too tough on crime and that's racist", but also "Joe Biden hates law and order and will let our cities burn." It's "we need to drain the swamp" but also "I already drained the swamp and we have the best people." It's "MAGA", but it's also "KAG."
The country needs Presidential debates. We need to see both side by side to answer questions. Make sure Biden doesn’t get the questions before debates!!!!
When will the democrats admit that Biden can’t do the job? Let him have a debate with President Trump and everyone will see how he is not able to be President. His wife and people close to him should be ashamed of themselves for using him like this.
Everyone remember when Kamillion Harris said she believes Joe Biden,s accusers. Wonder if she will flip flop on that like most Democrats are good at.
Biden will not win!!
Hell no will I vote for corruption Joe biden
I met Joe Biden last year. He was kind, thoughtful, and engaged. When I brought up trans rights, he got very serious. He leaned in and with a finger
Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate  via
🤦‍♂️ Joe Biden and Kamala Harris used Joe’s dead son to try to score cheap political points and sympathy votes today... while completely ignoring his LIVING son, but okay, yeah sure, Trump’s the one who will “do anything for power”, right? Shameful.
As a Tennessean, I can’t wait to vote you out and Biden in.
A negative Biden/Harris comment equals a positive Trump/Pence comment. This election is bigger than the Presidency.
Of course if Biden doesn't win, black folks like yourself will blame white  it.
Too bad Trump doesn't have a dead son to roll out at a political rally to try to drum up sympathy votes.🤦‍♂️ That was beyond pathetic, and petty. Not a single mention of Hunter, Biden's LIVING son, but both he and Kamala jumped on the Beau bandwagon today. What a horrible display.
You just completely misrepresented that entire exchange. Why would you do something like that? I listened to that entirely &amp; he stated that suburbia is a place where a lot of people aspire to live (ALL people) &amp; some regs under Obama/Biden allow high density/low income housing.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via   I only had $5 to give, but if we can all give a little, it can add up to a big message to Trump #BidenHarris2020Landslide
And a believer of Joe Biden’s accusers. 🤔 😂
🤣 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris roll out Biden's dead son today to score political points and sympathy votes (while completely ignoring his living son) and Soros thinks it's Trump that "will do anything"?!?🤦‍♂️
“You Ain’t Black” Biden is the only racist in this race. Kamala’s ancestor in Jamaica was a famous Plantaion slave owner.  Look up Hamilton Brown. Brown’s Town in Jamaica is named after him. #CNNNarrativeStreet
Seems like Joe Biden has a new link! Type  and check out who's website it is directed to! #WakeUpAmerica #Antifa #Biden #Trump2020
That's the dumbest and most false statement Biden has ever said lol Trump created the lowest unemployment rate in history so....
I’d give anything to hear Biden say Build Back Better 3 times in a row. #Trump2020
This Kamala/Biden event is going great. Very heartfelt discussion of Kamala’s relationship with Joe. She’s a strong speaker and they have chemistry, much more so than Trump/Pence.  I think Trump’s done for.
Under a Biden presidency, little girls everywhere will worry about this -
It's kind of crazy just how many of the most prominent politicians in the US have Jewish in-laws.  All three of Biden's kids married Jews.  Two of Trump's four (adult) kids married Jews.  Hillary's daughter married a Jew.  Kamala married a Jew.  Only Pence has no Jewish relatives
Oh for sure. And the best part is they'll end up helping the Dem ticket is they do it. "Kamala is a cop." "Biden supports Obamacare" 90% of normal people like those things lmao
The best part about those bernie cucks is that they talked themselves into a box where they either reluctantly support kamala/biden or they look like psycopaths. You can't go around saying trump is Literally Bringing Nazism Back for four years, then refuse to back his opponent.
Biden! we will vote him in, and then criticize him every single day. no free passes just because he’s a dem. biden and harris are problematic, but they aren’t reality tv star and his homophobic side kick level pure evil.
Unfortunately, Kasich has allowed his hatred of Trump to support Biden.  Kasich is a two-faced list and lackey for the DemocRATS.  He should be flooded with Tweets pointing to his hypocrisy
Looks like Joe Biden picked one of the ringleaders of the Kavanaugh hearings. Just imagine what she would do as VP. We have problems in this country if that liberal b**** Kamala Harris is the VP. Vote for Trump in 2020.
Seriously? These are the best two candidates you have?
Far dumber are the ex-Bernie bros like the Chapo guys who refuse to support Biden because Kamala's a cop, or he's too moderate or whatever.   Either you were bluffing when you swore Trump was a fascist maniac this time last year, or you're just totally amoral and don't care.
It's funny to make fun of the ex-Bernie people for reluctantly supporting Biden but it's actually pretty coherent.  A lot of these people genuinely believe Drumph is the next Hitler and the world is going to end from climate change. You can't think that way then just...not vote.
yall complained about trump for four straight years, and now yall voting for biden 😭😭😭
Again, at this point it seems purposeful. I can't think of any other reason why Biden would completely ignore the current political climate.
I️ wouldn’t vote for Biden . The VP he picked isn’t back nor did she ever identify herself as a black woman until now.  She’s Indian
Sorry dude, but naming Super Cop as VP during nationwide protests of police brutality is fucking tone deaf, and at this point it seems like even Biden wants Trump to win.  There's no excuse for it. He chose to disenfranchise yet again.
Woke up this morning feeling fine. Biden and Harris are on my mind.
I think that removing the current openly fascist regime is important, but I also recognize that Biden is very much a part of the imperialist/fascist machine that is our nation
I plan to vote for Biden because his brand of diet imperialism/fascism will be easier to resist. I agree ousting the current fascist regime is the most important thing. What I don't get is why the DNC/libs think that a republican and a cop are the ones to do it.
The term Bernie bros is exactly what I'm talking about 🙄 you've both just demonstrated my point beautifully.   Bernie was the compromise. Leftists fight fascism/imperialism. Libs just vote for the diet version.   I'm voting biden. But I'll still be in the streets if he wins.
Ha. Right?! I mean, I like Harris quite a bit. Biden creeps me out. But I wouldn’t throw Trump a life raft if he were drowning in front of his own damn family. He’s a disgusting human being.
That being said, there are valid critiques to be made about Biden and Harris(although her blackness is not one of them). I just don’t care to be subjected to them ad nauseam. Plus I fully don’t expect this election to be free and fair, so this all feels very moot.
We are so happy #katiecouric to see the Biden Harris ticket! It has been almost 4 years since we have had a real leader.  I am looking forward to seeing intelligence,integrity, class, and diplomacy will be in our WH again! Everyone please join me in making this a landslide win.
For the record, not that anyone cares, I’m voting Biden/Harris bc I am terrified at the prospect of Trump apportioning RBG’s SCOTUS sweat to a regressive, and appointing additional federal judges, in addition to him turning the US into even more of a dictatorship.
*Adds “Kamala” “Harris” “Biden” and “election” to muted words*
King Drone has Biden and Harris mixed up with trump and his corrupt family.  All the trumpeters are shttg their pants bc they know trump will be out in Nov and they will need rocks again.  #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden can be pushed around. Joe Biden is movable. If elected Joe Biden will be told what to do and the liberal Democrats will destroy our country for many many years to come. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 VOTE FOR TRUMP IN 2020 TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Biden: *sees BLM*  Biden (probably): I need to choose a VP that will really energize the progressive base in these trying times, especially the poor and underrepresented communities in our country. We need to beat Trump!  ALSO BIDEN: *picks a fucking cop*
Biden just wants to collect the title for the books then let her do the work.
It’s certainly a PR release, but I suspect it’s a real shot of the conversation. I don’t know why you’d stage it that way otherwise. Also, was the “C’mon, man” a Biden parody? Because if so, well done.
Also, as an #Apple nerd I’m fascinated that it’s a MacBook Air. Venerable workhorse computer and best for most users/uses. Can’t say for sure, but I’m guessing it belongs to the campaign, not Biden or an individual staffer since the Dock icons seem mostly stock.
I’ve seen a lot of dunking on #Biden for the upside down #iPhone, but it looks like speaker mode is enabled, so my guess is he’s letting whoever is on the phone say something to Harris on the Zoom call. Phone speaker to Mac mic as it were.
Kamala-Biden- because enough of you aren't in prison
But but but - we KNOW 45 is a monster and getting some normalcy back is going to be very valuable. A prez is partly a team and I think Biden’s team will be strong. I want M4A too but you’d have to have super-majorities in all branches to make it happen.
Y’all please go out and vote. I literally cannot do another 4 years of Trumps America where people think they can get away with blatant racism. Please go VOTE. Even if you don’t like Joe Biden, WRITE SOMEONE ELSE IN.   IF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE, DO IT.
I’m never going to vote for Joe Biden. I may not vote for Trump either but I will never be someone who voted for that sick old man that’s been proven to be racist and constantly makes racist remarks. Not to mention he’s a pedo and there’s proof. Our choices suck man.
Kamala Harris is not a black woman like Biden said he would pick.
Going from Michelle Obama to the Slovenian mail-order bride, then to Dr. Jill Biden is even more of a pendulum swing than between the three presidents.
Nobody ever said Joe Biden was smart! #Trump2020
Trump is going to absolutely maul Biden in the debates. It’s going to be sad to see him bludgeoned so.
What happens when Biden debates Trump?
I hope you are President Biden’s first Supreme Court pick. Wanted you to be VP. If not on the court I all for Klobuchar 2024!
Biden must be losing his memory becuse how dose one put harris in as vp when she calls him a sex  saying she beleve s many women who said he did.and indirectly calls him a
Biden picking  (someone who was a cop, BUT ALSO a woman/POC) was 100% intentional. And honestly, very smart. Pulling people to Biden who were on the fence.   Do I love it? No. Do I think it’ll help get Trump out of office. Yes. And what else do we want at this point?
I’m tired of choosing the lesser of 2 evils. Biden’s past racist comments and ”Stop &amp; Frisk” law that has put away countless of people for victimless crimes is just as disgusting as Trump. #WakeUpAmerica #EndtheDuopoly #MakeAmericaFreeAgain #VoteGold
Biden picked a winner in Kamala!  They will go on to win the election in Nov. Trump  will get out of our WH and hopefully he takes his trash with him! 😂😂.  It will be #BidenHarris2020 by a landslide November 3 2020!
Hey patriots, today’s announcement of Biden’s VP makes the Senate and House races even more important! Vote red straight down the ticket! 🇺🇸
"Wow I can't believe Bernie endorsed Biden, what a sellout"  Why? It's a completely coherent position. If you're a leftist and you truly believe Trump is putting kids in concentration camps on the border &amp; bringing climate extinction, you'd have to be crazy *not* to vote Bidien.
If you're a leftist and you *truly* believe what you said about Trump running concentration camps on the borer, bringing us toward global climate extinction etc., why *wouldn't* you vote for Biden? You'd have to be an immoral psychopath not to vote for the lesser evil.
There's something so telling about that clip of Kamala laughing hysterically going, "It was just a debate!" when Stephen Colbert asked her if her attacks on Biden were sincere.  It's so honest. She finds the idea of saying what you really believe naive. It's a show for her.
no one has a potty mouth worse than you, as you criticize Biden pick.  You should be very afraid with this Kamala Harris.  Mostly because you suck so badly.
Lol you know the trump team had a video ready for anyone Biden could’ve picked for VP
As a conservative, I can say this is absolutely true. Biden’s handlers and Kamala have been courting the Bernie Bros for their votes, but they have no intention of blowing up their corporate sponsors with an actual progressive agenda. Progressives need to form that 3rd party.
PACK. YOUR. SHIT.   It's over, comrade. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. You can't complete a sentence, but you're going to BE sentenced the day after Joe Biden is inaugurated~!   Try to get a cell with a view.
Can I go ahead and cast my vote for Biden/Harris now? Nothing will change my mind. Do whatever it takes to get Cheeto Man out of that office. #BidenHarris #VicePresident #KamalaHarris
We really said we wanted a strong, progressive VP to help get us excited about a Biden presidency and he really said, “No ❤️”
So you think highlighting that Biden and Harris are tougher on #LawAndOrder than  is a winning message?   Another solid strategy from #ConInc. Next maybe you could circle back to touting how much Trump has done for #HBCU
#Obamagate scared Biden away from Rice and now he's stuck with this 😂
What Trump should attack Kamala for: Her radical positions in the primaries like decriminalizing illegal immigration and gun seizures  What Trump will attack Kamala for: "she called joe biden a RACIST and she locked up poor innocent black men!!!"
The only people who can win this election are Biden or Trump. I don’t see any other option. I don’t love it but I’m gonna back it to get rid of this monster.
Biden picking a black woman who "happens" to be a cop as vp js exactly the kind of tone deaf bullshit that I've come to expect from the DNC.   It doesn't make me any less mad about it.
... Trump is going2 KILL Biden in the debates!
I’m so old I can remember when Harris insinuated Biden was a horrible racist...
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
And there it is.
Ya'll ever cry because Biden chose Kamala as his VP or is it just me
A cop is definitely the person biden needs to even out his incredibly progressive ticket 🙄
One thing you can bet your life on:  Right now Donald Trump is pissed off because Joe Biden is getting all of the attention on television and social media, without even saying anything.   Promise you. It's killing him!   Expect a major "Squirrel!" distraction any minute...
I follow back! Make America Sane Again. #DumpTrump2020 #BreonnaTaylor #SandraBland #SayHerName #NoJusticeNoPeace #BlackLivesMatter
Biden could pick CarrotTop and I would still vote for him over Trump.
But she’s also the only person on Biden’s list who spent part of the 1970s working construction in Fidel Castro’s Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade, a group that has organized annual trips to Cuba for young, leftist Americans for half a century.“
But #Biden is so well spoken!😂😂
At this point, there's not much #Biden does know unless someone tells him.
Just had a weird fuckin dream where Biden and Trump were playing hunger games for the presidency with someone else i'm no longer friends with

I'm not saying I'm Biden's VP pick...but I'm not saying I'm not.
🐂💩!!! Joe Biden tried to cut social security &amp; medicaid for decades.
Why do Joe Biden and the Democrats remain silent and never denounce this rioting and looting of businesses that provide jobs for hard working Americans? Oh I see...trash the businesses to prevent hiring workers to raise unemployment to hurt Trump.
Can't wait for some big-brained geniuses on here to explain to me how some of that 94% are actually just disaffected white nationalists voting for Biden to make a statement, or something.
I don’t see how a disgraced former prosecutor from San Francisco (who imprisoned African Americans at a record pace and got her job by sleeping with a disgraced Mayor) could possibly ‘help’ the Democrat/Biden ticket... not to mention she’s Indian by birth, not African American.
Splitting hairs. It was my ‘best guess’, given the speculative tweet I was replying to... the intimation was that an African American female who was a Governor is Biden’s choice for VP... please, do you have a ‘better’ assumption? 😑
Biden allowed himself to get backed in to a corner when he committed to an African American female... he has no choice but to follow through on that promise but if he does, no matter who he selects, he’s screwed. They ALL have baggage and none of them appeal to the ‘middle’. 🤷‍♂️
The only female African American Governor in the U.S. is Muriel Bowser - Governor of Washington, D.C.?!? No way... that would kill any chance Biden might’ve had. 🤔
If any veteran votes for Biden, let me just say this. A vote for Biden is a vote for all of Obama and Clinton's policies INCLUDING Benghazi! Kust remember!
I don't care if Biden picks his nose, I'm voting for Joe.
Yep!   “China Joe Biden”
Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win  For two months we’ve been witnessing chaos and destruction in Portland and other cities run by progressive Democrats, yet no one in the Democratic Party will stand up and condemn the violence as if...

Either way, I still think it's messed up that they won't let her debate with Trump and Biden. That’s why I'm so passionate about the #LetHerSpeak movement. The people deserve to know all of their options.
🖕🏽 all the Racists, Rapists, Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden, but Goodmorning and have a Bless one  😌💓
He doesn’t just “mess up” sentences. He can’t complete them. How is Trump racist? Lowest black unemployment under any president and history, but who cares, he’s racist? Gtfoh. And Biden is a pedophile. Plenty of clips to prove that for ya too
I probably should have said *their-self to include both of them. But still. Both Biden’s and Clinton’s central selling point is “hey, I’m not Trump, vote for me” and it’s just really really sad.
Even if I did align with Jo Jorgensen politically, we still can’t afford to not give Biden a vote. Yet another ineffectual moderate with no ability to rally support by himself. I have to do my part to try and make this not a complete remake of 2016.
Asked with a straight face and the answer was given with a straight face. These people are truly unbelievable!  The media is 6 to 1 or more in favor of Biden and yet “their truth” is that it’s the other way around. Simply amazing!

Biden needs a black woman that helps him with the black vote, and that is not Kamala... not sure Susan Rice delivers the black vote either, so it’s wide open right now, in my opinion.
The Koch brothers don’t like him because he knows they are in deep with the establishment also.  What has he lied. Cheated or stolen.  Not Biden or his son. Trump.
The liberal presidents at these universities see the benefit of not playing  thereby trying to hurt President Trump. They will hope Biden gets elected who would then bail out all of the programs with our tax dollars.
I don’t like anything about Joe Biden. His policies, the way he carries himself &amp; his business. He’s a condescending jerk of the highest degree. BUT, seeing what his friends, party, family, and his fellow Dems are doing to him is heartbreaking. It’s senior abuse. They’re pathetic
Joe Biden can’t complete a coherent sentence and you wanna vote for him? Saw a thing today that said “Joe Biden isn’t stupid, his mental status is just declining. Anyone who votes for Joe Biden, however, is stupid”
What about Biden’s insults? Trump never strikes first.  He wants hydrochloriquin used but the doctors won’t.  What about all the good he tries to do?
I got one.   So Biden was going to finish a sentence and ..... can’t get past that for the punch line.
Name 3 policy’s of Biden’s you like.  And 3 policy’s if trumps you don’t.
I’ve never even seen a Biden campaign sign.
Joe Biden has spent 45 years helping make the USPS the financial disaster it is today. But it’s Trump’s fault!!!
I let our resident 14 year-old (soon to be 15) niece drive me around this afternoon, practicing for her permit. Passed a slew of yard signs for Trump/Pence, didn't see one for Biden anywhere. Middle TN is definitely going to vote for that idiot again... What does it take???
We have no racism except for you Biden. Democrats have started terrorism in 2020.
Brown tried to kill a police officer you damn fool. Even the African Americans that witnessed what happened testified in police officers favor. Brown is not a good example for you to use. Biden you are mindless!

That's President Trump's plan. You know, the one that has been bringing jobs back to the U.S. Biden &amp; Obama said Trump would need a "magic wand"
If Biden manages to steal the election, it will be interesting to see how the reputation of America changes to a kowtow country due to his weak foreign policy against our enemies.
Joe Biden is explicitly running on exactly not this
She sounds perfect for a Biden VP candidate 👍
I was just wondering. Joe Biden says if he's elected he will make illegal immigrants citizens and also illegal immigrants will have free healthcare. Once he gives and illegal immigrant citizenship since they are now Americans do they lose their free insurance. Freaking idiot....
“He’ll revitalize American manufacturing and create millions of good-paying jobs” It’s interesting that the last time Biden had a chance to do that, he did the opposite.
He's a damn clone that's what happened.. The Biden in 2008 can articulate very well. The man of 2020, is not the same person OR it could be the affects of Adrenochrome. Take your pick. I just don't like him either way.
So spot on , I can’t even imagine CNN if Trump said what Biden did. It’s unreal the hatred of the fake media
BotSentinel is biased against conservatives so big whoopie-doo. Why are you so worked up over me posting a video representing the truth that Biden himself addressed? Instead of trying to bash me why not just research it? BTW: I’m a southern suburban grandmother. #Truth#Biden-Harris supporters remind me of Spalding...You’ll get nothing and like it!

Biden shows his age more and is much more senile. They're both old, Biden acts much older though.
Immediately after the oath of office President Biden should sign an executive order to release children from cages, make all efforts to reunite them with family, and provide them with any support and healthcare they will need. This is just human decency and Christianity!
Trump might go on small tangents sometimes, but he pretty much always gets back to the point. Some folks are better than Trump, sure, but he's better than Biden if you look at what Trump has done for the economy and for minority groups.
I'd rather have a man who loves this country like Trump, who has done great things for the economy, than a senile racist pedo like Biden who has done little since the 70s when he entered the government.
The lesser of two evils definitely isn't the side with a guy who's openly racist and pedophilic and who likely has dementia like Biden. Trump has done some great stuff, he locked down the nation due to COVID-19 before it was recommended, for example. Trump is infinitely better.
Kampala is Obama’s choice. Biden is just his puppet. Harris wasn’t electable as President. Biden has more potential to win. At least until the debates.
Biden likely won't make it to 2024, which is the earliest that he even has a chance of getting the presidency.
It's very questionable if Biden will make it to 2024, much less 2025 for the inauguration, if he somehow wins the next election that he even has a chance of winning.

What a great new day Sleepy Joe Biden is going to ruin a up and coming democrat by picking her as his running mate once she is announced that’s the last you will hear from her
I am sitting at my kitchen table waiting for the big announcement Who will Biden pick to ruin their political future. No wait the democrats have been ruining their future by hurting any democrat who steps forward as his partner
Maybe Joe Biden is back there and it was a special request!
NO WE CAN’T GET HIM OUT OF HERE !!!!!! Go Mr. Biden get him out.
Does it matter really? We are less than 100 days to the election. Team Trump is doing everything they can to subvert democracy.  Biden is the only alternative.That’s a cop-out. Not voting for  will seal a  re-election. Get this guy out of the White House or our country will be destroyed domestically and internationally. Vote for Biden, get him elected, then you can hold him (Biden) to account. Stop division!
You’re already coming up with excuses for why Biden doesn’t have a chance?
They do that with President Trump too. They just stay longer because they really want to press the president they don't have much to say to Joe Biden because he's really not undermining our democracy and ruining people's lives right now
Please educate me, as I must have missed something.. How does Biden hate America? We headed to Doom now.. he literally said on TV he would pull $ from the USPS, which employs over 97,000 veterans...
Just use plain paper. Or just permit assignment of voting rights since the win margin for Biden (if he wins) will be less than the number of illegal votes. Dems are going to cheat anyway.
#Biden-Harris supporters remind me of Spalding...You’ll get nothing and like it!
Spent a week at Gulf coast. Dozens of Trump flags and signs EVERYWHERE. Beach stores have whole sections of Trump gear. Truck stop on way home selling Trump shirts bumper stickers &amp; hats. Not ONE SINGLE BIDEN SIGN entire trip
Folks really letting Race cloud their judgement . Biden is literary going to be worse
Photocopy it 10,000 times and check Trump's name on all of them. Then dump them in the mailbox. That's what Dems gonna do but write in Biden's name.
Go ahead and "own" the internet, Biden and Harris own the people.

You are right   President Biden will lead one of the greatest years America has ever had.  Glad to see you understand it too.
1. from most angles, voting biden is the best option 2. being disappointed w/ this option is valid 3. non-/reluctant voters shouldn't be shamed 4. encouraging ppl to vote in a chorus of ppl shouting it doesn't matter is frustrating 5. tackling this nuance in 280 characters sucks
Biden/Harris ticket just recieved the endorsement of the National Association of Letter Carriers. Well imagine that!
#BidenHarris2020 need to bring up that #dodgeyDossier what #LyingTrump call it and all of trump sexual assault victims. Biden need to bring up the fact #LyingTrump promised to prosecute those liars but he never did. Probably because they told the truth. Fight fire with fire.
He knows Ms. Donda would be supporting Biden/Harris. Even more so because Kamala is her sorority sister.
Obama and Biden would probably be dealing with the ongoing pandemic which you're floundering at.
Should I get a BIDEN/HARRIS Sign? I think i have enough signs go VOTE!!!!
Gives Joe Biden an opportunity to save the USPS and win over more seniors. This is an election of 2% making the difference in who wins. Trump just needs to keep declmprnsating and giving Biden points to win the debate &amp; race.
“Actually she’s on a Joe Biden ticket &amp; not a Sanders ticket”   THAT part had me 🤣🤣🤣

Please go to his website, unlike Trump, Biden has very many wonderful plans
As of today, Kamala Harris has 4.9 million Twitter followers, Joe Biden has 8.4 million Twitter followers, Donald Trump has 85.1 million followers. I wonder how many Facebook followers each of them have?
Nah, they’d vote for a Biden/Stalin ticket if they thought it would get Trump out. It’s also weird that they oppose free speech now.

Joe Biden ABSOLUTELY NO VOTE FROM ME!
Joe Biden has held three campaign events since he was told Kamala Harris was his running mate. And yet the Biden team won't allow him to answer questions from the media. What are they hiding?
Kinda’ like President Trump will do with Biden.
The first thing #JoeBiden will do is reverse the balanced tariffs you put in place with China. This will cripple our economy right back to the Obama/Biden years. Of course Joe and his family and friends will get their corruption dollars from China.

Isn't that a "long"horn sheep? Do you think Junior would qualify given Daddy's reputation?
I don’t care about political sides of the fence, but I just don’t think it’s morally right to support Trump or Biden. I really don’t care who belongs to whatever party, some people just do not deserve to be supported.!&amp;5 makes no sense.
This is a great question... Kamala Harris, couldn't draw flies in the middle of a pasture with cow manure in both hands. And Joe Biden picked her to do what... Those flies still aint interested in her hands...
ms biden has her edges laid ok don’t mess w my bitch 💅🏽
Many women are elated at Biden’s pick and his pick, of course, has made many Black women elated! His choice has also made many men proud and definitely a lot of Democrats are overjoyed! Thank you Joe! Let’s go! #BidenHarris2020  #MakingHistory  #StrongGiftedAndBlack
Something like $7000 to the Bernie campaign and over $8000 to the Biden campaign. Zack is a shill for losers. He thinks he's a celebrity because he has millions of followers on YouTube, when most are probably from India and China. He's nowhere near as important as he believes.
Buy stamps but don't mail anything unnecessary while they are already having trouble delivering things. Just hold onto the stamps for later. To send invitations to your Biden inauguration party.
actually, fuck this. screw joe biden, kamala harris and all american politicians. i’m tired of trying to convince myself that there’s any positives in this election. there isn’t. i’m not choosing between two evils and we shouldn’t have to. i take it back and i’m sorry.
Postal union endorses Biden candidacy as 'survival' of USPS at stake
I don't see it happening in our lifetime. Take a look. Has anyone started legal proceedings against the Clinton's, Obama, Biden, the DNC? Look just how corrupt Pelosi, Schiff, and Feinstein are. It's the corrupt system that let's this happen.
I hope POTUS Biden finds a place for you in his Administration. I think you’re so smart and full of great ideas!

Biden's running on a pretty progressive platform, which I don't think a lot of folks are fully aware of. Some redditor condensed it (from 200+ pages) a few months ago:
I’m in that 86%. We just have bigger fish to fry in ‘20. After we restore democracy, save our country from fascism, add a couple states &amp; have a stable governing majority for a decade we can get resolve minor differences in policy, until then Biden can EO our way to 97% coverage
There really is no decision here. Vote for Biden!
I will be voting for Biden. #BidenTrumpLandslide
Biden.....pathetic....Media ..A damn Joke
I am alive and voting for Biden.
He’s totally a Neo-Liberal. He’s left on the American scale, not on the international scale which is what it sounds like you’re looking for. The President doesn’t pass the legislation by himself, that’s for Congress. Biden will sign whatever the D congress sends him.

wait till the debates and Biden stumbles around like the confused old man he is.  Kamala won't be able to get enough face lifts to fix that mess.  She and her new daddy will start sinking in the polls, and before you know it your crying through another election night. can't wait
Lol  what is this headline?? How can it be unexpected when the democratic establishment worked its ass off to pick Biden over Bernie????
60% of voters don't think Biden will live till the end of his term if he wins.  Nobody is saying that about Trump.  Put your vagina hat on and figure out why dummy.
"conservatives who want to support an alternative to Trump"  Very few of them who will actually vote for Biden. Biden/Harris should make no concessions to get them, because it will fail.
You guys can’t do anything on the up and up can you? You are a side show everyday. Can’t wait to the peaceful administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!!

It's really, really, really hard to stomach anti-Biden/Harris posts from Strickland voters.
Do we start peddling the hints of Chinese influence on the election now or in November in case Biden wins?
Iam truly sorry if Biden were handling this we'd all be not up a creek we woulda drown in it thanks POTUS 👍😷

Anyone who calls Trump racist, and you by proxy, call em a pediphile because of Bill Clinton and “Sit on my lap” Biden.
Just vote in person, if you can. We've been doing that successfully for quite a while. You can even vote early in person. Then this whole USPS thing isn't an issue. Then Trump gets beaten and Biden can fix the USPS.   Just vote in person.
Could Biden remember how to say Kamala’s name? Did Biden sniff anyone? Did Biden say anything racist? Does Biden have Alzheimer’s?
I guess I still don't understand the argument. Yes, Biden is terrible and I hate that I have to vote for him. However, I don't see how him being terrible negates the harm reduction argument unless you think Trump is better? "Harm reduction" doesn't mean "harm elimination."
Trump is going to better than Biden for the rest of the world how?
If u hate trump for being racist u should really hate Biden he racist and pedophile and he was a part of pushing the crime bill act I got receipts

So true. And Trump will continue to use government $ holding press conferences only to spend the entire time slamming Biden. He truly believes he is above the law and no one is stopping him. So why would he leave when he’s voted out. We are about to become a dictatorship.

Do you not see that Joe Biden is a weak feeble old man that can’t put one coherent sentence together? He’s unqualified. You can hate Trump all you want but Biden is unfit mentally and corrupt with his past dealings with China.
Yes, Biden got rich selling influence. You can't be that uninformed...
He got his son millions out of  Ukraine. Trump didn't get his money out of selling influence in office. Joe Biden, don't have a business, where did his money come from. Wake up!!!!! He sold our manufacturing base to China and Mexico.

Biden just recommended universal masking for all Americans and for ALL Governors to recommend masking. This is what’s needed to decrease viral transmission.  #RealLeadership
Kamala Harris only speaks knowledge of what she knows that’s happened between her legs . When uncle Joe Biden miss pronounced her name she was probably on her knees giving him a pump up job . That’s why sleeping Joe was smiling and said her name wrong.  Great for each other
Such political BS - the "15 days to slow the spread" lockdown that going on 6 months killed the economy and you know it. Quit saying garbage that even you know is wrong.   For someone who called Biden a racist and a rapist you sure are fast to ride his coattails now.
Maybe. Too bad presidential elections aren’t decided by board members. The optics on this are so bad I bet that Biden’s lead widens.
Another mind-blowing self-own. "Vote for the Trump Team. We're rich people who don't even slow down as we blow past your town in our armored comfort. Didn't even bother to install windows because we're not interested in your sad lives. Unlike that hard-working chump, Joe Biden."

Fuck you guys for being on that riden with biden shit but got audacity to protest with BLM THESE ARE THE SAME POLICIES WE ARE PROTESTING NOW ill always hate trump but its like all this shit ALLA of a sudden became a problem when he came in
Jules since Biden doesn’t move at all Trump looks good to me...calm and in control
He has 85 days left before the election and he WILL throw EVERY insane thing at the Dems he can. Expect it! Just a matter of time before he demands to see Biden's birth certificate.

You would never vote for Biden-Harris because you are a paid political hack that has sold your soul, and betrayed all of your values. You know this is a moderate ticket, and so you are intentionally lying
Sweet. Glad to see you’ve decided on the Biden/Harris team
Lol! What an idiot! Do you think Patriots cannot see through your bullshit? You don’t want a Presidential debate because you know that Joe Biden will be made to look like the inept fool he is! You’re scared shitless! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If Biden was being confirmed for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme court and there were allegations the Senate committee had, I would expect them to bring them forward and question him on them.
BIDEN/HARRIS 202O 🇺🇸 lets go !!!!
we are looking to Biden/Harris to be the opposite of Trump mouth disease and Pence sycophant speak. Don't hang everything on covid and economy. It was his lack of leadership, yes. But its his mean, nasty, myopic, self centered potty mouth we are tired of. 1/2
Don’t understand how she attacked Biden on racial matters and now supports him. Politics 🤷🏾‍♀️. All these people are fake, including the media.

Hey, the Joe Biden Halloween mask is already out!!!
I would like Biden to address the sizeable chunk of the population that will not have voted for him, telling them he is their president too and will make every effort to win their support. Trump’s us &amp; them mentality is destroying us.
Tennessee is and always has been red. Trump 2020. Biden and Harris are the Laurel and Hardy of politics.
This Is Not Just a Victory for Kamala Harris
You were lying in wait to attack ANYONE chosen on the Dem ticket, speaking of fakes.  Biden has us united behind him firmly and the woman you are calling fake has been in the fight to represent Americans and has risen to this height, proving to be undeniably REAL.
after 20,000+ flat out lies by Trump that conservatives didn’t care about, spare us the crocodile tears about a Biden statement that is only about 7 out of 10 on the truth meter
Biden and Harris Pledge a Strong Challenge to Trump and a Path Out of Crisis
You are literally making shit up. You don't get to infer racism. It's either there or not. Biden actually says racist things, often. Much like ethno wrote this tweet.
Exactly. The president didn't mention anything about color. Which isn't racist. The person who wrote this tweet DID, which is actually very racist. Interesting. It's a lot like Biden saying "poor kids are just as smart as white kids."
"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or for Trump, then you ain't black."  -Joe Biden

You mean like Biden?🤔
Enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket brought 150,000 new donors to the Democratic campaign. In the 24 hours after Biden announced that he was tapping Harris as his vice president candidate, the campaign raised an eye-popping 26 million dollars.
How can a woman of color be comfortable with Biden’s racism issues????
and finally
and this:
A very racist day indeed. Skin color should have no place in making any decision. Sad but not surprising by someone as racists as Biden.
Sad thing is that they took pictures of Biden's kids and manipulated them to look perverted.  The worst case, they edited a picture of his grandson. The child was at his fathers funeral. They edited that to look perverted.
Hip Hop Reacts To Joe Biden Selecting Kamala Harris For VP -
He was like 40 here. He's always looked like this. Everybody's always stereotyping and being hypocritical and every way, just because he look old doesn't mean he's old he might be old but he's no more than a year older than Joe Biden in 2 years older than Trump
shits a setup tbh, the other dems dropped out (Bernie excluded) to let biden win.
I love how  and his administration loves to change up the narrative.. especially to Kamala Harris and Biden 🤦🏾‍♂️
IF JOE BIDEN STEPS DOWN OR DIES, IT'S POSSIBLE. I DO THINK SHE WILL TRY TO EVEN THE FIELD.  SHE HAS PUT OVER 1,500 PEOPLE IN JAIL 4 SMOKING WEED, WHILE SHE WAS  AG OF CALI BETTER THAN TRUMP, AT LEAST THEY WILL DO SOME GOOD THINGS RATHER THAN ↩ THEM &amp; ONLY RAISE TAXES ON THE RICH
Y’all can say what you want about Kamala Harris but Republicans absolutely do NOT know what to do with her and that is why Biden/Harris will win. 😂   And it also proves that republicans have been using socialism as a fear tactic for far too long.
The Biden / Harris administration better appoint a special prosecutor on their first day in office. And that person better #ProsecuteTrump and #ProsecuteBarr

Old Captain America look a tad too much like Joe Biden.
I thought better of it and will send much of the tab to Lincoln Project and Biden. I'll get one when the gigs start to pick up early next year. I have a dozen guitars now. Priorities. 😂
Kamala did not even win her home state in the Presidential primary. The only reason why she was selected as a running mate is she is a pit-bull and can go into attack mode. Biden gets lost mentally if he speaks more than 2 sentences.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF OBAMA HAD NOT DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB OF LEADERING AND BIDEN WAS THERE AND HE LEADERED TO GET YOUR HEAD STRAIGHT MAN

Biden racist not Trump
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night.
Biden looks confused as always, and Kamala looks like a proud Indian American.
In the words of racist like Biden “close enough”

America definitely needs a #mamala, after watching Joe Biden and Kamala, It’s good to see sensible people. In contrast, I tried to watch Trump’s press conference, he sounded like he didn’t know what he was talking about and clearly has no way out. We have a choice #BidenHarris
more evidence of why he needs to do as many of these as he likes.  Fodder for Project Lincoln, more proof for those undecideds/low participation types to get out and vote for Biden.
We know you will President Biden !! Thank you sir! ❤️
Point being, if you're thinking of shit-talking or not voting for Biden/Harris because they aren't ideal, try holding your guy to the same standard and it might give you a 2nd thought, not to mention that Biden's and Harris' positions now are not what they were in the '90s.
And he's doing it to destroy his "competition" and to prevent people from voting for Biden/Harris. We can hope that those in rural areas who may well have voted for Trump will get angry enough at losing their mail service to vote him OUT.
Yes ! Go Biden/ Harris ... thank you!
Tbh, I think he only picked her because Michelle said no.  Kamala has been openly against Biden, so the whole thing just seems real fishy.  But having a black woman VP running mate is a "good look" for him and the Democratic party
you mean Biden plans to replace Esper

i don’t want to have to choose the lesser of two evils, and i hate that this is what it’s come to. but i can’t see any realistic alternative that wouldn’t result in ultimately helping the greater of the two evils, so until i find one, i’m supporting biden &amp; kamala.
So, it looks like #Twitter will allow NO criticism whatsoever of the #Biden team. But NO such reservations about EXTREME criticism of the #Trump team.  What is it you call that?
I’m watching the grassroots fundraiser for Future President Biden and Vice President Harris. ❤️
I'm not a fan of Biden or Harris frfr but you not about to tell me I deserve 4 more years under Trump because I won't vote for jo Jorgensen, who can also kick rocks
The sad part about this election is that... Biden/Harris don’t have to promise much of anything to convince me they’re who i need to vote for. They’re getting my vote based on simple stuff like.... can you read? Do you know the continents of the world? Simple stuff..
A flat out line. Biden was incredible and Harris nailed the moment.
I got $500 that he isn't in sniffing distance of 239. Look at the Brett Farve pics. He is 6'3" and 225. Trump looks an easy 100 pounds more than Farve. I also got $500 that Trump could not do a 100 yard dash and be within 20 yards of Biden.

Has Romney endorsed Biden-Harris yet?
I mean, Biden is smart, no doubt. I just don't think he's a policy wonk, or super intelligent. But thats not really what I want in a leader. I want someone who hires and listens to the smartest people and then makes informed decisions.
California Senator Kamala Harris is making her first address as Joe Biden’s running mate.
I dont think Biden is particularly smart (he's not dumb at all) but he does seem like a genuinely sincere and good dude. That's way more important right now.
So glad to see you with Mr  Biden. God bless you and him. My prayer is that you both will be safe. And kick Donald Trumps ass out of office. Amen
Anyone else getting slightly emotional watching this Biden and Harris joint speech? I teared up a little when Joe was talking about his son. #BidenHarris2020

Not saying I’m voting for Kanye at all, but to say Biden is a better person than Kanye is a bold faced lie.
Biden is not a better person than Kanye West. He and his running mate have put so many POC prison it’s ridiculous and he was essential in developing the prison system we have now. Not only that, but he’s said some seriously racist shit lately and has pedophile tendencies.

i'm rlly conflicted tho bc by "settling for biden" that just lets the DNC know that they can continue to fuck over progressive voters
Personally being a Leftist, voting Biden/Harris is all about harm reduction. Under which administration are marginalized/working class ppl going to be put through the least harm? Who can be persuaded by our activism the most?  Who will handle COVID better? Damn won’t be Trump

My wife went to the WH to accept an award from Biden and came back extremely impressed.  Said he's either incredibly sharp or really good at digesting a briefing, which is basically the same.
If Biden wins, everyone will be forced to have Jeff Tiedrich's hair.
My main point here is ppl thinking that this choice was ‘Biden trying to lose’ when I think ppl aren’t putting value on the power of the vote of misrepresented ppl of color. However, these actions by her are 100% inexcusable and should be criticized fully.
But what I’m saying is that folks are literally just voting for whoever goes against Trump and not realizing what Biden stands for it has done. We’re in a very hard place. Then Kamala didn’t even want to identify herself as black, invests heavily into prisons....
“Don’t care about Biden” = translate to you don’t care what he says or why...you didn’t care to comment on his outrage and blatant racism...but you cared to comment on this women’s post which isn’t racist at all 🤷‍♂️
I agree with you whole heartedly! We are under weak leadership and deserve better that’s 100 percent TRUE! But all I’m saying is that Joe Biden isn’t any better. It’s like we are at a point where it’s literally anybody but trump.
I still wish Trump would have Pence step down and bring in Tulsi as his new VP candidate just to see the debates.  Which if they want VP debates then there shouldn't be any issue with Trump/Biden debating.
Hot take, but I want Biden to win because I want to bully him and everyone associated with him for 4-8 years.  I want to show libs that our societal problems go deeper than Trump. I want Trump to cry about losing.  I want to be mean to Biden.  I want to be Biden's Jeff Tiedrich.

So you one of those that’s just voting for whoever runs against trump to get him out? Cause if YOU do your research you’ll see Biden isn’t any better. Speak facts not opinions.
She was a presidential candidate &amp; has been a senator. Did Biden pick her simply because she is black? I have no idea. But it's discounting her to say that. He clearly promised to pick a woman which I have some issue with. But I think that Kamala is a solid VP choice for him.

Trump has to go.  Biden/Harris is what we've been given to do it.  They get my vote to get rid of Trump. But they need to know my vote will hold them accountable and demand better.  We will be on your asses. America deserves real leadership. It's time to shape up.
You are spot-on and this should be shout from rooftops. People treat championing their candidacy as not wanting to hold them accountable. Yes we will still be a marginalized group if Biden-Harris are elected, but the fact they aren’t Trump is why we must support their candidacy.
Don't get me wrong. I'm taking Chomsky's and Dr. West's advice. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But that does NOT mean I'm going to act excited. Biden and Harris' policies were inimical to brown and black communities. They work for us, remember that. Hold them accountable.
Biden shows his age more and is much more senile. They're both old, Biden acts much older though.
I didn't say I wasn't going to. What I said was, this isn't a zero sum game. When Biden was VP the first time everything wasn't gravy and everything will not instantly turn to gravy the moment these two are elected. As far as school, what if we funded that instead of gassing ppl?
Uhm...... Biden is catholic.
Kamala, is not ADOS,( AMERICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVERY) BIDEN WILL FIND OUT THIS IN NOVEMBER

Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
GREAT NEWS!!!  Go Biden/Harris!!!
Immediately after the oath of office President Biden should sign an executive order to release children from cages, make all efforts to reunite them with family, and provide them with any support and healthcare they will need. This is just human decency and Christianity!
The voter shaming I keep seeing from democrats is annoying as FUCK. Don’t shame me for not choosing “the lesser evil” especially when I live in a safe red state. Fuck Trump &amp; Fuck Biden. I said what I said.
Trump might go on small tangents sometimes, but he pretty much always gets back to the point. Some folks are better than Trump, sure, but he's better than Biden if you look at what Trump has done for the economy and for minority groups.
I'd rather have a man who loves this country like Trump, who has done great things for the economy, than a senile racist pedo like Biden who has done little since the 70s when he entered the government.

A few folks have asked for my stance on Kamala Harris. In all honesty obviously anybody is better than trump. I get that. Biden has my vote. My thing is the people who continue to sit here and praise her all for what? She openly supports a country that has killed innocent people
I’m absolutely voting for Biden to ensure Trump gets out, but I’m so fucking sick of America being a country where thousands of people push for change and a better life and politicians just. Don’t? They just make life awful and that’s how things are set up here.
I love how people are (rightfully!) pointing out we have to vote for Biden to get trump out and by “love” I mean “Fuck we really are trapped in a country with all the people in power being awful people and actual citizens have no recourse to actually change things”
I don’t like it but sometimes politicians do things we don’t agree with. I don’t like every single action Trump takes the same way I’m sure you don’t agree with every single action by Biden. That would be like me saying if you vote for Biden you’re supporting the 94 crime bill.
This election is really sad tbh. I hate how half of my timeline is being bashed for holding Biden and Harris accountable for their past actions while the other half wants to ignore it. I personally think these things need to be discussed.
Y’all bet not vote for Biden 😒🙄🙄🙄
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness
Harris destroyed Biden in a debate and look what happened.
Please copy-paste and distribute widely:  Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.

Biden/Harris is a return to honest government that works for middle America.
Biden’s sexual assault allegations are probably true. Kamala Harris is like the most predictable pick ever and is about as establishment as you can get. I don’t think anyone is ecstatic about this. I think most people are just excited that we get to remove fascist Ronald McDonald
I've tried to explain this to Cult 45 members and they just say "well you can't say it's Trump's America. They're deciding to do that". As if Biden will force them to
Woke up today and the first thing I did was check to make sure Biden didn’t change his campaign slogan to Biden/Harris 2020-I Went Black &amp; I Ain’t Goin Back. So far so good.
The best thing for Biden is to stay in his basement.
We have decades worth of footage of Biden. We know what his usual speech problems sound like. This is not that.
Now you have to have seen the videos. If not I can send you link after link. Biden is suffering from way worse then just a simple stutter. He’s clearly no longer able to speak or think at the same level and the decline has been seen over the years to this point.
You honestly think Biden will finish 4 years in office?
Joe Biden thought we said “defend the police”
Trump is not perfect. But Joe Biden hasn’t done anything to convince me to vote for him. His policy positions change frequently. He’s been saying a lot of things about schools and housing but we have no reason to believe he’ll actually do those things. And he has dementia
This sums up the Republican party perfectly: Drunk white guys who are too dumb to understand that, even when he loses, Trump will still be the president until Biden is sworn in the following January.
I cried with tears of joy and elation when i got the text from Joe about you being the VP!!  I also slept better last night than i have in 3.5 years. Biden + Harris = Dream Team!  Pull NO punches when you debate Liar-Pence. OWN HIM and make him regret his choices.
You’ll eat what’s on your plate and you’ll like it, Biden Harris 2020
No since in trump flirting the idea of replacing pence with a woman. Biden got the top notch and no one of good character would want the job. #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #TrumpEvilPlan #TrumpFailedAmerica #Trumpdeathtoll165k
We are resilient! Biden/Harris 2020

Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden’s running mate?
its y’all talking about kamala harris like her nd biden aint our only choice fa me
Can't make this crap up....... Well unless you are Joe Biden!
I really think that in the run up to November, Biden-Harris team should announce who their Cabinet nominees would be to show America what a Biden Administration would look like. Make it a weekly event to help keep the buzz elevated.
A little distasteful that Joe Biden would pick Kamala Harris on the day after former WWE wrestler “Kamala” Harris passed away.  It’s almost like they didn’t even care.
Biden could have added Jesus of Nazareth to the ticket and Liz Cheney would still tweet this about HIM.
Because of people’s comments and reaction to Kamala being picked as Biden’s VP.
Anytime anyone has pushed Biden from the left, his response has been “go vote for someone else.” I see no evidence that will change when/if he has the power of the presidency.
Its either you vote for Biden and Harris or don't🤦🏽‍♀️. But don't turn around and complain about Trump 🙄
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews
She is probably already blowing it for smiling Biden
“Biden and Kamala aren’t any better but we still gotta——“ girllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll. Don’t tell no grown folks what they need to be doing LMAO you go do what YOU gotta do. Leave me outta this.
Can we please get trump out of office I’m not for Biden  either but anybody but trump
If Trump don't know that fact, hell look it up.... Google it, general knowledge don't make you smart. Specialize knowledge is everything. Joe Biden, 40 years in Washington, what did he accomplished.
Biden Harris 2020 Marsha Blackburn you are  going down with trump
Never Biden is 4 more years of trump. Y’all wanna die on the imaginary m4a hill? It’s not happening in the next 4 years. Your fake candidate ain’t getting elected. Even if he did, he would be several hundred congresspeople short...
You and me both. Will be great to watch Biden/Harris go down in flames.
Also, I'm not speaking just for myself and my vote. Most progressives feel this way. Most were ready to give Biden a chance, had the VP pick been someone who represented our vaules. A former AG is the exact opposite of that. A real slap in the face during these historic protests.
Not Pop Tarts! Say it ain't so! Are even our Tater Tots safe?   (I'd sacrifice both to get Trump out and Biden in. Must save the Republic!  )
If you don’t vote, or I see you constantly only slander Biden/Kamala, I’mma just assume you’re a Trump supporter. Because by definition, you’re a Trump supporter 💀💀💀💀
There’s no such thing as a perfect presidential candidate or VP. We know Biden &amp; Harris have glaring flaws but we have to do what’s necessary to rid this nation of Trump. You woke folks gotta deal with the reality of the situation before us NOT what you want it to be
Imagine how salty  will be if Biden ACTUALLY loses too Trump 😂 “that’s the twitter content I’m here for”
Joe Biden just lost the race. Black folks (the majority) will never vote for Kamala Harris. Been tricked before....
You can tell how badly Trump is doing by how (even more than normal) Mollie and her “friends” are getting. Notably she hasn’t had one positive thing to say about Trump. Just mean things about Biden. What a corrupt soul.
The lesser of two evils definitely isn't the side with a guy who's openly racist and pedophilic and who likely has dementia like Biden. Trump has done some great stuff, he locked down the nation due to COVID-19 before it was recommended, for example. Trump is infinitely better.
Yal really think Biden/ Harris will be better than Trump ? 🤦🏽‍♀️ No need to comment for debate it’s rhetorical
If Biden wins she will take over shortly after
She a wolf in sheep’s clothing, her affiliations are irrelevant. Biden picked her for those reasons cuz he knew it’d be a great distraction. He’s using his Obama clout and her blackness, ain’t neither one of em any good but they know we’re desperate
Biden will get her elected with his white privilege then will bow out cause he’s intellectually compromised
The "Biden vs.Trump Skydive Fight Video" makes it's debut on Monday, August 31st; so stay tuned and watch to see who wins!!
They could put out a press release saying that Biden Harris support KILLING Mike Fly and I'd STILL vote for them.
Danger!  Now that Kamala Harris is the vice presidential pick it's more than clear that between her and the Democrat party Joe Biden won't even be allowed to pick the color of his tie if elected, let alone lead the Country.
I bet now she won’t call Biden out for bussing again. I bet she won’t be called out for the things she did to the black community as California’s top cop. Time for the MSM to rewrite history.
Let’s get trump out of here; we’ve seen the shit hole and hatred he’s created!!! Biden has to win!!!!
Given Joe Biden's condition, I think that Kamala Harris would be the de-facto  president of the United States and between her and the Democrat party Joe Biden won't even be allowed to decide what color tie to wear.
Correct me if I’m wrong. Both Biden &amp; Harris are now receiving National Security Daily Briefs? Unlike  they will actually READ them! I’m feeling safer already.
Black folks have been forced to pick the lesser of 2 evils, since gaining the right to vote. Just say you’re voting Biden/Harris because Trump has to go, instead of trying to hype them up as two great candidates. They’re just more competent than Trump/Pence.
Can we all agree that we can find fault with both Biden and Harris? Okay, moving on—can we also agree that Biden/Harris will govern America better than Trump/Pence?   Okay, moving on—let’s go work to get them elected....work like they are the big underdogs.
"Vice President Mike Pence just got some very bad news. He’s going to lose the VP debate this fall, and that loss is going to do serious damage to the already diminished 2020 election prospects of the Republican Party."
Why does the Biden Harris ticket want to kill innocent children by the execution of abortion?
If Joe Biden spent years fighting for us, THEN WHY in all the years he was in Congress he NEVER Passed a Real Debt Free Balanced Budget?  Joe Biden kept America in slavery of debt owned by China.
Why is Biden standing so close to her?
Now that Harris is the VP pick, watch how many times she falsely claims Trump is a racist. The fact that Biden felt beholden to choose a black person is racist.
Biden is the polar opposite of Trump! #BidenHarris2020
Some Progressive Political Activists Are Not Happy That Biden Picked Harris
Joe Biden fought for who???? Not us black people for damn sure.
Biden is a Catholic....
The establishment thought they could will it into happening like they did with Biden.
I went #YangGang to Warren to Biden/Harris because I love America.  I refuse to be a privileged stereotype who complains about the Democratic nominees. I am not going to participate in the Liberal circular firing squad that happens every 4 years.    There is too much at risk!
LIKE I AM LITERALLY CONFUSED YALL MUST WANT TRUMP BACK IN OFFICE THE WAY YALL BUSY BASHING BIDEN/HARRIS -No it’s not what we want but the other option is TRUMP! SO WHY YALL DISTRACTING AND HALFWAY CONVINCING MORE PPL NOT TO VOTE AT ALL!? Any vote not for Biden is a vote for TRUMP
Kampala is Obama’s choice. Biden is just his puppet. Harris wasn’t electable as President. Biden has more potential to win. At least until the debates.
O you have a career in front of you! I lost a bet. I was sure you’d be the pick. Either way that $100.00 was sent to the Biden campaign! Keep making us proud? Senate or cabinet?
Come ”Hell or High Water” regardless of Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his Vice President running mate beware. The Biden-Harris combination remains as a losing ticket, on the November 3 presidential election day.
that being said i’m obviously still voting biden because i understand the importance of this election and whats at stake if i don’t
if biden picked bernie as his running mate things would be sexy
Anyone who fails to reelect Trump will aid in the destruction of the American economy &amp; the subjugation of the American people.  If Biden &amp; Reich have their way America will become another 3rd world despotic state in order to move the Earth's temp down by 1 worthless degree!
Joe Biden announced his VP pick, - August 11 - Trump has a 4-hour news conference - sometimes in the VERY near future.
I agree with everything you're saying, don't get me wrong, but how does Biden differ from Trump, when Biden himself has outright said "poor kids can be just as smart as white kids" and trying to police what Blackness actually is with his "ain't Black" remark?
Well it looks like you are insane.
I’m tired of this with you. I know the importance of voting and how can impact our communities and nation. Without Blacks Obama wouldn’t be president at all. Without Blacks Biden wouldn’t be our choice for president. Stop trying to undermine voting. You’re the problem.
Biden isn’t a perfect man we know that and our country isn’t either. But Trump doesn’t care about minorities nor this country. Biden relates towards Americans, he understands hardship and his mistakes but you can’t see this and you never will.
I can go all day on policy and why Biden is the best choice for our country. Trump hasn’t handled this pandemic right nor race relations in this country. For you to hate on Lebron and others for supporting Biden and Kamala shows what side you’re on.
He’s the same man that told African American wtf do they have to lose??! He’s racist against every minority. Yea Biden’s right after everything he said about BLM and protesters and Charlottesville. Blacks people would be crazy to support Trump. He doesn’t care about minorities!
Another Joe Biden is right Trump is racist and the first in modern times where his racist rhetoric isn’t hidden that’s what he meant but people like you take shit out of context. Listen ! and stop listening to sound bites...
No idea why Biden would pick a person with extensive experience in the criminal justice system when we should be focusing on reforming the criminal justice system.
Not voting is effectively the same as voting for trump.  Not voting for Biden Harris is the same as voting for trump.
Just reading all the great responses to this ridiculous childish garbage made me feel better. So... thanks?  Biden isn't perfect. Kamala isn't perfect. I'm not perfect.  Have you seen trump???  Biden Harris 2020 Biden Harris 2020 Biden Harris 2020!!!  End our national nightmare.
#JoeBidenKamalaHarris  Joe biden &amp; Karen harris.. Portland.. Seattle.. Chicago is waiting...
👀 all true and all reasons why nobody is black anymore i guess cos fuck biden and kopmella 🖕🏿
One more thing for tonight... systems that Harris defends are the reason people in similar situations to Pervis Payne end up being murdered by the state. I do not support a Biden/Harris ticket.   #FreePervisPayne
The left is confused. Kamala Harris stated that she wants to take away our 2nd amendment rights and up hold the constitution at the same time... It's impossible. How can I trust her. Joe Biden... come on man!!!!
Democrats rejected Kamala Harris during the first month of primaries. Now, knowing Biden won't finish his first term, they're all screaming about how amazing she is for the country.   The Democratic party is a joke.
Biden, what are you doing? Karelia ain’t black. Come on man!
📷 Congratulations to Sen. Kamala Harris as she begins her journey as the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden’s VP running mate.
Congratulations to Sen. Kamala Harris as she begins her journey as the presumptive Democratic Presidential  nominee Joe Biden’s VP running mate.
But also... meaningless gestures. Ain't nothing gonna change with his VP pick. We know where Biden stands with police, and look who he picked. Sooooo like who is surprised. 👀
Joe Biden could have picked a unicorn in a top hat and I would’ve voted for him but selecting Kamala Harris is like having my cake and eating it too! #BidenHarris2020 🖐🏾
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
The 2020 VP debate will be among the most memorable of all time. Pence will be the one bringing a toothpick to a nuclear bomb fight (figuratively). #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
if u can’t bring urself to vote for biden, vote for RBG. vote to prevent another brett kavanaugh from being elected to the supreme court. please.
Token BLACK to pander for the black voter, when she nor Biden will do anything for blacks other than in slave them to goverment dependicies. Same as liberals have been doing for decades. Obama had 40 mill on food stamps, WHY? Control.... control the food, you control the mind.
A white male Bernie supporter really used Charlamagne in an argument with me as a way to try to tell me he knew what Black voters wanted best and why I shouldn’t support Biden/Harris. At what stage of Bernie fandom does the delusion start to set in? I’m curious.
Biden Harris 2020  Because government is for adults.
Here's What You Need To Know About Joe Biden's Running Mate, Kamala Harris
Biden Harris 2020  trump has to go.
Another reason to vote #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden
This isn’t about privilege for me. We have to get this bunch out of office. I do think Biden’s crew can right the ship but then the real work has to begin.
173.9M women in U.S. 2020. Propaganda destroyed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s chances. Women donate $1.00 TONIGHT to show support for Joe Biden. Men feel free we are in this together! $1 each equal $173.9M women, plus men, exponential!  Donate $1! TONIGHT Link
I was asking lol i just assume people that aren’t voting Biden are voting trump
Fair point, but: the alternative is far worse. (No, we are not a three-party country, especially in this particular year.) My primary priority is to get rid of the current administration. Biden/Harris, even w/srs imperfections, are far greater than the current team o'jackwagons.

Oh, for sure. I didn't mean forget. Honey, I've let my natural hair color come in after 30+ years, so there's no forgetting this debacle. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Biden likely won't make it to 2024, which is the earliest that he even has a chance of getting the presidency.
Does anyone remember that Tulsi endorsed Biden? Does anyone remember that Kamala is now the VP nominee, and Tulsi has literally nothing?
It's very questionable if Biden will make it to 2024, much less 2025 for the inauguration, if he somehow wins the next election that he even has a chance of winning.

Harris Ignores Biden Race Record She Blasted Just a Few Months Ago
Supreme Court of the United States. Trump will get at least one or more picks. Hope you can get some caffeine in ya and get out the vote for Biden this year. 2022-24 will be too late.
Seems like your guy has been using the federal government as his personal plaything. You need to step back, sister, and let the grown - ups handle things. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Biden was on the sideline. But now, he’s taking it to the cup. My piece for Bloomberg
Can we have a mulligan on the last 4 years? Not record it on the official scorecard? #trumpmulligan #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
The Democrats themselves have given Trump all the material he needs to make ad campaigns against Biden and Harris (and in fact, Biden and Harris gave him a lot to use against each other.) It's kind of insane how much Democrats suck at politics at this point in history.
Hard truth. If you are a drama queen about Biden/Harris, please go play in traffic. The republic is in peril and your personal purity test is just not helpful.
If I were them I’d stop telling ppl that Donald Trump once supported Biden’s new running mate. That only supports Biden’s choice far as I’m concerned. I mean ... even Trump liked her. 🤷🏽‍♀️Duh
Also, are there no places for women in the new hypothetical Biden world?
#Trump: #Biden Is Insulting Men Everywhere by Picking Woman as Running Mate.  That's because Trump is scared of strong, smart women.  He only likes dumb blondes with stripper names.  #BidenHarris2020 #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
You and your criminal syndicate family are going to face so many criminal indictments. I can see why you're petrified. Better enjoy your freedom while you can because Biden will not be giving you a pardon. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
“I’d be comfortable drinking with Joe Biden and also comfortable with him warmingly embracing my daughter while sniffing her hair” said the white man
She could have just endorsed Bernie when the establishment backed Biden. Bernie/Warren would have won. But now, we have a cop and a racist. Exciting.

Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
I had the opportunity to see all the democratic presidential candidates last summer and it was such a great experience. Looking forward to voting for Biden/Harris in November. 👏🏽
If you are going to vote for Trump just say that… stop trying to cover it up with all the “Biden and Kamala are racist too” rhetoric 🙄 it’s dumb.
I wouldn’t be comfortable at all around a drunk Biden
Me finding out that Kamala Harris is Biden’s choice for VP:
you called Biden out as a racistist, now you are his slave so he can win the black vote. Selling your soul to the devil aren’t ya? Power is more important than having a soul right? Balcks, you have your token black running so go be sheep and vote accordingly, looser
I understand the frustration people who feel as if voting for Biden-Harris isn’t going to do much towards furthering the interests of Black people. I am one of those people. HOWEVER, the *other* candidate is Trump. It sucks, but it really is that simple.
If you’re not a troll you are clearly a butt-hurt Bernie bro. By choosing not to vote you choose fascism, racism and sexism for this country. I do think this country is worth saving. Biden admits his mistakes. Trump is a big whiny baby. You sound like him.
Trump can't win if Latinos turn out in large numbers for Biden. Period.
Trump and Biden should each take a history test.  We know Trump would fail it‼️
When the Harris nomination came across the TV, I broke down and cried. Not because she was my first choice (she wasn’t) but because after nearly 4 yrs of abuse from  , we FINALLY have a strong ticket to elect Biden for president. #BidenHarris2020 I’m thrilled!
Already starting the messaging “if biden steps down”.
Willing to “step in when and if Biden decides to step aside” like that very night.  I’m hoping she won’t get that chance.
This is hilarious. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are NOT radical leftists by any stretch of the imagination.
I agree that the country could’ve done better than Biden-Harris and that they probably will not enact policies that will jumpstart the systemic changes our country needs. But sadly, the current president is an orange goblin who wants the US to sink even further into Hell.
Did Biden get excommunicated while I wasn't looking?
The DNC picked Kamala Harris—a former cop who helped enforce the racist crime bill Biden helped write—over Elizabeth Warren? Pandering to BICPOC with a BIPOC candidate who is harmful to BIPOC communities ain't it.
Biden pick Harris finally good news in 2020!
Is this one of my crushes supporting Biden and Harris?? Yepppppppp
I would take Kamala over any of the Dem VP candidates from the past 30 years, with the possible exception of Al Gore: Caine, Biden, John Edwards, Joe Lieberman.
Did #MotherPence give you the special dessert tonight? #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Keep wasting your time barking up this tree. Black folks know and trust Joe Biden, and he won't let them down.
Careful, #GymJordan. Your fear is showing. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I have no recollection of when Tim Kaine joined the Clinton ticket, or when Joe Biden joined the Obama ticket, or when John Edwards joined the John Kerry campaign, or when Joe Lieberman joined the Gore ticket.  But I'll remember this one. #BidenHarris2020
Wonder if Biden is going to apologize to Harris now?
All hands on deck, huh? The GOP JV got called out to bash Biden/Harris. You're right that she won't increase black turnout because Biden is getting a 95-5 number anyway and your boy, the racist, has made those folks really angry. "What have you go to lose"? For GOP...everything.
Perfect! Thanks for your support! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
Do you think Biden picked based on hair smell?
I am so excited to witness  being the VP ticket for Joe Biden. This is something magical.
Biden thinking he can get the black vote without taking our policy demands seriously is shameful. Picking a black women vp just to woo black voters is too.
💥 I think Biden and Harris’s theme song should be the jaws theme song cos they are coming for trump and his swamp monsters   🦈 Duunnn Dunnn Duuuunnnn 🦈   #BidenHarris2020
Good!! I will stop work if Biden is elected - no tax money for your administration!!
I guess Biden is just mature enough to do what’s best for the country than be petty.
Not voting for trump is a vote for Biden/Harris to then right?
Proud to say my friend  and I called the Biden/Harris ticket way back before the Democratic nomination was even close to being decided in January! All you had to do was apply common sense to know this was the ticket that would win!
So excited! What a fantastic team! #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
The billionaires people have spent months complaining about getting richer during the pandemic want Biden to win just as badly as you do. Think for a sec if Trump was really helping them like you say he is why would Wall Street be literally cheering for Biden? Y’all are hilarious
the way biden kept teasing everyone like "sign up for our news letter to be the first to find out who my running mate will be 😛" as if literally everyone didn't already know it was going to be kamila harris lmfao
I'm very confused by this tweet. What VP could Biden (his handlers) have picked that would have cost Trump the Victory? None exists! Just another day closer to #Trump2020
Never Biden means 4 more years of #TraitorTrump  So get in line. Mind your manners. Swallow the jagged pill. Keep working after Biden is elected.

Remember When Kamala Harris Said She Believed Biden's Accusers?  via
This is wrong. He said himself that he's deliberately trying to take votes from worthy opponent Biden/Harris. I hope it backfires and makes Trump lose votes.
I know someone that refuses to vote for Biden|Harris (I don’t blame him) but he said he wouldn’t vote. So I called him a Trump supporter &amp; he got mad at me. I don’t get it
He also said Biden hurts god. 😂 #orangeidiot
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
So if you’re not voting for Biden/Harris WHO TF are you voting for?
Trump might not like Biden bringing up execution around this time next year.
Oh I'll be taking off work for the day before, the day of, and the day after because I'm sure I'll be celebrating heavily. With alcohol. #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden #nastiestwoman
Biden has stated that he is a one term president and that his VP pick would be handed the keys basically so I thinks it’s Kamala’s turn to represent moderate dems in 2024 regardless. It may be a long shot but electorally I do not see any other option
Trump/Pence-“Make America Great Again” Biden/Harris-“Don’t Touch My Hair!” Trump/Pence-“..ok I like theirs better”
I feel like if you voting for biden, just keep it to yourself at this point... ur embarassing yo self mane
Get over it. Biden did.
Tonight Trump accused Biden of treason and mentioned execution. Bad move on his part. he might find himself in that position one day.
They could’ve PICKED ANYONE ELSE!! But diddy and ten other lame ass muthufuckas pesuaded these folks to let this bitch run with biden? And blCk ppl are SOAKING IT UP LIKE ITS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF
I’d say it’s more so to replace Trump, endure Biden,  organize within DSA, and then vote AOC for 2024
Why is there annoying scream of Harris and Biden in the middle of my Twitter feed? Haven’t seen that for Trump.
Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris
Lmaoooo but y’all make sure to vote for biden tho!!!!
Meh,  Harris called Biden a  racist.
Based on what Trump tweeted after the announcement. They are falling back on the typical “Radical Left” rhetoric with Kamala. I don’t think it’s anything new than what Trump has been trying to paint Biden as. So I’m not too worried about it so much with Kamala
Will someone tell me why Bunker Biden is at the top of my Twitter feed?
Good. Biden went to UDel &amp; Syracuse. Harris to Howard &amp; UC Hastings. Not only are they representative of the country, but they know the power of a public education. And having an #HBCU grad as VP would hopefully bring support to #MinorityServingInstitutions! #HigherEd #SAPro

Kudos for telling it like it really is.  Vote Biden/Harris.
Vote Biden because he isn’t Trump
This is about more than just a GOTDAMN VP pick! There are fucking Supreme Court seats at stake! Our livelihoods, our safety!!!! And y'all worried about a fucking VP pick cause you don't like Biden? Man, fuck y'all!
So where can I get my Biden/Harris sign?
they REALLY, REALLY don't want Biden to debate Trump because they know it will be a disaster!!!
I'm not the one putting lofty ideals above real human suffering and death. I'm not the one throwing a protracted bitch fit because my candidate didn't win the nomination. Biden wasn't my 1st or 2nd choice but by god I will choose him over Trump!
The amount people that don't seem to realize how bad an idea it is for Kamala Harris to be VP, especially alongside Joe Biden, proves that people really don't do research or pay attention.  I'm still voting for them, but man this sucks. #BidenVP
She not young enough for Biden....
Should be “Tulsi destroyed Biden’s VP pick”
Hold up...that excuses valid points...and the over whelming majority of the population hasn’t ignored what Trumps record. To be clear tho Trump basically hurt a lot of people’s feelings, and more. But Harris/Biden...that’s some next level shit
See I don’t blame Biden because no doubt it would be a tough decision for me too. Me personally I would’ve picked someone like a Karen Bass, a congresswoman with roots in anti-police activism, has sympathies with the Left of the party, and is the chair of the Black Caucus
Deadass not gon lie, dead ass hope biden loses. Dead ass i hate trump but he’ll get his.
If I were to concede the point, I'd say something about Hillary Clinton receiving similar treatment 4 years prior, leading to her "losing" even with 3 million more votes.  Can we object to Biden's flaws (which I freely admit he has) without treating him like dogshit?
Never Biden, Never Cop
2020 is year of unprecedented challenges. We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

I’m not against the USPS handling mail in ballots.  I’m against the USPS backing Biden and also handling mail in ballots.  If you don’t see an issue with this, you’re an idiot.   It’d be the same if they were in favor of Trump for me.
If a dude slept with a married dude to get promoted, we would call it like it is, it’s not sexism.  Calling out Kamala for doing this isn’t sexism, it’s questioning the character of our potential next president because y’all know Biden ain’t lasting 4 years.
Is Biden-Harris on Tom Dewey's Path?
Umm Biden isn’t ahead, much less 15. Trump wins 40 States, thanks to antifa, BLM and the media. How many votes did Trump get when BLM attacked a Ronald McDonald house?
Biden is a racist, just ask his VP

I don't care what the predictions are, I'm voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is Trustworthy. Trump is not
Joe Biden is an honest man who will keep his word. Unlike crooked Trump who lies about everything and cannot be trusted. Vote Blue on November 3rd.
Prediction: Unless Biden wins, NY and Illinois will be officially bankrupt by the end of 2022 due to the mass exit of middle to upper income residents.
Pffft. Of course Biden will pick Rice to protect her from prosecution, why are they even debating this on the news?
It's a good question. I tend to lean conservative. I'd like to think I'm at least somewhat reasonable to the other side. Not sure if that resonates with folks who don Joe Biden facemasks.
Biden will let the scientists led us to victory over COVID-19.

The Great Recession ended in 6/09. In 7/09 there were 130.5 M jobs in the U.S. It took 62 months for the Obama-Biden “recovery” to add 9 million jobs or roughly the same number of jobs the Trump economic recovery added in the last 3 months.
Hey Joe Biden. Do you mean Seals and Crofts?
I'm pretty sure that every time Biden mutters some incoherent thought, appended by a "C'Mon Man!..."  it boosts Trump far more than any Russian support. In all seriousness, with the direct exposure of today, Trump himself wins or loses his own votes. Russia influence not so much
If the Obama-Biden administration had achieved job creation at this level for 3 months, they would be praised as economic miracle workers. But the anti-Trump media now greet the good economic news with only unjustified skepticism.  #FoxNews
