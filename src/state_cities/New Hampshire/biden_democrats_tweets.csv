And Biden will be worse
They‚Äôre going to do second waves of shutdowns around election season because they want to make sure Trump and Biden don‚Äôt get to have a 1v1 debate, I see trump losing this election season because of that reason. May the best candidate win #positivity üòÄ
You are correct. Biden needs come down on the right side of this and that's to choose Kamala.
This shows that Biden was going to withhold money if a prosecutor needed to get fired.
But Biden isnt even preferable to Trump. There's a very good case to be made that he's worse.
The Biden campaign knows about Bass‚Äôs history with the Brigade, which began as a joint venture of the Castro government and Students for a Democratic Society, the leftist, antiwar organization that gave birth to the Weather Underground terrorist group.
Why is it Binary now specifically? Hes not starting wars like Obama and Bush did. He has been great at keeping peace with North Korea.  I don't trust Biden on EITHER of those issues and without a doubt foreign intervention is the most important issue in this election.  #VoteGold
Arab also called the Trump base stupid. What a piece of shit. #RacePimp #nhpolitics : Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
What on planet Earth makes you think I would ever vote for Biden? I don't hate women and children. I don't hate innocent farmers in the Middle East. I don't relish the idea of putting the literally mentally ill in positions of power.  #JoNotJoe #VoteGold #VoteLibertarian
Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è A few people have asked me where to donate, so RTing this to say  Biden, or a state/local Democratic candidate are all great choices!
It doesn't help your pappy insulting VP Biden!  I would rather read a KKK book than yours!
Under a Biden presidency our freedoms will be lost forever. Soon we may see people wanting to leave this greAt country.
I'm from NH, just saw the polls here. Joe Biden leads by 13 points. Proud of my Granite State brothers and sisters. #TrumpKillsUS
Would Biden have those nominations or his VP?
Trump 2020. Biden is a fool. This Mom doesn‚Äôt approve that message he‚Äôs sending.
Absolutely not! You‚Äôll be too busy actually working to tweet! Biden 2020! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Here is the #nhdems/#dems/#CrookedJoe Biden‚Äôs plan for racial equality. #nhpolitics #HateTheWhiteGuy
Biden even eulogized KKK member Robert Byrd at his funeral and said he was a wonderful great guy. Christina Brown Biden has history of multiple Racist remarks and the Media nor BLM says absolutely nothing about it! Horrible I
So UNH's survey of New Hampshire has... -Biden up 53%/40% on Trump -Gov. Sununu (R) up by like 30% -Sen. Shaheen (D) up almost 20% I think it's possible Biden's lead in NH may be a bit smaller right now than this (maybe like 8-10% or so,) but the rest checks out decently well.
The vp will be serving at Least 2 years of Biden‚Äôs term -that pick alone could derail his election-
Joe Biden IS dementia personified!
What stupid Republican hasn‚Äôt down played this virus!!  downplayed it!! You all are just killing yourselves. Gonna make it hopefully easier for Biden to win in November. Darwin at his finest!!
We have really gotten off track of the original point.. Fleccas summation of what Biden said is inaccurate
You won‚Äôt be safe in #CrookedJoe Biden‚Äôs America. #nh #nhpolitics
I agree Trump will probably destroy Biden in the debates... What does that have to do with someone disingenuously  interpreting someone elses statements?
This asshole voted to impeach Trump because he asked #Ukraine about #CrookedJoe Biden‚Äôs #crooked son Hunter. It‚Äôs time to #ReclaimNH! #nhpolitics
Well ya. 1000 officers isn‚Äôt necessary for 300 ppl. Biden also has secret service. Nice headline for those who don‚Äôt read the article
I think it underscores that this race hasn't been about Biden, and still isn't really. It's about if people want trump back in or not... and right now, it sure doesn't look like they do. COVID and the BLM protests helped push Trump's JAs back to where they have been for awhile.
The state of the National Presidential Race with Biden and Trump over the last 9 months in RCP:  October 29th, 2019: Biden 50.1%, Trump 43.4% Trump approval: Disapprove 53.9%, Approve 42.4%  July 29th, 2020: Biden 50.1%, Trump 41.7% Trump approval: Disapprove 55.8%, Approve 42.9%
Biden is still ahead in national poll 50.1 - 41.7

It‚Äôs not that Joe Biden changes his opinion every day He has a condition that when he sees a pin of a dog on your jacket he will make up a lie about a dog He makes up things he sees around him like corn pop was a bad black dude because that day he was surrounded with Black people

Biden for president!  Your dad has done nothing but make America the laughing stock of the world! My cat would make a better president than Trump!!!!
The first thing President Biden should do is require low income housing be built in Mar A Largo!
I need a Biden yard sign ! The asshole neighbor just put up his trump flag! Help!!!
Full disclosure: I only heard PART of Biden's speech because my friend and I went to stand in the ladies' room line then because we'd heard him talk so many times and it wasn't like he was going to win. Oops!
I have seen no credible evidence of Biden's supposed cognitive impairment.  Trump, on the other hand, could be used as a casebook study for FTD/PSP.

Lol ya it was brutal. Like watching Biden in a press conference
Honest question: Does anyone here really believe that Collins has a good shot to win most of the undecideds in these #MEsen polls? She's roughly around Trump's share of support, is trailing, and the vast majority of undecideds are gonna back Biden. And they don't approve of her.
If Kamala Harris is VP ( candidate) Biden won't have to worry about picking an AG.
She reminds me in a way of Cheney - a strong VP who won‚Äôt run for President after Biden
Make America Great again, Vote for Joe Biden üåäüåäüåä
I mean, you're wearing a Joe Biden shirt. How optimistic should I be about the future of the left?
Another to say it is that Biden has a 52.5% chance of losing it.

Harvard University professor Cornel West, who also supported Sanders during the primary, said: "We have to be true to ourselves and acknowledge that Biden is a mediocre, milquetoast, neoliberal centrist that we‚Äôve been fighting against in the Democratic establishment," West said.

When Trump kicks #CrookedJoe Biden‚Äôs ass, him and his 600 #dems lawyers are ready to claim he won due to absentee ballots being under counted and will throw the country into chaos. The #HateAmerica party. #nhpolitics
Doesn't matter, 45's handlers will never let him debate. He's in late-stage dementia and Biden is - a stutterer who knows all the ins-and-outs of the office.
Joe Biden should be held accountable we see through his lies
NC voted about 6% to the right of the nation in 2016, so if Biden's up 9%-10% then he's probably up 3%-4% in NC.

Why is a misogynist on Biden‚Äôs VP search committee?
I'm not sure I understand which of those things don't apply to Biden. He has credible rape accusations against him.
I mean, what advantage comes from a Biden victory? Does anything indicate that he would do anything about the police issue we have in this country? No. Anything indicate that he wants to end the continuous wars? No. Anything indicate he can handle a pandemic? No.  #VoteGold2020
His whole issue w mail-in voting is so obviously setting him up so that he won‚Äôt have to accept losing if Biden is elected. If only he put this much time and effort into running the country. ü§®

This is how #CrookedJoe Biden is running for President. #tcot #tlot #nhpolitics #dems
Because he is running  President! Trump is no fan of CNN and has been on that-Wallace is a tough but fair interviewer -Biden‚Äôs campaign knows it would expose him-all the more reason not to hide
Ya but Trump went on‚ÄîBiden is in hiding-
Biden can deal with Russians and Iran but afraid of Chris Wallace ?that‚Äôs all you need to know -his people are hiding him-he can‚Äôt follow an interview-how sad
Is Biden winning a good outcome?
Do not see anything regarding Chris Wallace Fox Sunday.  Joe Biden will NEVER give an interview to Wallace because he is unable, due to his increased dementia.  Keep him hidden, but we the people know!  We are not STUPID!
Answer to Why are Trump supporters saying that Trump would win in the debates against Biden? Trump's interview with Chris Wallace and his recent press conference were disastrous. by Mark Jubelirer
I vote anyway. Even if it makes only a minuscule amount of difference. I fully admit my vote is basically because I don‚Äôt want Trump to get a second term. I also believe Biden would be leagues better.
This is a great conversation between Biden and Obama.
I almost expect #Biden to select VP late this week!! If not this week, early next certain. You need 2 weeks to get the nominee in line with everything. It‚Äôs coming!!

I completely disagree with the sentiment that enthusiasm for Trump is higher than for Biden. Enthusiasm on the Trump side is for what Trump hates, not Trump himself. On the Biden side, there is a ton of enthusiasm for an empathetic President.

In 2016, Trump won AZ by 3.5%. Remembering that Clinton won nationwide by 2.1%, that would mean AZ voted about 5.6% more R than the nation as a whole - if it's similar this time, these polls further confirm Biden's 9-10% lead in national polling.
Since July 6th, we've had 5 polls of Arizona. Averaging them all together, Biden is up 49% to 45%. Close to Lean D status, but not quite there yet. This is all in line with a Biden lead of roughly 9% nationally.
Who's more "incoherent" in these 2 video's? Jon Voight or Joe Biden?  If Joe Biden wins in November do you really believe he's going to the one running the country?
I'm not sure which folks seriously listen to  call  a racist and aren't aware of how racist Biden is, but those folks have to exist, because he's winning a DNC nomination. Or maybe  nominate him *because* he's racist. #VoteGold  #VoteGold2020

Adam is legit stakeborder hippe dude. He didn't like Trump but he started listening to his speeches and such and seeing what the media said compared to what the man actually said, dude is on the Trump train. Only reason I'm voting Trump is Biden is brainless.And Biden will be worse
Let Biden be president n Kamala Harris be VP and let her have more say because she deserves it
Although I support Warren for VP (or whatever role she wants, tbh), I've been hesitant to donate to her Biden fundraisers... It feels like they are prolonging the process so they can dangle "your fave as VP" and squeeze money from individual bases as long as possible.
Kamala Harris has done more to promote, fund raise and get Biden‚Äôs message out than anyone else. So all the has beens a please stop.
This shows that Biden was going to withhold money if a prosecutor needed to get fired.
Ignoring concerns about the threats to women‚Äôs civil rights, Joe Biden promises to use the Equality Act to promote a long list of transgender rights that will eclipse women‚Äôs rights and the rights of people of faith if he is elected.
The whole Kamala Harris vs Karen Bass twitter slap fight has me hoping for a Biden/Duckworth or Biden/Rice ticket.
If Biden wins you will see biggest cat fight in history over who will control him first lady or vp, since  Wilson was president , oh ya didn't he start a war,

There's a real twist, guess you're voting for Biden. Whatever you do, don't forget, he's going to need everyone who will get behind him.  Good luck....

Exactly. Dems have a great Senate candidate in Montana who could run 5% ahead of Biden but not 10%. Biden keeping it close could net another Dem pickup opportunity

You need to vote for Biden and the demand electoral reform to remove the two party hegemony. Sanders, Yang, Warren, Harris, Trump, and Kasich should all be standing, and then a run-off election can ensure a majority support the winner.

In 2016, Trump won AZ by 3.5%. Remembering that Clinton won nationwide by 2.1%, that would mean AZ voted about 5.6% more R than the nation as a whole - if it's similar this time, these polls further confirm Biden's 9-10% lead in national polling.
Since July 6th, we've had 5 polls of Arizona. Averaging them all together, Biden is up 49% to 45%. Close to Lean D status, but not quite there yet. This is all in line with a Biden lead of roughly 9% nationally.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty. "All scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse...The law is...helpless against a president willing to ignore it."
Regardless:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Done, in a stand alone tweet and here: JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Sorry to say but if you have clear eyes,  you can clearly see that Biden can‚Äôt function in society because of all his abuse he‚Äôs done to children he can‚Äôt even fake it to himself. He doesn‚Äôt have a sane mind .  Please look at what‚Äôs going on in his head . He is gone
Florida's Dem's Latino outreach has sucked. They missed the target in every cycle except the '08 &amp; '12 Obama/Biden campaigns. In '16 &amp; '18 they did dumb crap like organize Evangelical Latino to the polls &amp; allow GOP to run unanswered Spanish language ads tying Dems to socialism.
He didn't say he was in... Just that he could beat off Biden if enough people voted
lol at the idea that it ever meant anything.   also lol at the idea at Biden will be more than 1% different than Trump.
And how are you Republicans gonna act if Biden is elected
So since July 7th, there have been 5 public polls of Florida. Of those, 4 have Biden at or above 50%, and his lead over Trump has ranged from 6%-13%. Folks, FL is not a tossup right now.
What are the odds trump is not spying on Biden?  The odds are better that he will not bounce it when he throws the first pitch in August ( jelly much of Fauci?)
Joe Biden will be our next President of the United States.
You are a joke.  First you knuckle heads went after Hillary Clinton for decades trying to pin anything on her and now you are trying with Obama/Biden.  You will lose!
Just gonna sit this over here...  "If this is what Joe Biden has in mind for his cabinet, or his vision of what his administration will look like, then can those of us on the left really be blamed for refusing to fall in line?"
What a dangerous notion to have. I think if you vote Joe Biden than you are a pedophile. Fair enough?
60% of 2nd quarter NH presidential donors gave to Joe Biden, 40% to Donald Trump.
Did you complain about it when Biden charged the Secret Service to stay on his property every weekend?
Covid started being reported in the Villages if it runs wild there Biden will win by 10%
Agree! What‚Äôs up with that?
I haven‚Äôt seen any Biden boat parades in Florida!

If you can't make a salient argument on your own, don't bother. Here are the facts of the argument we were having: The trump virus is bad and he handled it poorly Trump is showing major cognitive decline You added: Biden can't tie his shoes Trump is stopping Fascist.

Those are not Trump supporters, they are Biden supporters like you. They riot like a kid has a tantrum. If your kid has a tantrum do you just give them whatever they want?
Biden asked him not to endorse him during the primary‚Äôs. Primary‚Äôs are over
Ah my friend if you only but knew who or what the silent majority is. Right now the silent majority is marching in Portland, they are finding ways to keep their kids from getting killed by Trump's back to school orders. Trump's campaign of hatred has brought them out....for Biden
Prior to my knee injury in 2001, I was capable of a 300 pound deadlift. After that I had problems getting it up. Fortunately to vote on November third I don't have to deadlift 300 pounds. I can pick up a pen; and vote for Joe Biden.
Sorry, Trump said groping was okay. Biden is a gentle soul who treats other humans with respect, including touching and hugging them like a normal human being does/should
Will Biden do better? I have no idea, I wish we had better choices, but another 4years of trump and we will be living in a third world shit hole. He has no plan for covid, other than to ignore it and hope it goes away.
Wasn't that right around the time Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade?  Let's focus on the allegations with at least a shred of credibility
Boris:  They are protesting Trump, not Joe, and would be home playing video games if Biden were President.
The #DNC is August 17th. 3 weeks from Monday. It‚Äôs almost normal protocol to have a VP 2 weeks prior now. So we SHOULD know Biden‚Äôs pick (crosses fingers) sometime late next week. 7-10 days or so.I don't remember any toilet paper lines when Biden was VP; why will we have them when he's prez?  In fact, the ONLY toilet paper shortage I recall from my 57 years of life was during the fascist regime of Agent Orange...
That's some serious cray-cray right here girl. You blame a wife, then blame Biden for getting an endorsement. Next level Q_type gas lighting, or are you in serious need of mental health counseling? #WTAF

If you 20m listen to my discussion this morning on WKBK we discuss Sununu's election possibilites, #Feltes v #Volinsky in the Dem Primary and "the  pledge" and Biden v Trump it may be a roadmap 4 the election #nhpolitics
Whatever else happens after he leaves office, Trump has permanently warped political standards in this country and reduced politics to meeting the absolute minimum threshold of "not constantly embarassing" (which of course Biden barely clears)
You mean playing clips of HIS Gestapo kidnapping people, then claiming it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs America wasn‚Äôt fooling anyone?
Biden Makes False Statement About U.S. Economic Contraction
Are you joining Biden‚Äôs campaign or is there another ‚ÄúWe‚Äù I should know about?
If they're being serious, I can respect that, as I believe the best way to support Biden is to be honest and admit that by doing so I'm "settling", but if they're being mocking, that's also ok, as I can admit the position must come off as absurd even if it is 1 I hold myself
Can anyone tell me if the  account is legit or not? Like, are they actually trying to get Biden elected, or are they parodying his supporters?
Imagine Joe Biden doing something as basic as saying "the Department of Homeland Security was a mistake." The man will in no way shape or form run back or even reform this massive usurpation of our civil liberties.

If someone could name a single signature Joe Biden policy ambition I will delete this tweet
It would be nice if someone could hold "just wants to be President" against Joe Biden too. That's literally the sum total of reasons he wants the job. Because he wants it. He doesn't actually plan to do anything meaningful when he has it.
You just described your Fearless Leader with that last sentence! See, here's where you lose this argument:  Unlike Trump, Biden had never faced legal action for that of which you accuse him. Second, Biden stutters. It's normal. Trump just rambles incoherently.
No. People like you who continue to condone corrupt people like Trump and Barr make me angry. When Biden wins on November 3, the two of them, his Cabinet, and you complicit deplorable TRAITORS will pay dearly.  #NoFascismInAmerica #BlueWave2020 üåä

Same.  When we had twenty-some candidates, Biden wasn't even among my top ten.  But he's still got my vote (albeit unenthusiastic); I'd vote for an empty paper bag over Agent Orange any day.
You mean like under the Obama/Biden 8 years in office when nothing was done. Glad this administration is stepping up.
Are they saying the virus and protests will disappear the day after the election if Biden wins, but if Trump wins, we'll get four more years of the apocalypse?
‚ÄòSquad‚Äô Member Tlaib Won‚Äôt Endorse Biden
Still can't really get over the fact that the Democrats are essentially getting a free Presidential term after the most diverse field of candidates in the party's history left them with the unequivocal worst candidate by a mile. Michael Bennett would have been better than Biden.
mate you don't know what you're on about. Neither candidate is going to give us it without pressure and Biden is the only one who might cave.

Never said inject Clorox. The media did though  The pussy grabbing comment was an example of what some women will let celebrities do. Wasn‚Äôt an admission, but shouldn‚Äôt have been said  The test is a taunt to Joe Biden to also take it. Which a lot of people don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd pass
Note that I am ok with this, btw. I believe that Biden can beat all the other candidates in the field even with Kanye explicitly trying to draw votes from him. I just want people to be honest about his intentions here.
who said anything about the black vote? I'm just talking about whose vote Kanye is trying to win here: Biden voters, which includes both black voters and white voters
To all the people who complained when others pointed out that Kanye was more likely to take votes from Biden than Trump, here he is admitting that that's exactly what he's trying to do:
I don't think it's Trump. Obama and Biden started spying on the Trump people. There is a string of documents that show how corrupt they are. The media of the left doesn't report it.  The Steele dossier paid for by the DNC and Hillary for starters.
Typical Joe Biden story. Mmmm...tuna sandwich.
Hardly. You want cult just look at the mess with BLM. Americans haven't seen this much damage, and these many homicides are going on. The USA is in a significant deficit. If Biden gets in, it will be horrific. Free everything will cost our freedom.
Sanders campaign is working for Biden now, and the Green Party is still running a candidate, it's just Howie Hawkins this time
Your father got taken to school for same bullshit on national TV and was made a fool of, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...
Interesting fact,  previously supported charter schools until he decided to run for President.  supports charters but unlike Mr Biden President Obama put the needs of children ahead of teachers union money. #CharterSchools

Reminder that polls aren't votes. Biden being up in red states means nothing as long as the GOP controls the voting systems in those states and can suppress all of his votes.
In what universe do you live in where Americans are paid to be parents? Having two parents does not guarantee they will have plenty of money, just like having only one does not guarantee they won't have a ton. Joe Biden was a single dad for fuck's sake
