I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.

Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.
They were just in Minnesota.  Fuck!
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
I mean, to be fair, Biden’s policy is a lot more sound and detailed than trumps, no matter how you look at it. His goals are clear, and they mostly align with democratic beliefs. It ain’t too hard to get
Watching cartoons is a much better use of your time at this point. Trump, Barr, et al, are fencing a hell of a reckoning this year and they know it. The childish antics, looting of the US Treasury, will ramp up until the Biden Administration, D majority Senate takes over in Jan.
Absolutely — Bill Barr must be indicted, convicted &amp; jailed. I used to be of the mind — assuming Biden’s  elected president — that there should be a time of “healing” to move past the Trump debacle. No more—Trump, Barr &amp; cronies must be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
Close.  M will be VP.  Then after election, Biden will be declared incompetent. M will be sworn in.
As long as you're not voting for Biden.
Biden is a 47 year fraud and a liar. The Democrats are growing desperate, They are now supporting organized chaos in our cities and getting innocent people killed. They will lose and lose big in November. #Trump2020Landslide
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for America’s Constitution!
If he ever hopes to pull in a larger proportion of the Democrats he has to play the politics. You can tell he's playing too because there is no passion behind his posts about Biden, just robotic statements
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Except this likely wouldn’t happen to Biden if he became president, since he already has policy which would directly help these communities. Part of the reason these happened in the first place was due to trump not addressing key racial issues (ex: disproportionat covid deaths)
What a senseless thing to say. 45’s entourage are dropping like flies with Covid, and you question people who are being cautious? Vice President Biden was there to honor John Lewis. Some were not.
Joe Biden wants to cut social security and disability and Medicare and Medicaid. How will that work out for you? The retirement age won't exist if Joe Biden is elected.
I AM living in Never Neverland, because this is Never Never going to happen.  I am not voting for Joe Biden.  This election is a referendum on Trump, and my vote will help remove him from office.  Trump should never have allowed to secure the Republican nomination.
In any event, you’re not going to find what you’re hoping to find as Tara Reade herself says she complained about sexual harassment, not assault, in 1993 in conversations with supervisors.  We haven’t heard much else since her attorney dropped her in May.
The documents at the U of D are Biden’s Senate Records.  The records do not contain personnel files.  Biden's statement said any records of such a complaint could only be at the National Archives, "at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices."
Sprucing up the place for the Biden’s in 2021.
Nice of her to spruce it up for when the Biden’s come in in 2021.
Nice of this witch to spruce it up for the Biden’s.
I saw the show it was amazingly alarming. Somehow that message has to get out to the general public nobody realizes what might happen if they elect Joe Biden. That would be the end of our country as we know it. They would take all the rights away from the people in the suburbs.
President Joe Biden Will Have the Palestinians' Back – and Israel's, Too
NOTHING. Over his decades-long career in the Senate, Biden was known as a demanding but fair and family-oriented boss, devoted to his home life in Delaware.  He was not on a list of “creepy” male senators that female staffers warned each other to avoid.

He literally says in this interview he turned down a Biden interview.
Things seen in comments today;  "Biden is a far-left wacko and I can't take anyone seriously if they don't believe this."  Dude needs to get out more.  Maybe stop watching OANN.
Chris Wallace told your dad, and proved him wrong, that Biden does NOT support defunding the police. You are a dolt and a liar. Runs in the family.
Firing ppl 4 political donations is bad. But ppl will misread this as being only reflective of the respondents. Trump is a narcissistic, incompetent, amoral grifter w/ authoritarian instincts.  Biden is a “normal” politician, like every other D&amp;R prez nominee in the last 44 yrs.

Trumps America is the right America where law and order are still important. The Democrats have no power left than to help cause chaos in inner cities, Funded anarchy. Your risking a civil war with an elected Biden. Trump is the anti establishment and the dems dont like it boohoo
Please don’t be sucked into this conspiracy — it only feeds into the Trump narrative of an America that’s out of control. And further detracts from Trump’s “Trump Virus” failings. So when you march, be safe. And for Biden sake, do it as peacefully as you can. Thank you—Be well.
Governor  has a 65% approval rating, and it's well deserved. Thank you for the leadership through the one of the toughest years Minnesota has ever faced, Governor.

I can’t believe all these Trump ads that are like, “this is what Biden’s America would look like”, while showing very real footage from Trump’s America. What is the game there? Does Trump think the rest of us have dementia too? People buy this shit??

You’re right so one out of 30 he is innocent. Biden just leaned over close enough to smell her hair. Perv

It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.

And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.

U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?
Kamala too bad this time you can’t sleep your way to the top. Biden only likes little girls.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
I'm glad he's gone, Biden will be the next to go.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!
Nah, you not acknowledging you were talking out of your ass about chinese imports was what made you a clown-- this is just really weak sauce use to say Biden is in it with the Chinese. In the end I don't think he'd green light muslim concentration camps-- so that's good by me.

I mean maybe more with Biden and actuary tables I’ll be interested in who he picks, but basically as long as I believe they could be president... who cares?
How many VP picks actually matter? Cause frankly all I remember from Obama picking Biden was that he handled Palin well and beat Paul Ryan so badly on TV I was waiting for a corner man to throw the towel.
Trump would’ve beat biden if it wasnt for corona
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.
Donald Trump had to go against Hilary Clinton and then Joe Biden.  What is this the play in game and the first round of the NCAA tournament?!?!?!?!?!!!
Biden and Trump
Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.

Neither forwards nor backwards, Biden is gone.
Agree, FNC is still entertainment, I don't care how good Chris Wallace is, there's no upside to giving that channel any uptick in ratings which a Biden interview would do. They're still carnival barkers to me. Biden doesn't need them, they need him. All the more reason to not.
That has got to be the MOST IGNORANT THING I'VE READ since 45 stepped into office. White privilege, right there. If you think Biden is as bad, you're a straight white middle class male.
Biden doesn't want to be on a FAKE news station!
This indicates the opposite of 2016. Voters seem to want to put a check on a potential 2nd Trump term than to put a check on Biden. People don't think of Biden as a prohibitive favorite like Clinton.
Biden's gone, he's not playing with a full deck.
Biden's scared of his own shadow.
They ought be terrified because there's a Blue Tsunami coming and it will be even worse in 2022 when many more republican senators are running than Democrats and Americans have seen the good that a Biden administration will do for all.

True. She said if Biden wins we’ll have socialism like the nazis. Who were fascists like Trump and his entire party and idiot followers like her. People really are that stupid. Plus racism.

Biden can't even tie his shoelaces, he's a joke!
This is it. You have a base of voters interested in policy and so far the Biden camp has done very little to reach out. They aren't asking for much. Just something more than "Not Trump".
Fox News polling says that Joe Biden is up by nine points in Michigan and eleven points in Pennsylvania. This is even uglier for Donald Trump than the overall polling averages, which say that Biden is up by about eight points in Michigan and about seven points in Pennsylvania.
A flood of dems will vote for trump secretly come election day. Most people are not ok with looting, burning, assaulting, and killing that the left has to offer. Go ahead and talk yourself into the myth that biden will win. Millions of dems will vote for trump. Secretly.
Biden very well could be a good man. You have seen him gaff just about every time he has spoke. The chances are pretty good he has dementia. You must be hoping he picks a decent running mate. Because that person will at some point be president. Biden isn’t mentally capable.

Biden will euthanize all puppies and kittens! He will set fire to all orphanages!  He will personally perform after-birth abortions! Biden will erect cancer-causing/bald eagle killing windmills! He will make rich people pay taxes! BIDEN DOESNT EVEN PLAY GOLF!!!
This will be great. Trump campaign could use the harris sound bites against biden. Love it
These “If Biden’s VP isn’t (my preferred person) then he’s lost my vote” people need to snap out of it.
Pretty clear to me he has chosen Kamala as his running mate!! Biden notes show talking points about Kamala Harris
Anybody that would support Biden after all he has failed to do during his time in Washington has an intelligence problem. Where were all these great ideas that Biden has now when he was the VP? Sorry but you Trump haters are really brainwashed.
If Biden shoots my dog he's not getting my vote. Not a scenario I'd expect, but there is a line.
Former Virginia City Councilor to serve as Minnesota political director for Biden Campaign
A former Virginia City Councilor has been tapped to become the Minnesota political director for the Joe Biden campaign.
Why do you have all Joe Biden on your profile list of tweets?
This is a smart play, Georgia has been moving our way the last several cycles and with a little investment we can finally put that nail in  Biden Flipping Georgia More Likely Than Texas
Texas. The trends put Texas into a 50/50 state by the election and every dollar Biden spends in Texas is $2 trump has to spend that he can't spend elsewhere. Right now trump is in full retreat and when the enemy is retreating, you don't dig in you attack.
Don’t get me wrong. Biden was far from my first choice. Biden could still lose. We can’t take anything for granted.  But don’t torpedo the damned ship from the port side.
The RCP Average has Biden +9, even Rasmussen shows Biden +2, several polls show Biden leading most swing states and Trump vulnerable in unthinkable spots like Texas.  And I am being told (establishment) Democrats are the reason Trump will win re-election.
Biden is appealing to anyone who will vote against Trump. Yes.  That does not equate to letting liberals drown. That meme is childish and not constructive.  Now answer MY question.
FTR, I was just blocked by an alleged 2020 Biden voter merely for disagreeing that Ronald Reagan “worked across the aisle.”
I voted for Reagan in 1984, my first ballot at age 18. I wouldn’t say he worked across the aisle and at 53 I wouldn’t even make the argument that he was particularly well-intentioned. But if Reagan Republicans are attracted to something about Biden over Trump, I’ll not complain.

I don’t think Biden needs to debate. Just take the snap...dance around the end zone for a few seconds and step out of the back for a safety.
Your precious Obama/Biden we’re locking people in cages first.  It has been fixed and people are not in cages anymore.  Maybe you should focus on FACTS instead of what other people and CNN tell you.
And even if your worst fears about them are true, wouldn’t we rather have Trump, Fox and the Russians distracted by Project Lincoln than focused on attacking Joe Biden and the Democrats down-ticket?
Thank you, Joe Biden and Ron Klain. This is easy to understand and very helpful to know what could be done with a change in leadership.
I'll vote for Biden in a haz mat suit if I have to.  No #Trumpdictatorship

Fiscally you're like 1 and a half steps to the right of Joe Biden
Biden doesnt have to acknowledge Trumps/Foxs "dares"...  He just needs to keep watching Trump talk! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funny because Joe Biden has DONE some nasty things to women and is under investigation in Ukraine!
I just hope that Biden has him and wife investigated.
It has to break at some point. I can promise that if Biden wins then Congress will be hard controlled by R's in 2022. He will "reach across the aisle" and approve everything they want. And then the R POTUS candidate for 2024 will be even worse than Trump.
Hillary is a proven loser. Biden is FAR more of a proven loser, but the establishment put everything behind him once the little mouse face was an obvious loss. Hey, can you remind me how using this strategy went in 2016? Oops.
How's that? The choices are Biden or Trump. Neither are going to end the fascist dystopian shit we're seeing everywhere.
Get a grip!  You say Ivanka coming here like it’s a bad thing.    Didn’t Biden just do a ad with Obama the other day. That is what scares us.  Obama might be holding the puppet strings. TRUMP2020
Half of voters say they would never back Trump. Thirty-seven percent could never vote for Biden. That leaves 13 percent “up for grabs.”  Frankly I might have more respect for Trumpers than for the 13 percent who claim they haven’t figured this out yet.
Joe Biden is a uniter.
Poor article. It clearly states in the that it’s the “coordinated campaign” which is the Florida Dem party not the Biden campaign.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Everybody, listen up. The Trump voter with an avi of Joe Biden in blackface has some conservative wisdom to offer.
I believe there are no genuinely undecided voters in these polls. There are Trump voters, Biden voters, and Trump voters lying to say they are undecided.
Since Biden is mentally and politically inept his VP is going to be running the country behind the scenes. And it looks like that person will be  fuck. Couldn't we have picked a black woman neoliberal hack who didn't run in the primary like Susan Rice?
Is it not now done?  He promised it and he did it!  That’s how this president works. Joe Biden would NEVER have done this and you know it.
I think the minute Biden announces his running mate, Nikki Haley pushes in there with her sharp, ambitious elbows.
The second Biden is sworn in Trump, Pence, Barr, Kayleigh, Ivanka, Betsy, Don Jr, Eric, Miller and anyone else who lied for him or used the office of the president to further his crimes needs to be handcuffed, arrested and held over for trial. They belong in fed prison for LIFE!
I'm with you on Biden man, I sensed an assumption that I was a supporter. Maybe I misinterpreted. Twitter can do that.  I do see him as the less immediately threatening of two evils, but I'm really tired of choosing between two politicians I wouldn't piss on if they were on fire.
Again, you're makinga lot of assumptions here. Joe Biden sucks. Trump just happens to suck more. This is what happens when the masses are okay with decades of oligarchy.
As we rebuild and recover, our economy can't afford Joe Biden's $4.1 Trillion tax increase, the largest tax increase in American history.
You don't expect them to run stuff like that when they need room in case a Biden email scandal happens some day, do you?
It's super easy for these people to jump ship and back Biden because Democrats and Republicans do more or less the same fucking thing
What Joe Biden’s #climate Plan Really Signals
criminal, liar, adderall, Biden, Obama
Me either.... In a very blue area too and i haven't seen any biden signs nor commericals.. The country is LITERALLY gonna paint over the blue with red, no doubt bout it
1. The presidency isn't the only office.  That said, does it not strike you that despite the only "viable" alternative to Biden being DONALD FUCKING TRUMP, Biden isn't the clear winner to tens of millions of people? There's a million good reasons for that.
This may have escaped you, but Biden isn't the only person running for an office.
Tell us again WHY the convention was canceled?  😂😂😂😂 Florida HATES you!
Anyone wanna talk about what Joe Biden is tweeting about? Or how nice it is to have an honest, uplifting message like this?  Or is everyone busy giving the narcissist what he wants?  Thanks for the inspiration again
Aww, you're cute if you think Biden won't do EXACTLY what Trump is doing. Stupid, but cute.
We don't think, we *know*. Look at Biden's history, ffs. He is a CONSERVATIVE. He's a DINO. Why is that hard to understand?
COVID is killing Trump in Florida.   On that note.. GO BIDEN!!

I keep seeing this come across my timeline and it gets dumber every time.  “You see how bad it is right now? If you elect Joe Biden, it will be ... uhhhhhh ...

MICHELLE OBAMA. WILL BE JOE BIDEN PICK FOR VP. WISHFUL THINKING!
Right.  We won't fall for Senate Republicans' new-found praise for Representative John Lewis.  If Biden is to be successful, we need to replace some Senators:  McConnell, Collins, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, etc.  Contribute if you can to
Leading the list of accomplices are Republican Senators.  Leaving them in office will make it impossible for a Biden administration to do the work that is needed: immigration reform, justice reform, etc. Vote out McConnell, Collins, Ernst, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, ... 🌊
Listen all you math geniuses: Biden = Pro Democracy                Trump = Tyranny                                  In which America do you want live?
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
They will in 2021 - to criticize Biden...
Since Biden is still within the margin of error in swing states, after a whole lot of centrism in his platform, he should just try a progressive idea, #MedicareForAll for example, and see what happens... he’s gonna try walk it back anyways, even if it polls well.
Joe Biden has been trying to become President for over 30 years.
How does Hunter Biden rake in millions as a board member of a gas company?

Yes, polls show Biden winning by wider and wider margins but remember everyone said HRC was a lock-in. Then she wasn't.  And right now I'm watching Progressives who were going to hold their nose and vote Biden now seriously reconsidering that.
In a race where a literal fruitcake (the loaf) would win in a landslide, the Democratic Party has worked hard to alienate their entire progressive wing and are simply hoping people hate DJT so much they overlook Biden's enormous flaws.
I honestly think we're legit looking at a situation where Trump wins narrowly but the GOP gets das boot from both chambers of Congress.  Biden and the DNC keep doing themselves no favors in a race where they literally just have to not be crooked/say dumb things but keep doin it.
Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy
Both presidential and senate races in AZ are quite close.  So easy for Trump/McSally to distort what is happening in the streets.  Hope Biden and Mark Kelly have a good message to turn AZ blue in November.
My biggest fear is Biden loses. But a close second is this exact scenario. "Scorched earth" doesn't even begin to cover it. Especially if the Senate flips and Dems hold the House.
The same place joe Biden touched all those little girls

Maga trolls: Biden is an old man who will be a puppet.  Hes told to be president and his advisers will actually be running the country. I'm lile totally cool with a group of presumably competent people running the country for for years.
DJT's brain is a pre-enlightenment model.  It doesn't do science or statistics or modern medicine.  You want those features in the Oval Office, better vote Biden.  🌊

Biden has his flaws - not the perfect candidate by any means. However, more than ever before, our country needs an empathetic leader. A leader to unite our country, not polarize it anymore than it already is. Great conversation and insight.I'm old enough to remember standing in line overnight to get concert tickets in January in Minneapolis. Standing in line ask day to vote for Biden would be a piece of cake.

why aren't you backing your delegates for #MedicareForAll and voice your opposition to Biden.  Unity is Healthcare for all, division is opposing it.
Biden knows foreign policy. We need a VP who will clean up the mob that has taken away democracy. THAT requires someone men fear, Kamala Harris. Otherwise, this will happen again. Male Hegemony is real.

Settle for Biden and vote the motherfucker out.

4/  Here’s what would be great - for Congress and Biden to pass a bill that addresses all the abuses of power we’ve seen the past three plus years.  And hell, name it after Trump.  Make sure he’s remembered...but for all the horrendous things he’d have us forget.
Literally everyone knows that Biden is a rapist and a sex pest and we're still trying to get him elected president. What a country.
Joe Biden is not picking a Scientologist for VP. Anybody thinking he will probably eats crayons.
Biden +6.2  You have killed many, many people, that's what they say.
I still wonder if Warren could be a dark horse contender. She has done A LOT of events, and I recall the campaign saying she had raised the most money for Biden by far.
I get that there is a context thing about her her area of LA/CA, but I guess I’ll be curious how this is perceived by the various entities pushing Biden right now.
It would be incredibly funny if Karen Bass were actually the VP choice, and Biden's campaign had no idea this clip existed.
vote biden save america is a thing? i hate everyone. fuck that guy. y’all think voting is gonna save us. tell me which one of our systems saves us. please. i’m listening.
Not just not allowing the old boys to get control, but the whole thing is just an unseemly, then bending shitshow like the Afghanistan review (that Biden managed?).  If he wanted to name a woman then he should have just... named a woman. This is a joke now.
Ability to express passion in Biden’s VP is one of many charistics needed. Clear thinking, goal oriented, works well with staff and a clear leader are a few other desired considerations. He must also choose a VP that can carry on after 4 or 8 years as a president. Tough choices.
Vote Biden on November 3rd.
It’ll be a great inauguration crowd regardless.  Bigger than Trump’s though that’s a pretty low bar.
bho is motivated, marxist operative, vocal critic of sitting President; intent on fundamentally transforming the United States, barely 60; developed DOJ, FBI, other Exec agencies, CIA, courts to hinder the duly elected successor..and dnc fields a guy like biden  he's not a memory
I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.
Love Kamala. Wanted her to be VP or AG for Biden. She's smart, driven and she can definitely do the job.  That said...I don't care if Bidens running mate is a sock puppet doing Star Trek cosplay....I'm still voting for him cuz that orange MFer needs to go.
She’s gonna he Biden’s VP
hmm. Does Biden suggest you inject disinfectant into your body to prevent covid? Does he think American soldiers took back British airports during the revolutionary war or that windmills cause cancer? Trump has cognitive and mental health issues and you know it.
I know a little bit about oppo research and I have to think any competent campaign screening running mates does more thorough research, and yet this information is... unknown to Biden? Unimportant to Biden? I don't know which is worse.
Biden doesn’t brag about being able to identify an elephant or count backwards from 100 by 7. FYI, they don’t give that cognitive test unless you’ve shown issues.
That concerns me that Biden, like Obama, will just want to turn the page and try once again "to work with Republicans."  Some lessons never get learned.
Get ready for an avalanche of Biden attack ads which of course will all be lies.
Joe Biden is gonna WWE style swerve everyone and be like "BARBARA BOXER!"
You honestly think Biden has a say in this?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden has been credibly accused of rape. He has also inappropriately touched women and girls on camera dozens of times.
Biden should do it like those Publishers Clearing House ads in the 90's where like some people show up to your house with a giant check and balloons saying IT'S YOU and then you go crazy on television.
would be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.

The biggest difference between the 2020 election and 2016 isn't that Trump's popularity has changed so much as Biden has a much lower negative rating than Hillary (38% vs 55%).
But Joe Biden is trying to gaslight us into a reality where only he is right. H1N1, a far less lethal virus, the Obama Biden admin saw 50 million cases- they had to stop testing.
But i thought biden was up 58 points. I thought everyone loved him.
Someone on here said that we're voting for our next opponents, not our player characters, and that's really helped me come to terms with Biden.  I can spend 4 years prodding Biden and whoever is his VP.
And just wait for the msn headlines. Trump getting crushed in early voting. Biden on the verge of a landslide. Bank it
My birthday is in a month and this year I’m asking for Joe Biden to drop dead!
Yeah. It’s going to be very hard considering what leaked to not take an historic moment (for the love of god, Biden’s pick better be the first female VP) and assume the worst if it isn’t Harris.
there's nothing proving they have moved polls and the majority of people enamored of them were already voting Biden. If anything, they're taking invaluable resources away from senate, house, and state races Dems desperately need to do anything of consequence with a Biden admin

It's a PPP poll, so assume a couple of points house effect in Biden's favor, but this is consistent with Trump having very little chance of swinging MN. Trump only just beat Romney's 2012 numbers in a good year for him - the shift in the suburbs is enough to sink Trump here.
I completely agree. That is why when Republicans keep calling Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe”, I tell them that after almost 4 years of the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump we’re tired. We could use a nap.
Same people polling saying Biden up on Trump by double digits. Same ones who said Hillary 90-10. Lol 😂
Remember four months ago when you said it was irresponsible for Biden to say that Trump would try to move the election?  That was funny.

In a democracy, no one should be a kingmaker. I hope that Biden doesn't want to be one.
“Before Mr. Biden’s transformation, the question facing voters was 'Do you support Donald Trump?' The question now is, 'Are you willing to endanger the economy and your freedom to KEEP the Trump presidency?'”  Fixed it.
“Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa...said Ms. Demings, too, would have wide appeal because of her former career as a police chief.”  // That isn’t appealing.  Especially since Val Demings presided over a brutal department.
This is actually one reason that I think Warren will be the pick. I don't think Biden wants to decide the course of the party, and I'm not convinced that Warren will run in 2024. If she commits to that, it could be an incentive to Biden if he really doesn't want the coronation.
Kamala sucks, but the Dems who don't want her to be VP suck even worse.

People who think politics is a sport can't see this, but electing Biden won't fix the country. It's not a game where winning the election is the goal, like winning a championship. Stopping the arsonist doesn't put out the fire.   To fix the country, you have to fix the country.
If Biden loses it will be most likely due to this attitude.
They can not except it. Biden can send out the troops. Not!!!
Wild how Biden is essentially describing himself 12 years ago.
She's an obscure (to me) congresswoman from a Blue state. How does this help Biden get elected?
if i don’t stop getting emails from joe biden i’m gonna end it all
Enough with the pundidiotry. Whoever Biden picks will be thoroughly awesome, and we don't need highly-paid headgamers to talk them down and spread arm-waving pearl-clutching before anything even happens.
I'm really looking forward to President Biden (and maybe Vice President Harris) giving a barnburner at the 2021 White House Correspondents' Dinner.
Dick Cheney supported gay marriage when President Bush was opposed.  Joe Biden supported gay marriage when President Obama was opposed.
This might be giving them too much credit, but what if Trump’s team is expecting to lose and are using the authoritarian playbook now so it’s tainted with TDS drawback once Biden uses the same approach?
Yes. Warren gives Biden a higher margin than his own supporters. Biden/Warren 2020: 'Let's Do This'
For my friend here it really makes no difference since Biden and Trump are both ruthless imperialists. Actually on that matter Trump might actually be *slightly* better than Biden, who's indistinguishable from a neocon when it comes to foreign policy.

It's Safe To Love Joe ... and definitely Hip To Be Square! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Yeah-Biden should pick someone who does no harm-he's leading by a lot, and there's no reason to take a risk right now, or assume you need one in the future.  The obvious choice is Harris in virtually every metric-pick her and let's get on with this.
Arguing over who Biden should pick as his VP is absolutely pointless, everyone said picking Biden was going to hurt Obama...so who GAF?   Just vote, Trump needs to go.
Awe, the Trumper can't answer, instead he has to deflect and avoid.  That is your acknowledgment that you KNOW Trump is mentally deficient, thanks.  As for Biden? Absolutely, more important? He doesn't need to be given one on a regular basis like Trump apparently does.
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.
generally republicans have no concept of what a liberal is or wants. they see gasmasked people clashing with police in the streets and they're like "look how much these people love joe biden!"
She was my presidential pick as well. I still hope to see her serve the Biden admin in any capacity that helps fix this Great American Trauma and hold the entire trump shit show accountable.
Joe Biden is a Bull Connor + A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
Remember when Harris declined to support mandatory school busing *one day* after selling a bunch of t-shirts calling out Biden for opposing busing? 😂
Sleazy Uncle Joe?  Bribing Biden?  Does he even remember what day of the week it is?
I post it on Biden's TL everyday. She's not going away.
I agree.  He will not be at a Biden Inaugural
How come Biden didn't show up?
Extremely unclear to me how picking a former prosecutor unpopular on the left whose primary appeal seems to be to older people who already love Joe Biden would "capitalize on the moment" in any respect, but you do you
Past that, it's clearly Warren who is the more successful national politician, with the greater appeal to groups skeptical to Biden, whose policy expertise also happens to be exactly what Biden needs right now. But they're the two candidates who meet the basic test of credibility
This will put me at odds with Warren Twitter, but I really think the only two VPs that Biden really ought to be considering at this point are Warren and Harris. The vice presidency is not a bureaucratic role - it's a political, executive role. He needs a high-level politician.
If Kamala gets picked as Biden's VP will she drop her stances of legalizing weed and Medicare for all?
I'm willing to bet Joe Biden will make make the Trump tax cuts permanent within the first year of his presidency (if he wins).
Huh, imagine having to "accept" two candidates who lost despite winning the popular vote.  #TrumpMeltdown #Election2020 #vote #trump #VoteBlue
People loved Obama and Clinton too, and they were terrible for the working class and POC, as Biden was and will be. But keep telling yourself they care. They don’t.
My .02 on Biden's VP pick is that it should either be Harris or Duckworth. Every other woman on the list is either too unknown or has too much downside.
I think the issue i see is that we will hear rhetoric from Biden camp that we will all hate as they will still use the criminalization versus asylum seekers lens. But i hope we can try and push after the election when Biden doesn't feel the need to assure folks about crime.
This is good news! It means they’re confident that Biden is going to win. They only care about deficits when Democrats are in the White House.

I still ultimately think Kennedy wins this, but if Markey pulls this off, you have to wonder where Kennedy goes next. Unless Warren is the VP next week, his only real options are in Biden’s cabinet as taking on Baker will be too difficult.
Biden is 78 years old. He may well be entering office in a second great depression and devastating pandemic, maybe after serious electoral civil unrest. "Everyone gets along with her" doesn't seem like it should be the main criterion for his VP!
Stop the whinning &amp; admit government over the last 40 years has failed with the USPS. Don’t blame Trump who has been in office for only three years.  How long have you been in office, Vindictive Nancy, Bribing Biden, Crying Chuckles, Lying Schiff, Nutty Nadler? Lunatic liberals!
Have had quite a few conversations about how Biden/Dems will be a drag on S&amp;P, but a return to normalcy/boring government without random tariff Tweets would even out that drag.

Trump doesn't use a teleprompter idiot. Have you seen one of his rallys, no teleprompter. Biden's going away in November, good riddance to the groping plagiarist!
Agree? Sure.   Do? No.    "Will the candidates agree to pursue meaningful pollution limits to clean up the annual toxic algae blooms?"
Biden might as well be working with Project Lenin, formerly known as Project Lincoln, the group of DC rejects that didn’t land a job with this admin.
Just like anyone on the left, Biden is rooting against anything that represents progress with America. Very sad to witness.
Yeah, when I think of Antifa or just revolution in general I think of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, and don't forget  another well known anarcho-syndicalist.

Correction: Here’s what seems clear. Joe Biden would not have to deal with the COVID pandemic, racism, riots or anything else. All of it would magically disappear starting November 4th.

Biden cant inspire record numbers. The only way to defeat trump is to reject and refuse to nominate unelectable racist joe. We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble joe
Every DCCC fundraising email is like subject: “Joe Biden has been killed by Donald Trump…” body: “…in terms of last quarter’s fundraising goals. Pitch in $5 $50 or $5000 instantly.”
Republicans are done. Biden reps the new “conservative”. AOCs crew is the new left. Trump blew their fascist cover. My kids and my kids kids will know that (if we survive) the Republican Party and their ilk are anti-American confederates to be as reviled as the Nazis.
No, but we would have to worry about Biden’s staff.  Everyone knows he can’t use a computer to tweet.  I can’t imagine anyone thinks his twitter page comments are posted by him

The Onion’s version of Joe Biden is more grounded in reality that Fox’s version of Obama.
The election is already a cluster fuck. It’s only going to get worse. Biden will refuse to debate. Votes will get lost. My dead uncle will be voting democrat.
All trump did was destroy a wonderful economy built by Obama and Biden.  He destroys everything. He went bankrupt owning casinos.  Who has ever done that before in the history of business?
Biden must win and it must be by a substantial amount. Keep up the good work  and others to vote Trump out.
Unfortunately, Trump has, with his rhetoric, created a situation where anything short of a landslide will create chaos. If Trump wins, Democrats will cry “suppression” or “foreign interference.” If Biden wins, Republicans will cry “rigged” and “voter fraud.” 1/2
Biden win is priced in, up, because less chaos.

But was there discussion if Smith then would also win it if Biden does?  She only lost it by three in 2018.
Elect joe Biden. Obviously
What will we do after Biden is sworn in?  Is he capable of getting thtough the swearing in ceremony?  Only way I’d vote for Joe is if Tulsi Gabbard is his VP.  Knowing she would be president within a minute.
Is it good to critique presidential candidates: yes of course  Does it feel incredibly irresponsible to be critiquing Biden at a time when there are still privileged chucklefucks out here who think if they don't love a candidate they can skip voting: also yes

because liberalism is a deep rooted infestation and leftists that compromise with liberals find themselves retreating back into liberalism and away from leftism.  "harm reduction" only counts if its actually demonstrable. Biden's history in government is not that.
Hey i am no expert just going off what guys like larry say. Then my kid says lots of kids he knows may just take a college gap year off and freshman likely wont be in dorms. You guys know the numbers and I dont . But i just assumed biden had hired smarter people.
Please show us where Biden said he would defund the police?! Trump was being interviewed and said Biden said that and then was shown the charter and it never says that. So please come with your proof that it was said and not just the lies that come out of Trumps mouth
If what larry says is correct and the youth vote is down 30% i dont see how biden can win. I put alot of faith in larry but who knows.
Exactly i was thinking sophmores and above. But with no rock the vote, etc freshman will not register. No katie perry showing up with a biden shirt on campus. No taylor swift concerts on campus. Nobody walking around campus.
I do support Biden as the better of the two options available, yes.  Not my first choice. Do you really think some stranger on the Internet calling me mentally disabled matters to me? That’s hilarious. I feel safe pretty much everywhere thanks but thanks for the concern.
It’s sad to think this man wasted 8 yrs of tax payers money doing nothing. He could of done something great to bring people together. He divided us to the point where we are now. How dare him and Biden for blameing President Trump for their own cowardice behavior.
So, let's just talk about all the things Joe Biden will do as our new President. Pay no attention to the man with the orange face...
Biden already said it's gone if he gets the senate.
This guy is SLIME and should have been removed from office!  Trump is SLIME and shouldhave been removed from office!  Joe Biden is a decent honest man and you run this POS shame on you CNN!  Go after the truth Trump is a traitor!
I love how Lincoln Project cranks out these devastatingly, beautiful nasty hit jobs - while Biden takes the high road with happy talk and playing Mr. Positive. The perfect foil. Hand in glove.

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
Every time this comes up, I remember how Bernie was going to destroy senile ol’ Biden in the one-on-one debate. Then that didn’t happen, and everyone complained about wily, shrewd Biden lying about his record, so I guess he has good days.
hidin' biden ..  let me think .. what rhymes with duckin'
gonna tell my kids this is jill biden
Firstly this time Biden blew everyone else out of the water, there was no contest, Keep Crying And Respect People Will And u saying Hillary and Joe are Same? GFOH, Blind hatred is Dangerous
Yup, Lee would be too much of a risk, since the entire point of rigging the primary and Biden running was to prevent any sort of leftward shift.
Honestly I think Biden is gonna win easily in three months. Democrats overcame some of the worst gerrymanders and took the house in 2018, and trump has only gotten worse since then so it’s unlikely he wins at this point
They don't have an angle on Biden or Obama, because they're both just people trying to do a good job, which puts them in stark contrast with the current administration.
Is Joe Biden's Tax Plan Bad for Business?
So true. Until they pledge to vote for Biden, there is no other path to redemption.
His pinned tweet is no longer about postponing the election. It's now some garbage about how quickly he acted on Covid and something about Joe Biden. This is tedious. Make it stop.
How about Al Franken, who has studied this issue to be Secretary of HHS in the Biden Administration.  And Elizabeth Warren to figure out the best way to pay for it.
They will do whatever is politically expedient and makes them money, once marijauna producers start a superpac for Biden, he will make sure they can bribe him properly.    They just need to find some other way to fill their prisons with slave labor.
I’d rather Biden endorse some proposals that would actually cut greenhouse gas emissions.

You can't provide any of that with no jobs, no economy, a huge drop in revenue and more spending. Quit blowing smoke up peoples ass for votes. Any one with a brain knows hard times are coming. You and Biden would cause more death and destruction than anyone before you! 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah, Biden is obviously a creep too. Difference is I'm not in a cult, I dislike all pedos. You selectively pick and choose the creeps you dislike
Trump tries to con at every corner &amp; fucks it up a lot. As he tries to lay groundwork for a fraudulent election just wait until he has his minions cast bogus votes for Biden &amp; either they get caught in the process or forget to challenge those votes making the landslide larger.
This mom and grandmom is voting for Biden!
I am from Indiana where I campaigned for Mike Pence’s 1990 congressional run, I voted for Trump in 2016.  I am completely disgusted by him &amp; his behavior. He is a disgrace to the office and to our country.  I will be voting Biden &amp; straight ticket Dem, the GOP is spineless.
He wants to register enough ex-felons to vote that the state swings into Joe Biden’s column in November—a goal he shares with left-wing billionaire megadonor George Soros.

This mom is voting for Joe Biden.
Trump is the only fraud and we’ll stop that on 11/3/2020 with an EPIC LANDSLIDE victory for Joe Biden!
There is no damaging information and whatever they think they have is crumbs compared to Trump and the Republican party’s actions!  Joe Biden will be our next President and there’s nothing traitor Trump can do about that!

By that logic a vote not for trump is a vote for Biden.
I plan on writing in Bernie but I think Biden will still win. Don’t worry I live in a solid blue state so my vote doesn’t really matter all that much.
Oh my God can he please be our next VP? Biden's running mate? Can that be a thing????? #IMissObama This Was a Different Barack Obama. A Stick-Swinging, Old-Testament Obama.
As if Biden wants an African American woman as his VP.
Bottom line is this....if mail in voting is allowed Biden wins. If not, Trump wins. Wake up call to the 249 elected Republicans
A potato could run against you in November and you'd still lose. Just like you're going to lose against Biden. By the largest landslide ever. BIGLEY!
Regardless of ones party affiliation or who they want to be the next president..can’t we agree that a major party candidate must submit to live interviews, press conferences, Q&amp;As...? The press hasn’t done enough to hold the Biden camp to the fire for not engaging..

Awhile ago I would not have said this. It  may  seem odd  that   I feel sorry for Biden.  I don't want him to win mind you.  But it seems like people are taking advantage of a man with dementia.  If true shame on the demonrats.

So do you think they can fully hide biden another three months? Also do you think independents will not eventually wonder why biden keeps hiding? Kind of seems to have worked so far but its still summer.
Nobody has ever skipped a debate before. If the public gives biden a pass on thay there really is no hope for future elections. I mean if you can skip debates without any consequenses why even have them?
hiden biden? ahhhh...no. not in a million years would i vote dfl!!
Yeah Russians. You meant Biden right?
ugh, the Biden team’s strategy of just staying on the sidelines and letting Trump destroy his own chances at re-election is almost certainly gonna work
his other arm isn't moving ... maybe Biden should challenge him ... lol
I see the aftermath of a bigger picture. Full of empty promises. We gotta stop looking celebrities as political figures. Our young black ivy league alumni has done more for prison reform than Kanye and Biden combined
This isnt about just Karen Bass, it's about all the other "Veepstakes" events where the Biden campaign thinks that having contenders 'kiss the ring' by putting together mega-donor events is still a normal and acceptable thing to do in 2020?  Take this shit back to 1960
I call it a toss up at this point. Polls show Biden ahead but we're 3 mo out, he keeps sabotaging himself, and republicans just vote republican.
I live in Minneapolis and I'm seeing Biden ads on TV. Not sure why  doesn't report that.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?
He took the best economy in the history of America, created by Obama and Biden, and burned it to the ground.

Its anazing biden willbe able to avoid debates with likely any consequenses. I dont know trump can win agaisnt somebody who will never ever be vetted or exposed.
It will not be BIDEN BOTTOMS 😂
Right.  We won't fall for Senate Republicans' new-found praise for Representative John Lewis.  If Biden is to be successful, we need to replace some Senators:  McConnell, Collins, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, etc.  Contribute if you can to
I mean if biden wins the country is over and those voters will be to blame. They will have fallen for a dementia patient radical.
Looks like we will be saying Madam President, who would he rather have Biden or Pelosi?
• Since there is no legal way for Trump to unilaterally delay election, red states are simply counted as having 0 votes • Biden therefore wins by the largest landslide in US election history because no red states' votes were counted • Republicans dig their own graves I guess
Best case scenario that won't happen but would make me lol:  • Trump announces that he is delaying election • Blue states continue with election anyway as prescribed by federal law • Blue states overwhelmingly vote Biden • Red states follow Trump's orders and delay election
So, should Biden step on all this great news for Trump with VP pick tomorrow? Or let America stew in Trumps failures over the weekend and reveal it on Monday?
It’s my job to educate a Qnut?  Treason is for Trump allowing a US enemy like Putin to pay cash to Taliban to encourage them to kill more of our soldiers. Bribery is forcing Zelensky to announce Biden investigations in exchange for weapons they badly need to fight Russia. And (1)
If Biden wins with mail-in voting that’s rigged? If Trump wins with mail-in voting it isn’t rigged?
Here's my thought: Biden needs someone acceptable to progressives but with a background that makes them palatable to moderates. Of that list, Tammy Duckworth seems to be the strongest to me. I think Harris will probably be it, but Duckworth is compelling.
They looked presidential even if they were each responsible for millions of oil war, and drug war deaths, sort of like Biden, a useful idiot for the status quo.

Sounds like this guy outta get back into politics...wouldn’t be the first Pres to transition to another national government position.  Senator?  Biden’s first Supreme Court nominee?
If Trump loses, there won't be any rebuilding for a LONG time. Democrats are Communists. It'll be the last election where votes are actually counted. Notice how China doesn't hold elections? One party rule ad infinitum. The party picks it's leaders; like DNC will pick for Biden.
ya know what else is good to do? check your privilege. i can't believe actually said voting for biden is the same as voting for trump.  what the hell are you smoking?
Leading the list of accomplices are Republican Senators.  Leaving them in office will make it impossible for a Biden administration to do the work that is needed: immigration reform, justice reform, etc. Vote out McConnell, Collins, Ernst, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, ... 🌊
If Biden wins the election can we also impeach Trump and evict him in November?

We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Good LUCK with THAT! Many of my Republican friends are "Riden with Biden!"
Trump is so scared of Biden he doesn't even want the election to happen.
I don’t think he said he was voting for Biden.....I’m sure he’s not that dumb 😉
I am just waiting for a biden  blow upor something that damages biden. Still waiting though.
It's harsh to say it in that way, though I understand that you are addressing people who wanted, presumably, Bernie. I wanted Bernie, but I have been impressed by Biden's maturity. Biden is working closely with Bernie, previously his competitor, to develop policy initiatives.
Pretty sure we'll know who won on election night, when Biden takes Texas.
For what? He hasn't broken any laws unlike Biden who did exactly what Trump was falsely accused of in the impeachment hoax.
Good luck. The real criminal is Biden but I doubt they would find him competent to stand trial.
That isnt a morale crusher.  I get far more worried seeing trump down 6 and 7 points is polls he is usually very close in. All i read about is everyone switching to trump yet the gap once again seems to be going the other way . Just baffling to me biden could be up in legit poll

That number for Biden and Peters would  VERY good if it pans out like that in #MI02.  In 2016 went fot Trump by 17.5.  If Biden and Peters are within 2 points there...
When does tRUMP replace Biden?
Joe Biden does Zoom
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.

Very true but will voters blame the govs. I reallly thought it would be mostly gone by now. Covid is the only thing biden has to run on period. So far its worked out perfect for biden.. He hasnt had to do anything.
Based on how piss poor every Democratic governor has handled the pandemic excuse me if I don’t think Biden will do a good job either
"Biden can't pick Warren, her demands are too extreme," say the pundits, as Biden and Obama spend months edging towards positions Warren has held for years.
Trump suggested that the Nov. 3 general election be delayed, something he has no authority to order. His GOP sheep quickly rejected that idea.  COVID-19 makes it too dangerous to vote, but no option to use absentee voting?   #FreshTopics #NoElectionDelay

Black women GAVE Biden the candidacy.  They are the backbone of the D party!  They need and deserve to be represented.   Black and Brown folks make up the D party!  An all-white ticket is not representative.
It wasn't unfounded though - &gt; it was pretty easy to imagine Trump would do this based on his past behavior.  Joe Biden just made the simple observation and columnist like yourself couldn't believe it.  That's the problem w/ going out a limb for Trump, he always fucks you

I thought biden was up by 67.
Biden is 4% in your poll. This should be very alarming to every single American.
There was plenty of evidence they rigged the primary in favor of Hillary. Don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover that. I may be an echo chamber I guess but Trump is a hell of a lot more right about how to do this election than Biden. Mail in voting would be a disaster.
Biden was selected to reassure racist white liberals, a subset of that category including Wall St.
What will it take for us to finally send Bill Clinton to a farm upstate? And to think, y’all think Biden never stops gaffing...
I am just worried the economy has now stalled. Dems really have done a good job hiding biden and doing everything to hurt the economy.  Plus trump really hasnt gone to the american people yet weth a firm agenda and there are 0 rallies.
I was thinking that Biden would announce his running mate tomorrow to dominate the airwaves all weekend, but news is so devastating for America and Trump, Biden may let that bake in for the weekend. 🤷‍♂️
It's gotta be hard being THIS wrong so much of the time. Poor, misguided Jonathan Turley. What a clown. #Biden
Comedy coming from a guy who got pushed aside by Joe fucking Biden 🤷🤷
i dont like biden but i would rather have an accused rapist in office than a proven one who also handled this situation terribly
But last I checked Dems are the ones getting busted for fixing primaries. So it's really not that awful of an argument. See Bernie/Hillary primary 2016 it's not that hard to see they literally did whatever they could to get her in. They'll stop at nothing to get Biden in too
Biden, three months ago.
Step 1: receive first batch of damning internal polling data predicting Biden landslide  Step 2: realize you’ve hitched your electoral fortune wagon to traitors in bed with CCP &amp; the Kremlin  Step 3:
BREAKING: Legal "Scholar" Jonathan Turley Takes Dump On Self About Biden's Accurate Prediction of tRUmp's Election Hacking  WASHINGTON — Alleged law school "professor" Jonathan Turley once again crapped the bed by falsely claiming that Joe Biden said tRUmp would "unilaterally"...
I'm just spit-balling here, but I don't think Biden can activate the National Guard?
I believe mail in voting could be the biggest scam of all time. Only way Biden can win imo. Trump is not wrong.
I am soooo ready for 'nothing to fundamentally change' under a Biden presidency. Such anticipation.
Stop gas lighting, stop deceiving. Biden did NOT say or imply that tRUmp could unilaterally stop the election. He merely predicted (accurately) that tRUmp would "try...somehow." What a disaster you have become.
Question: Why not quote Biden's actual words? Answer: Because you are a LIAR. Here's what Joe said: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held. Imagine threatening not to fund the post office..."
trump is an embarrassment to our Country. Biden knee in April that trump is corrupt
National Task Force on Election Crisis  #Election2020 #Biden #Trump #ElectionDelay
I completely understand you not wanting to lose her because she's on top of her game and is a strong female that knows her community. She has a great resume. Biden picking her would be a strategic move but time will tell.
But get over yourself.  Because any hope to achieve any goal you thought possible with your favored candidate would not be possible under Trump.   Biden may only get us part way there but at least his train isn’t going in the wrong direction and toward a cliff.
Yes, Biden &amp; Democrats must feel the loss.
If you are so far to the left that you see no difference between Trump and Biden then you have a problem.   Trump barely registers as a human being.   How can you be so blind to not see Trump as the unique danger that he is?   Biden may not be perfect,  he wasn’t my first choice
Joe Biden is the best of the dnc?  A child groping, hair sniffing, woman molesting, demented corrupt fool - is the best the #dnc can put forward?   His possible running mate -  a corrupt prosecutor who ignores exculpatory evidence?
like a fine aged milk
Excellent. Okay to use?
Biden didn't say he was going to unilaterally, or that he had the power, he said he was going to try to do it. Are you unable to tell the difference?
Yeah, not going to happen like that. Biden administration will not hold Trump accountable.. If you wanted actual accountability,  you should have supported Bernie.
I probably would but I would be wearing my Biden face mask.
His time would be better spent in Georgia, FL, or TX as examples, because Biden will win PA.  But on top of being super-spreaders, Pence and Trump's campaign are incredibly stupid.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
Now that the trumpeter has floated the idea of postponing the election #WeWillVote November 3. And we will vote for Biden. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
This is the 1st time I can honestly say you're nervous that Biden is winning this election.  Why is it that you're nervous?
That’s really happening? Jesus Christ... I’ld rather vote for Biden, and already plan on not doing that. The fuck?
It says Hotel Gitmo. Why are they treated so well at Gitmo? Lock em up! Obama is in there. He was just on TV with Biden last week. Do you recognize many?
Yes, I believe that is the case. I hadn't thought of the delay in decision being out of respect for John Lewis. That's a very good reason to delay, I respect Biden for that.
Isn't Biden announcing her tomorrow? Sen. Kamala Harris, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Rep. Val Demings of Florida, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham have been named as top candidates on his list🤔
Yes, pretty much anyone could pass it.  I wonder if Biden could.  And another very important thing, he signed an order that brought drug prices down. That may not matter to you but it affects millions of people and should have been handled by our congress a long time ago.
This tweet is from April, and the conspiracy theory he's referring to is Biden insisting that Trump is literally going to try to steal the election.  And what do you know? Trump is sending troops into cities, and now he wants to postpone the election.
settle for biden... i absolutely hate it here
I hope people don’t try to use that as a co sign either because I honestly don’t care who wins the presidency lmao. But I feel like I just know trump got it in the bag 🤷🏾‍♂️😂 cuz who tf voting for Biden.... or Bloomberg?
Burying John Lewis today, Trump tweeting about delaying the election...  truly feels like America is losing its soul.   Please vote in November. I don’t care if you don’t like Biden. We have to vote for him if we want democracy to survive.   PS here’s my project today:
I need Biden to stop delaying the announcement and say it already.
The Energy 202: Trump, in West Texas, warns Biden is threat to oil and gas industry - The Washington Post
Yep... they’re excited over a ham sandwich while kicking the majority of their constituents in the giblets. Even after Biden wins, the battle will not be over.
Maybe. I'm waiting to see what kind of role Yang plays, and how policies i care about most, #UBI, #DemocracyDollars, and #HR1 play out. I will change my mind if i see a Biden admin totally ignore this while governing.
Its tough. Politics is hard work, and you have to weigh a lot of things. The tide turned when rep Clyburn endorsed Biden in SC. He won very big there, and that in turn got over 17 million people to vote for Biden in the primary overall. I also can't deny that happened.
Uh, pretty sure he said exactly the opposite. In a free &amp; fair election (the way we’ve conducted elections for centuries) he believes he’d win. He said in this hurried &amp; unverified mail-in ballot election w/ alleged room for fraud he believes Biden can steal an election. 🤔
Eric Black: Peter Wehner, who worked for Reagan and both Bushes, wants his party back — and he’s prepared to support Joe Biden for president this year in hopes of bringing that about.
Biden is by far the "lesser evil."
Especially if Biden wins, #wigov is going to be a tough race for Evers. I think Kleefisch might be the strongest of the GOP candidates.
Has anyone done a face swapped “Settle For Me” video from Crazy Ex Girlfriend with Biden? My search skills are failing me.  Surely this already exists.
Yes, sir. This Blue Star and Gold Star family is heartsick for a good man like Biden. He will protect America and protect our troops.
Today tRUmp tweeted a proposal to postpone the election. Joe Biden PREDICTED it: “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held." When can we expect your retraction and apology?
You don't get to delay election day just because you are losing.
REMINDER:  Joe Biden is receiving classified intelligence briefings   😈
Nah, you not acknowledging you were talking out of your ass about chinese imports was what made you a clown-- this is just really weak sauce use to say Biden is in it with the Chinese. In the end I don't think he'd green light muslim concentration camps-- so that's good by me.
I think Biden cares about people.  Biden wouldn’t waste time during a press briefing on COVID deaths to play a video about how great he is or brag about his TV ratings.
This didn’t age well, did it?
I'm a working class guy from a working class background. I oppose capitalism and tyrannical government. While I generally consider myself a "democratic socialist," Trump and Biden would both surely dismiss me as an anarchist. So, #IAmAnAnarchist
I would highly encourage everyone to read this article game playing possible scenarios for the presidential election. Just don't do it right before bed, if you want to sleep
I have an idea!  Start with your family, then move to your admin, Congressional R's &amp; Bill Barr.  Use tear gas and and brutality if you want.  Anyway, that would keep you busy until Nov 3.  Then Biden and the new LEGIT AG will clean up the rest!  (The Kingpin!!)
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
I don't even know what's real and what's a Twitter joke anymore. Is Biden actually orange now? Is there really a Settle For Biden campaign? I don't know, man.
overwhelmed.
IF BIDEN WAS PRESIDENT WE WOULDNT ALL BE COMMUNICATING IN CAPITAL LETTERS.
What does Biden's wife, a doctor, say about hydroxychloroquine?
Where 👏 does 👏 Joe 👏 Biden 👏 go 👏 to 👏 get 👏 his 👏 apology 👏
Half the states go along? They're red states and they don't get electors then, and Trump loses.  Trump doesn't leave? President Biden sends in federal marshals to arrest him, or the army to open a path through the vermin Trumptards.  SCOTUS won't approve of Trump's whining.
This is some sexist bullshit..Too ambitious? Give me a break. One does not succeed in politics being a wallflower. Biden needs a warrior and here she is. #BidenHarris2020
I’ll settle for Biden because frankly I’ve settled my whole life
Biden said, “Mark my words” and you did.  Good job!
Biden is not well!
yes, the republican controlled senate will do the bidding of...joe biden, the democratic candidate for president.
I didn't realize Joe biden was the president and oversees this
So... that Biden number is a tough one to reconcile.  That would probabily be consistent with Biden winning the state by something in the 18-point range. Sure, the undecideds are probably disproportionatly Republican (makes sense give the MN-01 ballot test)
A truly elegant wrap-up to these past 4 years would be both Trump and Pence disabled by covid-19 by election night with President Pelosi looking after things until Biden's inauguration.
So why not just delay the election? You support a psychopath. You don’t have to like Biden or the left but your loyalty now speaks volumes of your character, moral compass and integrity. Once a fan of yours. Now disgusted.
This is.. not a good look.  What’s going on here? Who’s the young woman? Why is she leading the former VP as if he doesn’t know where to go?   The media helped amplify conservative criticism of Hillary’s health in 2016, but have allowed Biden to go under the radar.
Now that I think about it maybe delaying the election isn’t a bad idea because I think I’d prefer Nancy Pelosi over Joe Biden anyway.
Who do you feel can better help the economy re-emerge from current point—Biden or Trump?
OMG - here he goes again. The man lives outside the rules and the laws. He’s downright dangerous. He must be removed from office. 96 days...  via
Let's see Biden's wife, a supposed doctor, tell the American people that hydroxychloroquine doesn't work!
In fairness, I think thousands of people have made this prediction, so not that impressive of Biden, but does demonstrate that he understands how corrupt the president is.
via  oh HELL no you don’t.
I halfway think the story was cannily planted by team Biden to get positive backlash in her favor
This is the third #MN01 internal we have gotten this summer. Feehan’s internal in June had him up 1, Hagedorn’s June poll had him up 16. The new one today is from the House Majority PAC (D) and has Feehan +2 and Biden +7.
This aged well. /snark
Biden is a groping plagiarist unfit to run our country
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
A Biden presidency won't help anyone except Hunter.
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
Nice hit piece, Brian. Biden absolutely needs to pick a VP that could step into the role of President. Harris is that person.
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
Where's Hunter Biden?
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
"The president’s disadvantage in the suburbs is underpinned by his longstanding weakness among white voters with a four-year college degree, who back Mr. Biden, 57-31, in the suburbs."
The question you should be asking is whether the Democrats will accept defeat if Biden loses in November.  Remember:  it was the Dems who said Trump was not their President; pushed obstruction &amp; resistance; and put the country through $32M Mueller investigation.
The only brainwashing here is what the rising DNC Socialist Democrats have obviously done to you. Trump is an "outlier"...he is not a traditional politician. That is why many politicians, including some Republicans, do not "like" him. If you want Biden...RWYS!
Just have the community organizers keep watch for them. Biden said himself that police are the problem, why would he want them there then?😁
NOW LET'S SEE BIDEN DO THAT.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
Many Trump supporters will secretly vote for Joe Biden, because they don't want their deplorable friends to know...
If biden gets elected you will really see dark times!     Trump 2020
True of Biden too, however.
I voted for Clinton, got blamed when she lost for 4 years, and liberals have no one to blame but themselves when I don't vote for Biden. They've learned absolutely nothing, and I don't think they're actually capable of it. The dem party needs to burn if this country is going to
and Biden is going to send unmarked vans after me
and Biden is threatening to do the same as Trump with Anarchists as of yesterday. Both parties either want us dead or don't care if we live, why would we vote for someone like that?
I believe WHOLE heartedly that if #Biden didn't think he could do the job COMPETENTLY that he would step down and let someone who did and I believe he will put all of the RIGHT people in the RIGHT places &amp; hopefully we can begin to repair our country from the #tRUMP DEVESTATION!
Dems on Susan Rice as Biden’s VP: Are We Sure About This?
The day Joe Biden will announce his vice presidential pick will be watched all over the world. Why is the world interested? Maybe history in the making.
Remember when people said Al Gore was too ambitious? Yeah, I dont either. It's insulting that a man said this about a woman AGAIN as it feels too Hillary. Havent people learned? Biden needs to say get on board or here's the door. It's his choice, not theirs/ours for that matter.
This isn't a problem of an enthusiasm gap anymore. Biden doesn't bore me. He terrifies me. It terrifies me to think what will happen when the Dems no longer even make a show out of resisting the feds (not that their meager resistance was ever that convincing).
Since Biden is still within the margin of error in swing states, after a whole lot of centrism in his platform, he should just try a progressive idea, #MedicareForAll for example, and see what happens... he’s gonna try walk it back anyways, even if it polls well.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Tuesday that he will announce his vice presidential running...
I mean, I am it really pro Biden at all except as a binary option with Trump
I am much more anti pre meditated murder then pro Biden.
Elect Joe Biden as ournext president on 11/3/2020 and save our country!  Stay well America the nightmare is almost over!
That is only a problem if her plan is to win as VP then murder Biden to take his place.
Frankly my dear...I don’t give a damn!  Whatever is wrong with him I just don’t care!  Let’s tell DJ Trump we WILL elect Joe Biden as our next President!  Could be fun😎
The vaccine for Trumpvirus is Biden 2020!!!
yes, that is the reason why anyone ever accepts the vp.  why else would you do it?  why the fuck do they think Joe Biden did it?  are they implying that he shouldn't be running now?
Should I catfish a trump supporter? I'll pretend to be a 50 yr old white man w/ an "investive property" and a lot of blue jeans. I'll turn out to be a small Mexican man, who's super pissed that he's gonna have to vote for Joe Biden
No, seriously, just wait for the FUCKING ANNOUNCEMENT. MSNBC does not have influence on Biden's choice.
Everyone needs to just relax and wait till Biden announces. Be prepared to not be happy or to be overjoyed.
What everyone is concerned about is Trump contesting the election and preventing Biden from being sworn in.
That's been my philosophy the whole time, too. I'll take the hits for doing everything I can to defeat Trump, supporting Joe Biden, etc, but why should I expect the Ds to care about my choice for VP?
The rioters wont stop they will only get worse. Biden doesnt like cops.
Did Biden have to pay for his son's cougar girlfriend like your dad does?
Exactly!  Biden has negatives, sure, but he doesn't engender the visceral hatred - or in some cases, just the lack of enthusiasm leading to voters staying home - that Hillary did
Wanna bet Biden thinks he’s voting for Hillary this cycle?
Happy I looked at Twitter today; liking that Biden has links to more info. Still learning how Twitter works/what one can do (my first Retweet with comment)💕. My first Retweet from an anti-masker should have comment: Hilarious mix of anti-masker comments with rebuttals/links.
Joe Biden the presidential candidate of the future 😂🤪🤣
If Biden described federal agents in Portland as outlaws I’m confident we’d all understand he isn’t calling for it to be legal to kill them in the streets without trial.
I’m utterly confised on how “ambition” is considered a negative? I’m all in for Biden/Harris.
Continued censorship also guarantees a Trump win. There's no path for Biden to the White House.
Biden broadcasts that he plans to select a VP based on color and sex, that makes him a sexist and a racists. Select candidates on skills and what they bring to the office. If you disagree that proves you're a hypocrite.
So in this scenario you've made up in your head, how many times has yang tried what he's currently trying? Multiple times? I had no idea that Biden was already president before, this is news to me!
We will see what happens. We are also in the middle of this thing called a Pandemic, which has been horribly mismanaged by our federal govt as well. This is a different scenario than before, and Biden actually has some good policies to rebuild.
When Biden wins and Trump won’t leave I pray it’s a squad of Afghan vets that walks him out...
She will not excite the Progressive left.  We don't want Kamala the cop for VP.  Biden is bad enough.
Self-important doners whining to journalists is not actually news, it happens on every presidential campaign and this story tells us nothing about who Biden will pick.  But Twitter likes to fight about it so it becomes a top story and journalists will seak to emulate it.
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
It’s ok you can admit you’re describing the average Biden voter
This article is a scary read. (But you should all still vote!!!)
This is not a given! Biden's a whole lot better than Trump, but administrations of both parties have been screwing up fair housing for a half-century. The racial equity plan released by Biden yesterday has MAJOR fair housing defects.
This coming from Biden’s campaign manager. So he doesn’t share the same views as some of his allies perhaps?
What job in the Biden administration are you gunning for Pete?
This is bonkers. We need someone able and willing to step in at any moment. Hell, yes, she’d better want to be president. Who thinks Biden will even be alive to run for a second term? Good grief.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.
Biden's campaign better rid the naysayers. We need all positive vibes.
This.  Whoever Biden picks will be awesome.  Whoever Biden picks will be used by Russian trolls in an effort to divide Democrats.  Don't fall for it.  Whoever Biden picks will be awesome.
I wouldn't make too much of this but, what the hell, it makes good grist for social-distancing water cooler talk! #KamalaHarrisForVP
Too ambitious? Dont you want a VP who wants &amp; is able 2 do the job? Maybe they're right because George HW Bush and Al Gore never wanted to be president.🙄 Biden better rid himself of all the campaign people who dont want Kamala or they'll be an albatross to the campaign.
That Joe Biden email from Warren Democrats... it’s got me all goosebumpy. Not sure how to feel yet. On one hand, yeah, duh. That’s the obvious for the email. On the other, solidarity either way. Ffs, just tell us already
Know who else was ambitious and still wanted the top spot when they settled for the VP spot?  Some guy named Joe Biden 🤦  this is a ridiculous argument that I hope isn’t true and actually being bandied around behind the scenes.
Can’t really blame Bush. That economy was all tied to Wall Street garbage mortgages. But OBAMA and Biden did turn a horrible situation around
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Or, this is smart politics because if Biden chooses Harris, he’ll come across as his own man not afraid to make the bold, smart choices.
Can we stop saying..me included let’s vote blue and instead say let’s ELECT Joe Biden on 11/3/2020!  Let’s shout it out so Trump will hear his name Joe Biden our soon to be President!
If biden wins, they will ban homeschooling.  I fixed it for you.
Cuz biden is such a prize.
This is apparently real. It's not actually by the biden campaign, but it's apparently real.
Biden's campaign mgr!!! 🤣😂😆🤣
Seeing the crowd we can understand why Biden can still hold Rallys during a pandemic.
The  doesn't want ANY of #SusanRice but they can PRETEND like she would be a good choice for them if they want to! No matter WHO #Biden picks to run as VP the  will lie about them anyways because facts DON'T matter to them at all! #VoteThemAllOut
2. It was a competition. And maybe Biden came out stronger. Maybe Biden should have a little difference of opinion from his VP. These things are not exclusive of collaboration.
"Some remain bitter about her attacks on Biden during primary debates last year, saying they bring into question her loyalty to the former vice president. Others argue that she's too ambitious and that she will be solely focused on becoming president herself."
Consider attending Joe Biden for President’s event, Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with former US Attorney General Eric Holder:
I think the DNC is worried that on election night, she will ambitiously tell everyone about Biden's dementia and make sure he has to step down before day after election sunrise.
Maybe it's Russian hackers!?!? Not Biden supporters. Sound like a thing they'd do.
poll: conducted Jul 23 - 25 shows Biden leading by 5%: 49.2% , 44.2%
I hope Lincoln Project and Joe Biden hammer him to the ends of earth for this.
hidin' biden basement biden where's hunter  The mainstream US media is... whatever is weaker than worthless and impotent.
I think biden will lose but you really think the dems nominated somebody they knew would lose?? I mean with the supreme court alone i cant see them picking someone who will surely lose. I think alot of them think he will win and win big.
Biden does NOT need help with Allies - he is known and respected already , even before VP spot.
This sounds like someone is trying to hurt Biden and divide Democrats against each other.  shouldn't be helping them so much.
I mean maybe more with Biden and actuary tables I’ll be interested in who he picks, but basically as long as I believe they could be president... who cares?
"Anarchists should be prosecuted."  — Joe 'Good on Personal Freedom' Biden
How many VP picks actually matter? Cause frankly all I remember from Obama picking Biden was that he handled Palin well and beat Paul Ryan so badly on TV I was waiting for a corner man to throw the towel.
Agreed. Feel free to impeach Trump again in the meantime. You know Barr is going to try to arrest Biden in October, right?
And Biden will move them back.
Excuse me? We’re not pandering to the Republicans, here. I don’t give af if they give  money or not. Same goes for conservative wealthy Dems.  is Biden’s BEST chance of solidifying the office. Without her he has a 50% chance at best. FU the old boys club
Don't spend it all in one place, ok?
TMZ with the breaking news:  'close up picture' Joe biden notes highlights Kamala Harris as first bullet point in today's speech. suggest she could be picked next week.   if it is kamala Harris this will be an historic moment for black woman in America.
Biden isnt winning texas
A cabinet post in The Biden administration.
I know it hurts biden imo
Thread: Republicans are trying to prevent you from knowing how series the Russian threat to our elections is. They insist that revealing how much Russia is trying to hurt Biden would be "partisan."
If alot of colleges arent open biden will lose. The youth vote will not come out for him especially since there wont be people one campuses breathing down your neck to register. In theory they could vote from home but many wont be engaged and will probably just forget.
When...is Biden going to announce his VP running mate? Dr*ump announced P*nce in mid-July 2016. Obama announced Biden late August. The election is so soon and yet...so..far...away.
Biden is still winning. Texas has been a Red State since 1980, until now. Texans have wised up up to Trump's playbook: deflect, deny, lie
I watch these  ads and almost every time I think “am I a Republican for Biden?”
Luntz will be calling biden the winner at 3pm based on exit polls done in miami  and pittsburg.
Then you can wear a MAGA mask or a Biden mask, whatever you want. If you're worried about being attributed to a party you dislike that is. More to your point, yeah masks got politicized, but they aren't supposed to be. you should probably still use one though.
So which of Biden’s running mate choices would have the most sway in Florida?
If you hear Joe Biden promise to do something “on Day 1” if he wins, can we make it Day 2 so we can all get a good night’s sleep first?
Like...when Biden was VP?
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
Disqualifying: “Trump himself on Wednesday told reporters he believed Harris would be a "fine choice" to be Biden's running mate.”
Why should I vote for someone who just yesterday said I should be prosecuted for being an anarchist? Jfc this is 2020 not 1920, I'm not voting for Biden's anti-leftist Saturnalia of Oppressions.  Joe Biden is an A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
Pretty ballsy of Joe Biden to run for president like 100 times and lose 99 but okay Harris is "ambitious"
Further, Joe Biden is married to a woman with a doctorate... so he’s clearly not put off by high achievers
#GOPBetrayedAmerica by never once doing a single thing to get the Trump admin to do right by America.  #GOP need to lose every seat. I'll settle for minority status in both branches/elect Pres Biden   It's still breathtaking how much they let down their country.  #AmericaOrTrump
If Biden gets elected, there will never be another pipeline approved.  Doesn’t this increase the value for the existing ones?  Not to mention cash flowing assets in 0% rate environment should trade higher anyway.  $ET $EPD $WMB are nice value buys
I think folks are focused on Biden’s VP announcement b/c they know it’ll be the last thing of interest his campaign will announce all the way up till Nov. 3rd.
Trump would’ve beat biden if it wasnt for corona
Duck this nonsense
Now that the ball is in motion, can it be a) stopped/reversed if Biden is elected? b) completed before Jan 21?
Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
I truly don't GAF what any previous trump voter has to say about why they've decided to vote for Biden this election.  They were fine with the GOP and trump until RIGHT NOW.   I'll take their votes, but they aren't allies, they're rats deserting their sinking GOP ship.
It's a little troubling that people in the Biden camp would come out and say this in the press. It makes me worry about infighting.
Won’t matter when Biden loses.
Good luck expecting joe goddamn Biden to do anything meaningful to prevent climate collapse.   Key word meaningful
oh for fucks sake  not you too?  seriously - biden is not worse than trump - to say so is fucking laughable. your ability to spout that nonsense shows your privilege.   go fuck yourself.
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
Biden said I should be prosecuted for my ideology. So...no-the-fuck-thanks on that one, squirt.
Yesterday he literally said anarchists like me should be prosecuted. Why in the fucking hell would I support that?  Joe Biden is an A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
I remember Joe Biden jogging around and greeting parade watchers on July 4th, 2019. He looked very alert and fit.  I hope he still is.  As for Trump, we are watching a stunning, possibly fatal, barrage being delivered. Bone jarring blows. Will he remain standing? That *#%#* Cult.
... like Biden did?
So... If you look at the tweets and statements by  He has consistently, rightly and wrongly, said, "Obama Bad, Biden Slow and Bad" so look in your Conservative mirror and see that this is what we as a society have driven the political discourse to become.
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.
That's good. Here's my 2011 attempt to do draw something similar in Kentucky. This district game Obama/Biden a 2.4% edge (and a majority!) with nary a precinct in Jefferson (Louisville) or Fayette (Lexington) Counties. Guessing it gave Andy Beshear a slightly larger win in '19.
You're going to pretend Obama didn't convince Buttigieg, Steyer, and the Klob to drop and endorse Biden the day before super tuesday? His aides have already said as much.
I'll assume she's not planning to murder him in his sleep and instead would focus on becoming VP by working her ass off to achieve a stunning economic and public health recovery, allowing 82yo Pres. Biden to campaign hard for her and then retire. Seems like a safe assumption!
That's serious privilege when you stomp your feet and demand that Biden does what you want or else you won't vote for him  Knowing full well that you will not be one of the people who will be thrown in a cage, have your reproduction rights stripped away, will still be employed
If ambition is disqualifying, Joe Biden will not have a running mate.
With Biden talking about prosecuting anarchists it's exactly the time.
Love how you Dem faithful want us to pretend bad shit wasn't when perpetrated by Biden and Obama.
So they're rooting for Biden? If they were tilting things the other way you would deny it. Even rely on it.
Biden will win here double digit. Remb he is not Hillary and even Amy Klobuchar got more vote than trump or Hillary had a midterm election. Let that sink in. GOP does not have the numbers here
Like you said if it comes down to young voters biden is toast. U of minnesota just announced 70% of classes will be online.
The only way your right is if the president is Biden. Beside Amy Klobuchar is very popular here and even the gov. Ask the average voter here about the riot they blame trump even though that’s not true
Andrew has been nothing if not pragmatic, he's said he's "pro civilization". He's not just backing and voting for biden because of that contract. Sorry, not sorry.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
litterally the only faith i have in biden is that if he wins our country will be a little less overtly fascist, i think the trump administration showed how truly evil some of our fellow country men can be, and i dont think a presidential change will change that fact
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.
Republican "allies" would call her a fucking bitch and move on. Biden needs to shut this down and tell his "allies" that nobody needs this kind of "help."
Your decision obviously, but Yang seems to be going pretty hard in the paint for Biden if you've read his last few emails at all.
Like Nixon and Bush Sr and Biden before her?
Oh my gosh Biden might pick a VP that is ambitious and wants to win?  We all agree that Hillary's choice of VP was much better a boring white guy who apparently had nothing else on his mind, and it showed
But i thought biden was up by 38 points
Here’s the thing, I WANT a VP who is ready to be president and who can WIN in 2028. These Biden ‘allies’ are not being very strategic. 🤔
So like ... Joe Biden?
Harris is the obvious best pick. She is the BEST runningmate for Biden. I’ll support whomever he picks, but if she doesn’t get picked for this reason, these allies are sexist, pure and simple.
Yeah, cause Joe Biden, Al Gore, George HW Bush, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon’s obvious presidential ambitions clearly cost their presidential runningmates. 🤬
Kamala Harris is a terrible pick for Biden (politically) and if true is 100% a function of Dems needing an establishment person on the ticket, who they can trust, because Biden might not finish his 1st term.
They talking about Joe, I've wanted to be president since I was seven, Biden's VP choice?
Biden demands Trump stop retweeting unfounded coronavirus claims from 'crazy woman'
I think the idea is that she would distance herself from controversial Biden policies as VP.
Great point. Trump. HRC and Biden as our only choices in the last four years is utterly tragic for the United States of America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. We need such higher quality of people to run for office.
lmao as opposed to former vice president joe biden who has been *actually* running for president for 30 years
So, what is the date for the Biden VP announcement?
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
She’ll be focused on becoming President if she is VP? Gotta tell ya, given Biden’s age, I don’t see that as a bad thing.
To be clear, I want Elizabeth Warren to be VP in no small part because I think she will ambitiously pursue her policy agenda and perhaps a post-Biden presidency. Donors are idiots
Team Biden is doing a great job cranking up the drams and milking this for maximum coverage.
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Higher taxes when getting back to work. Come on Bernie. I hate Trump and like Biden but $600 extra a week is stupid.  $31200 more a year?? If you meant to say month, then ok.  Unemployed people should not make twice the median salary in America. Sorry.
No one in Minnesota cares about Biden.
Obama and Biden must go to jail for abusing their offices!
So funny when  minions bring up sexual assault, as if it’s a good selling point. You really want to compare Biden and trumps sexual assault history? Not even close. I’ve only seen one of them with their arm around Epstein and Maxwell. Than there’s the lawsuits.
It's human nature to veer towards the negative, so let's take a moment to think about the positive............ BIDEN WILL WIN THIS ELECTION!!!!!!
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Biden picked Harris. Our memories are short.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
On this, we agree.   1/31/20: the president declared coronavirus a public health emergency &amp; issued the ban on travel between the US &amp; China. Campaigning in Iowa, Biden criticized Trump’s travel ban, saying, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia.”
From the article: battleground states of Arizona (Biden +7), Colorado (Biden +13), Florida (Biden +3), Georgia (Biden +1), Michigan (Biden +10), Pennsylvania (Biden +7), Texas (Biden +2), Virginia (Biden +10), and Wisconsin (Biden +7). AND still losing I’m MN. What a LOSER!🤣🤣🤣
What if I'm not interpreting Biden's statement as "bad" but rather as part-and-parcel of Biden's longstanding political tendency to punch left? What if teeing off on "anarchists" has been in Biden's playbook since literally his first days in Congress?
I wasn't wrong.  Biden ran a horrible primary campaign: worst organization of any winning candidate in years. Name recog &amp; Jim Clyborn won nomination  In a freak of nature, all of this played to his advantage this spring as Pres Trump committed political suicide
As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden’s America
Ilhan came out for Biden when he won the nomination &amp; accusations of her antisemitism are largely based in right wing islamaphobia. There are way more obviously antisemitic, anti-dnc policy platform Dems out there but you focused in on the only 2 muslims...a pattern is a pattern
I, too, am settling for Biden......but this just feels like rubbing it in.
Why are you using the past tense of "tried" here? We're looking at an opportunity or you to do so right now, present tense.  I'm not "making an error" here. I held Trump to this standard, I'm gonna hold Biden to it, too. You should do the same.
Are you actually holding Biden to the same standard, tho? When Trump's supporters insisted that we were taking his words "out of context" back in 2016, did you give him/them the benefit of the doubt? Because I know I didn't.
Or that they're even Democrats. They're about to get served a cold reality in November that Biden can win big with a coalition that doesn't even include them. Let these self-serving leftist primadonnas do what they want. They're more trouble than they're worth.
I know but even baris said biden will do whatever he can to skip the debates so i think he will try to at least.
Biden doesn’t need a swing state if he picks a candidate that’s right for this moment. Rice helps carry Virgina and states through the south + Midwest. I like Harris but understand why the campaign may have hurt their relationship. The GOPs urgent scar tissue is self-inflicted.
you should be ashamed of yourself, but you don't have a conscience or a moral or ethical bone in your body! we who live in the suburbs, only worry about one thing, we want you to go away! #Biden #VoteBlue2020
Like I wrote just now, Trump's fans continually insisted that the plain meaning of his words was simply being taken out of "context."  I'm not "assuming the worst," I'm holding Biden to the same standards I held Trump. You should too.
Can't wait for Biden to be questioned on why the entire trump family had exiled to Yemen.
Biden hasn't told me to inject bleach...ever.
I dont see it happening. Biden would be toast
Nope. Not what I am saying. Voting for Biden or Trump is ignoring 90% of the population. Neither give a shit about us.
I don't know what I expected looking at uber lib gen x guys' facebook pages. You'd think Biden was literally Jesus.
Could that be because he is pooping in his depends that he is tied in multiple recent polls with Biden in a state with 38 electoral college votes??
Biden ain’t gonna like this. My disappointing bet is on Susan Rice now.
Biden bots are worse then trumpers
Instead of trying to bait people why not convince them? Tell us all how Biden will make the country better? I can give you plenty of reasons he won't. And in some instances he is just as bad or worse than Trump. As an independent, convince me how great Biden is?
Biden is not going to debate and will try and spin it with crazy condotions so it looks like trump backed out. Trump really needs to do rallies but doesnt soynd like any are planned.
I mean, to be fair, Biden’s policy is a lot more sound and detailed than trumps, no matter how you look at it. His goals are clear, and they mostly align with democratic beliefs. It ain’t too hard to get
My mom just texted me this pic from 2008 of me with with the person who *should* be President right now.  (VOTE IN NOVEMBER! Biden wasn’t my 1st choice but it’s not the primary so that doesn’t matter anymore!!!!!)  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #Vote2020 #Biden2020 #HillaryClinton
I'm not always convinced the big name #NeverBiden are in this for anything other than their paycheck.  That being said, after Biden is elected, I hope hope hope protests continue and people fight for more accountability, justice and the World in general.
So, you are not voting for Biden? Not dishing you, just curious?
Biden wants a yacht 🚢 in Gobie Deserts. That's juice for the boy.
One more puff of steam. Biden elected back to Conestoga wagons hitched up to only 1 lame  mule .
We are on a powerful path to universal care and coverage, amplified by #COVID19. Our health care systems have failed, and the reform we need done will take hard work to overcome the roadblocks and barriers the GOP continues to put in front of us.
Between Biden and Trump?  Yes, 100%!   I feel no shame for voting him out of office.
This guy I know feels entitled to knowing why I won’t vote for trump (and will vote for Biden). He claims he genuinely wants to understand, and expects me to explain it to him. He’s libertarian, we disagree on almost everything. He’s also been insisting I give him book 1/
NOTHING could be worse than what now resides in the WH. I’ll vote for Biden even if he picks Rosie O’Donnell
Was there a leak? Then Biden said it was an error? Page not found!
Feds v the virus until a Biden admin comes in to right the ship and let the fed resume its preferred position of background player.
Thanks, I asked for Matt’s opinion on it, not Biden’s
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.
Unless you're a tort attorney, you can never win a class action suit.
too bad you can’t legislate. President Biden will fix this pronto. ❤️ also, this is evil. #moreofthesame
Biden keeps asking his handlers “who is this trump guy you guys keep making me talk about”
Biden apparently doesn't think so⬇️
Just based on the trends in the district vs the state, if your prior is what evidence suggests that Biden is up 8-11 (expanding the range here a bit), then he is probabily up in the range of 5-10 points in the 2nd district.
I don't see any mention of Joe Biden.
But irrespective of all of this, this is simply deflection. Donald Trump is a raging racist, regardless of Joe Biden. There is ample evidence. Hopefully he is held to account in November.
Biden to announce VP pick. I bet he's going to say Kamala Abrams.
I think you missed that line of reasoning. I was describing your straw-man argument that "Joe Biden is a racist", which is not much of a counterargument to "Donald Trump is a racist". You've been provided some good evidence here, I would be interested to see counter-evidence.
No, racism in all forms, including racism that Joe Biden has espoused, is bad. I also believer that Donald Trump is an explicit, outspoken racist whereas Joe Biden is a bumbling, gaffe-racist who has appropriately attempted to modify his views over his 35+ years of public service
YEP.  (Says the girl who ran a ridiculous meeting in the park by my house yesterday on letting teenage boys of color play basketball without harassment.)  And I both feel you &amp; feel absolute terror from potentially purple MN that a single person would sit out voting for Biden.
I don't watch cable news, that stuff is trash.   You asked for videos because you seem to be implying that "Cos there’s many of Biden doing it", it therefor isn't that bad. Did you mean something else?  But let's do away with assumptions then: is Trump's racism bad? Yes/No
If he did that, he wouldn't have photos for his ads touting "Biden's America". Stupid idiot doesn't even realize that this is actually Trump's America and we all know it!
I also think people in CA are just differently situated, FWIW.  There is no world in which Biden doesn't win CA and significantly run up the margins.   So I think some of the elite strain you're rightly noting is also a screaming frustration at how CA is situated.
They call your argument "Cos there’s many of Biden doing it" a straw-man argument
I assume you mean that there are videos of Biden saying racist things, which would imply that both candidates for President do it, which you imply would make it a moot point to criticize the President's racism - therefor, the President's racism isn't bad enough to criticize
Has Biden talked with you about potentially giving you a cabinet position?
It’s not a purity test. Biden is god awful. So is Trump. Not voting for either one. We all go down with Biden or Trump.
"Cos there’s many of Biden doing it."
Biden will crush him just by using FACTS.
So even if you don't think it'd be much better, which it clearly would be, please vote for Biden.
2020 really gonna end with a Biden/Trump election

“With Biden, drug prices will quadruple!”  Has Dumb Donnie been right about anything?  Mexico hasn’t paid for the wall. The coronavirus is still raging even though it is hot out. Masks are preventing the spread. China does not pay us tariffs. Russia did interfere in our election.
And him campaign advisors are touting Biden as being the most progressive? this platform blows. Time to start watching the campaign dollars and where they come from until November.
O Biden is Still in the basement
Mystery of politics  Biden may choose as VP former Obama official Susan Rice  who has - Never run for elected office - No swing state pull  - Overlaps Biden's expertise: foreign affairs - Republican son - Scar tissue from GOP criticism over Benghazi  - Virtually no name recog
Biden got here off Super Pac $$ from healthcare. How can we change his stance while he accepts money from them?
Sorry Biden. You’re going to lose to the other Jo #joj20
Yeah, I mean, I think the hospitalization stuff is conspiracy theory nonsense.  But I think we're on the same page that Biden is both not great and also markedly, comically better than Trump.  Perhaps partially because of the low bar.

The Trump/Biden debates can’t get here fast enough!
270 To Win still shows Biden winning in a landslide if you give Trump those states.
Now? I think we're actually beyond fixing. A Biden admin might slow the collapse, but it won't stop it.
What is Biden supposed to have done about the pandemic that he hasn't done?  I've seen him give a fair number of speeches and he's unelected.  (I am against Biden/Clinton/Obama foreign policy pretty full stop, FWIW.  There's massive differences in domestic policy land.)
🤣🤣 Joe Biden is a neo-liberal, establishment Democrat. Far from "radical left"
“I am in  flying to the Great State of Texas”  Dumb Donnie is so stupid he tagged an HVAC company in Columbus instead of his own plane.  You can’t talk about Biden’s gaffes any more.

Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.
I don't want to live in a Fema camp but they just are unwilling to look past their anger to see the truth. They all want to see Trumps tax returns but  are unwilling to look into Bidens (sex allegations ) or Hunter Biden Scandel. Poof all gone. The power of the MSM
Just because I trash Joe Biden does not mean I like Trump... I think they're both shitty. Conservatives, i promise I'm not on your side. Your politicians are just as shitty as ours
Vote for Joe Biden to end the shitshow AND silence Matthew.
With #Trump and #Biden our choices for President in 2020 have to be the shittiest since 2016...
"anarchists should be prosecuted"  Considering how during the Obama administration punk houses were randomly raided for spreading anarchist propaganda I am taking Biden at his word
While the RV sample has Biden and Trump tied, it has Perdue up 6 and Collins/Loeffler at the top of the Special election.
This is an interesting (but frightening) look into Trump supporters in rural Pennsylvania. What will be interesting to see is whether these voters go back to the Democratic side absent Trump's cult of personality.
Joe biden cant beat trump. We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble racist unelectable joe
Joe Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August.
Pennsylvania will go for Trump this November.  Book it. I'll look this tweet up after the election and gloat about it.   #WednesdayMorning #NobodyLikesMe

Forget the the Biden memes - bring on the Fauci memes.
Wish they'd all just get good &amp; sick enough to keep them out of commission for a while.  Say, until Biden's inauguration day in January.
And that’s why you’re voting for Biden? He can walk down the ramp so he should be president?
Hollywood created a feel-good moment at the Oscars where Joe Biden spoke about victims of molestation, rape &amp; respecting boundaries! Molested as a kid, it was painful to watch. Google "creepy Joe", see what he has done to people not reported by mainstream media! F*** Hollywood!
I suppose they absolutely will make it an issue, but that the American people seem to have lost interest in chasing down every conservative narrative. I say let them go insane over it again; and keep them talking about it. It gives Biden more air on COVID, Systemic Racism, &amp; jobs
97 days until we have our opportunity to make things right.   Biden will work for all Americans rather than only those who are his base.  Please register to vote, check your status &amp; apply for absentee voting.  Let’s do this!  #FreshTopics #VoteJoeBiden2020  #RidenWithBiden2020
Kistner needs to count on that Morning Consult poll number materializing, but the problem there is that even within their own polling set, the MN number is outlier-ish considering numbers in similar states. Right now, Biden +9-10 is probabily about where we are.
One person with a lot of say in that decision doesn't think so.
Which Fox news anchor were you watching when you heard that?  Biden is about as centrist as they come.  The GOP has gone so far over the fascist cliff moderates seem like lefties to you.
Craig also has a pretty significant COH advantage and as things sit right now, Biden is likely to carry the district.  Kistner has some help with a LMN candidate on the ballot, but that likely won’t be enough without closing the money gap and drawing a better environment. #MN02

Vote For Joe Biden in 2020! He won’t tear gas your family!
Biden won’t give an interview because he is mentally incapable of answering questions on his own
Vote Biden 2020! He won’t tear gas you or your family!
Sooo you’re telling me if Biden wins all this just stops? What’s it going to take
No Joe Biden wants to murder babies that’s crazy with taxpayer dollars
Biden definitely has dementia
Biden went crazy whoever the vice president is is it going to be the president soon if Biden wins but I don’t think Biden is going to win President Trump is going to beat Biden hands-down
Exactly...he was a black man that supported Donald Trump so Biden’s “you ain’t black” went into full effect!  Biden should be charged as an accomplice🤷🏻‍♀️
He’s talking about Biden trying to force a corrupt General Prosecutor out of the Ukrainian administration and leveraging aid money to do so, which happened, but it’s also far from illegal and nothing like what Trump did, so it doesn’t help his point at all.
Actually they said it was a protest against Biden’s “socialism,” which doesn’t make any sense because the Nazis weren’t socialist.  So they might not be Nazis, but they sure are stupid either way.
So far, every criticism the right has thrown at Biden is just projection. It's everything they love about Trump, just in a Democrat's body. That's what they don't like.
It may not be a coincidence that Biden who submits to China released a virus and the Democrats will not do anything about it
Socialism is in the menu and AOC is part of “team biden” policies now. This dummy I’m sure will have a spot on the team too...they’re all anti-American/anti-western culture/anti-white/anti-man
Biden’s not even hiding his socialist agenda anymore.Joining Bernie and gave AOC a co-chair position on climate policies.They don’t say “team Biden” for nothing. Joe wouldn’t be the President either way, the “team” would declare him unable to discharge powers, 25th Amendment.
Let's remember that just because Biden is doing great in the polls does NOT automatically mean that he will win this Nov. We learned our lesson the hard way in 2016 when many of us got very complacent. If we want to insure a Biden victory, it's up to all of us to vote Trump out.
I saw it, people. The White Whale of Central Minnesota. A yard sign for Biden.
Joe Biden will kill America turn us into another Venezuela
➿#QualifiedImmunity➿Replying to   Okay, I can see that...because in Biden's version, every effort will be made for the remaining boot-lickers at fOx to be charged, prosecuted, and if not imprisoned...deported from Biden's America! I'd be very scared FoX nEws💪🏽🌊🇺🇸

Come on...warning u about socialism/communism is offensive?U know it’s exactly what ur endorsing?Cause shes not wrong about Biden.Keep voluntarily handing over our freedom!Masks aren’t even quality controlled but she should be banned for warning of whats being pushed in America?
❤️❤️❤️ I’m a good person I promise. I’m still mostly liberal I just hate what Joe Biden stands for
I'm not dying from Covid until AFTER I vote for Biden.
I see your point and I agree. Sadly, Biden will have much more to clean up and prosecute.
It's such a shame that you're campaign strategy is based on hate. Mr Biden is not.  Go away old man!

Please show us where Biden said he would defund the police?! Trump was being interviewed and said Biden said that and then was shown the charter and it never says that. So please come with your proof that it was said and not just the lies that come out of Trumps mouth
He wants to register enough ex-felons to vote that the state swings into Joe Biden’s column in November—a goal he shares with left-wing billionaire megadonor George Soros.
Yeah Russians. You meant Biden right?
trump is an embarrassment to our Country. Biden knee in April that trump is corrupt
Can’t really blame Bush. That economy was all tied to Wall Street garbage mortgages. But OBAMA and Biden did turn a horrible situation around

this should be removed. There are far more people running for POTUS than Biden and Trump.
Let’s make a deal. You say nice things to press, Biden, Clinton, Cohen, your niece,.... and I will say nice about you!  What do ya say?
I'm good! I do the same thing. Can't wait for November.  Hope the election goes smoothly and Biden wins in a landslide.
Apparently, the riots ARE the Biden campaign. Vote blue or the country gets it.
Our POTUS is watching a tennis match while Joe and Jill Biden ailing with Nancy Pelosi are paying their respects to John Lewis. Nice, eh?
"We're going to fight like hell for Biden. And there's no contradiction between doing that and supporting this pledge".  Wrong.  is vehemently against #MedicareForAll; if you vote for him you're voting against #M4A.   #DemExit 🌻
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I’ve never seen someone in politics as spineless as Joe Biden. Don’t be fooled by headlines and media; he isn’t for you.
Agree, FNC is still entertainment, I don't care how good Chris Wallace is, there's no upside to giving that channel any uptick in ratings which a Biden interview would do. They're still carnival barkers to me. Biden doesn't need them, they need him. All the more reason to not.
Shocker,  isn't the savior many have been making him out to be. Glad I was already going in another direction.🌻
Joe Biden is the nominee because voters didn't want Bernie Sanders, and Sanders seemed to have a chance in a 4-5 candidate race. Without Sanders running, Biden probably wouldn't have run.
They ought be terrified because there's a Blue Tsunami coming and it will be even worse in 2022 when many more republican senators are running than Democrats and Americans have seen the good that a Biden administration will do for all.
It's pretty simple. Biden implied he'd veto #MedicareForAll so this talk about 60 senators is a red herring. If you're voting for  you're voting against #M4A. 🌻
True. She said if Biden wins we’ll have socialism like the nazis. Who were fascists like Trump and his entire party and idiot followers like her. People really are that stupid. Plus racism.
He definitely won't. Why would he if he knows people will vote for him either way? Fuck Biden. 🌻
Watch some biden film. You understand baby talk correct?
Because he's gonna beat Biden off?
I agree plus Biden has worked with her.
This is it. You have a base of voters interested in policy and so far the Biden camp has done very little to reach out. They aren't asking for much. Just something more than "Not Trump".
Are trying to get #trumplstiltskin elected again? Any one but Trump and that includes Joe Biden. If you are not part of the solution you are the problem
Fox News polling says that Joe Biden is up by nine points in Michigan and eleven points in Pennsylvania. This is even uglier for Donald Trump than the overall polling averages, which say that Biden is up by about eight points in Michigan and about seven points in Pennsylvania.
A flood of dems will vote for trump secretly come election day. Most people are not ok with looting, burning, assaulting, and killing that the left has to offer. Go ahead and talk yourself into the myth that biden will win. Millions of dems will vote for trump. Secretly.
Biden very well could be a good man. You have seen him gaff just about every time he has spoke. The chances are pretty good he has dementia. You must be hoping he picks a decent running mate. Because that person will at some point be president. Biden isn’t mentally capable.
Could Obama be VP for Biden he gets elected and resigns so Obama is president and Nancy polosi V.P. think of that. Bernie leader of senate. And OAC speaker of house.
Hey, check out this cool site I found:  #Topic via

Biden would never  allow Russia to put bounties on our military without a repurcussion. trump is in cohoots  with the Russians. trump , against the constitution, has invaded our states
Biden would have never ignored that Russia has bounties on our military
An actual United States Congressperson, ladies and gentlemen. A potential Biden Cabinet member.It’ll be a great inauguration crowd regardless.  Bigger than Trump’s though that’s a pretty low bar.
In a democracy, no one should be a kingmaker. I hope that Biden doesn't want to be one.
This is actually one reason that I think Warren will be the pick. I don't think Biden wants to decide the course of the party, and I'm not convinced that Warren will run in 2024. If she commits to that, it could be an incentive to Biden if he really doesn't want the coronation.

this should be removed. There are far more people running for POTUS than Biden and Trump.
Let’s make a deal. You say nice things to press, Biden, Clinton, Cohen, your niece,.... and I will say nice about you!  What do ya say?
Apparently, the riots ARE the Biden campaign. Vote blue or the country gets it.
Our POTUS is watching a tennis match while Joe and Jill Biden ailing with Nancy Pelosi are paying their respects to John Lewis. Nice, eh?
"We're going to fight like hell for Biden. And there's no contradiction between doing that and supporting this pledge".  Wrong.  is vehemently against #MedicareForAll; if you vote for him you're voting against #M4A.   #DemExit 🌻
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I’ve never seen someone in politics as spineless as Joe Biden. Don’t be fooled by headlines and media; he isn’t for you.
Agree, FNC is still entertainment, I don't care how good Chris Wallace is, there's no upside to giving that channel any uptick in ratings which a Biden interview would do. They're still carnival barkers to me. Biden doesn't need them, they need him. All the more reason to not.
Shocker,  isn't the savior many have been making him out to be. Glad I was already going in another direction.🌻
Joe Biden is the nominee because voters didn't want Bernie Sanders, and Sanders seemed to have a chance in a 4-5 candidate race. Without Sanders running, Biden probably wouldn't have run.
They ought be terrified because there's a Blue Tsunami coming and it will be even worse in 2022 when many more republican senators are running than Democrats and Americans have seen the good that a Biden administration will do for all.
This is a FANTASTIC AD for Joe Biden lol
Are we better off than we were four years ago? Hell no! I'm Ridin' with Biden and voting blue down the ticket. VOTE! #ResistanceTaskForce
I hear what you're saying. I live in Minnesota and am an army of one as a Biden supporter. I'm completely surrounded in my family. But I have to admit: It keeps me plenty feisty.
It's pretty simple. Biden implied he'd veto #MedicareForAll so this talk about 60 senators is a red herring. If you're voting for  you're voting against #M4A. 🌻
Your a broken record.  You attack on multiple fronts hopping something sticks. In the meantime you have no answers. When Biden does say something it's already been done. On a other point Democratic cities are in  chaos and your party is a no-show. You attack the police. Turn away
True. She said if Biden wins we’ll have socialism like the nazis. Who were fascists like Trump and his entire party and idiot followers like her. People really are that stupid. Plus racism.
Part of me wonders if Biden doesn't want to be the Kingmaker, and would rather ride off into the sunset in 24.
He definitely won't. Why would he if he knows people will vote for him either way? Fuck Biden. 🌻
Watch some biden film. You understand baby talk correct?
Because he's gonna beat Biden off?
I’m not voting for Biden or for Trump.  I’m writing in 🌸Tulsi Gabbard🌺, unless Jesse Ventura ends up on the ticket some how.
I agree plus Biden has worked with her.
A flood of dems will vote for trump secretly come election day. Most people are not ok with looting, burning, assaulting, and killing that the left has to offer. Go ahead and talk yourself into the myth that biden will win. Millions of dems will vote for trump. Secretly.
Biden very well could be a good man. You have seen him gaff just about every time he has spoke. The chances are pretty good he has dementia. You must be hoping he picks a decent running mate. Because that person will at some point be president. Biden isn’t mentally capable.
Fox News poll shows Biden up 13 points in MN. Fox. News. Poll.
An actual United States Congressperson, ladies and gentlemen. A potential Biden Cabinet member.This is really Biden, wearing a mask, sniffing his hair...
In retrospect, Joe Biden was exactly the right candidate. He's the one Democrat who absolutely can't be tied to the far left.
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
I hate Biden, I'm not voting for either tbh. That said, if you think Trump has any chance at winning if the election was held tomorrow, you don't understand what people are going through. He has failed, and people are angry.
But that horrible Joe Biden who wrote the crime bill and locked up everyone and now wants to make crime legal was almost defeated!
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
This is why we need the percontation point. It would be so much better if we could write, "I'm sure gonna be mad if AOC murders Biden to death⸮" and everyone realized we were not serious about whatever we were saying.
I just can't do it anymore. Someone please lock this guy up with Obama, Biden, and Hillary.....Please!
So we need a president who isn’t Joe “I don’t want my kids growing up in a racial jungle” Biden, got it.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
My hot VP take remains that I will vote for Biden if he picks literally anyone for VP.
Vote for Biden? #BirkluvsTrump
Well, Joe Biden certainly was willing to share his notes. He just did it old school.
Yea trump killed 150k people (that died of COVID and nothing else I’m sure),  New York didn’t kill half of them in LTC facilities either that was trump probably too. He didn’t ban infected China either, Biden did that. #Trump2020 #Hydroxychloroquine
Close.  M will be VP.  Then after election, Biden will be declared incompetent. M will be sworn in.
Oh no Biden came out against anarchism, this will end his presidential campaign, because Americans are hungry for anarchy, I read it on Twitter.
Given that Biden is specifically campaigning on expunging records, nah.
Nothing Biden ever did brought down costs
Biden can bring his own people. They protect him like no one else can.
I can't believe I wasted my time with this. How disrespectful this clown act was to the Taxpayers of this Nation. Topped off with Biden's Q &amp; A act.
Joe Biden should go for a full rat tail. He's getting close. #JoeBiden
Biden is a 47 year fraud and a liar. The Democrats are growing desperate, They are now supporting organized chaos in our cities and getting innocent people killed. They will lose and lose big in November. #Trump2020Landslide
Also, and I mean this, Biden is experienced enough not to let that moment affect him. Politics ain't beanbag, and it was a debate. And in debates, you get called out. Harris did nothing wrong, and Biden deserved to be hit.
If he ever hopes to pull in a larger proportion of the Democrats he has to play the politics. You can tell he's playing too because there is no passion behind his posts about Biden, just robotic statements
Good job listing the DEMS accomplishments in 2020. Enjoying your Biden preview are we?
But why wouldn't Biden want a direct conduit to the CCP installed on his staff's phones?
Why weren’t any of these “issues” solved under Obama and Biden is what I really want to hear the answer to. Somehow made up words like systemic racism only exist if orange man bad.  Wage gap, this, all explains by people choices. Good choices - good life.
This guy is questioning Biden's judgement.
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Joe Biden wants to cut social security and disability and Medicare and Medicaid. How will that work out for you? The retirement age won't exist if Joe Biden is elected.
I saw the show it was amazingly alarming. Somehow that message has to get out to the general public nobody realizes what might happen if they elect Joe Biden. That would be the end of our country as we know it. They would take all the rights away from the people in the suburbs.
Unbelievable Biden is even on the radar for the democrats...
It makes you a black pedophile. Remember, if you don’t vote for Biden, “you ain’t black”! 😂
Free speech, extreme yea, don’t support it but free speech. What she said is true though, enjoying your preview of Biden socialism yet are we?
Yup. If anyone was actually paying attention after super Tuesday, you could tell that Amy was Biden's first VP pick.
My husband's a custom cabinet builder/woodworker. He spends everyday talking real loud and clear to all the tradesmen he works with(whether they want to listen or not) about Trump's mishandling of literally everything and why the country needs Biden. He knows we need their votes.
Biden lost my vote when he wrote the 1994 Crime bill, said “Poor kids are just as smart as white kids”, “You ain’t black if you vote Trump”, doesn’t want to end qualified immunity, wants to ban assault rifles, pedophile, racist. Damn do I need more?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes, but it's different because Biden is not Bernie.
If you vote for Biden, things will be just like this horrific hellscape, which is [checks notes] happening right now.
Yes, losing. Have you seen not only the polls, but the state of the country? I hate Biden, but I can see that he would be crushed if the election was today.
Yes, they do.  Do you listen to Biden?
Creepy?  Really?  Now do Biden.
Biden leading in Lakeville.  By three donors, but still!
#mnleg MN GOP may need to rethink turning MN red....Fox Poll: "In MN, the only state polled that the president lost to HRC in 2016, Biden leads 51 to 38%. This includes a 26-pt lead among women, an 18-pt lead among seniors and a 12-pt lead among suburban voters."
Says the Man who's Mentor is Robert Byrd??? Please! When does Mr. Biden have to answer?
Blasting Trump is understandable and warranted.  Praising Biden is not.  He hasn’t even run a campaign, he’s totally invisible and when he actually does speak he sounds, frankly, senile.
“Poor kids are just as bright as white kids” -Biden
Trumps America is the right America where law and order are still important. The Democrats have no power left than to help cause chaos in inner cities, Funded anarchy. Your risking a civil war with an elected Biden. Trump is the anti establishment and the dems dont like it boohoo
I can’t believe all these Trump ads that are like, “this is what Biden’s America would look like”, while showing very real footage from Trump’s America. What is the game there? Does Trump think the rest of us have dementia too? People buy this shit??
Y’all are literally taking headlines out of the Trump administration and substituting Biden for Trump.  You’re so bad at this.
You’re right so one out of 30 he is innocent. Biden just leaned over close enough to smell her hair. Pervwould be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.
Also, she’s beautiful.
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.
Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.
#WeWillVote you out👎! #WeWillVote for Biden👍! #WeWillVote blue. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😉
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm
Oh my God can he please be our next VP? Biden's running mate? Can that be a thing????? #IMissObama This Was a Different Barack Obama. A Stick-Swinging, Old-Testament Obama.
I probably would but I would be wearing my Biden face mask.
Now that the trumpeter has floated the idea of postponing the election #WeWillVote November 3. And we will vote for Biden. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
This is bonkers. We need someone able and willing to step in at any moment. Hell, yes, she’d better want to be president. Who thinks Biden will even be alive to run for a second term? Good grief.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
And Biden will move them back.
If you hear Joe Biden promise to do something “on Day 1” if he wins, can we make it Day 2 so we can all get a good night’s sleep first?
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
Biden doesn’t need a swing state if he picks a candidate that’s right for this moment. Rice helps carry Virgina and states through the south + Midwest. I like Harris but understand why the campaign may have hurt their relationship. The GOPs urgent scar tissue is self-inflicted.
We are on a powerful path to universal care and coverage, amplified by #COVID19. Our health care systems have failed, and the reform we need done will take hard work to overcome the roadblocks and barriers the GOP continues to put in front of us.
NOTHING could be worse than what now resides in the WH. I’ll vote for Biden even if he picks Rosie O’Donnell
Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.
Biden has dementia. It’s clear to the whole 🌎 Nice guy wrong job.
Meet Susan Rice. If you haven’t gotten to know  hear why she is a front runner for Joe Biden’s VP.  It is an amazing conversation about our country’s moment of reckoning. Listen here:
He should have pulled a Biden and just started laughing at them.
#IKeepThinkingWeveReachedPeakStupidityButIKeepGettingProvenWrong dept.:  Channeling Joe Biden, a white man tells a very black woman that inside, he is blacker than her.  #INeverExpectedUniversalMadnessToBeSoDamnedFunny
I refuse do let they assholes take this away from me. I put out my flag all summer , right behind my Joe Biden for president sign.
Does it include future quotes from public officials about the school openings? Note the Politico announcement included a quote of Biden referring to his pick of Harris
This has since been scrubbed from the Politico article  but thanks to  wayback machine, we know this wasn't a photoshop; Politico really posted that Harris is Biden's VP pick announced in future on Aug 1:
Hi everyone in my family is a registered voter and we vote together grandma to and we’re all voting for Biden from Minnesota 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗
Joe Biden’s plan failed to mention universal healthcare or #Medicare4All ... seems like this pandemic has shown us how important it is for all Americans to have access to healthcare
I’d question that poll honestly...
Breathing a sigh of relief as it dawns on me that I don’t have to listen to my parents bemoan the fact that Biden will ruin this country.
Mike can keep asking but Biden owes him nothing, especially since he did it like a childish dare.
I just saw Joe Biden commercial on TV and I cried. How are soul will recover with someone so good at the helm.
Answer me this, if Biden used a cover of Echo as their song of choice for a motivational campaign video, would you be okay with it?
I saw that exact same shirt except they spelled it Joe Biden. 😀
What a senseless thing to say. 45’s entourage are dropping like flies with Covid, and you question people who are being cautious? Vice President Biden was there to honor John Lewis. Some were not.
If Biden wins, it may not be rioters and terrorists being pulled into vans. It will be your children instead.
I prefer a president that doesn't have a private unmarked militia.   #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Biden
They’re ALL going for Biden because you’re such a TERRIBLE president and and we ALL want you OUT!!!
It’s being taken down by a strong her - Hurricane Hanna.

I'm 5 degrees to the left of Bernie Sanders. My friends and I all support Joe Biden. He will bring healing to this country and end fascism. Democracy is on the line.
Bullshit Jr. You're really afraid Biden will raise taxes on your billion buddies.
I have a Biden joke but it's about the other Biden.
But lot of them blacks that vote for YE are probably gonna vote Trump!! 😂 it might hurt Trump more than Biden.. JS
Damn autocorrect strikes again.  It's supposed to be Biden's not baby's
That’s precisely why I’m voting for Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Oh yeah that one. "Vote for Biden and gramma will get snuffed out" meanwhile all these "Biden's America" images are from literal Trumps America
Got it. It’s no good to 🗳 Biden
Helephino... Rhinophant... Hors.... Moo...   Biden 2020
Mr. Gidley needs to know that like so many people I know, I will crawl through fire, over broken glass, and fight off rabid dogs to vote for ANYONE running against Trump. (OK not Kanye)I don’t give a flying flip about watching Biden. He’s got my vote.
You guys need to visit the cemeteries, Biden bumper stickers on ALL the tombstones
That’s crazy. Look 👀 up what Biden has said about the Black community.
Trump: I combed my hair. I have beautiful hair. They couldn’t believe it. They said, “Its  unbelievable! Rarely does anybody do what you just did.” Biden refuses to tell us who combs his hair, bc I know for a fact he cannot comb his own hair.   #Biden2020Landslide
I love how Republicans are insisting this is what Joe Biden’s America will look like...as if it’s not happening right now and as if it’s not Trump’s doing. 🙄 Gotta find those excuses, right?
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. It’d be too damn embarrassing for Biden, or anyone for that matter, to brag about such things!
If I was just one year older, I would DEFINITELY vote for Trump! Because even though Joe Biden claims to be a moderate (i am a conservative, so i would not vote for him anyway) he does not seem very articulate and he does not seem capable of holding back the radical left.
Biden would fail this if they asked him to repeat it twice in 5 seconds
They've been running commercials advertising "Biden's America" here nonstop and i'm all like "uhhh... that's already happening dude. Failboat"
The deceptive radicalism of Joe Biden via
On Covid-19, Biden doesn’t have any new ideas. On climate and the economy, his ideas are liabilities, writesMore Evidence of #DNC Corruption | Listen to interview    #DNCisCorrupt #BernieSanders #Biden #ACAB #BREAKING #Corona #DyingForTrump
So.. What Joe Biden is running? Past, or present. Hypocrisy at it's best.
saying “settle for biden” like it’s a slogan..... I have to laugh
Everything except choclate rainbows and unicorn farts if Biden wins. If he Trump wins it gets worse
Our country needs to do better. This girl gave me hope for the future but we need to make some serious changes right now. I commended her for being so thoughtful and caring. We need our leaders to do the same. Have some compassion. Wear a damn mask. Vote for Biden. That’s it.
Biden is no card carrying member of Mensa either but at least he is smart enough to know he’s stupid.
Remember how you said Trump would destroy America? Now Joe Biden’s supporters are doing it instead....just leave America now.
It's not!! You think i want to vote for biden? He's not even my 10th pick!! But he's still higher than trump! If we're forced to keep electing pedophiles, maybe we should at least have the decency to not give them two terms. Trump had his one. Let's get moving.
What about a million person March in DC?  We could ask Obama, Biden, Rice, Harris, many others to speak
Let's jump 6 months into the future and grant Biden wins with the House but R's hold the Senate narrowly. Without any hyperbole and BS how much do you think will change?
What a horrible, mean thing to say. You know I wanted to knock boots with demons and wicked witches until I read your hurtful, hateful comments. Why are you two so extra in trying to hurt Mr. Biden. He’s obviously a superior Vice President to that mammas boy Pence. Joe n we win.
No it wouldn’t be. Joe Biden doesnt know where he is right now. He can barely keep straight what office he’s running for in his speeches.
This isn’t even political when I say this.   Joe Biden isn’t well, in any way shape or form. The Dems are going to push for him to be put in a position that will literally kill him. He won’t be able to handle the stress mentally or physically. They’re gonna kill him...
This is really letting the cat out of the bag on who is really running the show. If Biden was in control and didn't want her, she wouldn't be the pick. Period
Trump's withdrawal of our troops in Germany is INFURIATING  and rocks NATO.  Biden can restore order but we all have to VOTE! #EveryVoice
Joe Biden winning the presidency after 3 debates.
Since democrats want doom gloom and criminal activity from their supporters, I will never vote for Joe Biden
Biden is the first candidate ever to start the Primary in the middle, by Dem standards anyway, and tac left for the general.
I almost want Biden to win just to see the Left destroy these guys when they are no use to them any longer. **Almost**
I’m honestly screaming at everyone telling me I have to vote Biden, because I simply do not 😌 thank you.
They BOTH have credible sexual assault allegations. One of them just has more.  The BOTH are mentally declining old men.  Its absolute insanity to think that anything would be fixed by choosing Biden. But they can't get THAT much worse, right?
U want  for Prez? He may get in, but a good chance Dems will make his VP Prez sometime after election. Biden is a brain damaged puppet.
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate  Keep up the good work Biden.
Yet again that orange fucken asshat, ⁦ is breaking the law and getting away with it. This mother fucker and his devil spawn’s need serious prison time!!! When that happens we know President Biden will not pardon them.
When we elect Joe Biden we will be back on our way!!!
Dude i love joe biden
Blinders. Your hatred of the guy is obvious. You don't realize the path we're going down. If Biden gets in so be it. He'll maybe last a year before he's deemed an invalid.
-_- and the dilemma I'm having as well is who to support come Nov 3rd...Biden? Or the Third party write in Jo Jorgensen...
I competely agree with you on this but let's just think about it for a moment. How bad and rotten has it become when most people probably know this is going to happen and than just pretend it isn't? The narrative will be competely dropped for Jill Biden's hairstyle or something.
You must be an unemployed liberal living the dream on you government checks? You have to realize this ends in America becoming a third world country. If Biden gets elected America is in trouble.
Change my mind. Obama did nothing. Biden hasn't done anything in his 40 yrs in office, literally has lost his marbles. Hilary hasn't done anything. Give me someone who is worthy of the office? Dem or Rep. Show me something. I'm independent either way.
Clinton or Biden? You can't be serious. I'm up for a debate. Trump has his faults but Joe is wearing diapers and Hilary is on my list of most despicable people ever born. What have they done in the 70 years they've been in office?
It's obvious you're a pawn in this, livestock to the Gates, Biden's, and Clinton's of the world. If you think Biden, is a competent and qualified leader of America we're all done. He can't string together two sentences. Venezuela here we come.

No. Just like the idiots who walked into a Walmart here in Minnesota wearing masks that had a swastika on them claiming that if we voted for Joe Biden America would become a socialist state. She actually said that.
Trump ads:  Fictional scare tactics that look like cheesy afterschool specials.  Biden ads:  Just Trump's own words and actions showing how incompetent he is.  But, let's not talk about that.  🤣
Where IS Hunter Biden? 🤔
Not surprised!  declines interview with Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace, while   sat for an hour interview...no topic off the table.   Joe Biden should do the same.   Btw, where's Hunter?

Sorry you feel that way. I'm voting for  Not going to vote for Biden.
Biden’s “dignified care”: 1. Euthanasia on demand  2. Broken healthcare system overburdened by illegals 3. It 1&amp;2 fail - follow Governor Cuomo’s directions
I agree with Fed Agents to.troubked cities there is enough evidence Antifa is a terrorist group &amp; is meant to oust the Pres to make way for Socialism in America. Biden/ dem party agenda will destroy America Bankrupt the nation. Pres against all odds has done a lot

I know y’all go off shade room and all dis other bullshit fake news but Biden is not da answer Bernie was some what better but his plans was impossible mathematically and logically.
During 2016 I said it would be this bad. I've not been able to accept he's president. My anxiety level has been off the charts since 11/1016.  Every day is just more bs. If Biden isn't elected I  probably won't survive.
They are praying Biden is elected to get sanctions released &amp; resume their nuclear program to invade.
Voted mostly R back to 1972. Could not vote for Trump in 2016. Now am happy to vote for a decent man and faithful public servant in Joe Biden. #RepublicansForBiden
Trump is getting ready to dump DeSantis. Trump will be wanting his Governor job in a few years. It’s a state ripe for corruption and the feeling is its easy for him to continue a money grab as Gov. and take potshots at Biden. DeSantis has no clue. Set up Fl. For the kids income🔆
The pendulum is swinging. the military see 45 as a liability to global hegemony. he is no longer a useful idiot.   the next problem will be the Biden adminstration, and all the people who literally go back to brunch
If ya'll saying "it's either Biden or Trump" that aint right, you do realize   is also running for the presidency under the Green party.
As his day begins to unwind he readies for Barr’s daily fluffing. 11am is early when he fell off the rails of adderal and ran out of Tucks pads. Biden agreed to the Clorox entry team have at it for a few days before moving in. Biden will likely donate all the pizza puffs cases 2.
Minn. lawmakers tout Biden's child- and home-care plan at campaign event
Biden is getting the latest security briefings and has continued having Secret Service protection. I wonder if Trumps secret service detail is eyeballing and sizing up Biden’s crew. Sure they are on the same team but it’s like 1st team playing 2nd team. They might end up at odds.
Please Biden! Come out of the basement 🤣😂
Who are you referring to then biden? You are certainly not the person who would be able to fit that description.
I think Biden is the most racist person to run for president since LBJ
You are a Nazi dude. Just saying. BIDEN 2020
Join me and hundreds of others in signing this letter to Presidential candidate Biden- We need a #NoFirstUse policy to disarm from nuclear weapons!
He shows most early signs of it. This isn't about Trump's narcissism, which is equally obvious.  The difference is, biden has a condition that will likely deteriorate his memory. He may not even remember if he's president after a few years. That is more dangerous than a manchild.
This is the platform the democrats needed to cancel any debates with Biden! Wrong move!
Oops. I meant Biden signs💓
Oops. No Biden signs.
Me realizing I'm gonna have to settle for Biden because at least he won't literally use a gestapo to kidnap people
Because DJT  is a DERFA DERFA DERFA DERFA DERFA SHIT THE FUCK UP!!!!! BIDEN IS A WORTHLESSS PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!   #ImVoting4BidenBecause
We ask  what America looks like if Joe Biden becomes president...
I can see Biden just allowing China to push us around and not actually go to war with them...that’s the only country I can pucture having the balls to actually come to America
this article is from 2016, but I expect the Democratic platform has only gotten more extreme with Joe Biden openly admitting to supporting full-term abortion.
If Joe Biden becomes president, we will be in a war within the first 4 years. Screenshot this.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I'd rather fascism go back to a slow creep instead of an all-out sprint.  Fuck Biden.
Even though I voted for #Biden in the dem primary, I finally decided, based on Nancy #Pelosi's intolerable behavior, since she tore up this year's State of the Union speech in front of everyone, that I will be voting for #Trump.
How Biden threatens Trump’s fortune  He has millions from the taxpayers; his holding should be confiscated to pay back taxes and repay the taxes he stole.
As Biden says four Black women are on his VP list, here’s who he could choose  The only one who has a chance to make a successful run for president in 2024 is Sen. Warren. Otherwise, be prepared for anther republican president and that will be DTrump Jr.
Even Melissa looked surprised , But I'm not at all this guy needs to be on Biden's personal staff shining his shoes !
So he can get the war he wants, declare martial law, use the fear generated to fight the defund the police campaign plank by Biden and use all this to steal the election....with Russian help of course
Possible, or Biden as a figurehead is another option.I'm old enough to remember standing in line overnight to get concert tickets in January in Minneapolis. Standing in line ask day to vote for Biden would be a piece of cake.
No kidding...so some stupid white men don't like Biden's top choices...still not trump.
So than most people arent falling for the fox and cnn biden up 79 polls it seems. Well some twitter liberals are but probably not ordinary independents
The question was about religion and now Biden is talking about trains. #BidenWarren2020
I just heard Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren demand racial justice, explain politically and procedurally how they plan to get it done. And Warren laid out the specifics. I just donated again. #WarrenForVP
Not to parse words with the POTUS here, but... We aren’t safe right now.  The only way we will be less safe is: #1: 🤡 is re-elected #2: Joe Biden acts like 🤡  Almost all other outcomes are preferable to the 🤡 dumpster fire burning right now.
Biden doesn’t know where he is or what’s he’s doing!

Oof. Warren is a MUCH better speaker than Biden. #BidenWarren2020
Anything to avoid Sleepy Joe getting destroyed. This is something Biden’s handlers have nightmares about every single night.
why aren't you backing your delegates for #MedicareForAll and voice your opposition to Biden.  Unity is Healthcare for all, division is opposing it.
Biden knows foreign policy. We need a VP who will clean up the mob that has taken away democracy. THAT requires someone men fear, Kamala Harris. Otherwise, this will happen again. Male Hegemony is real.

Settle for Biden and vote the motherfucker out.
I'm not voting for anyone who doesn't represent the poor and working classes. So, no. I'm not voting for Biden.
4/  Here’s what would be great - for Congress and Biden to pass a bill that addresses all the abuses of power we’ve seen the past three plus years.  And hell, name it after Trump.  Make sure he’s remembered...but for all the horrendous things he’d have us forget.
Literally everyone knows that Biden is a rapist and a sex pest and we're still trying to get him elected president. What a country.
Joe Biden is not picking a Scientologist for VP. Anybody thinking he will probably eats crayons.
Biden +6.2  You have killed many, many people, that's what they say.
I still wonder if Warren could be a dark horse contender. She has done A LOT of events, and I recall the campaign saying she had raised the most money for Biden by far.
I get that there is a context thing about her her area of LA/CA, but I guess I’ll be curious how this is perceived by the various entities pushing Biden right now.
It would be incredibly funny if Karen Bass were actually the VP choice, and Biden's campaign had no idea this clip existed.
vote biden save america is a thing? i hate everyone. fuck that guy. y’all think voting is gonna save us. tell me which one of our systems saves us. please. i’m listening.
Not just not allowing the old boys to get control, but the whole thing is just an unseemly, then bending shitshow like the Afghanistan review (that Biden managed?).  If he wanted to name a woman then he should have just... named a woman. This is a joke now.
Ability to express passion in Biden’s VP is one of many charistics needed. Clear thinking, goal oriented, works well with staff and a clear leader are a few other desired considerations. He must also choose a VP that can carry on after 4 or 8 years as a president. Tough choices.
Vote Biden on November 3rd.
bho is motivated, marxist operative, vocal critic of sitting President; intent on fundamentally transforming the United States, barely 60; developed DOJ, FBI, other Exec agencies, CIA, courts to hinder the duly elected successor..and dnc fields a guy like biden  he's not a memory
I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.
Love Kamala. Wanted her to be VP or AG for Biden. She's smart, driven and she can definitely do the job.  That said...I don't care if Bidens running mate is a sock puppet doing Star Trek cosplay....I'm still voting for him cuz that orange MFer needs to go.
She’s gonna he Biden’s VP
hmm. Does Biden suggest you inject disinfectant into your body to prevent covid? Does he think American soldiers took back British airports during the revolutionary war or that windmills cause cancer? Trump has cognitive and mental health issues and you know it.
I know a little bit about oppo research and I have to think any competent campaign screening running mates does more thorough research, and yet this information is... unknown to Biden? Unimportant to Biden? I don't know which is worse.
Biden doesn’t brag about being able to identify an elephant or count backwards from 100 by 7. FYI, they don’t give that cognitive test unless you’ve shown issues.
That concerns me that Biden, like Obama, will just want to turn the page and try once again "to work with Republicans."  Some lessons never get learned.
Get ready for an avalanche of Biden attack ads which of course will all be lies.
Joe Biden is gonna WWE style swerve everyone and be like "BARBARA BOXER!"
Biden has been credibly accused of rape. He has also inappropriately touched women and girls on camera dozens of times.
Biden should do it like those Publishers Clearing House ads in the 90's where like some people show up to your house with a giant check and balloons saying IT'S YOU and then you go crazy on television.
would be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.

The biggest difference between the 2020 election and 2016 isn't that Trump's popularity has changed so much as Biden has a much lower negative rating than Hillary (38% vs 55%).
But Joe Biden is trying to gaslight us into a reality where only he is right. H1N1, a far less lethal virus, the Obama Biden admin saw 50 million cases- they had to stop testing.
But i thought biden was up 58 points. I thought everyone loved him.
Someone on here said that we're voting for our next opponents, not our player characters, and that's really helped me come to terms with Biden.  I can spend 4 years prodding Biden and whoever is his VP.
And just wait for the msn headlines. Trump getting crushed in early voting. Biden on the verge of a landslide. Bank it
My birthday is in a month and this year I’m asking for Joe Biden to drop dead!
Yeah. It’s going to be very hard considering what leaked to not take an historic moment (for the love of god, Biden’s pick better be the first female VP) and assume the worst if it isn’t Harris.
there's nothing proving they have moved polls and the majority of people enamored of them were already voting Biden. If anything, they're taking invaluable resources away from senate, house, and state races Dems desperately need to do anything of consequence with a Biden admin
“DRAIN THE SWAMP ON NOVEMBER 3RD!”  Quite the endorsement of Joe Biden! I agree! #Biden2020
I don't feel great about donating to Biden, but if  is his VP I'll not only feel better, I'll donate more.
What about Biden? He’s aleays doing something goofy with young girls. #HairSniffer
“ i agree to that, you know the (smells child’s hair, grabs little girl chesT)  thing, . Pancakes.”  Joe Biden   - your next world leader?  😂😂😂😂😂
It's a PPP poll, so assume a couple of points house effect in Biden's favor, but this is consistent with Trump having very little chance of swinging MN. Trump only just beat Romney's 2012 numbers in a good year for him - the shift in the suburbs is enough to sink Trump here.
Remember four months ago when you said it was irresponsible for Biden to say that Trump would try to move the election?  That was funny.
Biden can’t pick his own nose. His mind is gone. I take no joy.  Just shocked tha this is the BEST the dnc can offer..
BREAKING: Florida 17-yo charged with Twitter hack of Obama, Biden, other high-profile accounts  A Florida teenager has been charged with carrying out the hacking attack on Twitter in mid-July, in which the accounts  politicians, business leaders and celebrities were taken over.

This what Trump wished for A revolt by his supporters if he lose,  If Biden Gets Mail-In Vote Advantage, Majority of Trump Voters Say They Won't Accept His Win: Poll
All Biden has to do is seem generally centrist, and not the nightmare socialist Marxist nightmare the GOP suggests he is, he ought to pick up even more support. At the present, he's still a caricature to a lot of right-wingers.
Under Biden’s leadership : 50 million of H1N1 cases. They had to accept how unprepared they were and had to stop testing. Joe handling Covid = millions of deaths
Oh if ONLY that were at all true about Biden actually going even an inch left.

Is biden even bothering to spend money in ohio?
Whoever Biden pics will be awesome, I have no doubt.
Its always been close.a biden plus 14 leas with a dem + 12 sample was a 6 point biden lead in reality. But people dont take the time to look at that. They just take the poll as gospel.
In a democracy, no one should be a kingmaker. I hope that Biden doesn't want to be one.
“Before Mr. Biden’s transformation, the question facing voters was 'Do you support Donald Trump?' The question now is, 'Are you willing to endanger the economy and your freedom to KEEP the Trump presidency?'”  Fixed it.
“Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa...said Ms. Demings, too, would have wide appeal because of her former career as a police chief.”  // That isn’t appealing.  Especially since Val Demings presided over a brutal department.
This is actually one reason that I think Warren will be the pick. I don't think Biden wants to decide the course of the party, and I'm not convinced that Warren will run in 2024. If she commits to that, it could be an incentive to Biden if he really doesn't want the coronation.
Kamala sucks, but the Dems who don't want her to be VP suck even worse.

People who think politics is a sport can't see this, but electing Biden won't fix the country. It's not a game where winning the election is the goal, like winning a championship. Stopping the arsonist doesn't put out the fire.   To fix the country, you have to fix the country.
If Biden loses it will be most likely due to this attitude.
Wild how Biden is essentially describing himself 12 years ago.
She's an obscure (to me) congresswoman from a Blue state. How does this help Biden get elected?
Enough with the pundidiotry. Whoever Biden picks will be thoroughly awesome, and we don't need highly-paid headgamers to talk them down and spread arm-waving pearl-clutching before anything even happens.
I'm really looking forward to President Biden (and maybe Vice President Harris) giving a barnburner at the 2021 White House Correspondents' Dinner.
Dick Cheney supported gay marriage when President Bush was opposed.  Joe Biden supported gay marriage when President Obama was opposed.
This might be giving them too much credit, but what if Trump’s team is expecting to lose and are using the authoritarian playbook now so it’s tainted with TDS drawback once Biden uses the same approach?
Yes. Warren gives Biden a higher margin than his own supporters. Biden/Warren 2020: 'Let's Do This'
For my friend here it really makes no difference since Biden and Trump are both ruthless imperialists. Actually on that matter Trump might actually be *slightly* better than Biden, who's indistinguishable from a neocon when it comes to foreign policy.

Yeah-Biden should pick someone who does no harm-he's leading by a lot, and there's no reason to take a risk right now, or assume you need one in the future.  The obvious choice is Harris in virtually every metric-pick her and let's get on with this.
Arguing over who Biden should pick as his VP is absolutely pointless, everyone said picking Biden was going to hurt Obama...so who GAF?   Just vote, Trump needs to go.
Awe, the Trumper can't answer, instead he has to deflect and avoid.  That is your acknowledgment that you KNOW Trump is mentally deficient, thanks.  As for Biden? Absolutely, more important? He doesn't need to be given one on a regular basis like Trump apparently does.
generally republicans have no concept of what a liberal is or wants. they see gasmasked people clashing with police in the streets and they're like "look how much these people love joe biden!"
She was my presidential pick as well. I still hope to see her serve the Biden admin in any capacity that helps fix this Great American Trauma and hold the entire trump shit show accountable.
Joe Biden is a Bull Connor + A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
Remember when Harris declined to support mandatory school busing *one day* after selling a bunch of t-shirts calling out Biden for opposing busing? 😂
Sleazy Uncle Joe?  Bribing Biden?  Does he even remember what day of the week it is?

I agree.  He will not be at a Biden Inaugural
Extremely unclear to me how picking a former prosecutor unpopular on the left whose primary appeal seems to be to older people who already love Joe Biden would "capitalize on the moment" in any respect, but you do you
Past that, it's clearly Warren who is the more successful national politician, with the greater appeal to groups skeptical to Biden, whose policy expertise also happens to be exactly what Biden needs right now. But they're the two candidates who meet the basic test of credibility
This will put me at odds with Warren Twitter, but I really think the only two VPs that Biden really ought to be considering at this point are Warren and Harris. The vice presidency is not a bureaucratic role - it's a political, executive role. He needs a high-level politician.
I'm willing to bet Joe Biden will make make the Trump tax cuts permanent within the first year of his presidency (if he wins).
Huh, imagine having to "accept" two candidates who lost despite winning the popular vote.  #TrumpMeltdown #Election2020 #vote #trump #VoteBlue
People loved Obama and Clinton too, and they were terrible for the working class and POC, as Biden was and will be. But keep telling yourself they care. They don’t.
My .02 on Biden's VP pick is that it should either be Harris or Duckworth. Every other woman on the list is either too unknown or has too much downside.
I think the issue i see is that we will hear rhetoric from Biden camp that we will all hate as they will still use the criminalization versus asylum seekers lens. But i hope we can try and push after the election when Biden doesn't feel the need to assure folks about crime.
This is good news! It means they’re confident that Biden is going to win. They only care about deficits when Democrats are in the White House.

I still ultimately think Kennedy wins this, but if Markey pulls this off, you have to wonder where Kennedy goes next. Unless Warren is the VP next week, his only real options are in Biden’s cabinet as taking on Baker will be too difficult.
Biden is 78 years old. He may well be entering office in a second great depression and devastating pandemic, maybe after serious electoral civil unrest. "Everyone gets along with her" doesn't seem like it should be the main criterion for his VP!
Stop the whinning &amp; admit government over the last 40 years has failed with the USPS. Don’t blame Trump who has been in office for only three years.  How long have you been in office, Vindictive Nancy, Bribing Biden, Crying Chuckles, Lying Schiff, Nutty Nadler? Lunatic liberals!

Just like anyone on the left, Biden is rooting against anything that represents progress with America. Very sad to witness.

The Onion’s version of Joe Biden is more grounded in reality that Fox’s version of Obama.
All trump did was destroy a wonderful economy built by Obama and Biden.  He destroys everything. He went bankrupt owning casinos.  Who has ever done that before in the history of business?
Biden must win and it must be by a substantial amount. Keep up the good work  and others to vote Trump out.
Unfortunately, Trump has, with his rhetoric, created a situation where anything short of a landslide will create chaos. If Trump wins, Democrats will cry “suppression” or “foreign interference.” If Biden wins, Republicans will cry “rigged” and “voter fraud.” 1/2
Biden win is priced in, up, because less chaos.
🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m sure as hell NOT going to vote for Joe Biden
But was there discussion if Smith then would also win it if Biden does?  She only lost it by three in 2018.
Elect joe Biden. Obviously
What will we do after Biden is sworn in?  Is he capable of getting thtough the swearing in ceremony?  Only way I’d vote for Joe is if Tulsi Gabbard is his VP.  Knowing she would be president within a minute.

because liberalism is a deep rooted infestation and leftists that compromise with liberals find themselves retreating back into liberalism and away from leftism.  "harm reduction" only counts if its actually demonstrable. Biden's history in government is not that.
Hey i am no expert just going off what guys like larry say. Then my kid says lots of kids he knows may just take a college gap year off and freshman likely wont be in dorms. You guys know the numbers and I dont . But i just assumed biden had hired smarter people.
If what larry says is correct and the youth vote is down 30% i dont see how biden can win. I put alot of faith in larry but who knows.
Exactly i was thinking sophmores and above. But with no rock the vote, etc freshman will not register. No katie perry showing up with a biden shirt on campus. No taylor swift concerts on campus. Nobody walking around campus.
It’s sad to think this man wasted 8 yrs of tax payers money doing nothing. He could of done something great to bring people together. He divided us to the point where we are now. How dare him and Biden for blameing President Trump for their own cowardice behavior.
So, let's just talk about all the things Joe Biden will do as our new President. Pay no attention to the man with the orange face...
Biden already said it's gone if he gets the senate.
This guy is SLIME and should have been removed from office!  Trump is SLIME and shouldhave been removed from office!  Joe Biden is a decent honest man and you run this POS shame on you CNN!  Go after the truth Trump is a traitor!

Every time this comes up, I remember how Bernie was going to destroy senile ol’ Biden in the one-on-one debate. Then that didn’t happen, and everyone complained about wily, shrewd Biden lying about his record, so I guess he has good days.

Firstly this time Biden blew everyone else out of the water, there was no contest, Keep Crying And Respect People Will And u saying Hillary and Joe are Same? GFOH, Blind hatred is Dangerous
Yup, Lee would be too much of a risk, since the entire point of rigging the primary and Biden running was to prevent any sort of leftward shift.
Honestly I think Biden is gonna win easily in three months. Democrats overcame some of the worst gerrymanders and took the house in 2018, and trump has only gotten worse since then so it’s unlikely he wins at this point
They don't have an angle on Biden or Obama, because they're both just people trying to do a good job, which puts them in stark contrast with the current administration.

They will do whatever is politically expedient and makes them money, once marijauna producers start a superpac for Biden, he will make sure they can bribe him properly.    They just need to find some other way to fill their prisons with slave labor.

Joe Biden's campaign was often mocked but his social media team seem to really know their business.
The U.S. one-party state, as depicted by the actual Democratic National Convention website. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Immune systems didn’t exist before Donald Trump. Obama and Joe Biden  and the rest of the Deep State hid the discovery of immune systems, which humans had lived without for 5,400 years, since Adam, Eve and dinosaurs walked the Flat Earth.
Biden can go to a funeral but cant do a one on one debate? Come on how does he sell that.
Awhile ago I would not have said this. It  may  seem odd  that   I feel sorry for Biden.  I don't want him to win mind you.  But it seems like people are taking advantage of a man with dementia.  If true shame on the demonrats.
Biden should show up at a debate, dispel this notion with one question answered.
The U.S. one-party state, as depicted by the actual DNC website. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
So do you think they can fully hide biden another three months? Also do you think independents will not eventually wonder why biden keeps hiding? Kind of seems to have worked so far but its still summer.
Nobody has ever skipped a debate before. If the public gives biden a pass on thay there really is no hope for future elections. I mean if you can skip debates without any consequenses why even have them?
hiden biden? ahhhh...no. not in a million years would i vote dfl!!
ugh, the Biden team’s strategy of just staying on the sidelines and letting Trump destroy his own chances at re-election is almost certainly gonna work
his other arm isn't moving ... maybe Biden should challenge him ... lol
I see the aftermath of a bigger picture. Full of empty promises. We gotta stop looking celebrities as political figures. Our young black ivy league alumni has done more for prison reform than Kanye and Biden combined
This isnt about just Karen Bass, it's about all the other "Veepstakes" events where the Biden campaign thinks that having contenders 'kiss the ring' by putting together mega-donor events is still a normal and acceptable thing to do in 2020?  Take this shit back to 1960
I call it a toss up at this point. Polls show Biden ahead but we're 3 mo out, he keeps sabotaging himself, and republicans just vote republican.
I live in Minneapolis and I'm seeing Biden ads on TV. Not sure why  doesn't report that.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?
He took the best economy in the history of America, created by Obama and Biden, and burned it to the ground.
Dissent among Bernie’s supporters because of the deal with Biden
Its anazing biden willbe able to avoid debates with likely any consequenses. I dont know trump can win agaisnt somebody who will never ever be vetted or exposed.
It will not be BIDEN BOTTOMS 😂
I mean if biden wins the country is over and those voters will be to blame. They will have fallen for a dementia patient radical.
Looks like we will be saying Madam President, who would he rather have Biden or Pelosi?
• Since there is no legal way for Trump to unilaterally delay election, red states are simply counted as having 0 votes • Biden therefore wins by the largest landslide in US election history because no red states' votes were counted • Republicans dig their own graves I guess
Best case scenario that won't happen but would make me lol:  • Trump announces that he is delaying election • Blue states continue with election anyway as prescribed by federal law • Blue states overwhelmingly vote Biden • Red states follow Trump's orders and delay election
So, should Biden step on all this great news for Trump with VP pick tomorrow? Or let America stew in Trumps failures over the weekend and reveal it on Monday?
It’s my job to educate a Qnut?  Treason is for Trump allowing a US enemy like Putin to pay cash to Taliban to encourage them to kill more of our soldiers. Bribery is forcing Zelensky to announce Biden investigations in exchange for weapons they badly need to fight Russia. And (1)
If Biden wins with mail-in voting that’s rigged? If Trump wins with mail-in voting it isn’t rigged?
Here's my thought: Biden needs someone acceptable to progressives but with a background that makes them palatable to moderates. Of that list, Tammy Duckworth seems to be the strongest to me. I think Harris will probably be it, but Duckworth is compelling.
They looked presidential even if they were each responsible for millions of oil war, and drug war deaths, sort of like Biden, a useful idiot for the status quo.

It's hard to tell what prompted his original tweet as I haven't said shit about Biden in months?  But it seems to be tied to my tweet about my protest art. Which prompted a wholeass thread.  Never mind that a bunch of these pieces are things literally handed to me at protests.
Countdown to Joe Biden!  💙🇺🇸

Maybe Biden will hire this guy to dance for him..
Counterpoint: it's unlikely the nature photographer from South African/Canada with a lot of Twitter followers will be made Secretary of Commerce under a Biden Administration.
Listen. I'll vote for Biden. But, has the big tent party of the Dem party become too big?   I don't feel seen or represented by Dems.    Look at where Rep. Collin Peterson is on an ideological map. He's an R and I have to be in the same party as him?   Need a multiparty system.
You’re telling me Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the best we got to represent our country? Someone say sike right now
“My Statement on the 55th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid” by Joe Biden
Biden isn't that bad. You're just biased.
I'd be OK with a Biden landslide.  I'd be very OK with that.  Hell, I'd be ecstatic with a Biden landslide.
Sounds like this guy outta get back into politics...wouldn’t be the first Pres to transition to another national government position.  Senator?  Biden’s first Supreme Court nominee?
If Trump loses, there won't be any rebuilding for a LONG time. Democrats are Communists. It'll be the last election where votes are actually counted. Notice how China doesn't hold elections? One party rule ad infinitum. The party picks it's leaders; like DNC will pick for Biden.
ya know what else is good to do? check your privilege. i can't believe actually said voting for biden is the same as voting for trump.  what the hell are you smoking?
If Biden wins the election can we also impeach Trump and evict him in November?
Senile and a bit too Coo-co Joe  Biden Gets Confused Again, Doesn't Know What Year it is: "In the 2020 Census, Which is Now Two Censuses Ago"           (VIDEO)  via
I own mine. I say all the time I was Never Biden since the Thomas hearings. Even after all that, Biden is still better than Bernie or Trump.
Good LUCK with THAT! Many of my Republican friends are "Riden with Biden!"
Trump is so scared of Biden he doesn't even want the election to happen.
I don’t think he said he was voting for Biden.....I’m sure he’s not that dumb 😉
I am just waiting for a biden  blow upor something that damages biden. Still waiting though.
It's harsh to say it in that way, though I understand that you are addressing people who wanted, presumably, Bernie. I wanted Bernie, but I have been impressed by Biden's maturity. Biden is working closely with Bernie, previously his competitor, to develop policy initiatives.
Pretty sure we'll know who won on election night, when Biden takes Texas.
For what? He hasn't broken any laws unlike Biden who did exactly what Trump was falsely accused of in the impeachment hoax.
Good luck. The real criminal is Biden but I doubt they would find him competent to stand trial.
That isnt a morale crusher.  I get far more worried seeing trump down 6 and 7 points is polls he is usually very close in. All i read about is everyone switching to trump yet the gap once again seems to be going the other way . Just baffling to me biden could be up in legit poll
Why would you support two people who have spent a lifetime throwing black people in jail. Biden is a racist and Kamala is a sell out by your own standard.
Clean Water Action is excited to endorse Joe Biden for President.  Joe Biden will work to restore the environmental and public health protections that the Trump administration has gutted over the past 4 years

N.M. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham builds profile as Joe Biden looks to make VP pick.
I think the trump campaign has done a terrible job and im losing hope this week. Biden has skated for months and has not been vetted. No rallies at all. No real message. Covid has been a dream for biden and trump is letting them control the narrative . Time is ticking away fast
making a twitter account called gay joe biden
Desperately need Biden to earn some media!!! Otherwise 45 will dominate.
in 96 day we will be laughing at why Biden picked u!!!!
If people are dumb enough to blame trump.for this they will get the dementia joe economy they deserve. So far its all worked out for biden. Not one news event yet that has damaged biden. He is a horrible candisate but he has really even needed to campaign. Time is dripping away
That number for Biden and Peters would  VERY good if it pans out like that in #MI02.  In 2016 went fot Trump by 17.5.  If Biden and Peters are within 2 points there...
When does tRUMP replace Biden?
Joe Biden does Zoom
Your president has led us to a 32% plunge in GDP. Biden isn't the issue here, ma'am.
Why didn’t joe Biden deliver eulogy?
What can be done if red state electors give their electoral votes to Trump even if Biden wins the state?
YES. I’m a white dude and I’m gonna be crazymad if Biden chickens out.
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm  via
Biden is a nightmare.
What will you if Trump wins? What will you do to conservatives if Biden wins? Will you really chopping off conservatives heads? Could you really do that and be ok with it?
What do you say to the babies that are aborted? "Too bad, but I voted for Biden"?  NRA members aren't breaking the gun laws. People that commit crimes with guns are breaking gun laws, and they often obtain their guns illegally.  Why do you want to punish the innocent?
Who do you think delivered the nomination to Joe Biden in the South that turned around his campaign?  Demographics matter.
Very true but will voters blame the govs. I reallly thought it would be mostly gone by now. Covid is the only thing biden has to run on period. So far its worked out perfect for biden.. He hasnt had to do anything.
Based on how piss poor every Democratic governor has handled the pandemic excuse me if I don’t think Biden will do a good job either
"Biden can't pick Warren, her demands are too extreme," say the pundits, as Biden and Obama spend months edging towards positions Warren has held for years.
Trump suggested that the Nov. 3 general election be delayed, something he has no authority to order. His GOP sheep quickly rejected that idea.  COVID-19 makes it too dangerous to vote, but no option to use absentee voting?   #FreshTopics #NoElectionDelay
I do too!  Joe Biden will help us back through this mess and get our country back on track!  And Joe will work across party lines to get things done...a change is coming and it’s so welcome!
Black women GAVE Biden the candidacy.  They are the backbone of the D party!  They need and deserve to be represented.   Black and Brown folks make up the D party!  An all-white ticket is not representative.
It wasn't unfounded though - &gt; it was pretty easy to imagine Trump would do this based on his past behavior.  Joe Biden just made the simple observation and columnist like yourself couldn't believe it.  That's the problem w/ going out a limb for Trump, he always fucks you
"It's highly unlikely that the general election will be postponed or canceled." #Election2020 #electiondelay #votersuppression #VotebyMail2020
I thought biden was up by 67.
Biden is 4% in your poll. This should be very alarming to every single American.
There was plenty of evidence they rigged the primary in favor of Hillary. Don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover that. I may be an echo chamber I guess but Trump is a hell of a lot more right about how to do this election than Biden. Mail in voting would be a disaster.
Biden was selected to reassure racist white liberals, a subset of that category including Wall St.
What will it take for us to finally send Bill Clinton to a farm upstate? And to think, y’all think Biden never stops gaffing...
I am just worried the economy has now stalled. Dems really have done a good job hiding biden and doing everything to hurt the economy.  Plus trump really hasnt gone to the american people yet weth a firm agenda and there are 0 rallies.
I was thinking that Biden would announce his running mate tomorrow to dominate the airwaves all weekend, but news is so devastating for America and Trump, Biden may let that bake in for the weekend. 🤷‍♂️
It's gotta be hard being THIS wrong so much of the time. Poor, misguided Jonathan Turley. What a clown. #Biden
Comedy coming from a guy who got pushed aside by Joe fucking Biden 🤷🤷
But last I checked Dems are the ones getting busted for fixing primaries. So it's really not that awful of an argument. See Bernie/Hillary primary 2016 it's not that hard to see they literally did whatever they could to get her in. They'll stop at nothing to get Biden in too
Biden, three months ago.
Step 1: receive first batch of damning internal polling data predicting Biden landslide  Step 2: realize you’ve hitched your electoral fortune wagon to traitors in bed with CCP &amp; the Kremlin  Step 3:
BREAKING: Legal "Scholar" Jonathan Turley Takes Dump On Self About Biden's Accurate Prediction of tRUmp's Election Hacking  WASHINGTON — Alleged law school "professor" Jonathan Turley once again crapped the bed by falsely claiming that Joe Biden said tRUmp would "unilaterally"...
I believe mail in voting could be the biggest scam of all time. Only way Biden can win imo. Trump is not wrong.
I am soooo ready for 'nothing to fundamentally change' under a Biden presidency. Such anticipation.
Stop gas lighting, stop deceiving. Biden did NOT say or imply that tRUmp could unilaterally stop the election. He merely predicted (accurately) that tRUmp would "try...somehow." What a disaster you have become.
Question: Why not quote Biden's actual words? Answer: Because you are a LIAR. Here's what Joe said: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held. Imagine threatening not to fund the post office..."
National Task Force on Election Crisis  #Election2020 #Biden #Trump #ElectionDelay
I completely understand you not wanting to lose her because she's on top of her game and is a strong female that knows her community. She has a great resume. Biden picking her would be a strategic move but time will tell.
But get over yourself.  Because any hope to achieve any goal you thought possible with your favored candidate would not be possible under Trump.   Biden may only get us part way there but at least his train isn’t going in the wrong direction and toward a cliff.
Yes, Biden &amp; Democrats must feel the loss.
If you are so far to the left that you see no difference between Trump and Biden then you have a problem.   Trump barely registers as a human being.   How can you be so blind to not see Trump as the unique danger that he is?   Biden may not be perfect,  he wasn’t my first choice
Joe Biden is the best of the dnc?  A child groping, hair sniffing, woman molesting, demented corrupt fool - is the best the #dnc can put forward?   His possible running mate -  a corrupt prosecutor who ignores exculpatory evidence?
like a fine aged milk
Excellent. Okay to use?
Biden didn't say he was going to unilaterally, or that he had the power, he said he was going to try to do it. Are you unable to tell the difference?
Yeah, not going to happen like that. Biden administration will not hold Trump accountable.. If you wanted actual accountability,  you should have supported Bernie.
His time would be better spent in Georgia, FL, or TX as examples, because Biden will win PA.  But on top of being super-spreaders, Pence and Trump's campaign are incredibly stupid.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
This is the 1st time I can honestly say you're nervous that Biden is winning this election.  Why is it that you're nervous?
That’s really happening? Jesus Christ... I’ld rather vote for Biden, and already plan on not doing that. The fuck?
It says Hotel Gitmo. Why are they treated so well at Gitmo? Lock em up! Obama is in there. He was just on TV with Biden last week. Do you recognize many?
Yes, I believe that is the case. I hadn't thought of the delay in decision being out of respect for John Lewis. That's a very good reason to delay, I respect Biden for that.
Isn't Biden announcing her tomorrow? Sen. Kamala Harris, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Rep. Val Demings of Florida, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham have been named as top candidates on his list🤔
Yes, pretty much anyone could pass it.  I wonder if Biden could.  And another very important thing, he signed an order that brought drug prices down. That may not matter to you but it affects millions of people and should have been handled by our congress a long time ago.
This tweet is from April, and the conspiracy theory he's referring to is Biden insisting that Trump is literally going to try to steal the election.  And what do you know? Trump is sending troops into cities, and now he wants to postpone the election.
settle for biden... i absolutely hate it here
I hope people don’t try to use that as a co sign either because I honestly don’t care who wins the presidency lmao. But I feel like I just know trump got it in the bag 🤷🏾‍♂️😂 cuz who tf voting for Biden.... or Bloomberg?
Burying John Lewis today, Trump tweeting about delaying the election...  truly feels like America is losing its soul.   Please vote in November. I don’t care if you don’t like Biden. We have to vote for him if we want democracy to survive.   PS here’s my project today:
I need Biden to stop delaying the announcement and say it already.

Maybe. I'm waiting to see what kind of role Yang plays, and how policies i care about most, #UBI, #DemocracyDollars, and #HR1 play out. I will change my mind if i see a Biden admin totally ignore this while governing.
Its tough. Politics is hard work, and you have to weigh a lot of things. The tide turned when rep Clyburn endorsed Biden in SC. He won very big there, and that in turn got over 17 million people to vote for Biden in the primary overall. I also can't deny that happened.
Uh, pretty sure he said exactly the opposite. In a free &amp; fair election (the way we’ve conducted elections for centuries) he believes he’d win. He said in this hurried &amp; unverified mail-in ballot election w/ alleged room for fraud he believes Biden can steal an election. 🤔

Yes, sir. This Blue Star and Gold Star family is heartsick for a good man like Biden. He will protect America and protect our troops.
Today tRUmp tweeted a proposal to postpone the election. Joe Biden PREDICTED it: “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held." When can we expect your retraction and apology?
You don't get to delay election day just because you are losing.
REMINDER:  Joe Biden is receiving classified intelligence briefings   😈
Nah, you not acknowledging you were talking out of your ass about chinese imports was what made you a clown-- this is just really weak sauce use to say Biden is in it with the Chinese. In the end I don't think he'd green light muslim concentration camps-- so that's good by me.
I think Biden cares about people.  Biden wouldn’t waste time during a press briefing on COVID deaths to play a video about how great he is or brag about his TV ratings.
This didn’t age well, did it?
I'm a working class guy from a working class background. I oppose capitalism and tyrannical government. While I generally consider myself a "democratic socialist," Trump and Biden would both surely dismiss me as an anarchist. So, #IAmAnAnarchist
I would highly encourage everyone to read this article game playing possible scenarios for the presidential election. Just don't do it right before bed, if you want to sleep
I have an idea!  Start with your family, then move to your admin, Congressional R's &amp; Bill Barr.  Use tear gas and and brutality if you want.  Anyway, that would keep you busy until Nov 3.  Then Biden and the new LEGIT AG will clean up the rest!  (The Kingpin!!)
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
I don't even know what's real and what's a Twitter joke anymore. Is Biden actually orange now? Is there really a Settle For Biden campaign? I don't know, man.
overwhelmed.
IF BIDEN WAS PRESIDENT WE WOULDNT ALL BE COMMUNICATING IN CAPITAL LETTERS.
Where 👏 does 👏 Joe 👏 Biden 👏 go 👏 to 👏 get 👏 his 👏 apology 👏
Half the states go along? They're red states and they don't get electors then, and Trump loses.  Trump doesn't leave? President Biden sends in federal marshals to arrest him, or the army to open a path through the vermin Trumptards.  SCOTUS won't approve of Trump's whining.
This is some sexist bullshit..Too ambitious? Give me a break. One does not succeed in politics being a wallflower. Biden needs a warrior and here she is. #BidenHarris2020
I’ll settle for Biden because frankly I’ve settled my whole life
Biden said, “Mark my words” and you did.  Good job!
Biden is not well!
yes, the republican controlled senate will do the bidding of...joe biden, the democratic candidate for president.
So... that Biden number is a tough one to reconcile.  That would probabily be consistent with Biden winning the state by something in the 18-point range. Sure, the undecideds are probably disproportionatly Republican (makes sense give the MN-01 ballot test)
A truly elegant wrap-up to these past 4 years would be both Trump and Pence disabled by covid-19 by election night with President Pelosi looking after things until Biden's inauguration.
So why not just delay the election? You support a psychopath. You don’t have to like Biden or the left but your loyalty now speaks volumes of your character, moral compass and integrity. Once a fan of yours. Now disgusted.
This is.. not a good look.  What’s going on here? Who’s the young woman? Why is she leading the former VP as if he doesn’t know where to go?   The media helped amplify conservative criticism of Hillary’s health in 2016, but have allowed Biden to go under the radar.
Now that I think about it maybe delaying the election isn’t a bad idea because I think I’d prefer Nancy Pelosi over Joe Biden anyway.
Who do you feel can better help the economy re-emerge from current point—Biden or Trump?
OMG - here he goes again. The man lives outside the rules and the laws. He’s downright dangerous. He must be removed from office. 96 days...  via
In fairness, I think thousands of people have made this prediction, so not that impressive of Biden, but does demonstrate that he understands how corrupt the president is.
via  oh HELL no you don’t.
I halfway think the story was cannily planted by team Biden to get positive backlash in her favor
This is the third #MN01 internal we have gotten this summer. Feehan’s internal in June had him up 1, Hagedorn’s June poll had him up 16. The new one today is from the House Majority PAC (D) and has Feehan +2 and Biden +7.
This aged well. /snark
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
Nice hit piece, Brian. Biden absolutely needs to pick a VP that could step into the role of President. Harris is that person.
Where's Hunter Biden?
"The president’s disadvantage in the suburbs is underpinned by his longstanding weakness among white voters with a four-year college degree, who back Mr. Biden, 57-31, in the suburbs."
The question you should be asking is whether the Democrats will accept defeat if Biden loses in November.  Remember:  it was the Dems who said Trump was not their President; pushed obstruction &amp; resistance; and put the country through $32M Mueller investigation.
What a bunch of crap!!! Kamala has been my pick for VP before she even dropped out of the race. Let her help Biden get this country back to humility, grace and fairness and then in 4 years we'll know if she is ready to be the 1st women president!!
The only brainwashing here is what the rising DNC Socialist Democrats have obviously done to you. Trump is an "outlier"...he is not a traditional politician. That is why many politicians, including some Republicans, do not "like" him. If you want Biden...RWYS!
Just have the community organizers keep watch for them. Biden said himself that police are the problem, why would he want them there then?😁
NOW LET'S SEE BIDEN DO THAT.
Many Trump supporters will secretly vote for Joe Biden, because they don't want their deplorable friends to know...
If biden gets elected you will really see dark times!     Trump 2020
True of Biden too, however.
I voted for Clinton, got blamed when she lost for 4 years, and liberals have no one to blame but themselves when I don't vote for Biden. They've learned absolutely nothing, and I don't think they're actually capable of it. The dem party needs to burn if this country is going to
and Biden is going to send unmarked vans after me
and Biden is threatening to do the same as Trump with Anarchists as of yesterday. Both parties either want us dead or don't care if we live, why would we vote for someone like that?
I believe WHOLE heartedly that if #Biden didn't think he could do the job COMPETENTLY that he would step down and let someone who did and I believe he will put all of the RIGHT people in the RIGHT places &amp; hopefully we can begin to repair our country from the #tRUMP DEVESTATION!
Dems on Susan Rice as Biden’s VP: Are We Sure About This?
The day Joe Biden will announce his vice presidential pick will be watched all over the world. Why is the world interested? Maybe history in the making.
Remember when people said Al Gore was too ambitious? Yeah, I dont either. It's insulting that a man said this about a woman AGAIN as it feels too Hillary. Havent people learned? Biden needs to say get on board or here's the door. It's his choice, not theirs/ours for that matter.
This isn't a problem of an enthusiasm gap anymore. Biden doesn't bore me. He terrifies me. It terrifies me to think what will happen when the Dems no longer even make a show out of resisting the feds (not that their meager resistance was ever that convincing).
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Tuesday that he will announce his vice presidential running...
I mean, I am it really pro Biden at all except as a binary option with Trump
I am much more anti pre meditated murder then pro Biden.
Elect Joe Biden as ournext president on 11/3/2020 and save our country!  Stay well America the nightmare is almost over!
That is only a problem if her plan is to win as VP then murder Biden to take his place.
Frankly my dear...I don’t give a damn!  Whatever is wrong with him I just don’t care!  Let’s tell DJ Trump we WILL elect Joe Biden as our next President!  Could be fun😎
The vaccine for Trumpvirus is Biden 2020!!!
yes, that is the reason why anyone ever accepts the vp.  why else would you do it?  why the fuck do they think Joe Biden did it?  are they implying that he shouldn't be running now?

No, seriously, just wait for the FUCKING ANNOUNCEMENT. MSNBC does not have influence on Biden's choice.
Everyone needs to just relax and wait till Biden announces. Be prepared to not be happy or to be overjoyed.
What everyone is concerned about is Trump contesting the election and preventing Biden from being sworn in.
That's been my philosophy the whole time, too. I'll take the hits for doing everything I can to defeat Trump, supporting Joe Biden, etc, but why should I expect the Ds to care about my choice for VP?
The rioters wont stop they will only get worse. Biden doesnt like cops.
Did Biden have to pay for his son's cougar girlfriend like your dad does?
Exactly!  Biden has negatives, sure, but he doesn't engender the visceral hatred - or in some cases, just the lack of enthusiasm leading to voters staying home - that Hillary did
Wanna bet Biden thinks he’s voting for Hillary this cycle?
Happy I looked at Twitter today; liking that Biden has links to more info. Still learning how Twitter works/what one can do (my first Retweet with comment)💕. My first Retweet from an anti-masker should have comment: Hilarious mix of anti-masker comments with rebuttals/links.
Joe Biden the presidential candidate of the future 😂🤪🤣
If Biden described federal agents in Portland as outlaws I’m confident we’d all understand he isn’t calling for it to be legal to kill them in the streets without trial.
I’m utterly confised on how “ambition” is considered a negative? I’m all in for Biden/Harris.
Continued censorship also guarantees a Trump win. There's no path for Biden to the White House.
Biden broadcasts that he plans to select a VP based on color and sex, that makes him a sexist and a racists. Select candidates on skills and what they bring to the office. If you disagree that proves you're a hypocrite.
So in this scenario you've made up in your head, how many times has yang tried what he's currently trying? Multiple times? I had no idea that Biden was already president before, this is news to me!
We will see what happens. We are also in the middle of this thing called a Pandemic, which has been horribly mismanaged by our federal govt as well. This is a different scenario than before, and Biden actually has some good policies to rebuild.
When Biden wins and Trump won’t leave I pray it’s a squad of Afghan vets that walks him out...
She will not excite the Progressive left.  We don't want Kamala the cop for VP.  Biden is bad enough.
Self-important doners whining to journalists is not actually news, it happens on every presidential campaign and this story tells us nothing about who Biden will pick.  But Twitter likes to fight about it so it becomes a top story and journalists will seak to emulate it.
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
It’s ok you can admit you’re describing the average Biden voter
This article is a scary read. (But you should all still vote!!!)
This is not a given! Biden's a whole lot better than Trump, but administrations of both parties have been screwing up fair housing for a half-century. The racial equity plan released by Biden yesterday has MAJOR fair housing defects.
This coming from Biden’s campaign manager. So he doesn’t share the same views as some of his allies perhaps?
What job in the Biden administration are you gunning for Pete?
Yes - elderly - yes. They’re being lied to by Fox News. And us Biden people still have our humanity. Let’s not lose it.
Biden's campaign better rid the naysayers. We need all positive vibes.
This.  Whoever Biden picks will be awesome.  Whoever Biden picks will be used by Russian trolls in an effort to divide Democrats.  Don't fall for it.  Whoever Biden picks will be awesome.
I wouldn't make too much of this but, what the hell, it makes good grist for social-distancing water cooler talk! #KamalaHarrisForVP
Too ambitious? Dont you want a VP who wants &amp; is able 2 do the job? Maybe they're right because George HW Bush and Al Gore never wanted to be president.🙄 Biden better rid himself of all the campaign people who dont want Kamala or they'll be an albatross to the campaign.
That Joe Biden email from Warren Democrats... it’s got me all goosebumpy. Not sure how to feel yet. On one hand, yeah, duh. That’s the obvious for the email. On the other, solidarity either way. Ffs, just tell us already
Know who else was ambitious and still wanted the top spot when they settled for the VP spot?  Some guy named Joe Biden 🤦  this is a ridiculous argument that I hope isn’t true and actually being bandied around behind the scenes.
Or, this is smart politics because if Biden chooses Harris, he’ll come across as his own man not afraid to make the bold, smart choices.
Can we stop saying..me included let’s vote blue and instead say let’s ELECT Joe Biden on 11/3/2020!  Let’s shout it out so Trump will hear his name Joe Biden our soon to be President!
If biden wins, they will ban homeschooling.  I fixed it for you.
Cuz biden is such a prize.
This is apparently real. It's not actually by the biden campaign, but it's apparently real.
Biden's campaign mgr!!! 🤣😂😆🤣
Seeing the crowd we can understand why Biden can still hold Rallys during a pandemic.
The  doesn't want ANY of #SusanRice but they can PRETEND like she would be a good choice for them if they want to! No matter WHO #Biden picks to run as VP the  will lie about them anyways because facts DON'T matter to them at all! #VoteThemAllOut
2. It was a competition. And maybe Biden came out stronger. Maybe Biden should have a little difference of opinion from his VP. These things are not exclusive of collaboration.
"Some remain bitter about her attacks on Biden during primary debates last year, saying they bring into question her loyalty to the former vice president. Others argue that she's too ambitious and that she will be solely focused on becoming president herself."
Consider attending Joe Biden for President’s event, Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with former US Attorney General Eric Holder:
I think the DNC is worried that on election night, she will ambitiously tell everyone about Biden's dementia and make sure he has to step down before day after election sunrise.
Maybe it's Russian hackers!?!? Not Biden supporters. Sound like a thing they'd do.
poll: conducted Jul 23 - 25 shows Biden leading by 5%: 49.2% , 44.2%
I hope Lincoln Project and Joe Biden hammer him to the ends of earth for this.
hidin' biden basement biden where's hunter  The mainstream US media is... whatever is weaker than worthless and impotent.
I think biden will lose but you really think the dems nominated somebody they knew would lose?? I mean with the supreme court alone i cant see them picking someone who will surely lose. I think alot of them think he will win and win big.
Biden does NOT need help with Allies - he is known and respected already , even before VP spot.
This sounds like someone is trying to hurt Biden and divide Democrats against each other.  shouldn't be helping them so much.
I mean maybe more with Biden and actuary tables I’ll be interested in who he picks, but basically as long as I believe they could be president... who cares?
"Anarchists should be prosecuted."  — Joe 'Good on Personal Freedom' Biden
How many VP picks actually matter? Cause frankly all I remember from Obama picking Biden was that he handled Palin well and beat Paul Ryan so badly on TV I was waiting for a corner man to throw the towel.
Agreed. Feel free to impeach Trump again in the meantime. You know Barr is going to try to arrest Biden in October, right?
Excuse me? We’re not pandering to the Republicans, here. I don’t give af if they give  money or not. Same goes for conservative wealthy Dems.  is Biden’s BEST chance of solidifying the office. Without her he has a 50% chance at best. FU the old boys club
Don't spend it all in one place, ok?
TMZ with the breaking news:  'close up picture' Joe biden notes highlights Kamala Harris as first bullet point in today's speech. suggest she could be picked next week.   if it is kamala Harris this will be an historic moment for black woman in America.
Biden isnt winning texas
A cabinet post in The Biden administration.
I know it hurts biden imo
Thread: Republicans are trying to prevent you from knowing how series the Russian threat to our elections is. They insist that revealing how much Russia is trying to hurt Biden would be "partisan."
If alot of colleges arent open biden will lose. The youth vote will not come out for him especially since there wont be people one campuses breathing down your neck to register. In theory they could vote from home but many wont be engaged and will probably just forget.
When...is Biden going to announce his VP running mate? Dr*ump announced P*nce in mid-July 2016. Obama announced Biden late August. The election is so soon and yet...so..far...away.
Biden is still winning. Texas has been a Red State since 1980, until now. Texans have wised up up to Trump's playbook: deflect, deny, lie
I watch these  ads and almost every time I think “am I a Republican for Biden?”
Luntz will be calling biden the winner at 3pm based on exit polls done in miami  and pittsburg.
Then you can wear a MAGA mask or a Biden mask, whatever you want. If you're worried about being attributed to a party you dislike that is. More to your point, yeah masks got politicized, but they aren't supposed to be. you should probably still use one though.
So which of Biden’s running mate choices would have the most sway in Florida?
Like...when Biden was VP?
Disqualifying: “Trump himself on Wednesday told reporters he believed Harris would be a "fine choice" to be Biden's running mate.”
Why should I vote for someone who just yesterday said I should be prosecuted for being an anarchist? Jfc this is 2020 not 1920, I'm not voting for Biden's anti-leftist Saturnalia of Oppressions.  Joe Biden is an A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
Pretty ballsy of Joe Biden to run for president like 100 times and lose 99 but okay Harris is "ambitious"
Further, Joe Biden is married to a woman with a doctorate... so he’s clearly not put off by high achievers
#GOPBetrayedAmerica by never once doing a single thing to get the Trump admin to do right by America.  #GOP need to lose every seat. I'll settle for minority status in both branches/elect Pres Biden   It's still breathtaking how much they let down their country.  #AmericaOrTrump
If Biden gets elected, there will never be another pipeline approved.  Doesn’t this increase the value for the existing ones?  Not to mention cash flowing assets in 0% rate environment should trade higher anyway.  $ET $EPD $WMB are nice value buys
I think folks are focused on Biden’s VP announcement b/c they know it’ll be the last thing of interest his campaign will announce all the way up till Nov. 3rd.
Duck this nonsense
Now that the ball is in motion, can it be a) stopped/reversed if Biden is elected? b) completed before Jan 21?
I truly don't GAF what any previous trump voter has to say about why they've decided to vote for Biden this election.  They were fine with the GOP and trump until RIGHT NOW.   I'll take their votes, but they aren't allies, they're rats deserting their sinking GOP ship.
It's a little troubling that people in the Biden camp would come out and say this in the press. It makes me worry about infighting.
Won’t matter when Biden loses.
Good luck expecting joe goddamn Biden to do anything meaningful to prevent climate collapse.   Key word meaningful
oh for fucks sake  not you too?  seriously - biden is not worse than trump - to say so is fucking laughable. your ability to spout that nonsense shows your privilege.   go fuck yourself.
Biden said I should be prosecuted for my ideology. So...no-the-fuck-thanks on that one, squirt.
Yesterday he literally said anarchists like me should be prosecuted. Why in the fucking hell would I support that?  Joe Biden is an A. Mitchell Palmer Democrat.
I remember Joe Biden jogging around and greeting parade watchers on July 4th, 2019. He looked very alert and fit.  I hope he still is.  As for Trump, we are watching a stunning, possibly fatal, barrage being delivered. Bone jarring blows. Will he remain standing? That *#%#* Cult.
... like Biden did?
That's good. Here's my 2011 attempt to do draw something similar in Kentucky. This district game Obama/Biden a 2.4% edge (and a majority!) with nary a precinct in Jefferson (Louisville) or Fayette (Lexington) Counties. Guessing it gave Andy Beshear a slightly larger win in '19.
You're going to pretend Obama didn't convince Buttigieg, Steyer, and the Klob to drop and endorse Biden the day before super tuesday? His aides have already said as much.
I'll assume she's not planning to murder him in his sleep and instead would focus on becoming VP by working her ass off to achieve a stunning economic and public health recovery, allowing 82yo Pres. Biden to campaign hard for her and then retire. Seems like a safe assumption!
That's serious privilege when you stomp your feet and demand that Biden does what you want or else you won't vote for him  Knowing full well that you will not be one of the people who will be thrown in a cage, have your reproduction rights stripped away, will still be employed
If ambition is disqualifying, Joe Biden will not have a running mate.
With Biden talking about prosecuting anarchists it's exactly the time.
Love how you Dem faithful want us to pretend bad shit wasn't when perpetrated by Biden and Obama.
So they're rooting for Biden? If they were tilting things the other way you would deny it. Even rely on it.
Biden will win here double digit. Remb he is not Hillary and even Amy Klobuchar got more vote than trump or Hillary had a midterm election. Let that sink in. GOP does not have the numbers here
Like you said if it comes down to young voters biden is toast. U of minnesota just announced 70% of classes will be online.
The only way your right is if the president is Biden. Beside Amy Klobuchar is very popular here and even the gov. Ask the average voter here about the riot they blame trump even though that’s not true
Andrew has been nothing if not pragmatic, he's said he's "pro civilization". He's not just backing and voting for biden because of that contract. Sorry, not sorry.
litterally the only faith i have in biden is that if he wins our country will be a little less overtly fascist, i think the trump administration showed how truly evil some of our fellow country men can be, and i dont think a presidential change will change that fact
Republican "allies" would call her a fucking bitch and move on. Biden needs to shut this down and tell his "allies" that nobody needs this kind of "help."
Your decision obviously, but Yang seems to be going pretty hard in the paint for Biden if you've read his last few emails at all.
Like Nixon and Bush Sr and Biden before her?
Oh my gosh Biden might pick a VP that is ambitious and wants to win?  We all agree that Hillary's choice of VP was much better a boring white guy who apparently had nothing else on his mind, and it showed
But i thought biden was up by 38 points
Here’s the thing, I WANT a VP who is ready to be president and who can WIN in 2028. These Biden ‘allies’ are not being very strategic. 🤔
So like ... Joe Biden?
Harris is the obvious best pick. She is the BEST runningmate for Biden. I’ll support whomever he picks, but if she doesn’t get picked for this reason, these allies are sexist, pure and simple.
Yeah, cause Joe Biden, Al Gore, George HW Bush, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon’s obvious presidential ambitions clearly cost their presidential runningmates. 🤬
Kamala Harris is a terrible pick for Biden (politically) and if true is 100% a function of Dems needing an establishment person on the ticket, who they can trust, because Biden might not finish his 1st term.
They talking about Joe, I've wanted to be president since I was seven, Biden's VP choice?
Biden demands Trump stop retweeting unfounded coronavirus claims from 'crazy woman'
I think the idea is that she would distance herself from controversial Biden policies as VP.
Great point. Trump. HRC and Biden as our only choices in the last four years is utterly tragic for the United States of America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. We need such higher quality of people to run for office.
lmao as opposed to former vice president joe biden who has been *actually* running for president for 30 years
So, what is the date for the Biden VP announcement?
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
She’ll be focused on becoming President if she is VP? Gotta tell ya, given Biden’s age, I don’t see that as a bad thing.
To be clear, I want Elizabeth Warren to be VP in no small part because I think she will ambitiously pursue her policy agenda and perhaps a post-Biden presidency. Donors are idiots
Team Biden is doing a great job cranking up the drams and milking this for maximum coverage.
Higher taxes when getting back to work. Come on Bernie. I hate Trump and like Biden but $600 extra a week is stupid.  $31200 more a year?? If you meant to say month, then ok.  Unemployed people should not make twice the median salary in America. Sorry.
No one in Minnesota cares about Biden.
Frankly, given Biden’s age, a vote for him is also a vote for his VP candidate to become president. Hope he chooses well.
Obama and Biden must go to jail for abusing their offices!
So funny when  minions bring up sexual assault, as if it’s a good selling point. You really want to compare Biden and trumps sexual assault history? Not even close. I’ve only seen one of them with their arm around Epstein and Maxwell. Than there’s the lawsuits.
It's human nature to veer towards the negative, so let's take a moment to think about the positive............ BIDEN WILL WIN THIS ELECTION!!!!!!
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Biden picked Harris. Our memories are short.
On this, we agree.   1/31/20: the president declared coronavirus a public health emergency &amp; issued the ban on travel between the US &amp; China. Campaigning in Iowa, Biden criticized Trump’s travel ban, saying, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia.”
From the article: battleground states of Arizona (Biden +7), Colorado (Biden +13), Florida (Biden +3), Georgia (Biden +1), Michigan (Biden +10), Pennsylvania (Biden +7), Texas (Biden +2), Virginia (Biden +10), and Wisconsin (Biden +7). AND still losing I’m MN. What a LOSER!🤣🤣🤣
What if I'm not interpreting Biden's statement as "bad" but rather as part-and-parcel of Biden's longstanding political tendency to punch left? What if teeing off on "anarchists" has been in Biden's playbook since literally his first days in Congress?I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.
Also, she’s beautiful.
In retrospect, Joe Biden was exactly the right candidate. He's the one Democrat who absolutely can't be tied to the far left.
Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.
They were just in Minnesota.  Fuck!
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
I hate Biden, I'm not voting for either tbh. That said, if you think Trump has any chance at winning if the election was held tomorrow, you don't understand what people are going through. He has failed, and people are angry.
But that horrible Joe Biden who wrote the crime bill and locked up everyone and now wants to make crime legal was almost defeated!
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
This is why we need the percontation point. It would be so much better if we could write, "I'm sure gonna be mad if AOC murders Biden to death⸮" and everyone realized we were not serious about whatever we were saying.
I just can't do it anymore. Someone please lock this guy up with Obama, Biden, and Hillary.....Please!
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
So we need a president who isn’t Joe “I don’t want my kids growing up in a racial jungle” Biden, got it.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
I mean, to be fair, Biden’s policy is a lot more sound and detailed than trumps, no matter how you look at it. His goals are clear, and they mostly align with democratic beliefs. It ain’t too hard to get
Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.
My hot VP take remains that I will vote for Biden if he picks literally anyone for VP.
Vote for Biden? #BirkluvsTrump
Well, Joe Biden certainly was willing to share his notes. He just did it old school.
Watching cartoons is a much better use of your time at this point. Trump, Barr, et al, are fencing a hell of a reckoning this year and they know it. The childish antics, looting of the US Treasury, will ramp up until the Biden Administration, D majority Senate takes over in Jan.
Yea trump killed 150k people (that died of COVID and nothing else I’m sure),  New York didn’t kill half of them in LTC facilities either that was trump probably too. He didn’t ban infected China either, Biden did that. #Trump2020 #Hydroxychloroquine
He should have pulled a Biden and just started laughing at them.
Close.  M will be VP.  Then after election, Biden will be declared incompetent. M will be sworn in.
Oh no Biden came out against anarchism, this will end his presidential campaign, because Americans are hungry for anarchy, I read it on Twitter.
Given that Biden is specifically campaigning on expunging records, nah.
Does it include future quotes from public officials about the school openings? Note the Politico announcement included a quote of Biden referring to his pick of Harris
This has since been scrubbed from the Politico article  but thanks to  wayback machine, we know this wasn't a photoshop; Politico really posted that Harris is Biden's VP pick announced in future on Aug 1:
As long as you're not voting for Biden.
Nothing Biden ever did brought down costs
Biden can bring his own people. They protect him like no one else can.
I can't believe I wasted my time with this. How disrespectful this clown act was to the Taxpayers of this Nation. Topped off with Biden's Q &amp; A act.
Joe Biden should go for a full rat tail. He's getting close. #JoeBiden
Biden is a 47 year fraud and a liar. The Democrats are growing desperate, They are now supporting organized chaos in our cities and getting innocent people killed. They will lose and lose big in November. #Trump2020Landslide
Also, and I mean this, Biden is experienced enough not to let that moment affect him. Politics ain't beanbag, and it was a debate. And in debates, you get called out. Harris did nothing wrong, and Biden deserved to be hit.
If he ever hopes to pull in a larger proportion of the Democrats he has to play the politics. You can tell he's playing too because there is no passion behind his posts about Biden, just robotic statements
Good job listing the DEMS accomplishments in 2020. Enjoying your Biden preview are we?
But why wouldn't Biden want a direct conduit to the CCP installed on his staff's phones?
Why weren’t any of these “issues” solved under Obama and Biden is what I really want to hear the answer to. Somehow made up words like systemic racism only exist if orange man bad.  Wage gap, this, all explains by people choices. Good choices - good life.
This guy is questioning Biden's judgement.
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Except this likely wouldn’t happen to Biden if he became president, since he already has policy which would directly help these communities. Part of the reason these happened in the first place was due to trump not addressing key racial issues (ex: disproportionat covid deaths)
What a senseless thing to say. 45’s entourage are dropping like flies with Covid, and you question people who are being cautious? Vice President Biden was there to honor John Lewis. Some were not.
Joe Biden wants to cut social security and disability and Medicare and Medicaid. How will that work out for you? The retirement age won't exist if Joe Biden is elected.
I saw the show it was amazingly alarming. Somehow that message has to get out to the general public nobody realizes what might happen if they elect Joe Biden. That would be the end of our country as we know it. They would take all the rights away from the people in the suburbs.
If Biden wins, it may not be rioters and terrorists being pulled into vans. It will be your children instead.
Unbelievable Biden is even on the radar for the democrats...
President Joe Biden Will Have the Palestinians' Back – and Israel's, Too
It makes you a black pedophile. Remember, if you don’t vote for Biden, “you ain’t black”! 😂
Free speech, extreme yea, don’t support it but free speech. What she said is true though, enjoying your preview of Biden socialism yet are we?
CNN Polls: Biden leads in three key states Trump won in 2016
Yup. If anyone was actually paying attention after super Tuesday, you could tell that Amy was Biden's first VP pick.
My husband's a custom cabinet builder/woodworker. He spends everyday talking real loud and clear to all the tradesmen he works with(whether they want to listen or not) about Trump's mishandling of literally everything and why the country needs Biden. He knows we need their votes.
Biden lost my vote when he wrote the 1994 Crime bill, said “Poor kids are just as smart as white kids”, “You ain’t black if you vote Trump”, doesn’t want to end qualified immunity, wants to ban assault rifles, pedophile, racist. Damn do I need more?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yes, but it's different because Biden is not Bernie.
Oh yeah that one. "Vote for Biden and gramma will get snuffed out" meanwhile all these "Biden's America" images are from literal Trumps America
If you vote for Biden, things will be just like this horrific hellscape, which is [checks notes] happening right now.
And I assume he’ll use footage from Trump’s America to stoke fears of this hypothetical Biden’s America, because understanding irony has never been a strong suit of his.
Because he's laying the groundwork to start running ads claiming that Joe Biden's mental state is deteriorating.
Yes, losing. Have you seen not only the polls, but the state of the country? I hate Biden, but I can see that he would be crushed if the election was today.
Yes, they do.  Do you listen to Biden?
Creepy?  Really?  Now do Biden.
He literally says in this interview he turned down a Biden interview.
Things seen in comments today;  "Biden is a far-left wacko and I can't take anyone seriously if they don't believe this."  Dude needs to get out more.  Maybe stop watching OANN.
Chris Wallace told your dad, and proved him wrong, that Biden does NOT support defunding the police. You are a dolt and a liar. Runs in the family.
Biden leading in Lakeville.  By three donors, but still!
Firing ppl 4 political donations is bad. But ppl will misread this as being only reflective of the respondents. Trump is a narcissistic, incompetent, amoral grifter w/ authoritarian instincts.  Biden is a “normal” politician, like every other D&amp;R prez nominee in the last 44 yrs.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus Emcees Joe Biden Fundraiser, Says Donald Trump Is “Actually Worse” As President Than Selina Meyer #SmartNews
#mnleg MN GOP may need to rethink turning MN red....Fox Poll: "In MN, the only state polled that the president lost to HRC in 2016, Biden leads 51 to 38%. This includes a 26-pt lead among women, an 18-pt lead among seniors and a 12-pt lead among suburban voters."
Says the Man who's Mentor is Robert Byrd??? Please! When does Mr. Biden have to answer?
Blasting Trump is understandable and warranted.  Praising Biden is not.  He hasn’t even run a campaign, he’s totally invisible and when he actually does speak he sounds, frankly, senile.
“Poor kids are just as bright as white kids” -Biden
Trumps America is the right America where law and order are still important. The Democrats have no power left than to help cause chaos in inner cities, Funded anarchy. Your risking a civil war with an elected Biden. Trump is the anti establishment and the dems dont like it boohoo
One more thing for Joe Biden to add to his to-do list.  Move all of the fucking missiles.
I can’t believe all these Trump ads that are like, “this is what Biden’s America would look like”, while showing very real footage from Trump’s America. What is the game there? Does Trump think the rest of us have dementia too? People buy this shit??
Y’all are literally taking headlines out of the Trump administration and substituting Biden for Trump.  You’re so bad at this.
You’re right so one out of 30 he is innocent. Biden just leaned over close enough to smell her hair. Perv
O Biden was on Impractical Jokers.
They've been running commercials advertising "Biden's America" here nonstop and i'm all like "uhhh... that's already happening dude. Failboat"You honestly think Biden has a say in this?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Our country is in burning turmoil, and the White House is eagerly fanning the flames. If we are to have a shot at quenching them, let alone beginning to repair the damage left behind, we will have to play the two-party game to its conclusion in November."
I completely agree. That is why when Republicans keep calling Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe”, I tell them that after almost 4 years of the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump we’re tired. We could use a nap.
Same people polling saying Biden up on Trump by double digits. Same ones who said Hillary 90-10. Lol 😂
They can not except it. Biden can send out the troops. Not!!!
if i don’t stop getting emails from joe biden i’m gonna end it all
How come Biden didn't show up?
Trump doesn't use a teleprompter idiot. Have you seen one of his rallys, no teleprompter. Biden's going away in November, good riddance to the groping plagiarist!
No, but we would have to worry about Biden’s staff.  Everyone knows he can’t use a computer to tweet.  I can’t imagine anyone thinks his twitter page comments are posted by him
The election is already a cluster fuck. It’s only going to get worse. Biden will refuse to debate. Votes will get lost. My dead uncle will be voting democrat.
U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?
I do support Biden as the better of the two options available, yes.  Not my first choice. Do you really think some stranger on the Internet calling me mentally disabled matters to me? That’s hilarious. I feel safe pretty much everywhere thanks but thanks for the concern.
Kamala too bad this time you can’t sleep your way to the top. Biden only likes little girls.
I'm glad he's gone, Biden will be the next to go.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!
What does Biden's wife, a doctor, say about hydroxychloroquine?
I didn't realize Joe biden was the president and oversees this
Let's see Biden's wife, a supposed doctor, tell the American people that hydroxychloroquine doesn't work!
Biden is a groping plagiarist unfit to run our country
A Biden presidency won't help anyone except Hunter.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.
Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.
Joe Biden for President’s event, “Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with Attorney General Eric Holder” – sign up now to join! #TeamJoe
Hollywood created a feel-good moment at the Oscars where Joe Biden spoke about victims of molestation, rape &amp; respecting boundaries! Molested as a kid, it was painful to watch. Google "creepy Joe", see what he has done to people not reported by mainstream media! F*** Hollywood!
Donald Trump had to go against Hilary Clinton and then Joe Biden.  What is this the play in game and the first round of the NCAA tournament?!?!?!?!?!!!
Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.
Support Melania as Vice President to Biden!
Can you believe we are spending 5 seconds on this nonsense? It’s been 3 1/2 years. We are exhausted. VOTE and don’t tell me your sad, sad story about how Biden doesn’t please you on this or that. There are 2 choices. Pick one. That’s how it works.
It’s Biden. He needs a note to remember his own name.
Might move closer to the center though if guys like Biden are rewarded.  That’s my hope anyway.
That party gave you joe Biden this time.  Next time it might be AOC...
Oil and Gas Groups See ‘Some Common Ground’ in Biden Energy Plan
To win, Biden has to show that he isn’t a hostage of the disorderly far left. He needs to denounce rioting, writes   via
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Our cities are being ruined by Biden supporters and the main stream media is looking the other way.
Tell me something i don't know! Tell me when we win in November. Biden is going to prosecute the enablers. No healing the country bs no cumbaya bs just indictments all over.
Inslee thinks it's more important to bash Trump than to stop Seattle from being ruined by Biden supporters.
Biden 2020 put them all in cages.
If you go back like two years I tweeted that Joe Biden would be the president in 2020. Nobody listened to me because I tweet nonsense most of the time
Watch Mark Levin if you live in the suburbs. A vote for Biden is a vote for losing your American home in the suburbs.
Biden supporters are destroying our cities, it's time to take the gloves off and fight back!
Thank you thank you  for your response to Politico. I read it this morning and was so mad -  was right when she called out Biden during debate and has nothing to apologize for. We don’t want a president who can’t take occasional (and accurate) criticicism.
Trump has created jobs, has Biden created any?
They are clueless. Michelle Obama &amp; Jill Biden had causes &amp; were seen &amp; heard. Instead we got a FAKE anti bullying campaign &amp; an I don't care attitude. Probably planting a poisonous plant garden. Rappacini's Daughter.
What executive experience does Biden have?
Biden is no leader, what executive experience does he have?
Neither forwards nor backwards, Biden is gone.
That has got to be the MOST IGNORANT THING I'VE READ since 45 stepped into office. White privilege, right there. If you think Biden is as bad, you're a straight white middle class male.
Wallace does one interview where he challenges Trump on reality and he is Walter Cronkite.  Please.  He will be 20 times as hard on Biden, who has a longer record in government.   He can choose his interviewers.
This indicates the opposite of 2016. Voters seem to want to put a check on a potential 2nd Trump term than to put a check on Biden. People don't think of Biden as a prohibitive favorite like Clinton.
Biden's gone, he's not playing with a full deck.
Biden's scared of his own shadow.
I had no idea that Biden is a plagiarist and hasn't had any original thoughts or ideas.
Biden, HS graduation, BLM!
The world is looking forward to Biden’s leading the USA and restore the order and law for the World
Biden will lose because our country doesn't want a pedo plagiarist in the White House.
The real wasted vote is voting for the exact same thing that’s in office, but representing a different party.   Biden in literally the same as Trump except that he’s been in politics for almost 50 years.
Yup.....can biden even read that we know he can’t remember it? Great post!!!
So what, Biden will bail them out.
Biden is worthless, lets see him answer questions without a teleprompter.
Biden isn't playing with a full deck.
Ah, no.  Trump administration was investigating Biden foreign corruption before he was a candidate.  Video-proof of Biden demanding the Ukranian procecutor investigating his son’s connections to Burisma corruption be fired as a condition to receiving US foreign aid. BAM!
China must be held accountable.  Remember, Joe Biden and the democrats didin't even want to block travel from China in January.  The WHO told us all C-19 was not contagious.  China must pay!
And then there is Joe Biden supressing Latino vote in Florida.
Trump pardoning Alice Johnson from prison.  Biden sent 10,000 African American males to prison with his crime bill!
Trump behaved much better when he released Alice Johnson from prison.  And when he signed real prison reform.  Biden sent 10,000 African American males to prison with his crime bill!
Does Biden have a star on the Walk of Fame?
I don't think Biden is capable of writing a coherent sentence.
I doubt if Biden wrote this. There's actual sentences in the tweet.
You can beat Biden off?? You should rephrase.
Exactly. A vote for any other candidate other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
Place a mirror on this. What happens when Biden and the deep state refuse to accept their defeat?
Good time to remind everybody that the democrats called our president a xenophobe for blocking travel from China.  I wonder how many more would have died if Biden or Cuomo were president?  DiBlaiso was urging us all to celebrate St. Paddy's day in a Manhattan bar.  Shameful!
Biden will pick someone who won't complain when he gropes he/she.
No, Biden can do more
Really. During Obama's time Obama and biden refused the testing of the N1 virus. Remember this is a virus. You lie and mess with our freedoms. You will pay.
Remember   giving credit to Joe Biden for selflessly deciding rallies/conventions were not worth the risk to others MONTHS ago? Me neither. Thinking it was about the same time that Trump et al were mocking Joe in mask. Now Trump=he-man status for wearing mask twice.
He literally said they turned down a Biden interview
I wonder how this would look if it was all Democratic presidential candidates vs just Biden - I donated to a few but haven’t to Joe. Have prioritized that $$ for down ballot races
Biden can't even tie his shoelaces, he's a joke!
So true - Biden nice guy but no where the depth and range of Hillary- Actually very few people have her range
Bye Nina - you are done done over done!  We are on a new path with President Biden and you ain't on it!!
You vote for Biden because the threat to our democracy from Trump transcends all else.  Sitting out is essentially voting for 4 more years of Trump and enabling the destruction of our republic.
Biden never created a job or met a payroll. His main claim to fame was kissing Obozo's ass.
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS | Fox News
I thought Joe Biden was running for senate? So confused (as to why he is the nominee, thanks Obama🥵).
Wasn’t Biden berated by Trump et al when he made the decision to not hold a big convention or rallies? “Biden’s in the basement ring a bell?”Don’t remember Biden’s people having to come out and give a rah rah speech afterwards to stroke his ego.
Every person, woman, man, camera and tv is voting Biden.
Hopefully this is just the beginning of writing all these wrongs. When President Biden and his illustrious cabinet take their places we will finally be on the right track for this nation.

Same people polling saying Biden up on Trump by double digits. Same ones who said Hillary 90-10. Lol 😂
They can not except it. Biden can send out the troops. Not!!!
How come Biden didn't show up?
Trump doesn't use a teleprompter idiot. Have you seen one of his rallys, no teleprompter. Biden's going away in November, good riddance to the groping plagiarist!

I'm glad he's gone, Biden will be the next to go.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!

Trump would’ve beat biden if it wasnt for corona
Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.

Minnesota has voted for the Democratic nominee for 11-straight elections, but in 2016, the margin was the closest in modern state history.
Even if Biden wins (hopefully someone better in 2024) and dems get control of the Senate, these people will still exist and it honestly terrifies me. We need a huge overhaul to our education system. Teach people to think critically rather than just use school as job training.
I'm torn between wanting to encourage Biden to be better and not wanting to give folks inclined to find any reason not to vote for him or not to show up a reason to follow that inclination. Maybe I'll encourage him to be better after the election.
I understand that he's the Democratic candidate and all, but I don't understand why we're even talking about Biden. He's beside the point. I'm so excited to vote against IMPOTUS that I would crawl on my hands and knees back to Minnesota in middle of a pandemic to do it.
Where can I re-enlist? BTW If, heaven forbid, Stealing your tax dollars in my suitcase sized lunch bucket Joe I’m really only a half racist Biden wins in November, will he surpass Barack Obama as the most corrupt president in the history of the US of America. #ObamaBidenGate

Not a Paedophile like Biden!  If he ever touched, sniffed or stroked a child near me and I ever witnessed it ...
Good. If he tweets less maybe we can forget about him sooner. If the GOP really wanted him to win, at this point they’d put him into a medically induced coma to shut him up.  Biden doesn’t have to do anything to win except keep reposting that photo of him in his mask.
Republicans n Trump supporters please do not be worry about the president in this election. All we hv to do is go vote n encourage others to do the same. This country is tired of Democrats bad n scary policies and most of all Biden will not be president. Trump policies better.

We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Biden was the best of the best.  The cream of the crop that rose to the top.
Are you worried that all the dead people will vote for Biden?
i dont like biden but i would rather have an accused rapist in office than a proven one who also handled this situation terribly
I'm just spit-balling here, but I don't think Biden can activate the National Guard?
Since Biden is still within the margin of error in swing states, after a whole lot of centrism in his platform, he should just try a progressive idea, #MedicareForAll for example, and see what happens... he’s gonna try walk it back anyways, even if it polls well.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
So... If you look at the tweets and statements by  He has consistently, rightly and wrongly, said, "Obama Bad, Biden Slow and Bad" so look in your Conservative mirror and see that this is what we as a society have driven the political discourse to become.
Barely There Biden
Yes, polls show Biden winning by wider and wider margins but remember everyone said HRC was a lock-in. Then she wasn't.  And right now I'm watching Progressives who were going to hold their nose and vote Biden now seriously reconsidering that.
In a race where a literal fruitcake (the loaf) would win in a landslide, the Democratic Party has worked hard to alienate their entire progressive wing and are simply hoping people hate DJT so much they overlook Biden's enormous flaws.
I honestly think we're legit looking at a situation where Trump wins narrowly but the GOP gets das boot from both chambers of Congress.  Biden and the DNC keep doing themselves no favors in a race where they literally just have to not be crooked/say dumb things but keep doin it.
Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy
Why is better donating to Biden then trump tho. How does donating millions of dollars to Biden’s campaign help black lives. Also most of the protestors are anti police. That doesn’t help black lives either. Remember before Covid black unemployment what about all time low...
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Both presidential and senate races in AZ are quite close.  So easy for Trump/McSally to distort what is happening in the streets.  Hope Biden and Mark Kelly have a good message to turn AZ blue in November.
Since when am I a trump supporter tho. Certainly like him more than Hillary or Biden but that’s not saying much. Also the “neo-nazi” allegation makes u look ignorant. Also ur feed says otherwise. All American stuff
My biggest fear is Biden loses. But a close second is this exact scenario. "Scorched earth" doesn't even begin to cover it. Especially if the Senate flips and Dems hold the House.
They are clueless. Michelle Obama &amp; Jill Biden had causes &amp; were seen &amp; heard. Instead we got a FAKE anti bullying campaign &amp; an I don't care attitude. Probably planting a poisonous plant garden. Rappacini's Daughter.

Maga trolls: Biden is an old man who will be a puppet.  Hes told to be president and his advisers will actually be running the country. I'm lile totally cool with a group of presumably competent people running the country for for years.
DJT's brain is a pre-enlightenment model.  It doesn't do science or statistics or modern medicine.  You want those features in the Oval Office, better vote Biden.  🌊
Who would think violence in the streets would help the party in power? (think 1968)  You're right, though,   Everything is topsy-turvy in Trump world.  Gotta get the country turned right-side-up.  Biden 2020.
I completely second that. Sadly Biden won’t be any better but morally I cannot re-elect Trump
No, that’s what would happen if Biden wins! It’s the next guy’s fault! Or the previous guy’s!  Or that darn media!  Not the President. He takes no responsibility!

I'd like to say that voting in November will help.  But there are still the people who support 45 that we will have to deal with, and they aren't gonna be happy when Biden wins.
Exactly. A vote for any other candidate other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
We are going to Vote Orange Idiot out and begin to pick up the pieces or fail as a country. Biden is no way ideal but it’s a starting point for more progressive policies. It will be time to be constructive and put shit back together better than it was.
Important to do what we can to help Dems running for the Senate. Even if Biden wins the White House, it will be a hollow victory if Graham and McConnell are still running the Senate. If you have some donation $$ to offer, contribute to Jaime Harrison or

Trump will have no power &amp; Biden will be President. If he won’t leave the White House, he will be escorted out. Now let’s talk about the fact that there is no national plan to suppress Covid 19 &amp; more than 141,000 US citizens have lost their lives already. Trump is a failure.

Biden has his flaws - not the perfect candidate by any means. However, more than ever before, our country needs an empathetic leader. A leader to unite our country, not polarize it anymore than it already is. Great conversation and insight.
They've moved from blaming past Obama for now to blaming future Biden for now.Ope! And there were have it! A Trumptepreneur trying to school a "celebrity" who had his own opinion and a valued opinion at that!

Someone on here said that we're voting for our next opponents, not our player characters, and that's really helped me come to terms with Biden.  I can spend 4 years prodding Biden and whoever is his VP.
All Biden has to do is seem generally centrist, and not the nightmare socialist Marxist nightmare the GOP suggests he is, he ought to pick up even more support. At the present, he's still a caricature to a lot of right-wingers.
“Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa...said Ms. Demings, too, would have wide appeal because of her former career as a police chief.”  // That isn’t appealing.  Especially since Val Demings presided over a brutal department.

Biden cant inspire record numbers. The only way to defeat trump is to reject and refuse to nominate unelectable racist joe. We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble joe
Republicans are done. Biden reps the new “conservative”. AOCs crew is the new left. Trump blew their fascist cover. My kids and my kids kids will know that (if we survive) the Republican Party and their ilk are anti-American confederates to be as reviled as the Nazis.
Stop me if you've heard this one before-- poll shows Biden over-performing 2016 by ~6-8 points
Biden must win and it must be by a substantial amount. Keep up the good work  and others to vote Trump out.
Unfortunately, Trump has, with his rhetoric, created a situation where anything short of a landslide will create chaos. If Trump wins, Democrats will cry “suppression” or “foreign interference.” If Biden wins, Republicans will cry “rigged” and “voter fraud.” 1/2

CW: joe biden's abyssal stare
because liberalism is a deep rooted infestation and leftists that compromise with liberals find themselves retreating back into liberalism and away from leftism.  "harm reduction" only counts if its actually demonstrable. Biden's history in government is not that.
It’s sad to think this man wasted 8 yrs of tax payers money doing nothing. He could of done something great to bring people together. He divided us to the point where we are now. How dare him and Biden for blameing President Trump for their own cowardice behavior.
How would the DFL cheating propel Biden to victory? He needs a lot more states than Minnesota to win.
It’s a Biden administration as a third Obama term, and the Hillary character has Warren’s voice, but it’s sorkenized and on some kind of crraaaank
What on EARTH are they thinking with Madam Secretary other than to lathe of heaven like insert a Biden Administration into our collective consciousness?
They will do whatever is politically expedient and makes them money, once marijauna producers start a superpac for Biden, he will make sure they can bribe him properly.    They just need to find some other way to fill their prisons with slave labor.

Trump tries to con at every corner &amp; fucks it up a lot. As he tries to lay groundwork for a fraudulent election just wait until he has his minions cast bogus votes for Biden &amp; either they get caught in the process or forget to challenge those votes making the landslide larger.
Being in pubic health, you may be in high demand!  By next year Biden will have established full public funding for contact tracing and other public health activities. Your industry should be flush with cash come Feb 2021.
As if Biden wants an African American woman as his VP.
Regardless of ones party affiliation or who they want to be the next president..can’t we agree that a major party candidate must submit to live interviews, press conferences, Q&amp;As...? The press hasn’t done enough to hold the Biden camp to the fire for not engaging..
Did you apologize to Biden in this piece?
crazy Joe biden
hiden biden? ahhhh...no. not in a million years would i vote dfl!!
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?
Good LUCK with THAT! Many of my Republican friends are "Riden with Biden!"
Trump is so scared of Biden he doesn't even want the election to happen.
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm  via
Biden is a nightmare.
There was plenty of evidence they rigged the primary in favor of Hillary. Don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover that. I may be an echo chamber I guess but Trump is a hell of a lot more right about how to do this election than Biden. Mail in voting would be a disaster.
But last I checked Dems are the ones getting busted for fixing primaries. So it's really not that awful of an argument. See Bernie/Hillary primary 2016 it's not that hard to see they literally did whatever they could to get her in. They'll stop at nothing to get Biden in too
BREAKING: Legal "Scholar" Jonathan Turley Takes Dump On Self About Biden's Accurate Prediction of tRUmp's Election Hacking  WASHINGTON — Alleged law school "professor" Jonathan Turley once again crapped the bed by falsely claiming that Joe Biden said tRUmp would "unilaterally"...
I believe mail in voting could be the biggest scam of all time. Only way Biden can win imo. Trump is not wrong.
I am soooo ready for 'nothing to fundamentally change' under a Biden presidency. Such anticipation.
Stop gas lighting, stop deceiving. Biden did NOT say or imply that tRUmp could unilaterally stop the election. He merely predicted (accurately) that tRUmp would "try...somehow." What a disaster you have become.
Question: Why not quote Biden's actual words? Answer: Because you are a LIAR. Here's what Joe said: "Mark my words: I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow; come up with some rationale why it can't be held. Imagine threatening not to fund the post office..."
like a fine aged milk
Burying John Lewis today, Trump tweeting about delaying the election...  truly feels like America is losing its soul.   Please vote in November. I don’t care if you don’t like Biden. We have to vote for him if we want democracy to survive.   PS here’s my project today:
Yes, sir. This Blue Star and Gold Star family is heartsick for a good man like Biden. He will protect America and protect our troops.
Today tRUmp tweeted a proposal to postpone the election. Joe Biden PREDICTED it: “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held." When can we expect your retraction and apology?
This didn’t age well, did it?
overwhelmed.
Biden said, “Mark my words” and you did.  Good job!
A truly elegant wrap-up to these past 4 years would be both Trump and Pence disabled by covid-19 by election night with President Pelosi looking after things until Biden's inauguration.
This is.. not a good look.  What’s going on here? Who’s the young woman? Why is she leading the former VP as if he doesn’t know where to go?   The media helped amplify conservative criticism of Hillary’s health in 2016, but have allowed Biden to go under the radar.
Who do you feel can better help the economy re-emerge from current point—Biden or Trump?
I halfway think the story was cannily planted by team Biden to get positive backlash in her favor
"The president’s disadvantage in the suburbs is underpinned by his longstanding weakness among white voters with a four-year college degree, who back Mr. Biden, 57-31, in the suburbs."
Just have the community organizers keep watch for them. Biden said himself that police are the problem, why would he want them there then?😁
NOW LET'S SEE BIDEN DO THAT.
I believe WHOLE heartedly that if #Biden didn't think he could do the job COMPETENTLY that he would step down and let someone who did and I believe he will put all of the RIGHT people in the RIGHT places &amp; hopefully we can begin to repair our country from the #tRUMP DEVESTATION!
Dems on Susan Rice as Biden’s VP: Are We Sure About This?
This isn't a problem of an enthusiasm gap anymore. Biden doesn't bore me. He terrifies me. It terrifies me to think what will happen when the Dems no longer even make a show out of resisting the feds (not that their meager resistance was ever that convincing).
Should I catfish a trump supporter? I'll pretend to be a 50 yr old white man w/ an "investive property" and a lot of blue jeans. I'll turn out to be a small Mexican man, who's super pissed that he's gonna have to vote for Joe Biden
That's been my philosophy the whole time, too. I'll take the hits for doing everything I can to defeat Trump, supporting Joe Biden, etc, but why should I expect the Ds to care about my choice for VP?
Exactly!  Biden has negatives, sure, but he doesn't engender the visceral hatred - or in some cases, just the lack of enthusiasm leading to voters staying home - that Hillary did
Biden broadcasts that he plans to select a VP based on color and sex, that makes him a sexist and a racists. Select candidates on skills and what they bring to the office. If you disagree that proves you're a hypocrite.
What job in the Biden administration are you gunning for Pete?
Yes - elderly - yes. They’re being lied to by Fox News. And us Biden people still have our humanity. Let’s not lose it.
Or, this is smart politics because if Biden chooses Harris, he’ll come across as his own man not afraid to make the bold, smart choices.
Biden's campaign mgr!!! 🤣😂😆🤣
The  doesn't want ANY of #SusanRice but they can PRETEND like she would be a good choice for them if they want to! No matter WHO #Biden picks to run as VP the  will lie about them anyways because facts DON'T matter to them at all! #VoteThemAllOut
Consider attending Joe Biden for President’s event, Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with former US Attorney General Eric Holder:
I think the DNC is worried that on election night, she will ambitiously tell everyone about Biden's dementia and make sure he has to step down before day after election sunrise.
Biden does NOT need help with Allies - he is known and respected already , even before VP spot.
Biden is still winning. Texas has been a Red State since 1980, until now. Texans have wised up up to Trump's playbook: deflect, deny, lie
So which of Biden’s running mate choices would have the most sway in Florida?
Like...when Biden was VP?
Now that the ball is in motion, can it be a) stopped/reversed if Biden is elected? b) completed before Jan 21?
Good luck expecting joe goddamn Biden to do anything meaningful to prevent climate collapse.   Key word meaningful
That's serious privilege when you stomp your feet and demand that Biden does what you want or else you won't vote for him  Knowing full well that you will not be one of the people who will be thrown in a cage, have your reproduction rights stripped away, will still be employed
litterally the only faith i have in biden is that if he wins our country will be a little less overtly fascist, i think the trump administration showed how truly evil some of our fellow country men can be, and i dont think a presidential change will change that fact
Oh my gosh Biden might pick a VP that is ambitious and wants to win?  We all agree that Hillary's choice of VP was much better a boring white guy who apparently had nothing else on his mind, and it showed
So like ... Joe Biden?
I think the idea is that she would distance herself from controversial Biden policies as VP.
Frankly, given Biden’s age, a vote for him is also a vote for his VP candidate to become president. Hope he chooses well.
It's human nature to veer towards the negative, so let's take a moment to think about the positive............ BIDEN WILL WIN THIS ELECTION!!!!!!
On this, we agree.   1/31/20: the president declared coronavirus a public health emergency &amp; issued the ban on travel between the US &amp; China. Campaigning in Iowa, Biden criticized Trump’s travel ban, saying, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia.”
What if I'm not interpreting Biden's statement as "bad" but rather as part-and-parcel of Biden's longstanding political tendency to punch left? What if teeing off on "anarchists" has been in Biden's playbook since literally his first days in Congress?
As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden’s America
Minnesota is quickly becoming THE battleground state of 2020!  Biden’s lead is shrinking by the day &amp; now the race is a dead heat!  Proof that Minnesotans are ready to turn MN red, re-elect  AND retire  to her basement for good!
Why are you using the past tense of "tried" here? We're looking at an opportunity or you to do so right now, present tense.  I'm not "making an error" here. I held Trump to this standard, I'm gonna hold Biden to it, too. You should do the same.
Are you actually holding Biden to the same standard, tho? When Trump's supporters insisted that we were taking his words "out of context" back in 2016, did you give him/them the benefit of the doubt? Because I know I didn't.
Or that they're even Democrats. They're about to get served a cold reality in November that Biden can win big with a coalition that doesn't even include them. Let these self-serving leftist primadonnas do what they want. They're more trouble than they're worth.
you should be ashamed of yourself, but you don't have a conscience or a moral or ethical bone in your body! we who live in the suburbs, only worry about one thing, we want you to go away! #Biden #VoteBlue2020
Like I wrote just now, Trump's fans continually insisted that the plain meaning of his words was simply being taken out of "context."  I'm not "assuming the worst," I'm holding Biden to the same standards I held Trump. You should too.
YEP.  (Says the girl who ran a ridiculous meeting in the park by my house yesterday on letting teenage boys of color play basketball without harassment.)  And I both feel you &amp; feel absolute terror from potentially purple MN that a single person would sit out voting for Biden.
I also think people in CA are just differently situated, FWIW.  There is no world in which Biden doesn't win CA and significantly run up the margins.   So I think some of the elite strain you're rightly noting is also a screaming frustration at how CA is situated.
Biden will crush him just by using FACTS.
Yeah, I mean, I think the hospitalization stuff is conspiracy theory nonsense.  But I think we're on the same page that Biden is both not great and also markedly, comically better than Trump.  Perhaps partially because of the low bar.
What is Biden supposed to have done about the pandemic that he hasn't done?  I've seen him give a fair number of speeches and he's unelected.  (I am against Biden/Clinton/Obama foreign policy pretty full stop, FWIW.  There's massive differences in domestic policy land.)
With #Trump and #Biden our choices for President in 2020 have to be the shittiest since 2016...
Joe biden cant beat trump. We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble racist unelectable joe
Wish they'd all just get good &amp; sick enough to keep them out of commission for a while.  Say, until Biden's inauguration day in January.
has a great take on Biden. He isn't in the center or even center-left. He's in the center of where he thinks the party is...all the time. As it shifts, so does he. No need for him to justify change since he fits the narrative all the time.
everything will end november 4th after the idiots elect hiden biden
Then push the DNC to make legalization part of their platform and not just decriminalization.  This is where i still believe Biden is still out of touch with Americans evolving values.

Please take tbis picture down. As a Disabled person I am offended by your use of it. It is ableism. If you're not familiar with it, check it out right here on Twitter. Even Mr. Biden stopped using this pic.
So you just roll in with no prep in front of 20 people? Biden’s audience is literally millions and you suggest he wing it? We’ve seen where that goes. No harm in preparation, imho.
I cannot imagine anything Joe Biden could possibly do that would make him look even less competent and/or inept that the miserable excuse for a human being currently occupying the Oval Office.
Chewbacca vs. the Swedish Chef lol.   There won't be a debate. It'd make Biden look too bad.
Yes he is! Vote Biden!
I hate our two party system. republicans fuck shit up so thoroughly enriching themselves until there's no choice but to elect a status quo democrat... clinton, Obama, and Biden next.
Think of all we can do when Biden is President, when we grow our House majority, when we flip the Senate blue.   Think of all we can and will do.
And I heard the other day Biden might pick Harris for his vp and they will push a law and order agenda 🤣🤣how when they both want to defund the police and anyone who knows Harris said she was a lousy cop only wanted to push her own career plus she got a horrible face lift 🤣🤣
Hey  why does this article name Kamala Harris as the pick when nothing has been announced yet?

Biden cant beat trump no matter which woman he fingers as vp. His career of corruption, war, racism, homophobia anti union, anti environmentalism anti choice,  disenfranchises more of the voters we need to defeat trump than he inspires. We cant afford to lose. Biden cant win.

If people wear masks, they can meet closer than 6 feet so Mr. Biden can have meetings. But there are plenty of options. &amp; as others pointed out, he is familiar with other leaders &amp;is on good standing so even if some are reluctant to meet face to face, this won't be a problem.

No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.

It’s Biden. He needs a note to remember his own name.
Why is better donating to Biden then trump tho. How does donating millions of dollars to Biden’s campaign help black lives. Also most of the protestors are anti police. That doesn’t help black lives either. Remember before Covid black unemployment what about all time low...
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Both presidential and senate races in AZ are quite close.  So easy for Trump/McSally to distort what is happening in the streets.  Hope Biden and Mark Kelly have a good message to turn AZ blue in November.
Since when am I a trump supporter tho. Certainly like him more than Hillary or Biden but that’s not saying much. Also the “neo-nazi” allegation makes u look ignorant. Also ur feed says otherwise. All American stuff
My biggest fear is Biden loses. But a close second is this exact scenario. "Scorched earth" doesn't even begin to cover it. Especially if the Senate flips and Dems hold the House.

I completely second that. Sadly Biden won’t be any better but morally I cannot re-elect Trump

I'd like to say that voting in November will help.  But there are still the people who support 45 that we will have to deal with, and they aren't gonna be happy when Biden wins.
You can beat Biden off?? You should rephrase.
Exactly. A vote for any other candidate other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
We are going to Vote Orange Idiot out and begin to pick up the pieces or fail as a country. Biden is no way ideal but it’s a starting point for more progressive policies. It will be time to be constructive and put shit back together better than it was.
Important to do what we can to help Dems running for the Senate. Even if Biden wins the White House, it will be a hollow victory if Graham and McConnell are still running the Senate. If you have some donation $$ to offer, contribute to Jaime Harrison or

Hopefully this is just the beginning of writing all these wrongs. When President Biden and his illustrious cabinet take their places we will finally be on the right track for this nation.

Someone connected to the Biden campaign contacted you? 🤨
Biden has his flaws - not the perfect candidate by any means. However, more than ever before, our country needs an empathetic leader. A leader to unite our country, not polarize it anymore than it already is. Great conversation and insight.
They've moved from blaming past Obama for now to blaming future Biden for now.would be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.
#WeWillVote you out👎! #WeWillVote for Biden👍! #WeWillVote blue. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😉
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm
Oh my God can he please be our next VP? Biden's running mate? Can that be a thing????? #IMissObama This Was a Different Barack Obama. A Stick-Swinging, Old-Testament Obama.
I probably would but I would be wearing my Biden face mask.
Now that the trumpeter has floated the idea of postponing the election #WeWillVote November 3. And we will vote for Biden. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Yep... they’re excited over a ham sandwich while kicking the majority of their constituents in the giblets. Even after Biden wins, the battle will not be over.
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
This is bonkers. We need someone able and willing to step in at any moment. Hell, yes, she’d better want to be president. Who thinks Biden will even be alive to run for a second term? Good grief.
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.
And Biden will move them back.
If you hear Joe Biden promise to do something “on Day 1” if he wins, can we make it Day 2 so we can all get a good night’s sleep first?
Biden doesn’t need a swing state if he picks a candidate that’s right for this moment. Rice helps carry Virgina and states through the south + Midwest. I like Harris but understand why the campaign may have hurt their relationship. The GOPs urgent scar tissue is self-inflicted.
We are on a powerful path to universal care and coverage, amplified by #COVID19. Our health care systems have failed, and the reform we need done will take hard work to overcome the roadblocks and barriers the GOP continues to put in front of us.
NOTHING could be worse than what now resides in the WH. I’ll vote for Biden even if he picks Rosie O’Donnell
Hollywood created a feel-good moment at the Oscars where Joe Biden spoke about victims of molestation, rape &amp; respecting boundaries! Molested as a kid, it was painful to watch. Google "creepy Joe", see what he has done to people not reported by mainstream media! F*** Hollywood!
Biden has dementia. It’s clear to the whole 🌎 Nice guy wrong job.
Meet Susan Rice. If you haven’t gotten to know  hear why she is a front runner for Joe Biden’s VP.  It is an amazing conversation about our country’s moment of reckoning. Listen here:

I refuse do let they assholes take this away from me. I put out my flag all summer , right behind my Joe Biden for president sign.
Hi everyone in my family is a registered voter and we vote together grandma to and we’re all voting for Biden from Minnesota 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗
Joe Biden’s plan failed to mention universal healthcare or #Medicare4All ... seems like this pandemic has shown us how important it is for all Americans to have access to healthcare
I’d question that poll honestly...
Breathing a sigh of relief as it dawns on me that I don’t have to listen to my parents bemoan the fact that Biden will ruin this country.
Mike can keep asking but Biden owes him nothing, especially since he did it like a childish dare.
I just saw Joe Biden commercial on TV and I cried. How are soul will recover with someone so good at the helm.
Answer me this, if Biden used a cover of Echo as their song of choice for a motivational campaign video, would you be okay with it?
I saw that exact same shirt except they spelled it Joe Biden. 😀
I prefer a president that doesn't have a private unmarked militia.   #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Biden
They’re ALL going for Biden because you’re such a TERRIBLE president and and we ALL want you OUT!!!
If you agree that Biden should not debate Trump unless Trump releases his tax returns please like and retweet this tweet.
Canoe, Biden flag waving rally at lake Normandale on Tuesday,
Lmaooooo please keep asking every week. Biden would get TORCHED in one of these interviews
I'm 5 degrees to the left of Bernie Sanders. My friends and I all support Joe Biden. He will bring healing to this country and end fascism. Democracy is on the line.
Bullshit Jr. You're really afraid Biden will raise taxes on your billion buddies.
I have a Biden joke but it's about the other Biden.
But lot of them blacks that vote for YE are probably gonna vote Trump!! 😂 it might hurt Trump more than Biden.. JS
Damn autocorrect strikes again.  It's supposed to be Biden's not baby's
That’s precisely why I’m voting for Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You can beat Biden off?? You should rephrase.
Got it. It’s no good to 🗳 Biden
Hey, Mr Biden, can you just start acting as president? We really need you now!
Mr. Gidley needs to know that like so many people I know, I will crawl through fire, over broken glass, and fight off rabid dogs to vote for ANYONE running against Trump. (OK not Kanye)I don’t give a flying flip about watching Biden. He’s got my vote.
Since MLB is selling the back of the mound as ad space, it’d be pretty hilarious for Biden to buy the back of the Yankees mound for Opening Day.
That’s crazy. Look 👀 up what Biden has said about the Black community.
Trump: I combed my hair. I have beautiful hair. They couldn’t believe it. They said, “Its  unbelievable! Rarely does anybody do what you just did.” Biden refuses to tell us who combs his hair, bc I know for a fact he cannot comb his own hair.   #Biden2020Landslide
I love how Republicans are insisting this is what Joe Biden’s America will look like...as if it’s not happening right now and as if it’s not Trump’s doing. 🙄 Gotta find those excuses, right?
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. It’d be too damn embarrassing for Biden, or anyone for that matter, to brag about such things!
If I was just one year older, I would DEFINITELY vote for Trump! Because even though Joe Biden claims to be a moderate (i am a conservative, so i would not vote for him anyway) he does not seem very articulate and he does not seem capable of holding back the radical left.
Hey  I like that your ads are being the hard-hitting Bad Cop to Joe Biden's Good Cop ads. But you're airing them only in DC for an audience of 1. Are you planning to air them in swing states to actually affect the election?

On Covid-19, Biden doesn’t have any new ideas. On climate and the economy, his ideas are liabilities, writes"Our country is in burning turmoil, and the White House is eagerly fanning the flames. If we are to have a shot at quenching them, let alone beginning to repair the damage left behind, we will have to play the two-party game to its conclusion in November."
I completely agree. That is why when Republicans keep calling Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe”, I tell them that after almost 4 years of the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump we’re tired. We could use a nap.
They can not except it. Biden can send out the troops. Not!!!
if i don’t stop getting emails from joe biden i’m gonna end it all
No, but we would have to worry about Biden’s staff.  Everyone knows he can’t use a computer to tweet.  I can’t imagine anyone thinks his twitter page comments are posted by him

Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.

Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.
Support Melania as Vice President to Biden!

To win, Biden has to show that he isn’t a hostage of the disorderly far left. He needs to denounce rioting, writes   via
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Tell me something i don't know! Tell me when we win in November. Biden is going to prosecute the enablers. No healing the country bs no cumbaya bs just indictments all over.
Breathing a sigh of relief as it dawns on me that I don’t have to listen to my parents bemoan the fact that Biden will ruin this country.
Biden 2020 put them all in cages.
If you go back like two years I tweeted that Joe Biden would be the president in 2020. Nobody listened to me because I tweet nonsense most of the time
Watch Mark Levin if you live in the suburbs. A vote for Biden is a vote for losing your American home in the suburbs.
I just saw Joe Biden commercial on TV and I cried. How are soul will recover with someone so good at the helm.
Thank you thank you  for your response to Politico. I read it this morning and was so mad -  was right when she called out Biden during debate and has nothing to apologize for. We don’t want a president who can’t take occasional (and accurate) criticicism.
They are clueless. Michelle Obama &amp; Jill Biden had causes &amp; were seen &amp; heard. Instead we got a FAKE anti bullying campaign &amp; an I don't care attitude. Probably planting a poisonous plant garden. Rappacini's Daughter.
They’re ALL going for Biden because you’re such a TERRIBLE president and and we ALL want you OUT!!!
Wallace does one interview where he challenges Trump on reality and he is Walter Cronkite.  Please.  He will be 20 times as hard on Biden, who has a longer record in government.   He can choose his interviewers.
If you agree that Biden should not debate Trump unless Trump releases his tax returns please like and retweet this tweet.
This indicates the opposite of 2016. Voters seem to want to put a check on a potential 2nd Trump term than to put a check on Biden. People don't think of Biden as a prohibitive favorite like Clinton.
Biden, HS graduation, BLM!
The world is looking forward to Biden’s leading the USA and restore the order and law for the World
The real wasted vote is voting for the exact same thing that’s in office, but representing a different party.   Biden in literally the same as Trump except that he’s been in politics for almost 50 years.
Damn autocorrect strikes again.  It's supposed to be Biden's not baby's
Yup.....can biden even read that we know he can’t remember it? Great post!!!
That’s precisely why I’m voting for Biden.

China must be held accountable.  Remember, Joe Biden and the democrats didin't even want to block travel from China in January.  The WHO told us all C-19 was not contagious.  China must pay!
And then there is Joe Biden supressing Latino vote in Florida.
Trump pardoning Alice Johnson from prison.  Biden sent 10,000 African American males to prison with his crime bill!
Trump behaved much better when he released Alice Johnson from prison.  And when he signed real prison reform.  Biden sent 10,000 African American males to prison with his crime bill!
You can beat Biden off?? You should rephrase.
Exactly. A vote for any other candidate other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
Good time to remind everybody that the democrats called our president a xenophobe for blocking travel from China.  I wonder how many more would have died if Biden or Cuomo were president?  DiBlaiso was urging us all to celebrate St. Paddy's day in a Manhattan bar.  Shameful!
No, Biden can do more
Really. During Obama's time Obama and biden refused the testing of the N1 virus. Remember this is a virus. You lie and mess with our freedoms. You will pay.
Remember   giving credit to Joe Biden for selflessly deciding rallies/conventions were not worth the risk to others MONTHS ago? Me neither. Thinking it was about the same time that Trump et al were mocking Joe in mask. Now Trump=he-man status for wearing mask twice.
Hey, Mr Biden, can you just start acting as president? We really need you now!
I wonder how this would look if it was all Democratic presidential candidates vs just Biden - I donated to a few but haven’t to Joe. Have prioritized that $$ for down ballot races
Mr. Gidley needs to know that like so many people I know, I will crawl through fire, over broken glass, and fight off rabid dogs to vote for ANYONE running against Trump. (OK not Kanye)I don’t give a flying flip about watching Biden. He’s got my vote.
You vote for Biden because the threat to our democracy from Trump transcends all else.  Sitting out is essentially voting for 4 more years of Trump and enabling the destruction of our republic.

Wasn’t Biden berated by Trump et al when he made the decision to not hold a big convention or rallies? “Biden’s in the basement ring a bell?”Don’t remember Biden’s people having to come out and give a rah rah speech afterwards to stroke his ego.
