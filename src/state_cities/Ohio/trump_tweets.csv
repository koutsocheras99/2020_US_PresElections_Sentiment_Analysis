Brett Favre sympathizes with Donald Trump over coronavirus, explains golf round with president  via
Trump gets a paycheck, it's the law.  He claims he donates it. He takes in more than his pay. He spends more on his golf outings than the presidential salary over a 10 year period, and it all goes into his pocket. It's way over 2 games.  Moron.
Because what everyone needs instead of a stimulus payment is a deferment of payroll taxes that must be repaid later.

You'd think this would be a time where Congress would assert itself and we could put an end to questionable executive orders. Instead, this is giving Trump cover to exercise the same overreaching executive powers as recent presidents. Stupid, regardless of the policy outcome.

Jewish groups are taking aim at President Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for ambassador to Germany for his past statements about Muslim immigrants and for downplaying the importance of Nazi history.

I disagree with most of what Obama did. Im conservative, often told husband that Obama did too much too fast. conservatives, like me felt a bit of an attack on our beliefs.  That said. I may not like it but he did a lot. Trump had consevative house&amp;senate and accomplished zero.
That is so encouraging.  I hate that it has gotten this bad to make people see but what makes it worse is when you feel like Trump supporters still don't see or don't care and we may never get back to a semi-functioning country.

What's this about Governor #MikeDewine testing postive on his first #COVID19 test &amp; then testing negative hours later? Joke was he was trying to avoid meeting #Trump who was coming to Ohio &amp; he lied about testing postive in the 1st place. But are these tests really jokes instead?
Trump used the Russians to help defraud the American people. And your sources are suspect.

Was trump raised without God? Considering he's been married 3 times. Cheats on all of his wives, and sleeps with hookers. What about the constant lying? Maybe you should sit this one out. Republicans are nothing more then hypocrites.

Trump is not a cosmopolitan. D'Souza is a felon.

I know right? What's the deal with all the Round trump fans? Like round faces, round bodies lol they like to look like Trump I guess
Trump don‚Äôt deserve the black vote period he is a racist.
I don't agree it was "botched." Biden hasn't done anything. different from any previous candidate. It's just that the media has made this into a beauty pageant because I guess Trump's daily degradations aren't newsy enough.
So why don't Americans have free and complete access to these masks? Does Trump want us to die?
If someone has already decided not to vote for Trump, they would then vote for Biden, unless they had an additional choice. That's the game  and  are playing. Kanye has millions of followers and many don't understand the power votes.

Because Trump has refused to unequivocally condemn actions taken by actual white supremacists! This isn‚Äôt hard and if you don‚Äôt see the difference it‚Äôs because you want to feel better about voting for a POS who doesn‚Äôt really care about anyone except himself
They‚Äôre not close to the same. I‚Äôm conservative so clearly Biden isn‚Äôt ideal but he‚Äôs not a narcissist + he‚Äôll be willing to listen/act on his advisors/experts he puts in place to help him. Trump has his message if advisor disagrees he/his people undermine and attack the expert.
As here.Trump disbanded the program after entering office yet dared accuse Obama of "empty cupboards." Not true but fit nicely into his rhetoric. The world unions predicted we were due for a pandemic. Trump just rid of us of our Center for Disease Control a few months ago.

In the sense that sometimes it'll be tough to respond to Trump's inanities and lies, yes, I suppose Biden might have some issues. Beyond that, he could school Donnie on any subject. Thing is, with Trump almost fully having abandoned fact, it all depends on how Biden counters him
Has it not occurred to any of you complete imbeciles that people don't hate Trump because FB/Twitter/IG or any other social media platform tells them to, but because he is a truly disgusting and despicable human with few to NO redeeming qualities? No? Well it should.
I still can't get over POTUS thinking that Biden would somehow "hurt the bible," when Trump has nearly irreparably hurt the witness of evangelical Christians on a staggering level.

Shut the F up, the China Virus isn't Trump's fault, and would be much worse under you, seeing how you called him a racist and xenaphobe  for closing travel to China.
I have said for sometime,  that Trump is the result of angry white people who could not stand to see an intelligent,  compassionate, well spoken black man in the oval office.  So they put in place the complete opposite,   a mirror to themselves.  It is shameful.
Its always amazed me how people like him are so proud of their ignorance.  And  proud to be so self centered and uncaring of others.  But then this guy undoubtedly suffers from Dunning Krueger Effect.   As many Trump supporters do.

Sadly trump will prob be one of those with no symptoms. I can‚Äôt believe he is not suffering fromType 2 diabetes.  His weight  and poor diet  are prime risk factors in developing it
The Supreme Court is the most important reason to reelect Trump. We need more Conservative Justices on the SCOTUS to prevent the left lunatics from destroying our country and their strong desire to take away our freedoms.
Lmao. It's somehow proven now that Trump is a child sex trafficker ü§£ü§£ü§£ the same person who helped the Epstein investigation and called his island a cesspool... give me a break. He's talked about human trafficking all along just miss mr with that until there's actual evidence

What's really crazy is before all this happened, I was extreme anti-Trump. But now? I'm starting to lean towards him a little more. I don't agree with some of the stuff he says particularly his thoughts on law enforcement and kneeling, but he's done alot of shit well.
And of course trump created so many jobs.  Which he did not pay the contractors for.  Donald trump never held a real job. Sweetie. Daddy  kept him on the payroll and pumped him up when he has always been nothing g but a failure
Gee, wonder why? Maybe because misinformation on HCQ and governors committing grnocude by moving cv patients into nursing homes maybe? Gee idk. Must all be Trump's fault. He did it. Smfh
While we can't be sure just yet about his involvement, one thing IS FOR SURE. Trump tried to save all those people with HCQ...But his words got changed to create a false narrative that he said to "drink bleach, inject bleach, drink lysol" etc. Those deaths are not on him. 1/2
It is tiny by virtue of every prior administration , but it won't be when Trump is done. And you'll see why 100's of millions of walls are employed the world over because they work, a simple fact that seems lost on the left

It is genius by his campaign managers because any interview with Biden reveals his mental decline. Trump is fine. At least he has the balls to do an interview.

Let‚Äôs move Election Day to September 1st and call it ‚ÄúTrump Day‚Äù.  We can get it out of the way and Trump can get back to work!  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mr. Trump please keep your hands off our constitution especially off our voting rights.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Vote Trump out and the whole stinking administration can be jetted out into the Atlantic toward Russia.
Let‚Äôs all Republicans and Democrats send Trump packing back to Florida or better yet, send him back to Putin.  If I were a Republican I wouldn‚Äôt want Trump in the WH four more years.  As soon as he is gone (Barr will follow) our country can thrive again! üá∫üá∏üòÑ
Yes, Russia, if you are listening take Trump please.üôè
It amazes me that the media televises the eulogy of John Lewis a man who once cared until Trump took office.  Then he didn't care about the country at all just like George Floyd.  They televise two buffoons eulogies who didn't care for their country. A criminal and a sick Senator
The narrower the road the more concentrated the trump signs
Another Trump move that is as transparent and flimsy as Saran Wrap.
Absolutely. If the ballot arrives after the due date then it is not counted. There are other rules regarding mail-in/absentee ballots for each state which safeguard the integrity of the election.
Awesome! The safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the election worked! Good to know.
Trump: I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and I wouldn't lose any votes.

I don't know how anyone can truly believe Trump has the best interest of anyone other than Trump. I can't wait to vote for Biden.
This is how Trump controls the narrative. As Bannon taught, he ‚Äúfloods the zone with sh&amp;t‚Äù then sits back and lets the media amplify until all other subjects are drowned out. Stop letting him do it. #nhpolitics
Not while Trump is in office.  We need a leader during this pandemic
I can tell you Trump has been running ridiculous ads about Biden for the last month or so in Ohio. Every YouTube video I watch has like 3 ad breaks &amp; almost ALL the ads are Trump ads about the police not being able to help if you‚Äôve been raped. Truly disgusting stuff.Hope he now calls for trump to resign. trump makes Falwell look like a Boy Scout.
lmao yes nigga. This is the meta game in 2020. This is how Trump got elected. Where the fuck you been
They will try...next step is to take over the Senate for Impeachment 2.0 after 2020....they won't stop..they are crazy..#Liberals #Biden2020 stay safe #Trump...best president outside of #Reagan
He always watches mouths when someone else speaks during his trump briefings. No reading lips or paying attention; it's child-like. Just watching mouths. And waiting for them to stop moving.
But Trump will say they have one.
Yes, Biden can. Trump is incapable of putting together a workable healthcare plan for the people. He does not possess the skills.
This is the wrong track for truth but, this is the correct track for the uneducated, ignorant and wannabes to be taken advantage of. 44th U.S. President Barack Obama took care of pre existing health conditions when he enacted the Affordable Care Act. Trump has not helped you.

Yeah, saw a reply here that captures Trump's failure in a sentence.Imagine ignoring 160k deaths from a pandemic &amp; the leader of the free world says "It's just going to disappear"/ "kids are immune"/ "when the warm weather hits it'll disappear".That's what you're trying to defend.
Some who get it do recover completely. Some who get it die. Most others who recover have lingering long term effects, studies of which are only beginning. Heart, lung, liver, kidney issues. Attacking Trump is easy no matter what he's trying to talk abt. He fails at everything.
This is an acceptable answer. But the fact that there was anyone left who would vote for that guy isn't good. But Trump is president so can't be too surprised

Never EVER did any democrat say that they were coming to take anyone‚Äôs precious guns away! No one is planning on coming to your door and collecting your arsenals. Trump can‚Äôt think of anything new to lie about, so it‚Äôs the same BS from 2016. How great has he made us? We‚Äôre worse!
I wouldn't count on him disappearing. Trump needs to mobilize the base, and Fallwell Jr is one of his most loyal cheerleaders. I bet Trump takes him on the campaign trail.
If there are people dumb enough to vote for Trump not just the first time but a second time...then yeah..I'm pretty sure there are people dumb enough to vote for Kanye.
Other presidents have warned ppl of the immense unchecked power that a president has.  Never have I seen it abused like this.    Not even the media can put tRump in check because his corruption is baked in.
Well when are the test going to be available to anyone that wants a test? Are they test reliable? Are the testing times going to be reduced?Pre-existing conditions are already covered by ACA, why is trump taking credit for it now? Again trump is behind!

Nice mature comment. Just cant stand someone not agreeing with you, right? You literally just said ALL Trump supporters are racists! How close minded and stupid can you be?! I never once said Pedos ONLY support Dems. I said they do, which is true. Look at Hollywood.
How do you explain 1.8 million new jobs and an unemployment rate down to 10.2% if everyone is staying home to collect their $600? Even Trump and McConnell disagree with you now. I hope you're sufficiently embarrassed. Your lack of trust in the American "folks" is conspicuous.

Obama already did that. Trump is trying to take it away from people during a pandemic, with no actual plan or knowledge on what to do for coverage or how insurance coverage works. He‚Äôs grasping at straws since he‚Äôs 87 days away from losing to Biden. He just wants his name on it.
Nice try!  This is not a Republican!  I caught him telling 4 lies in the video.  If you're going to have a "Republican" saying why he's not voting for Trump, why don't you try finding an actual Republican?  This just shows how desperate Democrats are.

Some asshole put it in his head that the SCOTUS DACA decision lets him just do anything he wants with EOs.  It's not true of course, they didn't rule on the legality of the original Obama EO, they ruled on Trump's being able to just stop the program because he feels like it.

Obama did this with the ACA. The first thing Trump tried to do is gut it.   C‚Äômon, man.

President Trump has worked his entire life, what are you even talking about
Giving Russians classified intelligence in the Oval Office while knowing Putin is paying the Taliban to kill U.S. soldiers.  Is treason, McSally.  Hack.

Trump. Is. The. Worst. President*. In. USA. History.   AND he‚Äôs a Russian puppet, a lying traitor.  There it is.
I would prefer a president who didn't believe in gods at all, none of them, not a single one.  Having said that, I'd vote for Biden over Trump even if he believed in all the gods.
The trump cabooses are getting their asses swatted this week on
Congress (Republicans) are afraid to pass a bill if they think Trump is ont sign it into law.
There's no doubt the Chinese either manipulate, enhanced or developed this disease to get back at Trump for standing up to them with tariffs .. NO DOUBT IN MY MIND that it came from their biological chemical warfare lab in wuhan. They secretly want to take the USA out as leaders.

How's he a fascist? Give an example. What is my solution? For what, the China virus? I don't have a cure, but my brother just got over the Kung Flu, so I know all about it. It's real, it's dangerous, but Trump is not responsible for it.
This is good news. Instead of applying to get on a ballot, he should focus on his mental health and failing marriage. Trump has already made a mockery of the presidency and the country.
How exactly? Back people have had the highest wages %wise in their history under Trump . Highest % of overall employment under Trump ? He‚Äôs hurting them how ?
We never had a president in history that let his nuts hang like trump
Facebook been seen the wave... same thing they did to Snap when IG introduced the Story feature. it‚Äôs convenient that Trump pulls that trigger bc it removes competition for FB to fill that void

Black people rented from Trump in the 70s 80s though . He also turned down white people . And regardless it was the management it wasn‚Äôt actually Donald Trump himself . Hope this helps
Trump has shattered Bush‚Äôs records for debt, deficits, trade deficits, job losses, &amp; economic losses.  In 3 short years.  FACT: by every economic &amp; moral measure, Trump is the worst President in our nation‚Äôs history.  Trumpism gloats in failure &amp; lying.

China stopped buying our farmers‚Äô soybeans because of Trump‚Äôs trade war so we‚Äôre bailing out Big Ag with money borrowed from China, &amp; China now buys their soybeans from Russia.  US farmers now go bankrupt &amp; commit suicide at twice the national average.

Me too Matt!  If we had a normal Republican as President, I‚Äôm not even sure how excited I would be to vote for Biden. He certainly wasn‚Äôt my choice (Warren for me), but I am certain that he will do better than Trump. He will at least listen to experts &amp; not just appoint yes men.
Uh, not a Trump supporter either. Can‚Äôt stand either mainstream option, but thanks for assuming. George isn‚Äôt well-mannered. Lol. He‚Äôs become completely obnoxious &amp; obsessed on social media at the expense of many fans.

Dude. You trying to get a date, or what? Every post George makes is hypocritical. He talks about Trump being off the hinge on social media. George is just as bad if you look objectively.
Trump has stolen enough of our money. I'm certainly not giving him any voluntarily.
Why do you care? Why do we care? An individual‚Äôs religion or lack thereof is personal. You bitch about Trump so much, yet you‚Äôre an inverse-mirrored image of him. Angry old, radical man spouting off on social media. Your brand manager/asset on this acct is cringeworthy!

But Trump can grab women by the p*ssy and that‚Äôs perfectly acceptable! Get a grip. Women are allowed to express their sexuality. They are rappers, not role models. Worry about more important issues üôÑ
Totally agree! Trump is grasping at actual air at this point.  It‚Äôs a nothing burger.  He says SHIT all day every day
Big decision for Congress in trying enforce legal subpoenas ignored by the Trump administration
Trump said that? So then it‚Äôs not true after all.
I don't even think Joe is a factor. Trump is the only option. Also, you analogy makes zero sense.
Never Trump is not just hurt feeling, it's more about dead people, a 160,000 and counting and he doesn't give a damn.
Trump hasn't yet filled the hole he created in March with massive job losses. So he can't talk about good job numbers until he has done that.

Okay, fair enough- I am not a small guy in the weight department so I get that. I'm just saying if we're going to try to equate heart disease deaths under Obama to COVID deaths under Trump we should be comparing the relative level of actions they took.
Oh yeah, and that Trump EO wrt wechat/tik - Regardless of if/how it affects videogames, it's a problematic move.   I get the whole "It skims information! INFORMATION!" concerns, but Facebook, Amazon, etc. are as bad or worse for doing that.
Of course the reality is that Covid is a real problem, and Trump and the GOP response look bad because Trump and the GOP response are bad.
Trump looking to sign executive action if they dont get a deal done. Could be holding investors over
I believe he didn‚Äôt test positive, but rather said he did to avoid meeting Trump in Cleveland.
Any president with half a brain could use something like a pandemic response to bolster their reelection bid, so your dumb insistence that this is all a lib-dem hoax only works if you acknowledge that Trump is a moron who can't handle a national crisis.

Unreliable #COVID19 tests don‚Äôt help when testing before seeing  #Trump needs to wear a #mask. His ‚Äúthis virus will eventually go away‚Äù doesn‚Äôt guarantee he will not catch the #Covid. Wearing a mask will give you a lesser chance of catching or transmitting #Covid
The same should be true for anyone who votes Trump.
Not necessarily. If a person was going to vote for Trump and instead voted for Kanye, Biden's net would go from -1 to +/-0 and Trump's would go from +1 to +/-0.
actually that's proven wrong. you know who never went to church?? Trump. Only does that to appeal to his supporters
The state of #Kansas has a nice study that shows counties NOT wearing  #masks have a higher rate of #COVID19  than those that WORE MASKS. #Trump supporters aren‚Äôt more American because the don‚Äôt wear a mask. Even my namesake  needs to WEAR A MASK!
It appears Trump doesn‚Äôt know what he wants to be when he grows up.
Is Ted's wife really as ugly as Trump says she is???
With Trump failing to understand that having high covid death counts and high unemployment numbers actually means  he's "losing", it must be super interesting to watch him golf. Does he just putt the ball around in circles going for a high score? Hard to imagine otherwise
"It's the wrong thing for the wrong reason at the wrong time for the wrong people"  This is as succinct a statement ever said on the subject. In fact, it pretty much sums up everything Trump does. Also, we aren't producing enough to keep up with demand and NEED the imports.
The damage they are doing to the church (for Donald freaking Trump) is astounding.
It was a Trump-team test -- DeWine said he didn't even know where he was taken to have it done, because he was answering emails in the car the whole way.
It was apparently a last minute hail mary thrown by the Trump team.
I live in a purple state and voting for the Democratic Pres. nominee is simply the pragmatic choice.  It's not about Trump for me, but a binary choice between two platforms that are unfortunately similar in a lot of ways.  I do vote for DSA/OurRevolution rec'd local candidates

‚ÄúHahaha, Dury! 2016!‚Äù  It‚Äôs not 2016. The dynamics are completely different. Trump is no longer the outsider; he‚Äôs the incumbent; Biden is not Hillary.   The election is really a referendum on the incumbent. Biden is just ... there.
Just because you attended a party where a child molester is doesn‚Äôt mean you are one. A video where trump is with episten, they are so close it‚Äôs clear they are very close. So I have no doubt trump is a child molester, plus his disposition for a rape of a 13 yr girl. He‚Äôs a Pig!

at this point I'm justifying my Biden vote with an argument I saw for Trump in 2016, which is "eh, fuck it, might as well try a new guy and see what happens"

Perfect example of the shitshow from the Trump administration since February. An admin with a clear and concise plan wouldn't allow the rapid tests, only the PCR tests.
I mean, so does Trump..?
Like I've said before, if Trump winning in 2016 didn't tell you anything then you're not paying attention. Maybe him winning in November will wake you up. Two plantations but imagine BLKs that were lifelong Liberals voting for Trump cause the DemoCRIPS didn't do their job.
Breaking: According to Trump, If Biden is elected, he will literally rip the cold beer out of your hands as you are drinking it.
I appreciate your reiteration of these facts. Unfortunately, facts don't mean a damn thing to trump or his followers.
You support racist and classist corporations everyday that were funded by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade say nothing about it but wanna call Trump racist cause that's what the media tells them. Every Prez including 44 was full of shit.
Sounds like trump
Just like a drunk man tells no tales, old senile man tells no tales. How many times you gonna let him and the DemoCRIPS insult you? "But he's better than Trump" "Lesser of the two evils" Actually he's not he's worse like KILLary. Why is the energy never the same with him?
Doesn't it seem suspicious that when President Trump visited our Whirlpool plant here in Ohio Mike DeWine our Governor tested positive for Covid-19 &amp; after President Trump left, now Mike DeWine tested negative?
Is Trump/GOP taking a credit for 1% poverty decline rate? ü§î
I *love* that we as a community have so thoroughly ruined Pat McCrory‚Äôs shit that he‚Äôs now secretly advising Trump to stay out of trans issues
Someone should quote: "go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature". So, it ain't personal trump. John Lewis' chickens would give "Amen" to that. trump is pure evil;embraced by evangelicals for bucks and to put the others in their places.The Battle is real.
Thank you for throwing your Trump talking points at me without checking your facts first. Did you know that President Barack Obama was responsible for the rate decline from 12.6% to 7.5% which continued up until 2017? Does this mean anything though because the disparity in wages
Did you see this?  Wonder if it is a look into the future?
Weird....ran my dishwasher once and all my dishes are clean.  Also only had to flush the toilet once.  You know...as it‚Äôs always been.  Thanks Mr. Trump sir for solving a problem that wasn‚Äôt even there!  People are dying but at least my dishes are clean!!  Praise be.
Hard for Trump to claim we have best testing in the world when the test his own team uses isn't even accurate!
There is no religion except blasohemy that Trump can claim.  He is disintegrating rabidly.  May it please hurry.
Well played Governor well played avoiding trump !
Once upon a time, Republicans used to think executive orders were unconstitutional overreach.   Then came a Trump, and now I‚Äôm convinced they are right.   The End.

Lol, it's hilarious watching you Q nuts embarrassing yourselves trying to defend the indefensible &amp; pretend you don't know the Dem candidate is the best choice by far. It'll be surprising if Trump is even on the ballot.Resignation for health reasons, probably.He's fading fast.
Way to go, Trump. Though given your past four years, I for one welcome our ensuing new Chinese Overlords. Tik Tok. #tiktokdown #TikTok
When was the last time he was treated like the President of the United States of America? I was raised you don‚Äôt have to like them or agree with them but you treat them with respect. Not one day has this happened for President Trump. All because he can‚Äôt be bought by the Democrat
Where, the Clinton foundation? There is so little the neo-Marxist left have on Trump it's like little rubber darts.
so now DeWine gets a negative test lol I SWEAR this man was trying to get out of meeting with Trump ü§£ü§£
THIS is the karma. How many other false positives are out there that he masked us up for. At least Kasich admitted he wouldn‚Äôt be going to Cleveland to be with Trump.....
So if it‚Äôs really prounonced thighland and trump is so smart: why did he correct himself 3 seconds later? Listen to the clip. You psychophants are much more stupid than you think we are.
Your statement is true. Other countries.  They are not the United  States.  We are not like any other country on this planet.  What works in Sweden does not work in the US.  I Acknowledge things could have been better.  Trump would never say that but he knows that.
By now it should be obvious.  Spend money on anything with the label "Trump" and you will not be getting your money's worth.
Now if Trump would have said something this asinine, you‚Äôd be the same guy jumping all over him labeling him a racist.  Interesting how the narrative works....
Josie you think Biden is the answer? I want there to be a Ronald Regan to vote for.  There isn‚Äôt.  There are two choices.  Biden who stands against all of my core principles and Trump who aligns with my core principles.  Yes Trump has major issues but there is only two choices.

So nice to see some Thai writing. Wonder if you could send Donald Trump a note with it all in Thai writing. Not so sure he would be able to understand one word.
dinesh‚Äôs has brain has been sadly denied oxygen for too long as a result of his head being so far up trump‚Äôs cavernous ass.
Who is not listening now. I do not worship Donald Trump.  He aligns with my views on boarder security, taxes, the unborn, and the military.  I acknowledge his character has issues.  I Am Not voting for him because I like him.  I vote for him because of my core beliefs.
Yeah, let‚Äôs PLEASE stop with the campaign to rehabilitate George W. Bush.  No, he was nowhere near as bad as Trump, but he was still a TERRIBLE President, and responsible for the loss of thousands of lives in an unnecessary war that his administration lied us into. #MorningJoe
We're sick of watching you all pretend that the Emperor is wearing a splendid new set of clothes. "Corruption" is a particularly strange yardstick to use, if you're a Trump supporter. It's his stock-in-trade.
Yes it says clearly Obama separated families and that Trump is clearly much worse with his stance and no tolerance policy.  Did I miss something?  You seemed to when you stated Obama did not pull families apart.
Just be honest and say you‚Äôre looking for any excuse possible to vote for trump again
That was a good one.  Sweetie I am not blind Trump has issues.  Lots of them.  I don‚Äôt care.  Right now he is the only candidate that aligns with me on boarder security, taxes, the unborn, and military issues.  The left stands against all of my core issues what am I to do?
No, you're not crazy. I predicted this months ago, that there would "suddenly" be a vaccine found, coinciding with the election - and Trump will try to take all the credit for it in hopes of a reelection!
Did Trump take a page out of Mike Tyson's speech book? Theighland.
You may want to be better informed. The Senate Republicans can‚Äôt get their act together. Mcconnell and Trump together should be deeply involved with this process! Deeply. This is further evidence that  literally does nothing except spew hatred.
Trump Wins!
TRUMP WAS/IS/&amp; ALWAYS WILL BE A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN!
This has been the plan from the onset of the communist Chinese virus in the United States. Leftist democrats have been working with unhinged Trump haters and anarchists to destroy the economy in order to defeat The president and destroy the country.
Something Trump doesn't understand. Biden understands Matthew 7:1-2 as he is a devout Catholic. Trump doesn't go to church and sure doesn't act as though he has any Christian values. I understand that and do try to live up to it.
Just say you didn‚Äôt wanna meet trump my guy üòÇ it‚Äôs okay we understand üòÇ

I don't agree that schools must reopen. Send Barron Trump to school first before our schools reopen. The Teachers Union KNOWS what is BEST FOR STUDENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT IS BEST FOR TEACHERS.  and you don't know what is best for students, teachers.

Conspiracy theory alert. Ohio Gov Mike DeWine faked his Covid positive so he and his staff would not have to go to Trump Cleveland campaign stop.
Trump touts reinvestment in manufacturing during Ohio Whirlpool stop
So, DeWine just really didn't want to hangout with Trump, huh?
Since trump is so religious, let‚Äôs ask him again about his favorite bible verse, Sunday school  lesson, hymnal, or ask him to recite the Lord‚Äôs Prayer. What are some of his family‚Äôs favorite Christmas and Easter traditions? I‚Äôm curious
I don‚Äôt even understand the conspiracy theory. His motivation as a Republican Governor is to lie about getting Covid to scare you so Trump loses the election. Maybe the aliens from Area 51 have taken over his body and he is being controlled by them.
So, what are we to glean from this? He had it but recovered in a day or tRump is using faulty tests?
Translated- I'm voting for Trump.Does Trump, or his team for that matter, understand what‚Äôs in play with this corporate welfarist policy-led FCC and Republican Congress?

Trump needs to be put in prison after he leaves office and his friends he put in office needs to also go to prison
Not a chance this is his own words, but I agree 100% w points 1,3,4,9.  I agree w 2,5,6, but have zero faith he'd handle it correctly.   Agree w 8 but he literally got that from Trump.   7 and 10 is just word-salad lol.
This entire article is fake news.   Misleading use of stats ‚úÖ Citing fraudulent/retracted studies ‚úÖ Blaming Trump for deaths ‚úÖ  No wonder people are scared to take HCQ. MSM is pure evil for scaring people away from taking a safe &amp; effective drug that would save 1,000s of lives
All these idiots are gonna see that Trump is ‚Äúhelping‚Äù people with pre-existing conditions and praise him even though that‚Äôs the same shit he‚Äôs been trying to revoke.
This is pretty disappointing all around. A lot of people are struggling right now. Can‚Äôt depend on the government to help people out when the really need it. -Coronavirus relief talks collapse on Capitol Hill    via
The MSM wants us to believe a drug that's been safely used for 65 yrs is now unsafe.  Somehow, HCQ became dangerous right after Pres Trump spoke positively of the drug as a treatment for covid19. Not a peep from the MSM about it being dangerous before then.  What a coincidence.
Any truth to the rumor that Republicans scuttled corona virus relief talks so Trump could pull his "tough guy" executive order shtick?
You mean the pre-existing conditions that Obamacare already requires insurance companies to cover? That little clause that Trump's DOJ is suing to overturn? Those pre-existing conditions?
I've got 2 words for you: Jill Stein. If half of her voters in MI, PA &amp; WI had voted Hillary instead, no Trump. A person on the ballot who can't win is just a spoiler!
We already did that.    And then Trump and Barr refused to defend the validly-enacted law.
"Trump says new order will force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions; ACA already does" ~
Despite the effort in this tweet to demonize the crowd of Trump supporters for cheering this remark by Trump, he's not wrong to point out the double standards for the "peaceful protests" and all other social activity during the pandemic.
The GOP was well along that path before Trump became president.
Trump has already told us know one will know the real results of the election other than that he will be the winner.
Yes, MAJOR !   Except it's already been done by a president much more beloved than Trump will ever be
You just described Trump except being a fine person. He‚Äôs not.
...and sold our PPE to other countries at top dollar deciding to make a buck while he could risking lives of my family and yours. My theory may be a lie. Maybe not. Let‚Äôs see If  throttles me down while letting Trump say what he wants. Anyone else have social media anger?
Trump and Hannity are out of luck!

And this is suddenly important why?  And, P.S., it‚Äôs ALREADY a part of the ACA. NO THANKS TO REPUBLICANS or Trump who is ‚Äúworking hard to overturn it I‚Äôm the midst of a pandemic. Geez, you guys are sickening.
PATIENTLY WAITING, TRUMP.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember the time Donald Trump said we could all go to church for Easter because coronavirus would be over by then.
Bruh I go through social media accounts faster than Trump goes through orange face paint. Let‚Äôs see how long this shit lasts lol.
Could trump‚Äôs campaign be run by any worse people?  Do they lie about everything and everyone. ?
It‚Äôs interesting. As far as ‚ÄúNever Trumpers‚Äù go, you‚Äôve been at the far more logical and sensible side than others. Heres my thing. There will be life after Trump. I have libertarian unicorn dreams, but I know that won‚Äôt happen. I think it‚Äôs best to keep the party moving together
I don't see how it could possibly get much worse than where we are now and where we're heading. Trump has made us the laughing stock of the world and it will take us decades to gain people's trust and respect back.
How much did Trump have to drink ?     It‚Äôs after 5

Maybe he meant Trump is cuomosexual not cosmopolitan
This definitely is the OPPOSITE of what Trump said, so it must be the truth!
You must be brain dead to actually believe that trump is a god fearing man. Read his tweets, verbatim, then read the beatitudes. Trump is the opposite of what Christ teaches

Statement on Donald Trump‚Äôs Misleading Claims about Arizona | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
This opinion and the story behind shows the inhumanity of the current administration. It is so sad and infuriating.
Uh.  Okay.  Yeah.  That‚Äôs the opposite of any and all actual data in reality, but you go on ahead and live in fantasyland.  You‚Äôll continue that by claiming Trump‚Äôs ass-kicking was staged or something and manage to never see reality.  It‚Äôs fucking sad, dude.
So politics requires being an absolute asshole with no regard for decency or the folks who didn‚Äôt vote for your guy?  If so, you don‚Äôt love America.  It‚Äôs hard to do that when you hate so many Americans.  Trump‚Äôs really got that problem.
Trump‚Äôs busy destroying his chances of re-election.  Only an utter fool interrupts his opponent when he‚Äôs kicking his own ass.  You haven‚Äôt shown a lick of reason or good judgment in this thread.
He falls in line w/ the Trump did it theme. What about the ones causing the problems, choosing to harm Americans rather than fix the issues, because they don't wanna work with Trump? Why did dems sit on legislation to lower drug prices for over a yr? Why all the pork in a ...
Nobody should be listening to Trump when it comes to COVID or anything else
Same thing as our internment of Japanese Americans during WWII which itself falls well short of the PRC.  Trump‚Äôs superpower is convincing people that all degrees of bad are the same so he can do whatever.  Let‚Äôs not let nihilism infect the fight against oppression.
We must Resist Together. Trump has committed Crimes Against Humanity and Treason.
Thank you for all the wonderful birthday wishes everyone! The only gift I am asking for this year is for you to get your absenteee ballot request form in &amp; for you to do everything you can to ensure we elect Democrats in Ohio &amp; evict Trump from our White House! #BlueWave2020

Hmmm....and Trump is the racist one??? Righttt!
HAHAHAHAHAH HELL YEAH BABY! WEARING A MASK WORKS! SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS AND FUCK DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BULLSHIT TESTS!!! #WINEWITHDEWINE
Now he‚Äôs negative so does that mean some of the cases in Ohio are false positives? They just fucked themselves because now no one is gonna listen to a damn thing he says. He just didn‚Äôt wanna meet Trump but not that I blame him
Yea let‚Äôs discuss that. How does trump have thst in his heart? Proof? He‚Äôs helped minorities in 3 yrs Biden actually in 50 yrs voted for and against things thst hurt the black community never did anything to help.
So, Trump is POYUS and you still find a way to blame democrats for HIS FAILED LEADERSHIP. Nope. This crap show is ALL HIS!
It. Absolutely. Does.  I will NEVER forgive the GOP for this last 4 years. Name 1 Republican who behaved like my interests came before his/her re-election?  Name ONE Republican who put the interests of this country before sucking up to Trump out of fear of a mean tweet.
And this is the best the democrat party has to offer.... could you imagine trump saying something like thisüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

So Trump and the White House offer false positive COVID-19 tests. They are literally trying to discredit the pandemic by offering fake positive tests to people who have to meet with Trump.
Wear a mask. The election isn't over.  Blame Trump. The election isn't over.  Be smart. Use your own outlandish NY taxes to cover your pandemic costs.
The Republican Party as your father knew it is dead. Trump executed a hostile take over and nobody stood up to him on the right. Like parasitic wasps eating their host, Trump and his cult ate your party alive.
Joe Biden could select a dog turd as a VP and I would STILL vote for him. Trump is THAT bad. And voting for a third party candidate as a protest? That is essentially a vote for Trump anyway.
Donald trump blamed China for mike dewine gettin covid lololololol

Actually you were corrected on the fact that tax payer funded secret service was there. So there‚Äôs that. I bet that was more expensive then a speech where trump was going to be anyways. TDS

How exactly? Back people have had the highest wages %wise in their history under Trump . Highest % of overall employment under Trump ? He‚Äôs hurting them how ?
Black people rented from Trump in the 70s 80s though . He also turned down white people . And regardless it was the management it wasn‚Äôt actually Donald Trump himself . Hope this helps
Did you see this?  Wonder if it is a look into the future?
1227 days in a row you have tweeted about Trump . #rentfree
Tbh, I thought the same with the Bernie debate. I'm not defending him or his cognitive decline, which is apparent, but whatever the hell they give trump so that he can do 45 minute pressers, they are giving it to Biden. Biden bareley gaffed in the debate, he just ruthlessly lied.
I would but no one will take americans, they think we are all stupid like trump.

Hello all my Trump haters I want you to know you do not stand a chance in destroying President Trump he will send all of you haters  and Democrats down  the river. just wait and see when he gets in office.
So sad that EVERYTHING bad is Trump's fault! We had the highest job rate, economy was great. He stopped planes and was chastised for that! Now it's his fault? Anyone see a pattern here? Dems won't condem riots and ANTIFA. Why? They want to keep turmoil going to make him look bad!
Media, are the biggest instigators(of course) keep coming at bron about trump sh- but he handled it as best as anyone can without more content for today. Simple stated he did.. ‚Äúgame will go on, they‚Äôre fans around the world who love the game...etc. ‚Äú man ‚Äú politics as usual..‚Äù

As a lifelong Catholic, he is full of crap. Jesus taught me to take care of my neighbor and turn the other cheek to my enemies. Did you miss that bible lesson Mr. Trump? Oh wait, you missed them all.

and the rest of the Dems will never allow a payroll tax; and rightfully so. They know what Trump‚Äôs up to.
Yep, Fauci is doing a damn good job of that. He told Trump in January of 17 that there would be a SURPRISE PANDEMIC coming. How could he know? Cause it's the ONLY way the dems could DESTROY Trump was tank the economy.
Again, that is on the states to enforce that. Some states do threaten a fine. Again, that is not Trump‚Äôs authority.
Trump just couldn't let me have my clout üò¥
I so agree. Funny, well not funny due to all the deaths, how Fauci told Trump in Jan of 17 that there will be a SURPRISE PANDEMIC.   See old maxie pad waters wants to block a bill or something on how Trump wants to change how hospitals report deaths from 19....
What if... now, bear with me... the virus isn't real and Trump and Boris are getting together to save the world?

He just wants to end what‚Äôs there. Didn‚Äôt want or vote for Trump (I‚Äôm conservative) but thought if he has to be pres, maybe he could ax ACA. Our cost for healthcare skyrocketed under it &amp; it‚Äôs been hard. Now realize no matter, price won‚Äôt drop. Likely increase. Leave it alone.
But to answer your question,   is stupid. Trump is an ignoramus, a moron. He is #DelusionalDonald! #HeIsWhatHeIs because he sincerely believes that a death toll of 164,000 Americans is‚Äîwell‚Äî#ItIsWhatItIs

Trump will get someone to "approve" a vaccine  right before the election. He'll say "I DID IT!" people will be stupid enough to believe it and re elect him. Then in January when theyre set to start giving it, It will be pulled for safety and never come to be....

Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump
2 years old . mueller went though all this. no president has been investigated more than trump .  the establishment HATES him . if they had anything on him , they would have taken him down by now . u got nothin  have you ever wondered why the establishment hates him so much ?
30 million out of work and Trump addresses us from his private golf course..  you suck.
I‚Äôm not 100% sure yet.  I was thinking Biden till I did research then realized he‚Äôs the weakest one running.  Used to be a trump hater but after doing research I might vote for him after seeing all he‚Äôs done for the black community, economy, etc.
Because they put terrible policies in place to battle covid. Like for instanceputting covid-19 and seniors back in nursing homes instead of in the makeshift hospitals the army corps of engineer setup or the hospital ship Trump provided. Do you think that that was a good idea?
Yeah....now they will probably name an aircraft carrier after trump.
Trump is full of flaming shit. As usual.
I don't follow why you're deflecting from the issue. Does Trump have a replacement plan for Obamacare? Yes or no? If he does, then where is it? If he doesn't, then why lie to us about it? I mean, damn, this is not difficult.

Betcha Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans have deliberately stymied the coronavirus stimulus package and emergency relief and are blaming it on the Democrats so Trump can brandish his executive order and play the hero. How cynical is that?! #HEROESAct vs. #HEALSAct
I don't care about Gavin Newsom. I care about what Donald Trump has to replace Obamacare. Hell, the country deserves the right to know right now.
Obviously all this is the most brazen, bare partisan hypocrisy by Republicans, who yell and bitch about "the Article I branch" when a Democrat is president.   But under Trump they have basically dispensed with any role for Congress beyond rubber-stamping judicial appointments

yeah cause trump kinda admitted to something accidentally if the quote i read was accurate..
How soon? Trump didn't deliver his healthcare plan when he said he would.
It‚Äôs a ploy. Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans have deliberately stymied the coronavirus stimulus package and emergency relief and blame it on the Democrats so Trump can brandish his executive order and play the hero. How cynical is that?! #HEROESAct vs. #HEALSAct
The mandate is unconstitutional, but not the entire law.  We still don't have Trump's healthcare plan to replace Obamacare.
I think the move GOP move here might be: 1. Tank negotiations. 2. Let POTUS say he alone will fix thing. 3. Pass bill through Congress. That way low info voters think Trump actually passed the bill and GOP doesn‚Äôt create precedent for more exec power when Biden‚Äôs in office.
What else are you going to do at a trump event?!
President Trump continued:   ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt win the election in 2016, our country would be over by now...‚Äù

This is nothing more than a Trump flash rally. #TrumpFlashRally
It was huge news  in 2010 when  established these protections in the Affordable Care Act - the law Trump is try to dismantle as he signs meaningless executive orders.
To be fair, Trump is a man of such low intellect that he likely doesn‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs even in the Affordable Care Act.
So Trump‚Äôs third marriage, where he cheated with porn actresses was sacred and holy and stuff?   Y‚Äôall are twisted and perverse.
What's wrong with the mandate? Where's Trump's healthcare plan?
This is nothing more than a Trump flash rally. #TrumpFlashRally
Trump's executive order
ahh but the ACA is "obama care"...  trump wanted to rip up everything obama did and rebrand it trump...  and the gop was cool with it of course cause they racists.
It may not occur to most, but Republicans were never interested in a deal.  The plan was to set up Trump with a "heroic" executive order.

On the whole Democrats condemn violent action from anyone. Trump condemns or pardons people when it‚Äôs convenient. He hedges and refuses to take a strong stance against anyone, just agreeing with whoever happens to be asking him questions at the time.

That is because to Trump, all public appearances are a campaign rally.
Right. That‚Äôs it. Trump is super smart and intentionally pronounced it that way. He didn‚Äôt misread it off his teleprompter and he was making a word origin point.
What kind of non-peaceful attack was lead by the previous administration and how many of Trump's supporters were killed? When the 68 Democratic Party members didn't attend the inauguration, how much violence was included  in the refusal? Because with out violence, it was peaceful

Or, and hear me out on this crazy idea, maybe Trump shouldn‚Äôt have the power to kill the entire video game industry through an executive order.
This has better be true. Because right now it looks like Trump is going to kill the Video Game Industry because he‚Äôs pissed off at some TikTok memers.

Talk about corruption.....That‚Äôs the Democrats for you. And they have the audacity to go after Trump.They are nothing but low down liars,cheaters, and scumbags.They will go nuts when Trump wins the election even after they try to pad the voting with voting by mail

They wont ever let Biden debate Trump cause he'd say the dumbest things trying to defend himself.
You lie as much as your lord &amp; master Comrade tRump! #VoteBlueImpeachTheTraitors
What‚Äôs holding it up is they Trump‚Äôs not putting any nominees forward. They get confirmed through the Senate, and the senate got rid of the filibuster for positions like the cabinet, judges, etc.
Then you're voting for Trump. Bernie had his shot...people weren't buying what he was selling. America is not THAT liberal.
It's odd how he has been locking up the state and he misteriously catches CoVid before Trump's visit... Dude is cool to just say no thanks.
Well, where did that statistic come from? Trump's crony Postmaster General is going to upset a lot of them by cutting overtime pay. Btw, I'll vote in person...early, as always.
These are just a few of his fascistic and unconstitutional acts as president. It‚Äôs an objective fact that Trump is a fascist.
And Trump threatened (and as I pointed out earlier about Trump‚Äôs secret police/Gestapo) and used the military against American citizens that have been protesting.
Trump has threatened to ban TikTok, an entire social media platform. That‚Äôs a gross attack on freedom of speech.
Trump is in direct violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.
He has a cabinet full of people that haven‚Äôt been vetted and confirmed by Congress. They‚Äôre a bunch of Acting Cabinet members. This is a gross violation of the right of Congress to keep end executive branch in check.
He threatened that he might try to delay the election.
Trump literally deployed secret police to abduct protestors.
I know that a few black folks support Trump, but it's very telling that they had to create accounts, because most don't.

The only problem with that statement is there no one who is brainwashed by the communist Democrats can come up with a single thing that President Trump has actually done wrong, NOT WITH ANY FACTS!!! They only put out propaganda that their program for. Lack of intelligence!!!
Most of the noise on the debate has come from some Democratic advisors to  Biden, be he's pro-debate, 3 as opposed to 4. If Trump refuses, it only weakens him(good). They're trying frame Biden as losing it mentally, why would a sitting POTUS with shaky polls not debate him? IMO

Yes, but that is not how the Trump campaign is going to play this. NY has given them 2nd Amendment related ammunition for the campaign.
More than $200 million of the COVID relief funds went to Chinese owned companies.  Trump borrowed $30 billion from China to give American farmers subsidies to not sell to China. His trade deals are mostly hype and just repackaged old trade deals.  China is eating our lunch
In other words, she'd like some excuse, any excuse, to vote for Trump again.üôÑ

TRUMP is as sharp as a tact. Now Biden does not know who he is running against. He does not know what state he is in. It is not funny it is very sad. Stress is not good for his condition. He can only win by cheating. VOTE TRUMP so save America.
That makes no sense, just like Biden when he opens his mouth. Go Trump. Do not let those evil democrats cheat.
Biden is a sick man. He can only win by cheating. The democrats have cheating in their evil DNA. Trump has been the best president in years. He loves his country. Democrats hate America. VOTE TRUMP to save America from the evil socialist.

You're generous calling him "Mr. President;" I can't. Since he stole the presidency &amp; is squatting in the White House, I cannot call him president. Some say "respect the office." Unlike trump, I DO respect the office; that's why I can't respect the man making a mockery of it.

Given Trump's suburb tweet yesterday and election push back tweet today, I wonder if he plans to even finish the race into November. If not, who runs?
Man, everything this guy tweets is awful  1) mail-in voting and absentee are the same thing 2) there is no proof of widespread voter fraud from mail-in voting 3) Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to change an election date ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trump voted absentee ballot which is a far cry different then bulk mail in voting. For absentee ballots you need to be out of state, elderly, disabled or otherwise physically unable to vote. You also fill out a form that includes personal identification they verify...Trump is a fucking moron.

I can see DeWine this morning; "What's on my calendar today?'  "You have two meetings then a drive up to CLE to meet Trump at Burke Lakefront."  "I forgot about that!  How in the world do I get out of it?'  "Here's an idea; you could say you tested positive for COVID-19..."
I would say that I tested positive, too---if it meant that I wouldn't have to meet Trump on the tarmac...
I might say something like that if it meant that I didn't have to meet Trump on the tarmac...
My in-laws are Trump fans, but at least they wear masks (for the most part) and don‚Äôt think it is a hoax.
Thanks bro I‚Äôm just tired of being called racist like I literally was a liberal democrat (still pretty liberal) and a few weeks ago decided I‚Äôd rather have Trump than Biden. I wanted Bernie personally but he‚Äôs not in discussion anymore. I hate both parties now. I ‚ù§Ô∏è populism tho
I respect your views, sir. You probably calling me a racist bigot behind ur screen for supporting trump &gt; Biden but I promise you I‚Äôm not. I care. I hope u can respect my views as well. Hv a good day man
That‚Äôs why half of me liked Bernie and half liked trump. I liked bernies attack at the 1%
Not sure why I‚Äôm on here. I was just pointing out he has a large number of followers who like Trump. It was a joke and I certainly wasn‚Äôt mad.
Nah trump said terrible things too
Am I limited to #TrumpVirus when discussing #TrumpKillsSeniors ?  Or can I talk about how, as a 62 year old disabled man with stage 4 lung cancer, Trump is in court right now trying to take away my health insurance and kill me in that manner?
Because he IS Donald Trump POTUS. He is a man on a mission, he is driven he is the People‚Äôs President and anyone who does not see that literally has their head up their ass! Besides, you know the old saying, you can‚Äôt keep a good man down! We stand by &amp; love you
Those are legit facts. What did I say was false? Trump gave black Americans long-term HBCU funding lowest unemployment, wage growth first time in over decade, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones to spur growth in community. And all Biden did was say I‚Äôm a democrat I love u
Okay, this doesn't actually matter, but unless you were SURE that these weren't Trump internals, seems kinda risky to be *possibly* messing up data for your own guys. Like, lots of calculations, yes, in the Trump camp too, are made based on polling, and off data kinda hurts that
Biden was terrible in polls when he ran for president but Obama knew it was smart to pick him. Biden hurt black community in crime bills and now look who‚Äôs cleaning up Biden‚Äôs mess: trump: signing criminal justice reform.
Donald Trump doesn't have a religious bone in his body  Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America &amp; save America
U mean to tell me dis nihhga Dewine was so close to giving Trump covid and didnt follow through?!!!! WTF?!
Yes they all suck.  But Trump is a unique authoritarian threat.  The guardrails are breaking down.  So yes, unfortunately voting for Biden is just getting us back to the same old corruption we‚Äôre more comfortable with.  From there the fight continues.

When people run for election they say that they will do different things but it takes years to accomplish it might not even happen until after they leave office. Obama kept our country in peace. Trump is in this for money for his businesses and hasn't even been a good president.
Protesting in favor of the Black Lives Matter should never involve rioting and looting.  If you hate President Donald Trump, then vote for former Vice President Joe Biden less than 100 days frpm now in the November USA Presidential Elections.

She's so full of shut folks. Here's another fn lie. The fact is the only one who is committing voter fraud is Trump himself. Mail-in voting is a good process to avoid hacking by Trump‚Äôs boss dictator Putin. He knows this folks that is why he's tell bent on stopping it.

He always watches mouths when someone else speaks during his trump briefings. No reading lips or paying attention; it's child-like. Just watching mouths. And waiting for them to stop moving.
But Trump will say they have one.
Yes, Biden can. Trump is incapable of putting together a workable healthcare plan for the people. He does not possess the skills.
This is the wrong track for truth but, this is the correct track for the uneducated, ignorant and wannabes to be taken advantage of. 44th U.S. President Barack Obama took care of pre existing health conditions when he enacted the Affordable Care Act. Trump has not helped you.

The new rule Obama implemented was about fair housing for ppl of color. trump took this away and put in language that will give white investors and big corp. the opportunity to invest. What will it do? It will cause low income families n black owned businesses to be pushed out.
But by writing in or not supporting Trump‚Äôs opponent, albeit out ot a desire to be partisan, you are throwing your vote out.
Usually, men's short comings are not aired in eulogy.  In life it's said that Trump is corrupt, dishonest, lawless, and stricken with severe mental illness. Very few, with the exception of family, will care what is said of him, except maybe good riddance- a welcome departure.
Poll: Craziest b.s. from Trump today
And trump's slow response to COVID19 after saying it was a hoax and telling ppl to not wear a mask has resulted in over 150,000 deaths. The question is what are u talking about MAGA
And in 2015 Obama implemented a new in that act that would help low income families that trump rolles back. So what are we talking about here.
With all those communities hes going to have corporate America destroy as wealthy white investors tear down poc homes I wonder if ppl like u still glorify this tweet as trump quotes Walter Headly a known racist. B4 u say yes note that Twitter took it down because its hate speech
Too little too late for Trump!
Trump is totally unhinged. He will absolutely melt down as the election gets closer and closer. Cant wait to see his supporters melt away with him.
Where does Trump find these Genius Minds that  help him navigate the stormy seas of the campaign trail? How long before Paul McCartney sues them for illegally using his music for their Sick Carnival Roadshow?
That aint even a proper ration man, you got trump in there
Trump hurts god by breaking all Ten Commandments everyday
It's amazing how the the right wingers have made the NRA theirs and disregarded everyone else. I certainly don't agree with the corruption that  Wayne Lapierre is involved in or the massive intertwined relationship with Trump. Looks like it's time for the real NRA to clean house!

He is the most articulate man on the planet next to Trump so people can eat a dick. Seriously, what‚Äôs wrong with people?
Religion had a lot going for it until trump. Now it is a cult.
Yeah. Stupid people. I‚Äôm writing the NRA a check. I wonder if this is the same whistleblower who tried to get Trump impeached.
I would love for Donald Trump to prove at least 1 of these claims
You and Sally Yates are interchangeable. "Sally Yates is either lying or incompetent"  or Donald Trump is either lying or incompetent.  Same Same #TrumpHasNoCredibility #midwest
what if dewine didn't wanna meet trump so he faked having covid
Reading Rep Val Demmings tweet on the death and destruction of the hydrogen bomb, COVID has taken more lives to date and the killing is not over yet. Trump should be imprisoned for this.
Also, only Trump could think anyone could 'hurt God.'
Trump was able to create an economy that allowed me to move up and get a raise. We had been on a pay freeze for 5 years. He also supports the 2a for self protection, which is necessary where I live. I also believe in legal immigration and border security. Also trade agreements.
Hillary is the devil himself and you don't see how she would be worse shes had people killed trump hasnt im not defending trump im just saying anyone in their right mind would never choose Hillary id rather have bernie
You need to read the report. It said that if they had found Trump innocent they would have said so, but they did not. Plenty of evidence if you want to be open-minded enough to read it.

5\ Voting for the pig Tweeting Trump at this stage compares to pissing in America's pool.  Voting for the pig Tweeting Trump at this stage compares to flipping America the middle finger.  And republicans know exactly what I'm talking about.
4\ GOP voters tell me:  Trump puts cash in our wallets! "Hydroxywhatever" is the suppressed cure. Economics is a fake science. We need a businessman in the White House!  Because they love the sight of cops murdering Blacks, Latino kids in cages, and childish Bread and Circuses.
Here are fourteen things people think may be more popular than Donald Trump
2\ Now the pig Tweeting Trump wants voters to think that he's the only one who cares by saying that he can act himself. Even though we all know he can't.  Sadly, his gullible chump fan club will believe any lie he tells.  But fortunately no one else believes him anymore.
1\ For 2 months now the pig Tweeting Trump gets his incompetent pig of a Treasury Secretary to call Pelosi on the phone EVERY DAY to talk her into accepting a way-to-small stimulus.  Then the pig Tweeting Trump waits until there's no time left before he makes a lowball offer.
How is it Trump's fault that the governors closed businesses and cost people jobs??? And what about the people that refuse to go back to work because they make more sitting at home??

When he loses civil war might break out and they have no clue what they are doing. We didn't have civil war when Trump won or when Bush won in 2000 yet these dumb fucks will go along with his bullshit to cover for all the money he has stolen. He will try to burn it all down.
Honestly, I was thinking that the lying sacks of üí©that hate  more than they love this great country of ours must have paid these ‚Äúso-called‚Äù psychiatrists/psychologists to give Trump that rating. It‚Äôs all part of their TDS...it truly should be studied. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Hi President Trump's decision on TikTok is very weak, he claims they are stealing Americans info. So if this is true and he has proof then why give them 45 additional days to do more harm. He must think he is doing a deal and not looking after our safety
Wow what a weak decision on Tick Took, President Trump says the Chinese Government is getting info on Americans. So if this is true why give them 45 additional days to get info. You either close them down now or don't

trump wouldn't even know where to start in a conversation like this
...and then trump retweeted his supporters shouting White Power. And then there was that time trump said Nazis were fine people.... You guys are just dumb by choice!
You mean when trump retweets one of his supporter shouting white power?! Please go sit down.... #BLM
So that explains Trump! He could not look worse. Of course if he lost the ridiculous hair style &amp; orange makeup &amp; poorly fitting suits ‚Äî but nah ....
Also funny saying Trump cheated. Hillary couldn't even win an election that was rigged for her to win.
I think he's confusing the rapture with Joe Biden. And personally I'd like to see Trump raptured.
Fuck Trump
Trump is in Cleveland. Just spoke at Burke Lakefront Airport. Once again, he said Biden is against religion and the Bible. How ridiculous! The speech was filled with lies, misinformation and vague bragging.
That is ALL TRUMP has been doing since ELECTED.....if not HIS pockets than those of his family!
Gov Dewine thoughts and prayers are with you and Fran during this time. I am watching now &amp; POTUS just walked by Husted.....maybe it is best that you are not there. "YOU SIR ARE A TRUE REPUBLICAN!" Prayers being sent for a quick and easy recovery. Trump IS an idiot! He is calling
He didn't need to greet trump anyways.
Yea fuck Trump
Natural selection at work. Trump should make another suggestion if his supporters didn‚Äôt hear him clearly
No you are wrong Obama let the Bush FICA tax cut expire. FICA tax funds Social Security and it is a payroll tax just as is Federal Income Tax, State &amp; City income tax and the Medicare tax all are payroll taxes. Trump is targeting the FICA &amp; the IRS taxes.
trump is in cleveland???
John Lewis was a representative for Georgia. Easy mistake though. You trump cult members think all black people look alike.....
I think if they have all the documentation, it will be proved. They are investigating. You act as though it‚Äôs just a piece of gossip or a conspiracy theory. You honestly feel Trump is above such behavior?
Ur a dumbass voting for Trump or Biden.
I'm like 99% sure David is not visiting w Trump in Cleveland today.   I think it's important to make that clear as the director of battleground state comms for the DNC maybe.

Pleasantly surprised by all of the Biden support in and around the neighborhood that is hosting Trump‚Äôs private fundraiser tonight.  Thinking about setting up an Orange Crush stand on Lakeshore Boulevard to fundraise‚Ä¶
If you can't do the time don't do the crime. If you can't take the heat then get out of the kitchen. On 11/18/1978 the Rev. Jim Jones got 918 people to kill themselves. I fear Trump will hold a rally only instead of 918 it will be 9,000 people that die.
I never did like you but now by you backing this animal Trump you should get out of Ohio!!
Don't worry Tom you can have Trump as your cell mate!

NYT ran 5 times more stories about the scandal-free, transparent Clinton Foundation before the election than the self-dealing shell that was the Trump Foundation. More front-page stories about the mails in the 6 days before the election than ALL policy issues in the previous 69.
Trump‚Äôs not holding a gun/bat to anyone‚Äôs head! He‚Äôs not starting fires or bombing buildings! It‚Äôs the Democrats fault! Governors/Mayors are supposed to be keeping their constituents safe, they‚Äôre failing horribly by allowing the violence to continue, Dems want to disband police?

Same ! I‚Äôm in northeastern Ohio, in the Youngstown-warren area . I see tons of trump signs but I‚Äôve yet to see a Biden sign anywhere.
There are millions of reason why Ohio is pretty much a sure thing for President trump. If Biden wins he kill off millions of Ohio jobs, and leave the Ohio economy in dire straits. Plus he‚Äôs basically just a male Hillary. Pro globalism, anti worker, killer of the middle class.
More than ever, the public is counting on deliveries of their medications, supplies, and other critical letters and packages. Playing games and undermining the postal service is the last thing we should be doing right now.

The only Ohio politician who would go anywhere near Trump at his stop in Cleveland yesterday was thirsty-ass Christina Hagan. Analysis: Ohio GOP confused &amp; in shambles over Householder/First Energy crisis, but Democratic party too weak &amp; useless to capitalize on the moment.

When you fake covid to get out of spending the day with trump, nice move Dewine

DeWine's second "test" came back "negative" for COVID.  Analysis: first "test" was never "positive." It was an excuse to not be seen in public or have to speak to Donald Trump.

Same ! If trump has a rally in Ohio , I plan on bringing my whole family.
Trump also did admit to knowing Pedostien, and flat out stated he didn't like him so he never hung with him again. Had a few buisness dealings that fell thru. Trump even admitted this on national TV, directly after pedoman was arrested. Check your facts
It could be ! Israel loves president trump and according to Egypt the sharks work for Mossad!
Who is their audience? The only people who will watch this is and like it are Democrat‚Äôs that believe in good Republicans. They already hate Trump.  I am starting to feel like we have had this convo before and I‚Äôm losing my mind.
It's not that it's useless info. The reporter is trying to make the point that the US has a higher percentage of deaths per population than almost every other country and Trump's trying to call THAT useless info when it isn't either
This is like an Abbott and Costello sketch. Wonder why shit is still bad? Watch this. And if you somehow think Trump makes any sense, unfollow me now because I won't deal with your stupidity on my timeline
Trump lives matter.
#CouldBeALegitHeadline Trump sabotages his own re-election bid Biden wins..    With just weeks before the election, Trump fought hard to stop mail in ballots only to find out that more MAGA's use them then Democrats. GREAT thinking Mr. President or should I say EX- Mr. President

He‚Äôs kinda right, let a new band go on an award show with a Trump 2020 sticker on a guitar and watch how fast the industry forgets about them, also we have more censorship today then ever
Ohio is pretty much a done deal for trump! No one here will be willing to vote  their jobs in favor of the green new deal and Free job training. We‚Äôve Been there done that , and We know where that leads! Ohio would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. We‚Äôd never recover.
I watched Trump's press conference today &amp;  I swear he said that he was going to extend eviction moratoriums by Executive Order. Doesn't it piss you off that POTUS just SAYS things? he has zero intention of doing? so it doesn't even get reported since we all know it's bullshit?
It always ends with a "Trump 2020 hoot hoot" doesn't it?
But Trump actually was implicated as a pedo with the Miss Teen America pagaents
And just like that .. trump won Florida by a landslide!
Ok, Trump, my state is run by Republicans. So where‚Äôs my money? Where‚Äôs my money?
People common sense tell us that had tRump had a Healthcare plan that was better than Obama's Affordable Care Act. He would be on TV boasting about the plan. So that let us know there is no Healthcare plan. Please do not fall for the talk of no action.
Evidence? All remember from that time was trump closing the boarders and democrats calling him a racist and telling everyone to visit Chinatown.
I disagree with what trump did with DACA amnesty as well ! But would you really vote for the guy who wants open borders just in spite of trump‚Äôs daca decision?
Trump is so dumb he doesn't know how dumb he is.

tRump is a must. So do not get weary in well doing for we shall reap if we faint not.
I do not care of Biden pick an African American for VP or if he pick Elizabeth Warren. I want the best person for the job. Our major concern is to get tRump out of office so we can have a Country to build back better. An African American woman would be a plus, but defeating
Trump: "The Wall, Lock Her Up, and people dying of this virus, among  others is the thing of the past. Give it a rest.. I'm worry about how to win this election with every underhanded trick I can. Trust me, NO way are they sending me to prison. Besides it's all Putin's fault!"
Trump‚Äôs presidency is a national humiliation. The damage he‚Äôs done to our democratic institutions will take a long time to fix.
Becoming? Sir, Trump made us the laughingstock of the world years ago. Remember the world leaders at that summit laughing and making fun of him?  Yeah, pathetic little human being he is.
Joe Biden thinks he's running against himself and Trump thinks he's running against a man who isn't even eligible to run again. FFS
If trump gets another 4 years something has to be done to reign in the media.
Not really, Everything the leftist media has reported on trump has been either an out and out lie or highly questionable at best. Trump put his foot down with Russia, China, and Iran ! Where as looking at Biden‚Äôs past all you see is a long history appeasement.

Look, it's not that Trump's wrong.  COVID-19 will go away, as much as the flu goes away, but it's tone deaf in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
And Trump is clueless how history will portray him...I wonder how he sees his "legacy"? ü§î Yeah, I don't wonder that much...
Trump comes off pretty stupid, but he's smart enough to fleece Uncle Sam (basically us) for millions and millions of dollars.

Calm down preachers.  If God didn't want you to pray with masks on, he wouldn't have allowed Trump's inactions to infect the whole country.

My goal is to be alive when Trump leaves office.  My hope is that VP Biden wins big.  Trump &amp; Barr &amp; MAGA folks will of course contest the election.  Come January 21, the authorities move Trump's ass out of the White House and Pelosi moves in.  Later, SCOTUS installs VP Biden.

To be fair, Trump had "always been a Democrat" until he ran for President.

Yup.., he's right about the chickens though.., a whole bunch of republican chickens that won't stand up to Trump.  In metaphor speaking.

They literally threw a mini rally together and called it a press conference to get him in a better mood because he‚Äôs fuming over his campaign.
Trump's picks for all the government agencies were people who were against the mission of the agency. I remember reading the first list of picks for the heads of them with horror. It was clear they were put in charge to destroy their goal.
Tonight‚Äôs bizarre press ‚Äúconference‚Äù was thrown together at last minute with no real news, but because the president wanted to simulate one of his rallies with his customers after getting angry after a day of meetings about how bad his campaign is going.
Wow, just about everything about that Trump press ‚Äúconference‚Äù was a new level of bizarreness. He so wants to try to during these into his hate rallies. He even tried to build a nonpress cheering section for him.
So five years later we learn that Trump‚Äôs health care plan is actually.... ObamaCare but through executive order instead of federal legislation.

Ok üëå nobody denies Trump locker room talk isn‚Äôt out there at times but he is not a pedohile period it‚Äôs bs the left is creating to destroy a man that is trying to change the country for the best ( the left just can‚Äôt stand it ) period
Yes drain the swamp TRUMP 2020
Trump can only DELAY collection, he cannot waive or cancel it.  Companies to protect themselves are being advised to still collect the tax out of the employees pay, and hold it until it has to be paid.  If the company fails to collect and hold, they are likely liable for it.
Yeah...Liberals are always so angry. Where‚Äôs the love ? Trump people are so happy and they can‚Äôt stand it
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
Let Operation Warp Speed have this. If true this is huge. On another note TRUMP CURES CANCER
Only Trump can do this
Too late they have already exposed their agenda. Trump 2020
I saw a report that Kanye isn‚Äôt the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! üò°
Start by getting rid of Trump and his family along with McConnel, Graham, Jordan, and every Republican who voted against removing Trump from office.
Trump isn‚Äôt racist
Letitia James, NY State AG, is currently on " Morning Joe" tearing Wayne Lapierre and his NRA a new one. Hoping that she has the same energy against Trump with the investigation of the Manhattan DA. Emphatically,  she states, " No one is above the law".

The people of Ohio CD8 didn‚Äôt elect you to kiss Trump‚Äôs ass...grow a pair and represent SW Ohio, not a reality television fraud.
I feel like Trump saying ‚Äúin numerous categories were lower than the world‚Äù isn‚Äôt getting the attention I needs...    I guess when you deem 155,000 deaths  ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù one stupid has to outshine the other. #coronavirus #TrumpIsALaughingStock   #TrumpHasNoPlan
You‚Äôd let us Americans in right now? Coming from someone whose family may seriously choose New Zealand as an escape route if Trump gets re-elected.
Yep... Then we can elect another Trump. Lets get that started. Funny
Have you seen anything about a remark Trump supposedly made about not being seen for awhile?
ATTENTION: Trump's people gave the test to Governer Dewine, they said he was positive, he takes a 2nd test later in the day on his own and tests negative, Trump didn't want Dewine there because he encourages masks and speaks SCIENCE, JUST LIKE HE WONT LET DR. FAUCI SPEAK
Wait where is the fuckers in the comments saying good another trump voter behind bars
People who put Trump flags in their yard are just asking for attention and trouble. Actually I think all political flags are tacky no matter who it‚Äôs for, but Trump flags are expecially tackyüòâ
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Gotta love after  tries dunking on DeWine over getting COVID despite preaching masks it turns out DeWine is negative and Trump testing is just bad.
We won't have a democracy if he gets elected again. Trump and Barr will be our new rulers. That's terrifying.

Trump is not going to like that...Birx accidentally telling the truth.
Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
You would think  actually not having the coronavirus during Trump‚Äôs Ohio visit would be good news for the campaign, but instead it‚Äôs lead to reporting about... how flawed their own testing is.
Dewine power-played Trump. True conservatives despise Trump. It‚Äôs hilarious.
needs to be investigated for using tax payer dollars to travel to do presidential things that ends up turning into his campaign rallies.  I think that may be illegal. #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpFraud #Trump #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHasNoPlan #PresidentTrump
Can I rescind my membership of the white race? I mean, the fact that 50% of white folks would still vote for Trump certainly reflects lack of intelligence &amp; lack of values.
DeWine staffer: Sir, Trump is coming into town.   : I have COVID. Can‚Äôt  go darn.   Does this mean I‚Äôm now in charge?  DeWine: Suddenly, I no longer have COVID.
Trump says he going to do something outrageous &amp; repeats it a few times. Everyone says he just talking, trying to divert, he can't do that. Later we find out he did it, even if it was against the rules, Constitution, etc.
Not sure Trump has that much money. Might need to declare bankruptcy again.

Things Trump has wrecked while trying to convince Americans he should continue to be President: - The economy - Pandemic response - The postal service What else?
But  Trump literally already did it and called it his trade deal.
Trump‚Äôs own advisors recognize what a dolt he is...and the dangers of that self-serving idiocy.
Republicans: Support Trump--Boycott the Election
Head lines :  Trump mispronounces one word. No Head lines Joe Biden is a dementia patient
get off the fence, Meghan, and show some respect for your father.  Endorse Biden and help get rid of trump.
In the past 48 hours alone, we‚Äôve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden‚Äôs personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
They certainly do. This something that could have been done years ago but President Trump DID it
Reminder that in ‚Äò16 Trump dodged a primary debate for a supposed veterans event his campaign then manufactured and then got caught failing to make the promise donation...
Never heard prison referred to as a beautiful resort, but given Trump‚Äôs mental loss, it may be true.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

Just a friendly reminder that Trump's administration has done more to "infringe" on your second amendment rights in 3 1/2 years then the Obama/Biden administration did in 8 years.

It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting that Trump of all people would attack  as a man of faith.  Completely unfounded slander.
Trump has destroyed millions of American jobs this year alone. Manufacturing was in recession BEFORE the pandemic. You are delusional.
Still reviewing authority of Trump to issue Executive Order that suspends or changes the IRS tax code on payroll taxes (legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law by a former president). The law is clear; it‚Äôs not a matter of interpretation for Executive power.
I am still researching on what authority Trump can issue an Executive Order that suspends or changes the IRS tax code, which is legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law by a former president. The law is clear; it‚Äôs not a matter of interpretation for Executive power.
‚ÄúOhio Governor has contracted coronavirus‚Äù is exactly the headline the WH needed from today‚Äôs Trump visit to Ohio.
DeWine tests positive for #CV19 based on test taken in order to meet Trump today in Cleveland.
Governor cancels coronavirus briefing to greet Trump, which leads him to learn he‚Äôs positive for the coronavirus.
Show this to Trump.  I'm sure Trump's can be far better.  But RIGHT NOW Nixon has the best presidential resignation letter in all of history.
If only the rest of Ohioans were protected by a testing regime as much as Trump has ensured he is.

Trump isn‚Äôt ever going to hire you, nor will Fox, Ari.
You‚Äôre projecting. Trump was too scared to stand up to China on the virus or Hong Kong because he was afraid it might prevent his disasterous trade deal China is already breaking.
Yep, that‚Äôs utter garbage alright. Trump can‚Äôt even keep China keep to half of its commitment in his so called trade deal after nearly putting the country in a recession with his disasterous trade war.
Correction: Trump Campaign circulates and files petitions to collude to put totally unqualified man on Ohio ballot for president in racial stunt.

It‚Äôs ignorant as hell to think that all trump supporters are religious, racist, and rednecks. Like seriously can you tell me why you hate him so much? Genuinely wanting to know

Donald Trump is a National embarrassment on the world stage, we must take the White House away from him he doesn't deserve to live within the scared walls of The People's House never has deserved it and never will. Vote on November 3rd
Don‚Äôt let the Democratic Party run game, Biden ain‚Äôt shit just like Trump. #NoVote #DefundThePolice
Because Trump did!!!!!
This isn‚Äôt opinion this is fact. Republicans are so worried trump will lose the election that they are trying to steal votes away from Biden
Trump needs some new material.  He keeps repeating the same thing over and over...very annoying.
Where's Trump's Deutsche Bank records? Oh, that's right..they are in the hands of Cyrus Vance. Are you watching Letitia James' (State of NY AG) big announcement tomorrow at 11:30 AM, Kayleigh?
Trump's daily "Covid" briefings should be called "How many Lies can you tell in 30 minutes." Or "How many false self-aggrandizing phrases can you utter."
Seriously cause the right thinks it's to take  for Trump
Trump is technically correct. The Hatch Act doesn‚Äôt apply to the President though there were still a line they wouldn‚Äôt cross and it does apply to his staff.
. is correct. Trump‚Äôa trade war with China has been an unmitigated disaster.
Guess what  nobody cares, still voting for Trump in November.
Trump is going to BLOW UP!
President Trump said today on TV that it had not been determined for sure what caused the explosion. Did you not even listen ?
I doubt Trump knows that Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
I can‚Äôt either.  Trump 2020   There I have it figured out

Birx lost all credibility when she said that Trump was attuned to the data and science behind the 'Rona. Trump is now distancing himself from Birx because she accidentally told the truth in her recent interview.
It‚Äôs the height of ego for the Trump campaign to think a debate has the potential of swaying a voter who‚Äôs already looking to cast their ballot at the earliest opportunity.
Facebook knows Trump ads are false ‚Äî but no one is telling its users. ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶
Such a rebel aren‚Äôt ya?
Me! I'm in Ohio. Startes Twitter during the impeachment. My town loves the trump goon! So does my family. Fb is full of Magats ! Help!
They will not be "debates."  Trump will lie and Biden will correct him.  Trump screws up, MSM will ignore it.  Biden makes even a minor error, MSM will crucify Biden.  There is no upside for Biden. Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was afraid; NO ONE WILL BELIEVE TRUMP.
That would be a negative on holding a debate. There is no way that Trump is going to release those voluntarily,  come hell or high water.
You don't help another candidate you are running against.  While I don't think Trump campaign is providing ‚Äúsubstantial assistance‚Äù to West, it appears close to colluding.   /EOM
Is this just another way of directing funds to Trump or one of his kids?
Trump is going to lose because he is an asshole ASSUMING young people and minorities bother to vote.  The summer protests show those groups are passionate but in 2016 they didn‚Äôt vote due to a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton.  Old man Biden isn‚Äôt exactly Obama as far as coolness.
I hope Biden just tells them to f'off.  These "debates" will be Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  No upside for Biden.  Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was "afraid."  No one will believe it.
This list is a joke.  Biden needs to tell Trump to go f' himself.
My understanding (unconfirmed) is that the firm represents the Trump Campaign in Ohio.  Kayne is using other law firms that are also representing the Trump Campaign.
West needs just 5,000 valid registered voters signatures to qualify.  His "campaign" is being helped by the GOP.  His lawyer/law firm is the same as that working for the Trump Campaign. What a surprise.

Could be part of it, but Trump finally figured out a large percentage of FL voters vote by mail, so by restricting it, he's shooting himself in the foot.
Any idea if his team (should say GOP Team Trump) was able to obtain the number of signatures and whether they are VALID?  Kayne's had trouble in the past getting enough valid registered voter signatures. Was the deadline today? Thanks for the update.
Trump never said that but of course you don‚Äôt care about facts before the infamous lie that CNN spreads  he unequivocally condemned the white supremacists who showed up in Charlottesville get your facts straight
Trump needs you on his campaign staff.
If Trump had said that to that host all hell would break loose.

Good morning! As I've mentioned I'm in Ohio. My town still loves this goon. Please tell me we will have enough votes to completely dominate Trump! My anxiety is high. There is still so much support for him in my hometown.  ü§¢ü§Æ
President Trump has policies to help minority communities. They only see the Democrats when it‚Äôs election time. Then here they come with more empty promises
Just because Trump said we are doing better than the world doesn't mean he doesn't understand the 'Rona data.
thinks workers should carry the risk of investing in a dying industry. How is that letting people have power over their money. Care to answer
A Pence pardon in this situation would be an abuse of power and an impeachable offense. The pardon won‚Äôt hold up to the litigation that follows. Trump can‚Äôt escape the multiple state felonies he will be indicted on, prosecuted and jailed. But otherwise OK.
They are afraid of having their press credentials revoked, or being used as a verbal punching bag when Trump calls them out for a particular , tough question.

Trump actually is killing Biden. Biden isn't trying anything to kill back. This is an example of poor leadership from Biden.  is attacking both Trump and Biden with the facts.

Well, actually  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump, when he loses, blame the Democrats for appealing to former Republicans instead of leftists.
Good point and if Democrats vote anti trump then that‚Äôs as bad as republicans voting anti Hillary in 2016. This will be a never ending cycling of voting against a candidate instead of putting up a better candidate.

I will not vote for someone who very well could be worse than Trump, after Biden said that he agrees with Trump sending the fighters or ‚Äúrioters‚Äù to jail or prison is absolutely disgusting. Biden has created the system, Trump is only enabling and worsening the system.
I'd rather not vote for Trump 2.0
The reality is this: Its not going to help progressives or far left to splinter the vote. How much closer to your ideals will we be if we have 4 more years of Trump?  Answer that question. No bullshit about your ideals (which i agree with, btw), just answer that question.

It's so sad to see more than one Grown Trump man act so childish
If you had done a hard shutdown, demanded and ENFORCED a mask mandate from the get go, and had not given in to the trump humpers, we wouldnt be in this position.  We are going to shut down again.   Your feckless leadership has gotten us here.
No need to answer the question. If you are unwilling to see that the only way to get to Medicare for all is by making sure trump is defeated, you're honestly too ignorant to talk to.  This is not about what you want. Joe isnt my first choice, either.  Im not a selfish asshole.
trump what‚Äôs he got to lose!!!! He is not in it for the money or fame!!!! He already has both!!!! So he‚Äôs in it for you and me and I stand with him all the way!!!
Biden is Trump 2.0Jim I hope you saw johnathan Swift and Chris Wallace interview trump....THATS how you guys need to deal with him
Thigh Land is not a country.  But can be about foreign relations !!!  Trump lovers are like those people on Family Fued that start yelling GOOD ANSWER when one of their family gives a dumb answer.  Nice glasses btw
Hey Judge, Anonymous blocked me when I called them out about Nibiru and how they are trolling and making up lies about Trump
Biden can't fix crap he claims it's Trump's fault for the economy when actually it's not it was due to the pandemic sloppy sleep Joe has shit for brains
Lol do some research trump is passing bill after bill
Come on this one is to much of a soft toss question just so you get like !üòâ We both know that President Trump is  awesome!
OK FOLKS. HERE‚ÄôS YOUR WAKE-UP CALL. TRUMP‚ÄôS GOING AFTER SOCIAL SECURITY.
After having heard Trump stumble through many a scripted speeches, and after hearing ‚Äúüê± grabbing‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúbleeding orifices‚Äù, I don‚Äôt want to hear a WORD about ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs gaffes‚Äù or his unproven dementia.
I don‚Äôt understand voting for trump honestly. Dude has done literally nothing but objectively bad things
Can't read between the lines Greg? I think Trump is full of shit, Coumo is full of shit &amp; de Blazio is full of shit. None of them have done anywhere near a good job with their virus plans since this started.
Regardless of what the current polls are saying, I will not relax until Jan. 20th &amp; I physically see Joe Biden getting inaugurated. Until then, Trump‚Äôs capable of just about anything, including destroying our democracy to stay in power. He‚Äôs a sociopath.
I think trump has down syndrome
trump wants to ban tiktok and not the kkk.......smh
Too late... trump already crippled our economy

No that would be trump
Even all the boats are white.
At this point, even a tomato could beat Trump.
trump will go full monte with his executive orders if he isnt stopped .   The 1A is under assult by him because he didnt like something the kids did or others said or that Twitter and Facebook decided to grow a set and stop being his propoganda machine
Imagine putting forth such a lackluster candidate that even against Trump, you had to tap a Republican of Nicaraguan descent who funded, promoted, and praised right wing Contra death squads to "rev up" latinx voters
They EMBEZZLED 60 MILLION DOLLARS !!!  There is NO fighting back.     Just like Trump EMBEZZLED from his Charity Foundation to  buy pictures of himself and fix up his golf course and he was forced to make retribution and disban his charity .  He can no longer have a charity in NY
‚ÄúBoth the Trump and Biden campaigns have also traded accusations that their candidate has dementia‚Äù
Trump is one flew over the cookoos nest
Never Trump means more globalism, more assaults on free speech, more riots, more death.
If I were Trump I would be worried. You cannot guarantee people who test negative are not infected.

Listen, I can't stand Trump, but I'm not confident that he's going to lose this election.
Yes they do... you and trump are the farthest from it as can be
So apparently Trump was considering film school before ultimately deciding to go into his dad's real estate business, and as bad as he became, I feel like we dodged a bullet in not having to see what tacky shit he would have produced had he gone the other direction.
4/..totally selfish and totally counter productive!!  Any action taken other than voting for Biden and Blue in general is a vote for Trump and is unforgivable.  Save your protest vote for 2024.  Or better yet,  run yourself and convince us we should vote for you.  You have 4 yrs
2/...your agenda... they should not be more than 2 people on a ballot at that point imo... that‚Äôs what primaries are for... but Hillary and Dems were far closer to what we wanted than Trump and the GOP as we see. They are just the opposite.  Now is no time for temper tantrums ...
I mean trump isn‚Äôt known for doing this with good reason
I willl not be voting for Trump... and I‚Äôm a white American.
Trump is in it for the long haul, bank on it !!!
Trump and Biden both suck üòÇ

2. Trump obviously had some learning disability and I bet he was a late reader and his issues pronouncing words screams of some sort if dyslexia which is why he probably struggled with standardized tests. But his compensation and coping mechanisms are one of the reasons he‚Äôs

I literally don‚Äôt understand this... Mr Trump continues to declare Covid is ‚Äúharmless‚Äù... so why hasn‚Äôt he voluntarily allowed himself to contract it to prove how harmless it is instead of allowing the ultimate protections against him getting infected with it?!

Ohio loves Trump!
Mr Trump has been royally hurting God for a very long time as far as I can see based on his abhorrent behaviors! The two greatest commandments‚ÄùLove God! And LOVE your neighbor as you love yourself‚Äù appear to be unknown by him!

Also funny saying Trump cheated. Hillary couldn't even win an election that was rigged for her to win.
Makes one wonder what happened to all those Latino children that disappeared with tRump's anti immigration policy. When asked to locate them they had no clue where they went. For Christ sake, they gave them to people and no record was kept? That's child trafficking! SAD!!!

John Lewis was a representative for Georgia. Easy mistake though. You trump cult members think all black people look alike.....
Liberals: Your "totally not Trump" savior
I wouldn't bother arguing. Some liberals are so desperate for electoral politics to swoop in and finally do *something* that they'll cling to (and excuse) literally anything. It's like Trump's supporters blindly swallowing everything *he* says. Same concept, just a diff facade
TRUMP: ‚ÄúI made the sky Blue. I know all the bluest blues. Some people are saying that when the sky is not blue it‚Äôs because of Obama and China. I don‚Äôt know who said that, but it‚Äôs important we listen‚Äù  wHY aRe PEoPlE aRGUiNg WITh thE PresIDeNT wHEn hE sAId tHE SkYs BLue?
Trump amd his son receive the most death threats. ‚ÄúTolerant‚Äù leftists.
Trump is going to try and clean some dirty laundry
If nothing else, Trump will have tested the resiliency of this political experiment called a ‚ÄúDemocratic Republic‚Äù with a representative government &amp; ‚Äúchecks &amp; balances‚Äù. Cracks are appearing but, hopefully, the foundation will hold.
Trump can say whatever he wants apparently but when lebron is asked a question and gives his opinion he gets ripped apart by everyone for speaking his opinion when he was askedü§îü§î
Trump has never grasped the ‚Äústatesman-like‚Äù notion that, once elected, you become every citizens president-not just the people who voted for you. He‚Äôs never demonstrated one iota of interest in uniting the country.

No, they really don't. Look into their leadership. They're simply unhappy with the face on their brand of fascism...they'll continue to push it (and succeed) no matter who wins this election.  They're taking monetary advantage of liberals' vehement hatred of Trump, nothing more.
Agreed, but how can any sane person vote for Kanye (or Trump for that matter) waste their vote on this imbecile? I just don‚Äôt get it
DOMA, Iraq, crime bill, PATRIOT Act, bussing stances, segregationist buddies, helped set up the concentration camps Trump's using, drone record in the Obama admin.....  TL;DR - Yes. He's a fascist.
Black people aren't voting for Kanye.  We remember what he said and thought about Trump.
You are wrong Trump does not have the power to run states or cities, that is up to local and state Governments.
Lincoln Project is a Republican outfit that funnels cash to far-right think tanks. Dunking on Trump a couple times doesn't make them the progressive "heroes" liberals seem to keep thinking they are. They're not on your side.
The article clearly gives the time of the picture...which was stolen by the Trump campaign and doctored for the purposes of propaganda.
Everyone 24 hours ago: Wow..simple follow up questions and basic pushback works wonders when Trump is full of shit.  Reporters today: *crickets chirping*
Today's headline is literally "This Just In, Someone Told CNN That They Do Not Like Trump".  "Breaking News.. Trump Haters Hate Trump".
You make a reasonable and thought provoking argument.  But if Trump wins there won't  be anything to stand up for anymore. I do not disagree with you.  But you know we'll never get folks to back a liberal candidate.  So, I'm asking,  ate you willing for 4 more years of trump?
There is always room for dissent.  Just not in Trump world.
I have searched the web and still no instances of Trump using the word "stormtrooper". I have though found many instances of liberal main stream media and liberals like Pelosi using it. So keep drinking the Kool aid.
The wrong choice makes a target for Trump that just might swing this election.
Trump is killing us!!!
You are straight up lying.  We are dying,  hungry,  losing are homes.  Please stop lying to us.  Trump will throw you under the bus. He's done it with everyone else.  Please tell us the truth!
Why is trump still POTUS?  It‚Äôs all a mystery
Gov. Mike DeWine postpones Thursday coronavirus briefing to greet President Donald Trump    And in doing so, lost my future vote.
Doing a bit of a social experiment over on facebook.. It amazes me how the only people that can't manage to follow the simple instructions are the Trump supporters... Actually I am not amazed at all.. #TheRock2024 #TheRockForPresident
I have never once heard Trump refer to federal law enforcement officers as "stormtroopers".
The best Trump interview of the day.....
Trump yesterday gave his full throated endorsement of Florida going ahead with its mighty mail in vote campaign.   They have one of the largest in the USA.   Then he turned around last night and went to court to stop Nevada from implementing theirs.   Total hypocrit
trump sees himself in everything.  HE is the angry man....HE is the one out of control.  HE is the one obsessed with Obama.      Clinton and Bush41 became fast friends.  The Obamas and Bush43 have become friends.   Think ANY of them will become friends with Trump any time soon?
Hey.. wasnt Fauci &amp; Co.'s March prediction 2.5 to 3 MILLION DEAD by now? Trump has us at FIVE PERCENT of that - even with the "car crash is Covid death" padding. What would you have done different? Shout "EVERYBODY PANIC, RIGHT NOW!"? You'd own the 3/25/2020 "Nat'l FOOD RIOTS"?
I fear SPEAKING - putting out my TRUMP 2020 sign - bc I don't want the union member driving the mail truck to see that sign and "forget" to drop off, pick up, or timely deliver to BoE, my mail-in ballot. Think I'll GO to BoE, GET my ballot, TURN IN myself, THEN post my yardsign.
This is really important for Trump since Dewine is very popular. Although Kasich ignored Trump in 2016 but Trump still won Ohio.
Community Rallies Behind Pizza Joint After Woman Tries To Cancel It for Flying Trump Flag
Honestly Biden wasn't my first choice, also honestly Trump screwed things up worse than I ever imagined anybody could &amp; continues to get worse daily.
If Biden wins we are Screwed! Imagine if Trump said this, there would be a tsunami of news coverage and all of it negative!
Just imagine if Obama ever made a video like this... ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù ‚Äúdictator‚Äù just 2 out of many words that would be used if it was Obama. But, it‚Äôs trump, so nobody cares.
Trump sent Army Corp of engineers to set up the Javitz center approx 1000 treated in a month.  The Navy Hospital ship Comfort treated less than 200. The elderly patients could have been sent to 1 of these 2 places. Instead they were sent back to NH by a Cuomo mandate. Guilty!!

You aren‚Äôt fit to be a press secretary but here you are. tRump isn‚Äôt fit to sit in the Oval Office yet we‚Äôre dealing with that corrupt fraud.  Where‚Äôs trump‚Äôs taxes? Where‚Äôs almost 200,000 Americans that were affected with covid? Where‚Äôs your intelligence? Where‚Äôs your dignity?
Democrats can't handle the truth. They still can't accept Trump as POTUS their hate for him consumes every single one of their miserable lives. It must be a bitch falling asleep every night thinking of ways to screw over America. Buckle up Buttercups you got 4 more years coming
What is WRONG w/ppl??  I was commenting during his speech earlier &amp; I kept seeing tRump 2020 &amp; all kinds of shit lije that. Amazing how damned stupid tgey r out there!  Guess the drank damned koolaide too!ü§¨
After watching Trump‚Äôs disastrous interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios, just how in the hell is it that Trump is a graduate of the Wharton School?
So now, according to Trump, mail-in voting is OK in Republican states-not so much in Democrat states.
Acton, &amp; DeWine generally have taken decidedly scientific based approach to this crisis, unlike other GOP leaders who‚Äôve focused on ‚Äúeconomy only‚Äù based choices, or Trump-based choices. I‚Äôm glad to be here compared to other GOP lead states, though I‚Äôm missing WA State right now.
I guarantee that if someone asked Trump about the Secretary's design choices, he'd take the bait.
If Trump wanted to pull out of the debates, would your stance be the same?
Neil Young announced he is taking legal action against the Trump campaign to force them to stop using his songs.    I wonder how much Trump spends in legal fees per year and who is paying for it?  Worth checking in to
EVERY deal Trump makes NEEDS to be FULLY investigated.  Its more than likely totally shady.  Like this one and like the deal with Tic  Toc having to pay a ''fee'' and every deal, i have NO doubt Trump has his hands in someone pocket...He is THE mocst corrupt POTUS EVER
70% of the universe thinks  Trump is full of shit.   30% thinks the 70% is full of shit.  Trump dosnt think at all

We will be sticking different #TRUMP t-shirts from now till the election üó≥ everyone. You can shoot us a message to see if we have your size or stop in to grab some thing during normal gym hours.
of course they do.  they are why we have trump ....  they are no longer a party.  they are a cult
Joe and Bernie are working together and Joe has adopted alot of Bernies policies to one degree or another.   At least its a step in the right direction.  Trump will decimate and destory all hope for any of those changes and if the GOP retains the Senate, you can count on it
youre voting for trump.  Biden is alot closer to giving you those things.  Most of them are part of his platform NOW.  But, youre wasting a vote on something that will NEVER happen.    Vote Blue this year, then vote green when theres actually a green candidate worthy of a vote
there is no worse version of trump, .he's it.  either you dump him and the confederacy he represents, or you give him another 4yrs to actually become something worse
youre not voting green, youre voting red.  ANY and ALL votes cast or not cast for Joe Biden IS a vote for Trump.  It is your right, of course, but you are bending the country over the chair in the process and if Trump wins goodbye to nature, alternative energy, and the planet
hes 100% better than Trump on every level.  NO candidate is ever perfect ! But, Biden is 1000 steps closer to where we want to be than where we are now.  And theres alot more than just Biden to worry about.  Senate and House seats.   State and local offices judges and issue. VOTE
they all migrated to the US and got jobs in the Trump Administration
Lord, please let that be true !!!  Ohio NEEDS to get back to its blue collar heritage and ethics and get out from under the American Taliban Trump loving conservatives already !!!!
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA......you're 3 1/2 yrs too late on that Madam Governor.   Trump done spent over 3 Trillion that we aint never gonna see again.   NOW you want to worry about the debt NOW right before the election
to be fair.....he is Aurstralian, but he's lived and worked in America for a very long time and he just married Betsy Woodruff of Politco and MSNBC fame....but this interview should once and for all show people just how unhinged Trump truly is and its past time for him to go
AMEN !!!! Ive been waiting 4yrs for someone, ANYONE, to talk to Trump the way Wallace and now Swan have done.   The WH Reporters collectively have NO balls whatsoever and have NEVER asked a tough question, let alone stood up to Trump and not let him get away with his lies and BS
I was  15 when Nixon was elected to office in 1968...and I was 21 when they escorted him out the door in 1974.  In fact, I was stationed at Quantico where they keep Marine1 that took him to Andrews.  And thru it all, Trump STILL managed to be a worse POTUS than even Richard Nixon

thats true of trump, not biden.   so far, biden hasnt told us to drink bleach to cure covid.   hasnt been a blubbering fool trying to hold a daily press breifing nobody cares about

Sean.....go back to Dancing with the Asshats.   As always, what you say about others is only true of you.  Its Trump that wants no part of debating
Lightfoot, DeBlasio, Durken, Wheeler all need to step down. They're the ones dividing the country their hate for Trump outweighs their love for the USA Thank you for the courage to fight for your beliefs. VOTE RED
The entire nation needs to rebel &amp; shout-out against attempts to sabotage the postal service in order to give Trump a leg up. Elderly Trump voters have as much right to avoid COVID as elderly  Biden voters-or any voter for that matter.
And Joe Biden is your answer??????......im not a fan of either but to say Trump is losing it when Joe is OBVIOUSLY suffering from some sort of mind illness is disingenuous man.

But trump might if you split the vote.
Please. Can we just get rid of Trump?
I agree. However, trump is not a boogey man,  he is THE Boogey Man!
Mr.  Knight,  this is the fight of our lives. Please don't split the vote. When trump is gone we can work on all the other stuff.

Trump doesn't care.
Trump is extorting tic tic for his cut
Disappointing that any people of influence in the local area still support Trump. I suppose they are pleased with their tax cuts and fewer regulations on their businesses.
We have 328,000,000 people living in the United States. How is it that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the top two candidates available to run our country? These are the top two turds on the pile of 328,000,000 people? We're being fucked, big time!
This is what the leadership of  thinks of you, liberals.  Remember this next time you help them make money for all the far right think tanks they fund because they dunked on Trump a few times.
Which part is "stupid"?.. is it "those cages were built under Obama's administration"?... is it "these hotel rooms are better than cages"?... or is it simply any suggestion that Trump might not be 100% responsible for every single evil in the history of the world?
the end of trump and trumpism
except that, yes, Biden IS good.  Especially compared to Trump
Trump petitions the government for the right to 'hire foreign workers' EVERY YEAR at his resorts !!!!!  And he does it with construction projects like building his hotel in DC.   And since when does Trump care about executive compensation?  Must be more to this story
Well.... Im sure tomorrows headline will be 'Trump fires Homeland Inspector General"
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE !!!
Trump is a carrier !!!!   He spreads disease and death wherever  he goes. !!!! It explains why everyone around him is getting it  except him.   Put him back in his bunker and dont let him out except on election day !!!
Trump was in Texas after giving the virus to their representative in congress spreading lies and the virus in a state so infected after following Trumps lead that they are setting records in cases and deaths and the Gov  has had to shut back down.  Will be tough to win TX on that
After WHAT? Discussions with Trump?  Why?  It had better be in order to warn him they were going to have a free hand to post as they want as always no matter WHAT Trump thinks about it.
There are total aholes and then there are trump lovers...
things wont change until trump is gone and we have someone at the top giving the RIGHT messages ALL the time and doing the RIGHT things the governement should be doing ALL the time.  And THEN, hopefully, we will see this thing turn around and finally we can breatheLive with it. Your inaccurate and one-sided reporting triggered Trump‚Äôs distain for many in the media.

Youve made youre prediction a little too early. 3rd Quarter GDP growth may change the econpmy keys. Also Trump may end the war in Afghanistan before the election giving him a foreign policy success.
Yes. And Trump is doing whatever he wants. Look how many times Seperation of Powers has already been ignored. He has been deteriorating the checks and balances his entire time in office.
Yeah, it has nothing to do with the fact that TikTok is Chinese gov't spyware and they can use it to steal personal information, banking details, or anything else you have on your smartphone.  You idiots hate Trump so much, you'll side with a foreign gov't that spies on you.

I have no faith in Trump. I believe he is a horrible human being. He is a repulsive liar and not fit to lead. That‚Äôs where the analysis ends for me.
But Trump has no problem being reliant on a foreign nation for election help. WTF.

Funny. The gaffe machine is human and Trump can't catch any breaks? #PresidentTrump

Anyone working for the trump campaign is evil. This wasn‚Äôt a smear attack against Biden which means nothing coming from the sources. This lying to parents to send their children into danger. Where is the land in sand for their supporters to be held accountable.
And he has lied about this before to the extent that he has even claimed that the factories are being built but nobody could identify where. Lies don‚Äôt create jobs. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúvisions‚Äù never become reality.
He spends so much time talking about Biden and Obama. I don‚Äôt recall any foreign leaders laughing at Obama or Biden. Trump is pathetic.
Donald Trump is a criminal and traitor. Those who support him are amoral degenerates and imbeciles. We do not need a nation ruled by ignorant unskilled weaklings, as all right wing extremists are.

What good are laws if there is no enforcement? Trump and his band of misfits have repeatedly ignored laws and laughed at those who have complained to the point that nobody even tries to hold them accountable at this point.
Trump‚Äôs presidency raises major ethics concerns everyday and nothing happens.

Please don't have me spell "rhinoceros." The word "elephant" is easier to spell. I was really anticipating your next question on the cognitive test.
Geraldo is just like Trump film flam man. Remember Al Capone‚Äôs fault?
Why dont you form your own opinion instead of piggy backing off every single thing your commander in chief decides to do. This scares me because if joe gets elected what are you going to talk about? Like your career is done if trump isnt president. Lmao you have no content.
So it turns out Trump's big healthcare plan was just Obamacare but he puts his name on it and pretends it's completely different....
I have literally never seen somebody so obsessed and career dependent upon mocking one man. I wonder who your audience even is because nobody I know ever even mentions you. Your jokes flat out suck. You just mock trump all day long. At a certain point you just shake your head...
Thank you!
Which one is the elephant? Okay, which one looks closest to an elephant! Got you!!!
This won't be the last #pandemic. If we correct our course, it will go better. #Trump has degraded our response capacity.
Hope for what? It literally doesn't matter. Either you're for America or for Trump.
Come on man, which one is the elephant?  via
This supports my theory that anyone who still embraces Trump is a truly horrible person. Sorry you had to put up with such bs.
Now, in this test which one is the elephant?
It's already starting...  RUSSIA!!!
Okay. Now, which one is the elephant?
Right.  I see folks talking about the cost of Obamacare, but we shouldn't forget it was Trump who's elimination of the minimum annual fee of $75 caused lots of younger healthier participants to exit and drove costs for others u p.
Just today, Trump intell people once again catches Vlad sticking his nose illegally in or elections. All the work the Republicans did to put them in their place destroyed in less than 4 years. Why the love for Russia? They have nothing economically to offer us. They are the enemy
Seems like this should be getting at least as much attention as sports &amp; Trump today, right? #ohshit #ClimateChange
It goes without saying at this point, but Trump is a fucking moron.
They all lie from time to time, however making empty promises, that are actually lies are not necessary. Checking my self-esteem at the door won't happen. I certainly don't support sexual predators like Trump or Clinton. And criminality deffinently is not a trait to be admired.
I'm so excited(!) for Trump's upcoming executive orders creating penicillin. And cheese fries #Obamacare
We don't need to illegally use foriegn aid to being elections. You have no clue what a next term for Trump would be. He doesn't either. By the way, where's the healthcare bill he said he was signing this week. Brainwashed people support habitual liars.

Plenty of people said Trump being president would lead to disaster
The #MalignantNarcissist needs to hear the cheers of the idiots who still think he gives a shit about them or this country. How small of a man is  This country will be great again in January when Joe is in the WH and Trump is in jail.
At the Trump presser, the muthafucka suddenly sent to hand out masks WASN'T WEARING A MASK! So each elite, rich, white Trump club member could be infected as they accepted a mask. This is insane cult behavior.
I know what you mean. I'm terrified as well. There's so much about the Trump cultists that is terrifying. The complete lack of critical thinking, the violence, the racism, so many things

This already exists asshole. It's called the ACA. Also the Trump administration is in court right now trying to fight the requirement of pre-existing conditions. I can't believe there are people stupid enough to eat this shit up.
Falsehoods and Failures: Trump During COVID-19 (8/7 Update)

this Ohioan wishes there had been a follow up for  when he claimed the divisive, racist. incompetence of trump (and the death of 160,000 Americans from Covid) was worth it because of some judges.
President Trump says he'll sign an executive order on payroll taxes, student loans, and unemployment -- but the order remains questionable on how it will be funded without Congressional authorization.
Trump went to play golf expecting congress to get a deal done...they didn‚Äôt so now he has to do a press conference from his golf club...this is the same guy that said he‚Äôd be too busy to golf...yet here he is. Another weekend, another few rounds, another grift...

Everything about Trump is antithetical to Christian beliefs. Everything.
They‚Äôve been looking into him for 4 years!  And all they have is the stuff they made up!  Manafort and Cohen and Gates are shady by themselves, nothing to do with Trump or the campaign.  The real criminals are all from the Obama administration.  But you already know this.
Congress is supposed to work together on a bill. House has passed their side, Senate should be negotiating with House. Final goes to Trump. GOP is politicizing this entire thing at the expense of those needing relief from virus economically.

Daddy trump please keep tik tok up a bitch won‚Äôt know what to do with her life if you take it down
He seems to be unaware that you only take such a test when there are issues that necessitate taking one.  There's a reason Trump has taken one &amp; a reason why Biden hasn't needed to take one.  Let's see his long-form health records.  #TrumpsNotWell
"Pulling up in ah" Obama but the inside Donald Trump
Whoever is following me I need some faith and I need some right now.i have a feeling Trump won't win this election. I want him to but to much against him. Please change my mind
Like literally these people make no sense! You‚Äôre racist if you support trump, you‚Äôre a pedophile if you support either of them but then they say they don‚Äôt support either of them. Well hate it to break it to you but voting third party is literally a wasted vote
Trump is not, nor does he speak English...So there's that...But, nice try clown...
"Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump said. "He's against God, he's against guns, he's against energy, our kind of energy," the president said.
disclaimer that I'm never advocating for someone's death but wtf would happen if Trump and Biden both died in some crazy natural disaster or something at a debate man that'd be nuts
Have u seen the video of trump sluring his words or is that ok
It‚Äôs why I get furious whenever anyone calls Trump an aberration, and not the logical result of the Republican project. All it takes is a quick look at how MLM schemes are 100% entangled with Evangelical Christianity and republican leadership. The Venn diagram is a circle.
And it's now this. He has yet to show an actual example of anybody other than Trump saying "Thighland."
Imagine feeling the urge to gargle Trump's balls over a mistake Trump himself realized he made, and corrected three seconds after he made it.
Trump is an idiot. Accepting that is the first part of the process to realizing what a bad idea it is to vote for him . Then add in all the other overall horrible attributes he loves to flaunt and its easy to see why so many want to #VoteHimOut #DumpTrump2020
Thanks a Bunch Doc &amp; Texas, I Knew it was a Lie After Mr Trump Used &amp; Confirmed It, But Now This is The Nail In Their Hoax &amp; Bill Gate's Miserable Vaccine?
You knew about this in September. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs virus
We also need to start flagging Joe‚Äôs ads that spew falsehoods. If they‚Äôre taking Trump‚Äôs down for 90 days I surely don‚Äôt think Joe deserves a free ride.
Trump whipped out the credit card and went on a spending spree. Eventually the bill was going to come due.
Has nothing to do with whether you're a Trump fan or not. You just make the same type of comment Trump has continually makes. Birds of a feather!
Literally, these people are literally on here calling anyone who supports trump racist but then the same person is supporting Biden saying ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TRUMP
Naw nigga!!! It‚Äôs none of they above he ain‚Äôt wanna meet with trump hoe ass so he lied! Said he tested positive to avoid the meeting and then took a real test hat said negative
What‚Äôs all the fuss about? Trump can jump over to  and spread all the üêÇüí© he wants without accountability. Problem solved.
Trump Foundation: non-existent.
i meant trump im sorry
I dunno about that. Theyd already have to be somewhat fans of Trumps, because anyone that has seen his relationship with Donnie knows something's fucky with him... and they're not gonna vote for him just because of that Trump association.
Trump n his Base will Always Twist whatever Biden Says.. The Fact is Biden is fighting for the Rights of All Americans!!! Including the African American And Latino Americans.. Trump Has Said Things Much Worse and Derogatory about Both
Why's the president so scared of the first debate being in Ohio?    Is it because it will focus on his terrible record of broken promises and failed policies here?  From health care to attacks on women to the an economic disaster--to a testing debacle here--Trump is failing Ohio.
I guess you didnt read that.... not surprising.... since everyone saying read the transcript convienetly didnt read it. Reading isnt a strong suit for trump voters, is it? How apropos, the man who cant read beyond a 4th grade level leading people who seemingly cant read either
We all know it was an excuse not to see trump. We all understand.
It‚Äôs definitely picking 1 of 2 evils but Trump is just incompetent to run the country. It hasn‚Äôt even been four years and the country is gone to shit I‚Äôm not sayin the president will save me I just don‚Äôt want him in office.
This is 100% spot on.   Biden is Uncle Junior. Well intentioned enough but also sad, confused and lashing out.  Trump is Livia. Determined to malignantly burn everyone and everything down along with himself on the way out.
You obviously don't understand squat about spying like obama did to trump. Looking forard to the Durham report. Now that will be fun to watch. What will be disgusting to find out is how many celebrities, Clinton etc hung with epstein on island .  Home movies I never want to see
No, I think Congressman Lewis had way too much class for that. I guess you were ok with Trump bad mouthing John McCain after his death?
Trump puts the final nail in the coffin of Chinese  enrollment in US Higher Ed w/the #WeChatban. Imagine telling US kids that if they go to college abroad they can't do social media, Amazon, chat, Venmo, etc.--that they‚Äôre cut off from US in every social + economic dimension.
That‚Äôs great but somehow trump defending the confederate flag and statues, saying the white nationalist have good on there side and etc nullifies all that for me personally
It takes 3-4 days to get results in KY. IT ISN'T TRUMP, it is the Governor of each state that controls it!!!!
Trump isn‚Äôt donating his salary - he‚Äôs putting it back into the budget - he makes more money golfing than he ever would ‚Äúworking‚Äù - he has golfed one year of his administration üôÑ
For real though I don't know too much about HCQ to say whether it will be effective or have dire side-effects, but I don't think most people do either. They just let their hatred of Trump get in the way of even letting this medicine be discussed. It's sad really if it could help
So how does Mitch feel about Trump calling it the "Wuhan China virus?"
The last time trump talked to god when he found out his boy Epstein got busted and thought he was next..
Good so I‚Äôm guessing your not voting for trump cause a vote for him will nulify all the percentage u gave
I visited the WH a couple of years ago and President Trump left on the helicopter while we were inside. You should‚Äôve seen everyone crammed into the windows trying to see him!
So #KanyeWest admitting that he's running a Statue of Liberty play to help #DonaldTrump win...  Does that mean he's given up on running in 2024? Because if Trump wins, there's won't be a 2024.
Trade wars are where Trump gets to pump up his chest and pretend he‚Äôs strong. He‚Äôs done it since Day One.
Ohio Republicans turn on Trump: ‚ÄòWe will not make the same mistake this November‚Äô
You are still digging this hole? It isn't true. There isn't an English speaking country where it is pronounced that way by the majority of people. People who pronounce it like Trump did do so because they've never heard the word spoken, and have only read it.
Ikr? I know Trump says a ton of goofball stuff. Biden can be just as wacky. They're two out of touch old white dudes.
Way to wrap it around to Trump !  I didn‚Äôt see that one coming.
Trump wasn't then, and never has been, neither conservative nor republican.  Unfortunately the country is paying for those establishment republicans that put party over country.
Absolutely, and every time trump lies, he strengthens the resolve of black voters against him and for Vice President Biden.
I would say Mary Trump but everyone knows she only writes non-fiction
New job for Trump. Midnight jock for info mercials. My pillow you can use while taping women.
In all fairness, ‚ÄúNever-Trump‚Äù more like ‚Äòonce a Republican.‚Äô How about being a #Constitutional #American?  That way you can vote for the choice that preserves the Constitution without ever saying his name.
I am sorry. I love golf but I could not go golfing with trump.
So then your going to actually hold Trump accountable considering Putin has bounties on our Troops AND is supplying  But ya know Republicans are Traitors who dont give a fuck about our troops unless they are trying to score political points... Trump Mocked Gold Star Families
What is trump?

Ummmm, isn‚Äôt Congress on their ‚ÄúAugust break‚Äù amidst the pandemic?? And didn‚Äôt Trump continuously try to pass another relief bill that was blocked by dems ??
Thats long been my thought, which explains Trump's anti-vaccine, vaccines cause autism BS because he can't imagine it possibly just being his genetics. He has to place blame elsewhere. Malaria protects Baron from Donald, which is why you never see just father and son. She knows.
ICYMI: Gov. Mike DeWine has now tested negative for coronavirus, after a rapid test administered by the White House before a planned meeting with President Trump came back positive. He'll be tested again on Saturday.
I wouldn‚Äôt wait 8 seconds to vote FOR Trump. I‚Äôd stand however if I needed to to vote against him.
I'm voting Trump AGAIN. I love love love love President TRUMP. Proud to say that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is horrible that trump and his cronies are taking advantage of a man with mental illness. It is also sad that West‚Äôs family is letting all this happen.
Trump also dissed Pres. Obama's eulogy for John Lewis and pouted because John Lewis had the good sense to skip Trump's inauguration and SOTU speech.
You don't believe Trump is being remotely controlled?  I find that... Difficult to believe.
Just saying, I bet some of us know a few who just need a little encouragement...  Or they're the ones buying up Trump rally tickets, and should be encouragement to us.
Not disagreeing that Biden has some trouble speaking. That said, if you compare Trump's speech to Biden's, do you feel that the two are equally qualified to lead?
Your vote only counts if you want that person your voting for to do something for you then you can say hey i voted for you even if the system is a set up and president Trump won't be allowed a second term.
Trump knew he would‚Äôve been struck by lightning if he entered
Trump is the opposite of what I consider a good leader.
I am sickened and disgusted Georgia is sacrificing children to help Trump. WTF is wrong with you people?
Uh no. She‚Äôs a snarky, petty woman and I doubt wil have much influence. She‚Äôs already been campaigning against Trump for 4 years.
I know, anybody with any ties to honesty or mortality is a ‚Äònever Trump RINO‚Äô.  What DeWine has been, for decades, and will continue to be, is an establishment Republican. Yes, most of them sold out all their morals and values to hitch a ride on the Trump train wreck.
Lol. The last time we saw "Republican" Phil Heimlich he was campaigning for Democrat Aftab Pureval and all his illegal campaign activities. If a bunch of Republicans form a Democrats for Trump group, will the Enquirer cover it?
Dude Trump is a complete moron. He‚Äôs WAY more than just rough around the edges üòÇI‚Äôm amazed by people that think he‚Äôs fit to run a McDonald‚Äôs, let alone a country. His niece was right....
Occam‚Äôs Razor. Simplest answer is usually the right one.  Going beyond a false positive and a negative test in rapid succession, to find anything conflicting you really need to jump WAY off a cliff into insanity and conspiracy and nefarious plots against Trump.
We pride ourselves on spreading the plain truth whenever Trump and his minions drop in for their photo ops and fundraisers:  In 2019, Ohio had its worst jobs year since 2009. We lost manufacturing jobs. Construction jobs. Farm bankruptcies soared.   All before COVID.
THE GREAT RESET: Davos &amp; the Plot to Cancel Trump  via
There is no question that efforts to cover up how incompetent Trump is would lead to the Executive not actually doing the job. This isn't how our government is supposed to work. It's why the GOP's failure to convict &amp; remove from office Trump will be stain on them forever.
If anything, he could pull votes from Trump.
You all are fine to call President Trump a racist, but are silent when this man is really out here being a racist. #JoeBidenIsARacist
Trump incoherently and sweatily saying ‚ÄúGod. Guns. God. Guns.‚Äù over and over again is probably the most coherent re-election strategy I‚Äôve ever seen him deploy.
This is one of the best jokes about Trump I've ever seen. It's also not really about Trump, so don't worry about getting triggered.   I wouldn't share a video of this quality unless the joke was really, really good so this is also well worth your time today.
The first test was issued by White House staff for his meeting with Trump that was said to have fast results. The other two were handled at actual doctors offices.
We need to prepare for "a whole lot of ugly coming at us from a never-ending parade of stupid", as long as Donald Trump is President, and unfortunately even after he's out of office. No matter how he exits the office.
An Average Joe needs to get his Kool-Aid from sources other than the fake news media mob. President Trump has outsmarted &amp; outmaneuvered the Left on every issue. And that's right, Trump IS the PRESIDENT - and you're not!
This is a whole new level of sycophancy.   For clarification, Dinesh's point is that people in India say it with the "TH" sound so it's correct that Trump did. Even though no other English-speakers do, and the people in Thailand don't.
Patriot and Trump supporter That is conflicting.
Y‚Äôall. Trump is really out here more pressed about Tik Tok than the 150,000 dead Americans and the racial injustice happening in our country. Ooookay Cheeto. #DumpTrump2020 #SettleForBiden

Clearly nothing I say will convince you that your thinking is flawed. Trump derangement syndrome is a serious problem. I‚Äôm sorry it affected you so much but  hopefully disability will honor your claim . Obviously you can‚Äôt be expected to work with trump in office
Yes, and they also say W's as V's but that doesn't make it correct for Trump to do it.   There's a correct way to pronounce things, and then there's a colloquial way. Trump doesn't get a pass because he doesn't have the colloquial accent.   So stop. Just stop with this bullshit.
'Sit down': Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô
Was hard to pull off  It took just the right combination of narcissism, incompetence, sociopathy, ignorance, corruption, extremism, &amp; persistence in all these qualities  But after nearly 4 years, Trump finally became #1.  The single worst jobs president in our country's history.
I'm sure  and  didn‚Äôt appreciate this. I know I don‚Äôt. Very tasteless.
Rural Ohio is the same story.   Small towns have seen nothing from Trump.  Farm bankruptcies are skyrocketing.  Health care under attack.  No infrastructure plan to speak of.  Rural Ohio needs a champion in the White House.

So some #Ohio Republicans acknowledge Trump is dangerous. But we knew before he was elected he was dangerous. He didn‚Äôt change. Republicans like Heimlich must have known, but held their noses to beat Hillary and get their judges. This column is just a CYA mea culpa.
Oops you meant to say the Trump Virus
No A Trump loss could well mean he'll be fleeing to Rikers.
So Trump‚Äôs Covit test is as accurate as Trump‚Äôs vaccine that will be available on Election Day?
Ain't gonna happen Still a chance that Trump could win..  He will cheat.
Maybe you should understand the racist comments Trump has made in the last 30+ years. Who says i‚Äôm a Biden supporter? I can admit when the democrat candidate is bad. Also why would I give af what a crusty white man thinks how I look? I can fuck more women than youüòÇ
He failed a test given by the secret service. If anything Trump didn't want to meet him!
Love how tRump gets up there &amp; acts like he's been some great ally to the Black/LatinX/POC community. He's happy to have feds take over our streets bc citizens DARE to use their 1st Amendment right to peacefully protest &amp; equates BLM w/a terrorist org? #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Dear DeWine, If you didn‚Äôt want to meet Trump Dumpster, you could have just said so...
Awesome new ad.

2- if she gets Covid, she‚Äôs DEAD. The lack of leadership &amp; accountability is SHOCKING. They have NO IDEA what they‚Äôre doing. Kushner had a testing plan..what happened to it? They let ‚ÄúBlue State‚Äù people DIE because they weren‚Äôt voting Trump anyway. That seems reasonable, right?
So Trump‚Äôs Corona virus test is as good as Trump‚Äôs vaccine that will be available on Election Day?
My grandmother took a turn for the worse. Shes now in a coma and on a ventilator.  I lay this right at the feet of Donald Trump and Florida governor Ron DeSantis.  These people downplayed the virus and made claims people were safe. They mismanaged this thing. This is mass murder.

Weird. I have friends who are world travelers, too. The question they are asked the most is, ‚ÄúWhat happened to America? Why would you elect a President like Trump?‚Äù  Then they have to explain we are a Republic not a Democracy and the majority of ppl voted for someone else.
You kidding me, now Ohio has to go in lockdown because the TRUMP  VIRUS is coming to town! This PATHETIC COWARD is not wanted here!
So Trump Doctors did the test and you test positive,  sounds like Trump didn't want to see you. Your Doctors tested you and the results came back negative. You got played.
I'm not sure what you're implying here. Trump's record and history speak for themselves.   But I guess you don't care as long as you perceive a benefit for yourself.

Second test was negative? Sounds like he was trying to get out of his date with Trump.
This point would have a lot more validity if Trump had done something worth praising in the last four years. What you're asking them to do is to write a positive story about a guy who is Mussolini but dumber.

President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.

Yeah that's the thing, even if Q is legit it's not like a savior. There will still need to be a lot of work done. The most important work is on yourself, the inner work. This is what really matters. This is the Great Awakening, regardless of what's going on with Trump and Q

The democrats hate Trump so much and this is the best guy that they can find?
Because he has a long history of telling outright lies when it'll support Trump? This is far from the first time he's done, "All of you aren't seeing what you think you're seeing" when it'll benefit Trump.

This is exactly the kind of thing Trump was waiting for tbh. The only reason the feds have been staying in was a ploy to wait for something to claim Wheeler can't do his job so Trump could pounce. I called it! (I really hate being right about this stuff though)

Absolutely not a true statement.  Trump supports the states that banned abortion.  Also, POTUS cannot overturn Roe vs Wade.  Not a power given to the Pres.  Biden is 1000 times worse.  He has flipped and is for overturning the Hyde amendment.  That is beyond awful!

Trump works for Putin. He's not misguided he knows exactly what is going on and he's into it.  Trump is a traitor plain and simple.   #TraitorTrump  #TrumpKillsAmericans

Same to you. But don't bless me too quick ‚Äî even tho I probably won't vote for Trump this election either, there's no way I'm voting for Biden.  But I DO want the best for America, and if Biden wins I want him to have a capable VP ‚Äî especially since she'll be running the country.

Joe Biden, on the other hand, has led the fight against foreign interference for years, and has refused to accept any foreign materials intended to help him in this election - something that Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly failed to do."
Except if you have an option to drop off your ballot, do it.  It may be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but Trump is trying to make it slow to muck things up.  You might have to mail it two weeks ahead. So taking your ballot in yourself is a better choice.
This has been law since well before Trump took office.
How do we trust a man who lies talks over the top of the president,enforces his well over a staffer? I truly believe Trump wanted you to hear everything he said he is most transparent president in history. Acosta you need to find a job that doesn't involve telling the truth.
Sounds like a Trump ad. Now y'all plagiarizing his campaign.  Good luck with that!
Regrettably he has said some really stupid things. But compared to Trump, and yes right now, I compare every little and every big thing, and everything in between, to Trump. I‚Äôm not going to argue with you. You do you. But don‚Äôt whine when we get Trump for another 4 more.

I knew it was too good to be true! üòÜ  I get it. I didn't vote for Trump either. I can't believe he's who we ended up with out of SEVENTEEN choices. It still feels like a bad dream. That said, I won't be voting for Biden. But if he wins I'd at least like him to have a decent VP.
Trump is insane
#IMPOTUS would rather kill Social Security than provide relief to states and cities. In addition to killing Americans with the Trump Virus.
The point, numb-nuts, is that all those Americans didn't have to die, but for tRump's incompetence, scientific stupidity &amp; pushing to reopen the U.S. economy too soon, not because he cares about American lives, like you, he doesn't, but only for his own self interest-reelection.

You must have forgotten how the Pence staff announced he was the one, before Trump made a decision.  I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs still there.

Trump is talking to his ignorant base. Everyone else knows it is bullshit.
The only thing tRump puts first is tRump.  If what you said was even remotely true, which it isn't, then he wouldn't have talked to Putin 8 times this year, without once challenging him on Russia paying bounties for the killing of American military personnel. WHY? WHY? WHY?

If people simply hated Trump because he was successful. Many more successful people would be hated. This is one of the dumbest arguments I have ever seen about the criticism of Trump.
Brazil's leadership doesn't believe in trying to do anything. Just like Trump. Uruguay has had an EXTREMELY successful testing and contact tracing procedure (helped by a small populous).  Of course, you could have looked this up yourself.

Sounds like trump just threw in the towel... he knows he‚Äôs fucked so why not make life difficult for the next guy... sounds real American
Russia is sabotaging R election. Trump  knows &amp;  knows &amp; neither 1 of them care. McConnell is helping Putin by refusing 2 protect R election by allowing the Election Protection legislation 2 B put on the floor 4 a vote. Republican's can't win elections w/o cheating.
Cutting the payroll tax means cutting Social Security.üò°  The payroll tax is how we pay for Social Security.  If trump stays in office, his next big trick will be killing Social Security, just as the GOP has been trying to do since it's inception.
Already done Ron.  Trump is making sure of that. You can‚Äôt take credit for this
They won't let him get that win, they'll shift tactics at the last minute. Look at the masks, Trump advises that people all wear masks just to be safe, then suddenly Dems want to reopen schools and get worried about the economy, like Trump has been recommending for weeks. Frauds.
You are the con job.  You lie and lie and lie.  You hate Yrump so much you don‚Äôt care anything about We The People. You just want to destroy Trump. Too bad you can‚Äôt work with Republicans
So basically, Trump is our Pay Day lender.

We taxpayers are funding trump to golf again on his three-day weekend. He has his NJ country club members lined up for the cameras, where they can give him the applause he desperately craves.
So this was the point of the  purposefully stalling during meeting with Pelosi and Schumer.   They wanted congressional talks to fail so they could make Trump look like a hero.
I find it interesting if not HYPOCRITICAL that YOU ask this question while supporting TRUMP in his personal assault on OUR freedoms. Anyone else.
Trump virus.  Cheers!
Seems like Russia has had a direct line to trump since he first announced his candidacy.
President Trump says that "My administration continues to work in good faith with Democrats..." and he says that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer want to implement dangerous leftist policies, which he didn‚Äôt elaborate on.
Earlier today, Trump was trying to spin these numbers as positive, in only the way Trump can ignorantly spin things.
'Most Deranged I‚Äôve Ever Seen': Critics Rip Trump's 'Desperate' Attack On Biden
Maybe because there are more players this time around and Trump has done NOTHING to discourage or regulate these brazen illegal attempts to interfere in our sovereign ability to elect our own leaders.  This is a frightening departure from norms, and shameful. #NoElectionSecurity
President Trump: "Public health is vital to economic health...". He says the country is adding millions of new jobs, even when most of those numbers come from people returning to work. He continues, "Unemployment has fallen from nearly 30% since April."
Trump despises anyone that isn't a millionaire! Disguising a campaign rally  his Bedminster golf club as a "Press Conference" so it will be covered. All this while millions are getting evicted &amp; don't know where their next meal is coming from. Disgusting.
That is the 64000 dollar question...for some reason it‚Äôs a mystery... I think it‚Äôs being propped up by federal tax dollars so when Biden wins election trump pulls the rug out on the market and says ‚Äú I told you the markets would crash if Biden wins‚Äù... trumps a bum... a Russian
The golf club members are milling around, ready to give trump the applause he craves. Bet we won‚Äôt see even one employee on camera.
I need a cartoon.  US map shaped piggy bank, trump with a hammer.   That‚Äôs all he‚Äôs in it for.
Think of Trump as a sheep dog.  His supporters keep touting the same lame arguments for this man and they either really believe them (like the sheep) or they're afraid to look past the cliff to know that they're one step from falling.  Wake up!
Trump supporters remind me of sheep. The sheep get bullied around by sheep dogs and have actually been known to run right off a cliff when the dogs get too aggressive.  It's as if they refuse to believe the cliff is there or they somehow think that the sheep dogs are always right
I assume you already know the answer. I‚Äôm sure those who can‚Äôt pay rent or mortgages and who don‚Äôt have enough food are not fans of trump and company.

I'm happy he went golfing, he needs a break from the demoncrats.he deserves a break GOD BLESS MR TRUMP.

A) You can never go too far to avoid meeting with Trump. B) If I'm gonna get busted, it is not gonna be by a guy like that.
and  I am voting for Trump simply because you are leaving us without by not passing smaller bills. I wish they would have done the HEROS Act, but they aren't and I am broke now with no way to pay rent or bills. Blaming the GOP is just as selfish as them
I think most people find it actually bizarre that we are actually in a bad situation. There is this expectation of the president to be sane, at least. Not a liar helps too! I think people who don't listen to trump, don't know how bad he actually is. It's almost  Incomprehensible.
Biden wouldn‚Äôt be in my Top 50 of preferred choices. But right now, he‚Äôs the only hope to defeat Trump. So I am now Team Joe.

I hate Trump. I live in a low income housing area, every single person/family is white. Lots of drug and alcohol related crime as well. All white.
Well,  beat me to it, but Trump's probably doing this to distract everyone from the ghastly economic news just released this am, that 2nd Q GDP dropped 32%, and that was with a 10% bump in personal incomes from the stimulus payments. Keep your eye upon the doughnut!

He just wants to end what‚Äôs there. Didn‚Äôt want or vote for Trump (I‚Äôm conservative) but thought if he has to be pres, maybe he could ax ACA. Our cost for healthcare skyrocketed under it &amp; it‚Äôs been hard. Now realize no matter, price won‚Äôt drop. Likely increase. Leave it alone.
But to answer your question,   is stupid. Trump is an ignoramus, a moron. He is #DelusionalDonald! #HeIsWhatHeIs because he sincerely believes that a death toll of 164,000 Americans is‚Äîwell‚Äî#ItIsWhatItIs
It‚Äôs unbelievable and shameful that parents take their kids around him much less w/out a mask. In my eyes that‚Äôs child endangerment.  Trump can say bs, kids are immune but kids get this &amp; some die.  just featured a child that died in her lives well lived segment.
Trump will get someone to "approve" a vaccine  right before the election. He'll say "I DID IT!" people will be stupid enough to believe it and re elect him. Then in January when theyre set to start giving it, It will be pulled for safety and never come to be....

The mandate is unconstitutional, but not the entire law.  We still don't have Trump's healthcare plan to replace Obamacare.
I think the move GOP move here might be: 1. Tank negotiations. 2. Let POTUS say he alone will fix thing. 3. Pass bill through Congress. That way low info voters think Trump actually passed the bill and GOP doesn‚Äôt create precedent for more exec power when Biden‚Äôs in office.

Uh... You know that I get Biden spam too, right? It ain't just Trump. This is kind of part of campaigning.
The only enemy I see is you and Trump. If you mean we'll have someone better in office, then hell yeah! Lol. If you're talking about aliens and demons shit, then you still need your head checked out by a psychologist.
This was a crazy man speech. Instead of discussing what would help them. Trump went on and on about Biden and Obama. How they took companies from the üá∫üá∏. Idiot. He has not got them back nor will he.
Bullshit. Trump never had or will he have it now.
Bullshit again. Trump does not even no what the civil rights movement was about.
Trump does that on a daily bases.
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining #ProtectTheResults:
Lol get rid of the biggest swamp monster ; Trump
You all are pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. We have a fascist running the country in the midst of the worst pandemic response in the world, an economic recession, and you all are pretending this is somehow as scandalous as that or Trump defending the Confederacy.
Trump indeed is.
Keep hammering him for this. 160k Americans are dead and counting. Millions are out of work. Millions are about to lose their homes. Trump's failures destroyed the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. Let's destroy him politically in November. #COVID19 #coronavirus

Mike: Don‚Äôt dismiss the possibility that Trump‚Äôs stooges lied to you about the positive test because you‚Äôve advocated COVID-19 safety measures he doesn‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs how little confidence I have in his honesty. NIXON, PART 2.
And what exactly is going on? Trump says : ‚ÄúDemocrats are the enemy of the People‚Äù and you believe it with no other reason than he said it! He‚Äôs lied to America &amp; the World 20,000 documented times and you still believe him... very cult-like!
Trump is bullshit. Not a bit of that speech was from someone who is in his right mind. Trump is crazy.
McConnel has need out of that Senate for years. He seem to think it is there to serve his way of thinking. He in ways is just like Trump. They both don't care about the average worker.
Kanye would be a better than Trump. Kanye is crazy only half the time.
Well that is no surprise. I can see that. I would not sleep in the same bed as Trump either. Lol

Trump didn‚Äôt have the stones to make the decision to unite the country so he put it in the hands of 50 governors. That way he could agree with those who chose wisely and blame those who chose poorly... accepting zero responsibility! Trump‚Äôs a coward!

Whoever this guy is he‚Äôs a f#cking joke! My four year old granddaughter can pronounce Thailand properly. It is NOT thighland. Trump must be thinking of another pornstar! I‚Äôve never heard it pronounced any other way. These idiots must be eating thigh food instead of Thai food!
We are letting all the immigrants in...millions and millions of them, just to make America pay for electing Trump.

While I agree this headline is terrible, your answer was odd. Everyone knows a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump. That means writing in a candidate, voting for a third party, or not voting at all is a vote for trump. Biden is our only ticket off this ride.

My breathing is fine. Why would you think my breathing is at all an issue? You‚Äôre a bit presumptuous, aren‚Äôt you? Trump is a horrible person. I‚Äôve known this my entire life. My mom was raised with him. He‚Äôs never hid how putred he is, but here you are.
Just adding to the conversation that Trump is a stupid criminal.
It‚Äôs akin to Roger Stone admitting he covered for Trump by not squealing? üòÇ yea. Okay sparky.
It doesn't matter if masks work or not, as Governor, he is near so many people that he could have caught it at anytime.  I just hope he gets through it okay, and some had wished he gave it to Trump today.

I‚Äôm not having discourse with you. You asked for specifics like you‚Äôve been asleep for decades. Trump‚Äôs racist behavior is documented but you choose to argue about arguing and avoid the actual issues. This is my last reply to you, read it 2X when you see it, the block is comingüëçüèª

My state is nearing phase 4, so like...? Which state are you in that has yet to reach phase 1 and how is your state able to speak for all states. It is not Trump/admin's job to babysit every state as some governmental overseer. It is up to the states and those elected in them.
you are a horrible sad excuse for a human being and need to get your head out of trump and his gangs backsides
156,000 deceased. 55,000,000 unemployed. Lock Trump up!
Trump is exactly right. There have only been about 35 children who have died from it, probably with weakened immune systems from comorbidities or obesity. Children with these health issues should be home schooled or get remote schooling, or be given HCQ as a prophylactic.
You are soon to be Ex-Senator Blackburn whose legacy will read ‚Äúa worthless politician that licked Trump‚Äôs boots every chance she got‚Äù.
I truly don't see that. Trump has lied mote then most presidents. His whole time in office has been a lie. Just look wear the country is at. He put blame everywhere. But where it belonged. He is not a leader.

Two Twin Tokens in a Trump Trap, Tragic.
Allegedly, the NY AG announcement is going to be about the NRA and not Trump or his family or businesses.  So calm down folks. Decimating the NRA will be a solid consolation prize.

The NY AG does work other cases, as every state AG does. It could be major announcement and have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Folks shouldn't get their hopes up.
He's being investigated because there's strong evidence he committed crimes, prior to reaching office. Should he get a free pass on that because of the job position he committed two felonies to obtain?  Also, I wasn't aware that the Man DA or the NY AG were running against Trump.
Naturally, you're projecting, just like a good cultist. Your dude is literally doing everything he can to rig the election from helping Kanye get on the ballot, to slowing down the mail, to trying to announce bs results from a bs investigation into Trump campaign treason.

Correct, something the left won‚Äôt recognize. If Trump is so racist, why would he ever do anything to lower the black unemployment rate to a historical low?
Yes he should be forced into it. He would get eviscerated by Trump. Hell, Joe would probably eviscerate himself.
Let‚Äôs survive the election first. I think there is going to be a really long line taking Trump to court, both civil and criminal.  Those decisions should really come from Congress.
You can tell Trump grew up having his arguments before the Internet was around to solve them
Trump makes his products overseas. Trump, as POTUS, has continued to fail American workers. He was a failure before the pandemic and he's an even bigger failure now. It's time to elect someone who will actually put American workers first. That's
Trump shut down travel and the media and Dems called him a racist and said he was overreacting. Meanwhile, Pelosi and De Blasio told people to continue their lives. Fauci even downplayed it. But sure, ‚ÄúOrange man bad.‚Äù
People that are that daring that they‚Äôd set up a frame job on an incoming president, that‚Äôs a lot of pull. I‚Äôd be scared too. Especially when DC is against Trump.

1\ For 2 months now the pig Tweeting Trump gets his incompetent pig of a Treasury Secretary to call Pelosi on the phone EVERY DAY to talk her into accepting a way-to-small stimulus.  Then the pig Tweeting Trump waits until there's no time left before he makes a lowball offer.

There is nothing more important to Donald Trump than Donald Trump.

Trump is the epitome &amp; reincarnation of those who installed Jim Crow.
You clearly don't follow how hard the black community is working to address this issue &amp; how they are getting nothing but hindrance from Trump &amp; officials. How racist of you ‚Äî and I don't care that you're black. Black people can hate other black people.
Thanks   I appreciate your thoughts. I know I am not alone and things will be fine. I just wish that we had take care of this in March. I do believe that if he had done his job trump would have been re-elected so there‚Äôs that. #VoteHimOut
When he loses civil war might break out and they have no clue what they are doing. We didn't have civil war when Trump won or when Bush won in 2000 yet these dumb fucks will go along with his bullshit to cover for all the money he has stolen. He will try to burn it all down.
With all due respect  trump is doing something. He is allowing them in and showing them where the keys to the election are and that‚Äôs where he is doing nothing to stop them. #VoteHimOut
Trump has to spread his stench to all of his properties so his trumpsters will continue to overpay for his clubs because you know he could show up anytime. So he is trying to market his businesses on our dime. Damn crook #VoteHimOut
David Brooks wrote an editorial about the wrongheaded nature of anti-government Republicanism.  Government can make better living.

Democrats won't win in Ohio. Sherrod Brown should go.
Although I agree with you I am not sure who is actually using him as a puppet. It could be trump and co but I believe it could also be the kardashian family itself. Can you imagine what he promised them. Can you imagine tik family also in the White House. #VoteHimOut
Is it bad that my first thought reading this article was, there are people in Bratenahl hosting Trump fundraisers???  Donald Trump promises quick end to coronavirus pandemic the same day Mike DeWine tests positive at Trump event -
Expose all the Democrats demands is a good plan; don't cave.  Newt Gingrich: Trump could take down Schumer and Pelosi with this Reagan tactic
If they use the same unreliable test they use at the White House it is believable. However DeWine may be the smartest republican in the country. At the end of the day he doesn‚Äôt have Covid and he didn‚Äôt have to meet with trump. WONDERING?  #VoteHimOut
West is just another distraction bought and paid for by the trump administration/campaign. I can‚Äôt believe that these idiots think that our Black community is that dumb that they will fall for this schtick. #VoteHimOut
Hi President Trump's decision on TikTok is very weak, he claims they are stealing Americans info. So if this is true and he has proof then why give them 45 additional days to do more harm. He must think he is doing a deal and not looking after our safety
Wow what a weak decision on Tick Took, President Trump says the Chinese Government is getting info on Americans. So if this is true why give them 45 additional days to get info. You either close them down now or don't
No kidding. I am just hoping and praying it backfires. As everything else the liar in chief says and does. What will our Black community think about trump using one of their own as a stooge?#VoteHimOut
Lucky for them they found a mentally deficient puppet. I just wonder what the cost was. I know he‚Äôs not bright enough to do this deal himself. Perhaps there is a Kardashian behind this whole situation. Can you image trump bringing in that family as well. #VoteHimOut
Ya think. Trump doesn‚Äôt need another ignorant talking head to help him. He has enough of those already. West brings nothing but division. Oh wait.......that‚Äôs the plan. #VoteHimOut
So much for Trump's ridiculous claim that children are "almost immune" to the novel coronavirus. This is another profoundly sad case.  A 7-year-old boy in Georgia died of Covid-19, the youngest victim in the state
Trump doesn‚Äôt pay any debt. If this were to happen they should put a deposit down. So If trump lies an average of 18 times an hour have them put a $360,000 deposit down and see what happens. #VoteHimOut
Oh enough already. You got 4 more years of Trump princess.
Kanye West is mentally disturbed. Trump &amp; the Republicans would be thrilled for Kanye to be 2020‚Äôs Jill Stein.  If Kanye plans on acting as a spoiler  acting on behalf of Trump to hurt Biden‚Äôs campaign he deserves consequences  BOYCOTT ALL KANYE WEST MERCHANDISE (music &amp; apparel)
I don't think you have to be a "trump lover" to see that the Biden campaign keeps him under wraps most of the time. I'm no fan of POTUS. But it's disheartening to see Biden botch the two or three interviews they let him do per month. How is this a presidential campaign?
No. We Voting fo Donald Trump 2020 üá∫üá≤

trump wouldn't even know where to start in a conversation like this

You mean when trump retweets one of his supporter shouting white power?! Please go sit down.... #BLM
Trump is a scam!
Trump probably gets a kick back.
Another thing is the suburbs. For a good portion of the last 40+ years, suburbs in Ohio were HEAVY R. Areas outside of Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland all were republican strongholds in the state, then in around 2012 they started shifting. Trump sped that up.
It‚Äôs ironic that Trump mocks Biden when Trump is a terrible public speaker.  Master of malapropism.
So that explains Trump! He could not look worse. Of course if he lost the ridiculous hair style &amp; orange makeup &amp; poorly fitting suits ‚Äî but nah ....

This is pretty disappointing all around. A lot of people are struggling right now. Can‚Äôt depend on the government to help people out when the really need it. -Coronavirus relief talks collapse on Capitol Hill    via
The MSM wants us to believe a drug that's been safely used for 65 yrs is now unsafe.  Somehow, HCQ became dangerous right after Pres Trump spoke positively of the drug as a treatment for covid19. Not a peep from the MSM about it being dangerous before then.  What a coincidence.
Exactly!! They played this smear game in 16 election but sadly after they ‚Äúreopened the investigation ‚Äú on Hillary she lost alot of votes and lets not forget the manipulation Putin and Trump had going! They‚Äôre trying play it again! We can not let this work ! Our nation needs us!
Any truth to the rumor that Republicans scuttled corona virus relief talks so Trump could pull his "tough guy" executive order shtick?
You mean the pre-existing conditions that Obamacare already requires insurance companies to cover? That little clause that Trump's DOJ is suing to overturn? Those pre-existing conditions?

Thank you.. They also said something about Census not complete yet largely because if covid19 and chaos our country is in. And there was concern about Trump completing it and trying to alter the numbers! Could you please keep us updated the Congress and Senate could lose people.

We already did that.    And then Trump and Barr refused to defend the validly-enacted law.
"Trump says new order will force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions; ACA already does" ~
Despite the effort in this tweet to demonize the crowd of Trump supporters for cheering this remark by Trump, he's not wrong to point out the double standards for the "peaceful protests" and all other social activity during the pandemic.
The GOP was well along that path before Trump became president.
Trump has already told us know one will know the real results of the election other than that he will be the winner.
Yes, MAJOR !   Except it's already been done by a president much more beloved than Trump will ever be

If you throw the Clinton name around  because of epstein and continually bend over backwards to excuse trump for the same shit, you‚Äôre a terrible person. All of those people that slept with children should be locked away forever. They should get worse in fact.

President Trump Signs Order Banning TikTok In 45 Days If It Isn't Sold
Thank you for showing the people who still somehow believe in Trump #IMPOTUS #TrumpVirus #BLM #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #TrumpKillsSeniors #HumptyTrumpty #personwomanmancameratv #trumpthinskin #Biden2020
Yes for President Trump
The ifiot doesn‚Äôt get the young people and others age groups of people who LOVE this app who will be mad enough to vote Biden! Trump is just ticked that supposedly Tic Toc users said they were coming to Tulsa rally and didn‚Äôt show up! His itty bitty feelings are hurt! #TrumpVirus
Ohio for Trump
I will be so happy if Biden wins, obviously, but I'll still have a bad taste in my mouth if my state (Ohio) goes for Trump. I mean, JFC, we went for Obama TWICE.
i would recommend calling OSHA   but i'm not sure what state the department is in.  dept heads alwasys seem picked to destroy the agency they are tasked with heading, and trump has taken it to even more of an extreme
Comments like this is why I really think Biden's best chance at victory is to shut the fuck up and just use what Trump says against him. Both are bad speakers, but Trump doesn't know how to shut up.
Wish more people had that experience especially when you see a president trying to create more divisions instead of bringing people together.
This isn‚Äôt Ohio yesterday. People in Ohio are wise to you trump. You certainly don‚Äôt have my vote and many many others.
Trump does rule by violence and intimidation. Unfortunately for him, he‚Äôs not very intimidating. He‚Äôs more like the Wizard of Oz, fake to the core. If Trump was going to expose anybody it would have already happened. He wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep his mouth shut.
Hey trump did you eat paint chips as a child?
Well, actually,  I don't want another package either. I want the country back to work. Trump was elected President, but the Democrats are running the country anyway by means of the virus. "Bipartisan" means colluding with the treasonous Democrats.
Bitch ü§£ü§£ I saw him fly in to Cleveland I was downtown and saw him and 6 other planes in front and behind him I was like ohhhh trump üòë
I was keeping up with the results last night. I'm disappointed because Hagerty fits the mold of the typical Washington bureaucrat. And he's a Trump bootlicker. Dr. Manny is the opposite of that. I hope he doesn't give up on politics. We need people under 50 in politics
All intelligent people know that, but the UN-intelligent, corrupt Trump haters will always spin it to fit their filthy agenda. MAGA Forever!
2020 prediction from professor who called every election since 1984 #SmartNews
so trump is really popular in the tiny town of Clyde.  Funny you didn‚Äôt mention the protestors and Biden supporters that were there too.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tested negative for COVID-19 on Thursday after testing positive earlier in the day before he was to meet with President Donald Trump, according to a statement from his office.
You politicized the Trump virus. You can‚Äôt rewrite history. We take very good notes.
Rodney Dangerfields estate should be suing Donald Trump for stealing his "I don't get no respect " routine.
Some peeps will do anything to not hang with tRump!
COVID just keeps getting smarter and smarter.  Positive and Negative in the same day!!!  Positive test before meeting with President Trump...Negative test on the same day after President Trump has left the state!
I lost a bundle in that God vs Biden bout.   ‚ÄúI was gonna vote Biden bc of Trump‚Äôs horrible handling of... everything... but now that I know Joe is gonna hurt God that changes everything.‚Äù
I pretended to read The Scarlet Letter in high school way better than trump or Biden pretend they care about God. And I got a D on my analysis paper
Ohio's Governor was tested by the Government's Testing team and was  positive {he had no symptoms} ‚Äî he later got a test from a University, Twice‚Äîboth Negative  ‚Äî  what's the point? Not only does Trump Lie, the method of testing he authorizes lies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Hmmm....and Trump is the racist one??? Righttt!
HAHAHAHAHAH HELL YEAH BABY! WEARING A MASK WORKS! SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS AND FUCK DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BULLSHIT TESTS!!! #WINEWITHDEWINE
Well they did last time too. Wonder why Trump has a shot? Look who he has run against! A crooked ultra liberal people don‚Äôt trust or a dementia patient. Give me a choice before you judge me.
Now he‚Äôs negative so does that mean some of the cases in Ohio are false positives? They just fucked themselves because now no one is gonna listen to a damn thing he says. He just didn‚Äôt wanna meet Trump but not that I blame him
Yea let‚Äôs discuss that. How does trump have thst in his heart? Proof? He‚Äôs helped minorities in 3 yrs Biden actually in 50 yrs voted for and against things thst hurt the black community never did anything to help.
But never Trump means Biden? Common your genes say you have to be smarter than that.
"But I do know I‚Äôm 100% uncomfortable with the direction Trump does." - And it comes down to his pick of VP??? If that is the case, you are NOT 100% uncomfortable with Trump and you know that makes you look bad.
Trump‚ÄîI will put golfing first for myself and all Americans who can pay my country club fees.
So, Trump is POYUS and you still find a way to blame democrats for HIS FAILED LEADERSHIP. Nope. This crap show is ALL HIS!
It. Absolutely. Does.  I will NEVER forgive the GOP for this last 4 years. Name 1 Republican who behaved like my interests came before his/her re-election?  Name ONE Republican who put the interests of this country before sucking up to Trump out of fear of a mean tweet.
And this is the best the democrat party has to offer.... could you imagine trump saying something like thisüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I‚Äôm wondering the same thing.  Who is providing the test to these politicians before they are supposed to meet with trump?  Can they be trusted?  In a 2nd test, governor dewine tested negative.  Hmmmm...
Apocalypse Bingo  Aug: Swarm Of Locusts  Sept: Students In Radiation Suits Oct: Trump Tells His Base That Obama Was...Black! Nov: Klingons Take Cleveland. Dec: Santa Gets COVID-19, Christmas Is Cancelled.  I don't feel like tagging anyone now. Have a great day!
How is that the president. Do you even hear yourself? #Unbelievable what‚Äôs next? I can see the headline ‚ÄúTRUMP CAUSES HURRICANE‚Äù
2/2 DeWine couldn‚Äôt have gotten near the results! The take away from this is that Trump‚Äôs test of choice doesn‚Äôt work.   Without Gov. DeWine and Dr Acton we would be in a lot worse shape than we are now.   Stop blindly following Trump and start doing your own research!
First, I‚Äôm so happy that you are ok, Governor DeWine!   Now.... to the majority of people on this thread: Get a life, work on your empathy and compassion and stop being so snarky! Geez!  TRUMP‚ÄôS PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE TEST!! 1/2
How Would Trump Say Virginia?
Ukrainian who made appearance in Trump impeachment saga accused by U.S. of stealing, laundering billions
Trump has black supporters so what? Every master has a house slave who loves their master but continue
In a loss for Trump, judge says woman who accused him of rape can proceed with defamation suit
When Trump Is In Bed With Melania, Who Is He Fantasizing About?
If you don't vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump. It doesn't matter who Biden's VP is. You want to be a courageous conservative? Conserve our country and vote for Biden.
Positive? Negative? Maybe DeWine just didn‚Äôt want to meet with Trump lol.
So what you are saying is yiu really didn‚Äôt want to see Big Daddy Trump and weaseled your RINO ass out of it. Ok got it
Omg omg omg!!!! Im sending this to Trump.. im heartbroken to see this baby girl...I‚Äôm so sorry
So Trump and the White House offer false positive COVID-19 tests. They are literally trying to discredit the pandemic by offering fake positive tests to people who have to meet with Trump.
There's no right answer. It was 75 years ago. The world was different than it is now. We now know the horrible effects it had and know not to repeat it. Telling people they aren't Libertarian because of how they feel about it is absurd. You trying to create more Trump voters?
Wear a mask. The election isn't over.  Blame Trump. The election isn't over.  Be smart. Use your own outlandish NY taxes to cover your pandemic costs.
We just hit 160,000 dead and 4.8 million cases because we have no test no ventilators, no protective wear for drs nurses first responders! And he wants re-elected in Nov! I‚Äôm in a group to try to stop that!! I would think it would be illegal for Trump to dispense meds to a person
The Republican Party as your father knew it is dead. Trump executed a hostile take over and nobody stood up to him on the right. Like parasitic wasps eating their host, Trump and his cult ate your party alive.
Amen brother, I have multiple Trump flags flying on my area and I don't recall any Obama flags during his terms.
Joe Biden could select a dog turd as a VP and I would STILL vote for him. Trump is THAT bad. And voting for a third party candidate as a protest? That is essentially a vote for Trump anyway.
Donald trump blamed China for mike dewine gettin covid lololololol
Trump shit show
All 25 trump supporters
Trump is so full of BS!
You could have just said you didn‚Äôt want to meet Trump üíÄüòÇüíØ we feel you
Actually you were corrected on the fact that tax payer funded secret service was there. So there‚Äôs that. I bet that was more expensive then a speech where trump was going to be anyways. TDS
Sounds like he didn‚Äôt want to be around Trump.
can‚Äôt seem to report on anything but trump and republicans. They are all hacks that don‚Äôt care about the truth they only care about putting dems back in power even if it means destroying their own country and hurting the ppl they are supposed to be giving the truth.

Trump issues executive orders against Chinese firms, citing national security concerns
Trump has said far worse and we forgot about it the next day.
Good! Maybe he just wanted to get out of Trump meeting today. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump tweeted this just a couple weeks ago. This is racism.
Going to any length necessary to avoid seeing Trump
We are a joke to other countries thanks to Trump,
If you didn‚Äôt wanna meet up with Trump just say that ü§£üòÇ
Exactly. We get it you‚Äôre down with the fauxvid- but your TDS started before fauxvid. Yeah trump only cares about himself- first President to donate salary and will be first to leave with less wealth than he came in with. I‚Äôm tired of the ignorance
People don't want to have that conversation. Its "I hate Trump" so I have to vote for the other guy
Too many..anyone who supports trump at this point is insane
Donald Trump promises quick end to coronavirus pandemic the same day Mike DeWine tests ...  Let‚Äôs wipe this shit stain from history in November!
More than 100 protesters demonstrate along President Donald Trump‚Äôs motorcade route dur...

You're a MAGAt and you're stuck on a crashing plane with Sean Hannity and Donald Trump. There is ONE parachute. Who would you give it to?
Never Trump should mean Republicans have to start over.
I‚Äôve always had respect for you and still do. I‚Äôm a liberal but I‚Äôve always felt you were someone I could have a rational political discussion with. It disappoints me you‚Äôre on the fence. Trump is a threat to democracy. Seems like an easy decision
President Trump visited the  factory in Clyde, Ohio today. Here's what I saw, for    #fujifilm #photojournalism #POTUS #politics #ruralamerica

An immoral President says a compassionate and devout Catholic is "against God".  Trump will lie about and slander anyone, but to tie God into his lies, in hope of being re-elected, is as low as one can go!
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider
All this man has to do is say fuck trump and he can't even get that right
Biden is a joke on healthcare. He would never have signed the executive order Trump did lowering drug prices. Hes a shill for big pharma and the insurance industry.
Trump cares about himself , the rest of us are peasants to use for a vote.. to work for him .. everything! You don‚Äôt hear. stories of him being kind or helping someone!
Trump is.
Trump would say, "Total failure. Total disaster. SAD! Completely preventable, by the way. The buck stops with him! Impeach!" üôÑ
Fine by me. I‚Äôll listen to doctors who actually ran the tests and proved already it wasn‚Äôt a cure rather than believe a few doctors hired by Trump to say it works and they believe ALIEN DNA IS REAL. So go ahead and wear your tinfoil hat and believe conspiracies
The democrats refuse too because Trump said it showed a lot of promise months ago. They would rather see people die than give him a win
That's the thing we know civics, but the die hards don't.  There are plenty of R's who are not voting for Trump this time and they are bringing their friends.
Kanye West is living his deep, dark,  twisted fantasy - right now.   While his wife Kim is using Trump to release convicts, Kanye is setting them up for the kill when they get out - TWISTED.   Maybe Kanye doesn‚Äôt care that Black Lives Matter because he hates being Black?
Alright this is bigly lol. Trump lost Colorado by 5 in 2016.   It is a realistic possibility Kanye can siphon 5% from Biden, giving this state to Trump.
If you're going to bet on Trump to win, just make sure you do it before the debates, because after the 1st debate most of the value on Trump to win will be gone.
I'm not going to change their minds. I live in Trump country. They think the more pain they inflict that we will quit. I won't quit.
I've been told the NRA case is going to SDNY. What makes you think Billy boy isn't going to be all up in this one, let alone a Trump? If I'm wrong I apologize.
My workout buddy is a Republican.  Months ago, he said he wouldn't vote for Trump.  I said to him that he would always find an excuse to not vote for a Democrat.  Go ahead SE, vote for the mobster president.
That could be true. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but the vast majority of people not picking religious topics like this with Biden are pro Trump. I'm personally not a Biden or Trump supporter, but I couldn't give a shit about their religion.
Who is Donald Trump
Your reasoning is flawed. The vast majority of Trump voters do not take any polls whatsoever. It's even more true now than it was in 2016.  Trump is not behind and never has been. Everyone still has to go out and vote.
They won't listen anyway. I spent months talking to someone who was going to go back to their Dem roots until one weekend with their Trump highway patrol buddies.
Facebook bans pro-Trump super PAC from advertising on its platform  #FoxBusiness
Two of the same kind. Gym is our Ohio embarrassment Trump is our national embarrassment
You got that right! MAGA!Trump and his conservative policies forever.
All mask hating violent Trump supporters should be the ones infected with the virus not the young people who are getting the virus not the elderly or health compromised people who are dying from the virus not the talented good people of all races and religions who are dying
No wonder Trump loves him. Two of a kind.
No. Thighland is Putin's bodily area loved by Trump.
I have spoken out more harshly about the crap Trump said against her father than she has.
Trump's "Biden wants to hurt god" comments aside, I resent that the existence of any deity is a given, a proven thing - and that such an unproven concept is used to make laws that harm people.
Idk why Dewine couldn‚Äôt just do us all a solid and give Trump coronavirus.
is still a globalist NWO never trump piece of shit. Nothings change. He‚Äôs digging in on the masks!
Does your hate for Trump mean that u would let BIDEN get elected???!   Do u NOT care about USA.   Biden‚Äôs brain is gone.   He is just a shell of himself
Biden is against God??? When did he say that?  Trump is getting more desperate by the day.
I notice u didn‚Äôt say anything about the trump secret police that‚Äôs what the second amendment people always sceam about why they need their guns
I honestly don't know how the secret service does it. Truly Impressive how well they are able to protect our president .Trump's hated Obama was hated Bush was hated and all of them survived with no real attacks on their head
does your hate for Trump override your love for USA.   Please tell me u see Biden and how unfit he is for President, but u won‚Äôt report any of it.   Can u put your hate aside and think of what‚Äôs best for USA.   It doesn‚Äôt even matter who his VP will be.  PLEASE
Nursing home patients are as annoying to Trump as rats. He has no sympathy for people older than him. He needs to face reality. Picture Trump without his hair dyed and combed over. Without the orange skin and without his fake teeth. He's old
Ohio.   All in for Trump ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèºüá∫üá∏
Only if you would show this passion towards true incompetece in the Trump Admin. I'll tell you what Jim, before you took a COWARDS way out by blocking me. When I pushed back on your support of the bigotd, poor policies of a Con Man. Even I didn't think America would fall this far

Go Jamie Harrison! We know how much you do for your State and hiw little Linsey Graham does.. he stays in DC to help Trump with his sinister actions! You will do a great job Jamie Harrison!

I can't participate in those conversations or I'd lose my job. I've never said a word about politics to anyone here other than saying "not a fan" when asked if I like Trump and they all label me a liberal, socialist blah blah blah because of my age and one statement. Nightmare...
Lean into it. Start telling them that you were on the fence but now you‚Äôre specifically voting for Joe Biden because Trump said Biden possesses the power to harm God.
10 bucks says Trump couldn‚Äôt even name a book in the Bible.
Remember this the moment you find yourself buying into Trump's horseshit about Biden being "against god" #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

‚Å¶ Get your head out of your ass!!!  You f‚Äôd up at EVERY point!   Donald Trump says he‚Äôs done ‚Äòfantastic‚Äô job on coronavirus in interview with Cleveland ...
Trump's desperation is so sad. What's even sadder is that there are many people who believe this nonsense.
Donald Trump is a liar.  He knows he can't win on his own merits, so he lies. He preys on people's fears. He distracts. He doesn't care about his voters. He cares only about being admired. He is truly a cruel, vile person and is undeserving of the presidency.

Ohio governor tests positive for coronavirus ahead of Trump visit   In other words, if Dewine was not scheduled to meet Trump today, everything would‚Äôve been fine &amp; he  probably would‚Äôve played golf this afternoon!! He has no symptoms! LOL, LOL, LOL
According to Presidental candidate trump Mexico is paying for the wall, he won‚Äôt be golfing because he‚Äôs too busy serving America, and he‚Äôll release his tax returns after the audit is concluded... should I go on with more Bullshit?
Governor Mike DeWine has tested positive for COVID 19.  He &amp; his wife Fran will quarantine at their home in Cedarville for the next 14 days.  Neither has symptoms.  The test was given today prior to President Trump‚Äôs arrival later today   Lt. Governor Jon Husted tested negative.

let's all rush back to school tho... Too bad he didn't see trump first... No one wanted trump here in Ohio anyway so that's a sign for him to stay the fuck out of Ohio!
So... Our gov. Mike DeWine was supposed to meet with presidementia today so they tested him and he has covid ..but let's all go back to work and school... But keep Trump's lying ass safe.
Cant we seize all assets of pedos by one of Trump's recent exec orders? Wasn't Laura Silsby working for the Clinton's when she was charged with trafficking in Haiti?It was HC she called when she got caught.Can't we seize their organizations and liquidate them? #IStandWithHaiti
So does trump.  lol
President Trump already is wasting no time attacking Biden over this gaffe:
On top of everything else, seeing Trump land at Burke Lakefront Airport is an infuriating reminder that the airport is an inefficient use of 450 acres of prime Lake Erie coastline reserved almost exclusively for rich people.

Gov. Mike DeWine tests positive for COVID-19 prior to Trump visit
It seems that there is a trend of Trump going to a location and individuals at that location who are supposed to meet him saying that they have tested positive for Covid-19. Coincidence? I think not!
Well, that‚Äôs one way to avoid having to meet with Trump üòÖ
ü§£ü§£ü§£ Not surprising that Trump doesn‚Äôt see an issue with the self dealing and grifting.
Nah, Trump. I honestly don‚Äôt think this VP pick is going to move the needle for Biden.
Well one of Trump's appointees is apparently an embarrassment and a regrettable decision so says Mike Pence.  Hate to say it but if we lose thr court that's the DNCs fault as a consequence of their actions.  There are ways to overturn the SCOTUS.
Yes it does. Unless trump has things written down for him, he can‚Äôt function. He reads things verbatim. Because of Covid the debates will be remote
This is not a good thing, democrats will kow be smeared by trump campaign for "coming for your guns"  This type of thing will only get him more support.
In OH and the most signs I saw were legit when Bloomberg was running (they‚Äôre gone now).  I have seen less than 10 Biden and Trump signs. Waaaay less than previous elections.
Well I have. More numerous than trump yard signs by 10 to 1. Open your eyes
More material for the next "Law and Order" themed Trump campaign ad. Leftists just can't help themselves but grandstand on far-left causes that only makes Trump more appealing to moderate voters.
Trump makes no sense. He lies which is his way of justifying anything he says because he actually believes it. I‚Äôve never heard Joe Biden sound like he‚Äôs having a stroke but trump sounds like he‚Äôs on some type of medication. We will see. Anyways it will be a remote debate.
Wow ‚Äî the four battleground states are amazing.    Even if it‚Äôs a split on those (Georgia and Iowa going for Trump, Ohio and Texas for Biden), it‚Äôs still an interesting mix of states.
He can‚Äôt even pronounce Yosemite. Called it JOSE MITE. And he‚Äôs going to win a debate? Not!! Joes a politician who actually knows how government works. Trump only know lies and corruption
Just because you don't like him or what he has to say does not make it untrue. I'm sure glad my doctor knew about hydroxy., if it wasn't for Trump most of us wouldn't know about it. Had I not had gotten the drug when I needed it, I could've had a completely different outcome.
Because as much as I don't like Trump, at least he's out and about again.  Biden at this point has been hiding the last couple of months.  Trump can finish an idiotic sentence.  Biden can't even say 4 words together.  Also they both touch children.  Biden isn't an improvement.
Honestly the GOP should be in total fear of the TicToc community... I‚Äôve met teenagers that planned and executed revenge after months... they‚Äôve already messed with the rally tickets, and also trashed the ratings of the trump app. That was before they tried to ban TicToc!
Look.  If Trump gets 4 more years the DNC will at the very least have a major sit down and consider actually going left.  If we get Biden, 2016 is a fluke and they keep screwing us knowing they won.  Don't be the lesser of two evils, be a better candidate.
There is not a pro-bible group or an anti-bible group - Trump is so freaking divisive just because  he wants to hold onto power.  Never an original thought (that made sense) . #864511032020
That SOB should wear a sock in his mouth under his mask! I‚Äôm soooo tired of all this BS. All of this/ ALL of it is just to hurt Trump!
totallly agree!  Why give Trump another platform to lie his fat ass off?
Ya fucking phony trump
Damn. If hannity has the number one book then we are a nation of morons, just like trump.
God is using Trump as a tool. We are so blessed to have president Trump!
Hopefully in the cell next to Trump.
Biden is gonna make u look like the moron u are, trump. U shouldn't be pushing so hard. His political, national and just general knowledge about everything, far surpasses yours. And we all know it and we love Biden for this and we cannot stand you trump
What‚Äôs really sad is you are willing to let USA go down bc of your hate for Trump.  U cover NONE of Biden‚Äôs gaffes and its so obvious that he is declining daily.    He cant even talk for 3 minutes without it sounding like a train wreck. Do u care about USA!  Trump 2020
Rs have no one to blame but themselves. Going all in on Trump was always going to have bad result.

Your tweets mean nothing because we all know YOU don‚Äôt write them.   Or they‚Äôd all start with ‚Äúcome on man!!!‚Äù   Trump 2020
What is going on at  ?   is so obviously anti Trump it is disturbing I thought she was News not opinion. She sucks
By itself, 20%  satisfaction reveals little.   Coupled with 91% GOP support for Trump, it's just confusing.   Add the  poll on how Americans identify by party -- in Jan., 47% said GOP v. 45% Dems, but now it's 50% Dems v. 39% GOP. -- it starts making sense.
President Trump is the luckiest president in US history to face Hillary in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Both gaffe machines with more skeletons than a graveyard.
Country run by Donald J Trump is apocolypic  Check mate‚òùÔ∏è
I assume your narrative is that the threats are only coming from right-wing Trump supporting Republicans.
Straight into the next Trump campaign ad it goes. He's the gift that keeps on giving, even more than Hillary was.
I have to apologize.. this is not the Supreme court case Vance v Trump .. this is brand new trial, Vance found new crimal activity, subpoenaed Deautsche Bank and they sent a huge of documents! Somehow Spanky missed blocking this subpoena and Deautsche gave us a jackpot!
Trump. Can I have my money now?
Yes. Because this is a cold war. Not liking Trump does not excuse the absolute threat of China
Entirely Russian propaganda. The right wing media is being manipulated by Russia. I hope the Senate unclassifies those documents regarding Russian interference into this election. They really want their useful idiot, Trump to become president again
FBI raids offices at downtown One Cleveland Center building tied to probable Ukrainian oligarch #trump
If the DNC loses to Trump twice they will almost be forced to put someone who is actually progressive on the ticket.  They've been screwing the actual left for years yet still demand our votes.  Be a better candidate, not the lesser of two evils.
At least we enjoy the privilege of not being made fun of for it, unlike Trump.
...the leftist before them didn't.   We can't keep relying on social media to do what we aren't. What happens if Trump actually passes an executive order forcing social media to reinstate these accounts? Or rollback their rules regarding hate speech?  We have to face them...
In that case, Trump will put him on the payroll
Breaking: Facebook Deletes Trump Post for 1st Time in History
Trump never watched basketball in the first place.#China had meeting with #Trump and #Giuliani. About #CoronaVirus early in January according to Associates of Ukraine
#FoxNews The same old shit #Portland A policeman no one beleives The Dems old buissness like #Obama and #Hillary You think that's going to help your boy win Lmao Nobody cares but his crazies About Obama and what he has done in history #Trump and #Republicans ignored #CoronaVirus

Prove the president Trump is a racist!
I‚Äôm not left lol. You funny. I have a lot of trumpers as a moderate. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative and with Trump with Trade deals. He should have put tariffs on our other countries that make our products cheaper elsewhere and bring back those jobs. His administratiü§°
Who‚Äôs the most corrupted administration. It‚Äôs not Obama because GOP had all the opportunities to get him and never did because nothing sticked but your guy, wow.  Yeah Trump is the swamp
The upcoming election - what will Trump/GOP do to remain in power, what could go wrong with the election, will Russia mess with the voting machine software, etc.
Ohio Where trump declared insanely that Biden would hurt God and the Bible.  #voteblueohio
Biden dont shitted on the African American community twice this year...and y‚Äôall wonder why I rock with Trump tho
It couldn't have been a Trump supporter. They're stuck at home in their trailers.
Suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year will give all WORKING people a raise, Including 1st responders Trump wants people to go to work! The democrats want them to stay home and collect the 600 a week BONUS on top of their unemployment checks, through November of course!
Lol I am now convinced Biden is a puppet to get trump back in office another 4 years
Holy shit I forgot about that Trump-ism. Dinesh tried to prove Trump right in that one, yes? Same fucked up way he‚Äôs trying to ‚Äúwell, actually...‚Äù this?
lmao my brother just disowned me because i told him i wasn‚Äôt a trump supporter
It‚Äôs the test his team administers to White House staff and anyone who will be interacting with him. It gives a result w/in minutes. I believe the same one Trump gets as well.
Trump‚Äôs test is only 70% accurate. That‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs not widely used despite being cheaper.
Everyone saying DeWine made up the positive test to avoid meeting Trump are ignoring the fact that the first test was administered by Trump‚Äôs team. They said he was positive. Everyone who gets near Trump receives that same test from his team.
Trump‚Äôs team tested him and declared he was positive.
Trump‚Äôs team is who told him he tested positive though:
Trump‚Äôs team administered the test and told him it was positive though.
#DonaldJTrump #Ohio Oh I forgot how #GOD Is on the side of #Pussygrabbers That have sex with #pornstars while they are married Oh yea and #Biden is destroying religion Now #Trump thinks he can trick and play GOD You are headed for a huge fall O #sinnerboy
Vote them out of office everywhere they are. TRUMP 2020
Trump is in town and I‚Äôm ready to tongue kiss for the team
Hey,  . The White House gives anyone who might see Trump an instant test.  Our Gov. tested positive today.
If White House staff are loading Trump's speech on teleprompters in which he campaigns, is that not a Hatch Act No-no?
DeWine wasn‚Äôt seeking to be tested. He was required to. I don‚Äôt fault him for Ohio not having access to the rapid testing Trump has, because none of the other states/governors have it, to my knowledge.
Based on the sounds above my house, Trump just flew overhead again on his way to his fundraiser.
Maybe your buddy Trump will give you a job when Ohioans toss you out of the Senate.  Your ass-kissing is going to backfire on you!
Marine One just flew over my block. Hate Trump but still think Marine One is cool.
#ClydeOhio #CoronaVirus #DonaldTrump came to #Ohio and gave the #hoax to our #Governor I hope he gets better And no blacks work in That factory We see nothing but #Trump faces on our #Media
Will Trump abide? No.
No one -and I mean no one but the Trump mind dead and the Trump dependent-are buying this horseshit
No, he reported what Trump said
Trump‚Äôs nightly campaign spots have no news value
I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can watch the Axios Trump interview and the Fox Lou Dobbs Trump interview and not take away the blatant bias and favoritism Fox plays over actual journalists. Lou Dobbs first question is when is the radical Left going to start caring about America?
#Ohio #DonaldJTrump #PeterNavarro  I woke up Seen the beautiful sin But then I took a breath and it smelled like Garbage Like bad breath I turn on the TV And Trump is here I was just about to complain about smell But he will go back to swamp After he spills BS Out his mouth Ohio
Facebook removes Trump post over false Covid-19 claim for first time
President Trump does NOT have to show a bunch lying people his tax returns.   Does NOT bave to show anyone his tax returns.
These children have a real friend in President Trump!
Trump really said ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù in response to the fact that thousands of Americans are dying a day to the pandemic he‚Äôs so poorly responding to.  Nice.
Trump says and Black people will cast their vote for Kanye thus another for me along with poll closures gerrymandering Fine payments and photo id's Russia kicks in there I might win
Facebook removed from Trump‚Äôs official account the post of a video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said children are ‚Äúalmost immune‚Äù from covid-19. Twitter required his Team Trump campaign account to delete a tweet with the same video....
Trump may not be religious, but the communists that oppose him are God‚Äôs natural adversaries.  In the Godly scheme of things, Trump is more like an impartial mediator.  He‚Äôs a Republican, but secular enough to be...well...let‚Äôs just say he‚Äôs a Reagan Democrat, eh?
Ted should be the next President , after Trump! Only way to save ourselves from the commie takeover ! Good job on Karen today Ted !

If anyone was stupid enough to knock on my door for Trump, they would not enjoy the conversation
Trump traveled to Tulsa
It definitely is. If you're not getting your mail, you need to write your congressman. If you're a trump supporter, you need to not complain.
And you are right President Trump! Thank you for keeping us safe, doing a great job, but most importantly telling it like it is! Time people heard the truth, line it or not, for to long we‚Äôve been lied too ! It‚Äôs refreshing to have you as President!
So grateful for the Nat'l Guard and the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team during our  event last week.  This service has helped feed so many in our area.  #HungerHeroes  National Guard gets Trump OK, but uncertain to stay on food duty
Da fuq? Trump‚Äôs troops left town. Pretty straight forward
That's why Trump had a surplus when he took over. Give us a break.
Trump is in Cleveland üôÇ
One thing that I've learned, Trump is not too bright.
Because Trump elevated the US Attorney who gave Epstein a sweetheart plea deal to a Cabinet position. Cabinet members are highly scrutinized
Yeah but trump is just a big ole POS right??? Form your own opinions. The media is lying to you
Like we did for trump...
your biggest problem is that you get your information from TRUMP and he is a MORON and a pathological LIAR.  there is voter fraud in every election to some degree, but it cannot be directly connected to vote in ballots.  you're just coming off as stupid
This president calls it like it is. That's not being a racist, that's being truthful. Sometimes the truth isn't pretty, but it is the truth.
Greetings and Salutations... #Trump
I'm hoping President elect Bidens appointment to Attorney General is a real lion in investigation of the entire trump administration.
Due to trumps postal slow down, bill's are arriving late. Can I send late fees charges to Mitch, Manichean or directly to trump's re-election campaign?
you sir have no right to compare Trump with Putin. At least Trump sees that there is a need for law for protection for the people of these United States. If there is police defunding then you will see that there is no protection for the people of these United States!
They trying to collapse the economy. Fk Trump Administration
Without a doubt! Trump GOP2020
There are no cities destroyed. There are 157,000 dead Americans under Trump‚Äôs watch
I don‚Äôt have a Biden sign in my yard but I would swim through a pool of Covid-19 to cast a vote against Trump
Trump threatens lawsuit to block mail-in voting in Nevada  via  go ahead. You will lose. States have authority over there election of federal representatives unless congress says otherwise
#PeterNavarro Young people don't care Wait no one cares what you say it think Your a Trump boy  people know that Trying to blame China to deter and deflect This Administration have let 153000 Americans perish #Tiktoc So if it's a tracking data device Why would they sell it
Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong Un
157,000 dead on Trump‚Äôs watch but you‚Äôve found the real problem in America-crime In Chicago. Looking the other way must be a full time job for you
Panic, pissex off look, oh shit he knows, we‚Äôre screwed, no checks from big Pharma, I think I‚Äôm gonn throw up...... thoughts of Dr. what‚Äôs her name! Gotta love Trump.! Bet her and  Fausi didn‚Äôt sleep well
If you think 20 people is in force you're delusional. Just like your continued support of traitor, rapist, and racist Trump. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Yes I‚Äôm voting for Trump again
Trump fell in love with the murderous North Korean dictator
I know you want to ignore it given Trump‚Äôs pathetic performance. But 155,000 dead Americans on Trump‚Äôs watch ( so far) is a stink you can‚Äôt ignore
Of course not.  Trump works for Putin.
Info Wars is pretty cringe when they walking the streets with their stupid microphones, but the idea that Trump and his supporters are racist is beyond ridiculous.  People should know better by now.
THIS is why Trump is THE leader of the free world!
It‚Äôs working out better than Trump‚Äôs response to the pandemic
Trump knows what‚Äôs best about the pandemic, right? Says he does.Look around at the clusterfuck he‚Äôs presiding over (Let me anticipate your response: Trump‚Äôs not responsible)
The US sued him for racial discrimination in 1973
I‚Äôll have respect for the Office as soon as Trump does
We have 11% unemployment under Trump

Well, it seems that when  we vote on the machines some how, Donald Trump friends from Russia seems to hack into the system to rig the election.
Dont we have enough social media apps? The one President Trump wants to ban in the US is owned by Chi_na..We would just be handing over our personal data. Use Twitter,  FB, Instagram,.or any of the current aps. Geez, take some responsibilty.
Jonathan Isaac, you may become the most beloved basketball player. Overwhelming majority of Americans know that BLM is a phoney come on. All of the $$$ goes straight into Biden‚Äôs war chest. It does NOTHING to help black folks. President Trump has done more to help minorities.

Back in April,  posted this great story to our website. For anyone questioning just why TikTok was banned, do yourself a favor and read this.    #Trump #tiktokban
Trump should really stop talking about himself.
If that‚Äôs the test, then Dershowitz has the same character as Trump and Clinton?
#China #tiktokdown  Another distraction We didn't care before And what we don't have apps that Track and store data Keep blaming Ever since #CoronaVirus #Trump has managed to make them enemy #1 To slide Russia in there What does it matter virus is going to kill 90% of us slowly
Trump could have declassified those as soon as they we‚Äôre transcribed
White House advisor Ivanka Trump has been granted  34 trademarks by the Chinese Communist Party
He should‚Äôve told Trump to read the books out loud to him.
About law enforcement being prohibited from live streaming riots... WHY NOT? The anarchists are live streaming proof that they are Traitors. Domestic terrorists. PRESIDENT TRUMP, PLEASE name Antifa as a terrorist org.
Moving my ass over there if Trump wins
The Wuhan virus is not President Donald Trump‚Äôs fault and those of you that think it is probably believe that the poliovirus was Grover Cleveland‚Äôs fault in 1894.
Well, let us do some critical thinking about that!! Was the US targeted by China to bring our economy down. President Trump hasn‚Äôt exactly been easy on them with tariffs,  trade deals and he‚Äôs been very outspoken about China ripping the US off for years. Critical thinking.
He's also getting pretty good at blowing Trump   #GovDeWimp  #NoHelp  #RepresentationMatters  #privilege #Richards
Senator, you know very well that Trump is the highest placed Russian asset in history!  He envies Putin‚Äôs power and ruthlessness.  What are you going to do when Trump steals the election?  What are you going to do about his stormtroopers?
Trump supporters
And she sold our biggest shipping port on the west coast to China. Imagine that!!  Donald Trump got it back. Dems have hurt this country so much. Traitors!! Bought off by China.
I just got chills.  I saw a clip of the Trump supporter that was killed.  I immediately recognized that he was an angel. I  got the same chill watching this video.They are angels sent from God Answering our prayers to help our country and defeat our enemies (foreign and DOMESTIC)
Really not looking forward to going to this funeral on Tuesday...how about we all just become immortal ? ....Except for rapists, racists, murderers, molesters, pedophiles, and Trump.

Trump and Obama preached change too. And we‚Äôre still in the same situation, garbage in, garbage out.
No cities have been destroyed. You sound like Trump

Am I the only person who thinks TRUMPLESTILTSKIN has orchestrated these riots in  order to send in the feds and  save the poorly managed cities by us Democrats? I sure hope once Biden is in office Trump is investigated from the  first day he sat his ass down on the desk chairTrump's conjuring up a hoax to make his base think that he's doing something.
That's over and above the fact that it's too dangerous to travel to vacation somewhere. Our country is on fire and Trump is acting like he's the victim crying to his millionaire white country club members.
I wonder if Trump made them buy tickets.
And he can‚Äôt ‚Äú order‚Äù private companies to do anything! Or give the US ( Trump) money for a sale to another company....sorta like a cut.
I never watch Trump's pressers but I would have enjoyed Fox cutting away.
Trump‚Äôs baldspot.
How come all BLM protestors..also political activity...choose to wear masks even as Trump Troops shove &amp; teargas them? Stupid POS!
He looks like a college age Barron Trump.
Hey asshole....we already have that: it‚Äôs called Obamacare!! What a freaking load of crap Trump &amp; this administration is.
I had 2 root canals last Thursday (the Novocain wore off just as they were shoving medicine in the last root) and I still like that better than Trump.
It‚Äôs because a big part of their creators and users are American and that means if trump signs to ban it in America then they‚Äôll lose all of the creators and American users and they know that they will either have to do that or sign it over to Microsoft for a price!!!

The entire globe hates Trump, his approval rating is like 10%. It shouldn't be tough to find people that would like to have some digital  fun and do something patriotic for a better USA.
We have to work our asses off to get rid of Trump.
No way! Trump's ignorance has lead us on a path to death and Economic Depression. #TrumpsTheWorstPresidentEver
Trump's too ignorant and arrogant to address Covid-19. TikTok is an easier challenge. Cowards always take the easiest path!
It's imbedded in Trump's decrepit brain.
They're a bot or Trump Tool. Block them.
This could be a classic banner of truth against the Trump campaign.
You call Trump a President.
The antigen test was done and provided by the WH. Dewine has nothing to do with it. maybe Trump was scared that Dewine would ask him some hard questions....
I don‚Äôt see Iowa voting Trump but then voting for a blue Senator. It will be a down the ballot election with the exception of Maine and maybe Montana.
So basically....he called in sick so he didn't have to see Trump.  Cue the applause.
And complete sentences
Lolzzzzzzzzzz, Trump is such a fraud. I can‚Äôt believe he can say this without laughing
Again, can't win...small crowd it's obviously a sign against Trump....large crowd and Trump is trying to kill everyone with COVID.  Maybe, just maybe, this was the max allowed by the city?

We can't allow Trump to get by with all of his assaults on the middle class.
The President is suggesting that you overlook illegal activity in non-profits in Texas - is this true?
You're right about this. This needs to be scrutinized and reported. This is probably another money grab by Trump and his cronies.
Trump can't stop Athletes or anyone else from kneeling. This movement is much larger than Trump's Ego and its going to get any smaller!

It's amazing how the the right wingers have made the NRA theirs and disregarded everyone else. I certainly don't agree with the corruption that  Wayne Lapierre is involved in or the massive intertwined relationship with Trump. Looks like it's time for the real NRA to clean house!

Trump's not a True Republican!
Can a single republican tell me what church tRump will be attending this Sunday? Next Sunday? Or any day? He has no god because he thinks he is god.
Trump deflecting his guilt again!
Trump hasn‚Äôt done ANYTHING but destruction for LGBT equality‚Äî By cancellation of military aspects, cancellation of transgender surgery, from taking away ability to adopt....   and on and on and on.
Please don't allow Trump to defund Social Security like he's threatening to do.
these trump ads.
Trump will never get that into law. He's wolfing as usual.
That's one way to avoid being associated with Trump's scum.
I don't even listen to what the Dotard Trump says anymore. You can bet that the Trumps are complicit in fleecing the NRA also. Hopefully Texas will say No to the NRA.
Trump is a liar and a cheater. What possible reason would anyone have to vote for a cheating liar? Trump is a danger to our health, our security, and justice. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Joe Biden has proven time and time again to never do anything to help the minorities. But you all want Trump our so bad, that you‚Äôre willing to vote in another career politician who‚Äôs done absolutely nothing?
I hope it's too late for Trump in Florida. He's not done them any favors.
Because EVERYONE can vote.  No one needs to justify the need for absentee voting.  It will terrifically raise the numbers of voters and the number of people leaning Biden will grow further.  Or, Trump hates to lose.
Actually they help a lot. I have a nephew who was homeless and through Trump's administration work on jobs he is now employed and doing well. If it was Republican politics that caused homelessness then how is it that the cities with the highest homelessness rates are run by

Given Trump's sway over the core of the GOP, I actually think Don, Jr. could pull off the same path to the GOP nomination in 2024. Consistently get 30 to 40% in every primary while all the "mainstream" GOP candidates fight each other and fail to coalesce around one candidate.
Lady, you are totally off your rocker. I personally stood in line at the poll and voted in person for none other than Donald J Trump. I happen to know that people all over the country went to the ballot box to ensure Trump became  WATCH REAL NEWS.
You've pretty succinctly summarized both the 2016 and 2020 elections. The only thing missing due to 280 character limit would be does Trump drag the GOP brand down so far that the Senate flips to Dems. Currently it looks like he would.
Censoring is totally unamerican but I guess when it‚Äôs trump.. people are celebrating. What happened to freedom of speech? Meanwhile Facebook has censored #SaveTheChildren and left pedo pages of little boys up that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt violate community standards‚Äù.

Please hold Ohio Governor Dewine accountable for the extreme abuse of power he has exerted on the citizens of Ohio.  We love Trump and Freedom and need your support against our own Governor.
The sad thing is trump is a hate filled liar so he will be out in November
The most unfit in American history is donald trump
I don‚Äôt think joe Biden knows what joe Biden‚Äôs is thinking. I know he thinks we should vote for trump though... rather peculiar.
She is on her knees begging Trump for forgiveness because he spoke ill of her yesterday. She changes her opinion as the wind blows. We need less Dr. Scarf and more Dr. Fauci. He obviously speaks the truth because Trump likes to severely curtail his speech!
I can create a Paradise on earth if people gave me as much power as they give people like Donald Trump. At least, I‚Äôll be open to share my power among equals. Like fuck a leader &amp; a folllwer. And this dying eras of people still participating with this dying system. #staywoke
Trump could stop this harassment but he's not  even trying.
Hopefully this sick plot is transparent to young black voters. We won't survive another 4 years of Trump!
I always voted all red, then took 2016 off because I couldn't vote either. Regretted in 2017, have gone Dem ever since, Trump isn't even fiscally Republican, which used to be my excuse! #LincolnVoter
And with Trump gone it will not change. The Republican party depends on ignorance ( destroy education), religion (twist Bible quotes), racism( fear of the other), and lots of $$$$$.
How rude of you, Trump! How rude!
Trump 2020
The silent majority is there. I‚Äôve talked to many of them. The problem is that they‚Äôll stay home this election. Trump needs to stay off Twitter and change his tactics on mail in ballots if he wants any chance of winning.
Many of these possible voters are pro-police, pro-2nd Amendment. Yet one or two will vote Biden because they view Trump‚Äôs decision to rail against mail in ballots as voter suppression.
and older folk feel betrayed by Trump‚Äôs calls to stop mail-in voting despite Trump doing it himself. Honestly, Democrats are going out of their way to hand Trump a chance to be the reasonable choice. Trump proceeds to jump a cliff instead.
No,that would be trump
IT‚ÄôS NOT EVEN IN ME TO WISH BAD ON SOMEBODY. MY HEART SO BIG AND DUMB... I BE TRYING TO SEE THE GOOD IN DONALD TRUMP LIKE Q üòÇ BUT MY MIND SO BIG AND SMART.... SO I BE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THIS SYSTEM WITH MY WORDS ON YOUTUBE AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE MY MAMA AIN‚ÄôT RAISE NO FOOL.
Even Nixon had the decency to resign. Trump not so much.
Do you have children? And if you do and you‚Äôre willing to risk their lives just so you can support Trump, then someone needs to take those poor kids away from you
Since when did facts get in the way of a Trump ‚Äúoration?‚Äù ü•¥
he said this to his nephew because his nephew called him out on being a racist Trump supporter. He‚Äôs the CEO of this company so he can‚Äôt be fired but we can expose him. He announced he (his product) was coming to Amazon.
The GOP led by the war by Trump lied about the Coronavirus and people lost their lives and livelihoods.    Fixed it for you.
Watch this fabulous interview by Johnathan Swan of Axios. Trump demonstrates that his reality is a figment of his imagination.
Must be a Trump supporter.....notice the limited vocabulary!! üòúü§£
Trump: Our kids will do just fine back in school!  Our kids:
I'm afraid the Evangelical community has invested too much in politics and not enough in prayer.  I fear if Trump loses all bets are off; and it won't be because of Biden.
How about ANOTHER lawsuit for him/his campaign!!!!
Who is more delusional trump of his supporters?
Seems fishy, since Trump took from the Pentagon budget to fund part of a wall.  Now they want to boost up the Pentagon budget with funds from a COVID  relief bill ü§î
Protests are fine, but not going to a race where you can easily stay six feet apart and masks are required.  THIS is why so many are upset, and Trump will get re-elected.
Holy crap. This is real and happened 45 minutes ago. MSNBC still talking about Trump
You should‚Äôve had THAT conversation with Trump 3.5 years ago. He‚Äôs blown out our national debt with his ridiculous tax cuts for his buddies and HIS businesses. #TrumpFailedAmerica
How can Trump's mental state be acceptable?
It‚Äôs no coincidence TikTok is an epicenter of Trump criticism. This is a political move, not a security one.
Trump on John Lewis' legacy: "he didn't come to my inauguration"
And just for Trump! 'Graphs can lie to you!!' Ha ha
Exactly, so let us push dirt over FOX "News", AKA the Trump channel.
Imagine a world without Donald Trump!
Pay Trump a vig?!?! That‚Äôs where it‚Äôll end up.
Trump
Well....tell that to Jim Jordan. He‚Äôs tweeting like Trump....
trump lied and Americans died
No, that would be donald trump
OMG, I cannot WAIT to vote for President Trump in November.
I cannot stand how Trump fans have taken "Karen" and used it against people who stand up for women's rights, trans rights, BLM, etc. We are not the Karen's.  A Karen is used on someone who isn't getting their way and complains to the manager, typically seen in retail.
He‚Äôs not Trump..  proven record... he and Obama were a great team... he‚Äôs not a republican
2nd that, won't trust any vaccine associated with Trump.
Fuck this guy....and all Trump spawn!!!
I hope you're right about Trump's destiny being jail.
The same people on Twitter who think Trump is too stupid to tie his own shoes are the same people that think he is capable of leading some grand secret plan to take over the country.   Pick a side. Stupid or evil Genius. Can't be both.   My vote is for idiot narcissist.
Thank you all for outing yourselves so we know who needs kicked out when Trump wins again...
So the GOP can afford to lose Colorado (Cory Gardner), Arizona (Martha McSally) and Maine (Susan Collins) while Trump wins, giving them a majority via Vice President. (51-50)
You‚Äôre right There are too many trump supporters that are to ashamed that they support him I would be too
I‚Äôm already planning to do mail in voting where I live and I hope more states will jump on board like Nevada has so it will be easier for people to vote Trump out in November.
Nevada did the right thing. We need to do whatever we have to do to remove Trump from office. We also need to remove as many of the GOP from Congress as we can.
If you like what Nevada has done regarding Mail-In voting, which in my opinion is pretty progressive &amp; needed, then remember, this could only have happened because voting is a state's issue. Voter reg and election admin happens at the state level.   This is out of Trump's reach.
You need to put something negative about Trump as your catch phrase to get it through. The officer Tatum put 'I will never vote for Trump again' as his catch phrase and his video went right through. He explained in 2024 he can't vote for Trump so it worked.
Trump's Republican Party is defined by racism and those who tolerate it: GOP strategist
I guess Trump missed that memo.
Trump may be related to the elite too and I don't trust him neither but I trust him more than anyone else we ever had in office and I'm all for keeping his dumb ass in office because let's be honest... this is our last president anyways.  USA GOING OUT WITH A BANG lol.
But it‚Äôs perfectly OK for Trump to undermine Fauci?!! Okey dokey..,
Nope, you‚Äôre wrong. Trump stopped flights from China AND later from Europe, except for Americans coming home. In both cases, Pelosi, Schumer, ABC CBS NBC CNN cried NO REASON to stop flights: Xenophobia &amp; other BS! Fauci was in on both decisions and said this saved American lives!
Trump drug out in handcuffs falling and tripping allllll the way to a prison sentence in which he never sees the light of day free again
trump parted the Red Sea
Hey         Bet  will hate seeing this posted all over..  anyone got TikTok to spread it??
A less sharp  Joe Biden is100% better than a lying corrupt trump
$5,000 reward offered after North Carolina bear found with ‚ÄòTrump 2020‚Äô sticker on collar
Make Trump be gone!
No, because Dr Fauci brings expertise to only ONE side of an issue. But, our lives are very complex, and as President ALL aspects have to be understood &amp; considered before taking action. That‚Äôs why Trump was ahead of all you naysayers by asking how can we work to reopen America!
Got my family‚Äôs vote!  Trump 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏the silent majority will speak out for Trump!
Disagree... Biden will make trump look the fool he is..
Well, at least we will be rid of the Trump virus soon.
Can you imagine the look on Trump‚Äôs face if anyone touched his arm to bring him to a fan? You can‚Äôt fake this instant utter joy on her face. SHE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT so don‚Äôt make us beg for VP! Name her today,  #BidenHarris2020
It‚Äôs gotten way worse with trump
No that would be donald trump
Trump trying to pry the Bernie folks.
We have the right to know about his health.  Every single President before him released yearly physical exam information.  Trump doesn‚Äôt... so he shows signs of illness and we are being lied to... it matters..
I did get more active because of trump. And I‚Äôm not leaving!  The resistance will still be needed!
Trump's going to lose this one. Only ignorant people will vill volunteer kids and teachers for such a dastardly experiment.
If only he defended his student athletes as vociferously as he does Trump who admits to sexually assaulting women.
It literally isn‚Äôt &amp; I NEVER said I hated Trump. But what you‚Äôre saying I did, you did, plain and simple. There‚Äôs no arguing that point. ‚úåüèº
The real fool is trump
There you go again ABC, quoting dishonest polling data with non-random samples just to make Trump look bad and as though America is not in agreement with him. When will you ABC ever learn? You are repeating your mistakes of 2016! You are doomed to relive it as Trump wins in 2020!
I can't get over how happy I am that Trump is planning to ban TikTok. Do you realize how many fucking times I've accidentally been caught in the background of one because I was simply just at my locker.
I agree. We have to get Trump out of office. Just remember everybody a vote for anybody other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
He won‚Äôt refuse... its trump who‚Äôll run scared
Joe shouldn't get down in the mud with Trump. Trump will try to create a Circus to distract attention away from his ignorance.
Obama underwent fire his entire presidency as well. People act like Trump is the only one who gets fought and questioned along the way. I know this though...his irresponsible tweets bring the majority of it in himself.Trump, you gonna need more Lawyers. It appears shit isn't going your way.
Hey Trump, insurers already cover pre existing conditions. You may want to read the ACA (OBAMA CARE).
Trump is coming for Democrats and he‚Äôs bringing some hell with him. Grab some pop corn
Exactly! Most of the failures and delays come from him! Besides Trump, McConnell is the main one who HAS to go. It's imperative for the change we need.
Once again Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "China Virus". What a disgrace
It strains the imagination to realize that Trump, his admin. picks, &amp; Trump Republicans are so callous to the plight of the citizens they are suppose to serve. People are really suffering. The Admin. &amp; its loyalists are only concerned about cramming their own corrupt pockets
They literally threw a mini rally together and called it a press conference to get him in a better mood because he‚Äôs fuming over his campaign.
Trump's picks for all the government agencies were people who were against the mission of the agency. I remember reading the first list of picks for the heads of them with horror. It was clear they were put in charge to destroy their goal.
Tonight‚Äôs bizarre press ‚Äúconference‚Äù was thrown together at last minute with no real news, but because the president wanted to simulate one of his rallies with his customers after getting angry after a day of meetings about how bad his campaign is going.
I am attempting to dismiss the thought that this has been orchestrated. The timely pandemic, (months preceeding election) many people are  diagnosed positive that surround Trump. He's clear, how? He's must have BP and Cholesterol issues and he's over weight.
Wow, just about everything about that Trump press ‚Äúconference‚Äù was a new level of bizarreness. He so wants to try to during these into his hate rallies. He even tried to build a nonpress cheering section for him.
So five years later we learn that Trump‚Äôs health care plan is actually.... ObamaCare but through executive order instead of federal legislation.
Trump on preexisting conditions EO: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been done before....‚Äù Except as statutory law by Obama/Biden that Trump has sued to invalidate... repeatedly.
Yep, that‚Äôs an idiot alright. Trump‚Äôs record is clear: he‚Äôs been the worst President on the economy with the worst jobs record.
Just today, Trump intell people once again catches Vlad sticking his nose illegally in or elections. All the work the Republicans did to put them in their place destroyed in less than 4 years. Why the love for Russia? They have nothing economically to offer us. They are the enemy
They all lie from time to time, however making empty promises, that are actually lies are not necessary. Checking my self-esteem at the door won't happen. I certainly don't support sexual predators like Trump or Clinton. And criminality deffinently is not a trait to be admired.
We don't need to illegally use foriegn aid to being elections. You have no clue what a next term for Trump would be. He doesn't either. By the way, where's the healthcare bill he said he was signing this week. Brainwashed people support habitual liars.
Thanks for the follow Charlie, do you think Pres Trump will carry Texas?
Yes! Help me out please. My fb is full of Magats. My hometown in Ohio loves Trump. My family too. I started Twitter during the impeachment.  I find my comfort here! My family said I'm going to hell for not voting Trump...I'm now the "black sheep". I'll claim it. #DumpTrump
How can Trump allow Nixon to have the greatest Presidential resignation of all time‚ÄΩ
Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November
I see all the anger coming from your side bozo . All you have to do is look at a Trump rally . Just happy people. You just hate it don‚Äôt ya
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‚Äòbasement‚Äô
Boy you must think people are stupid. Well I guess most Trump supporters are imbeciles.
Not funny. #politics
Bro you just posted cringe, complaining yet still forcing into the tweet your dislike of Trump, or supporters of Trump.üòÜüòÜ
Has nothing to do with whether you're a Trump fan or not. You just make the same type of comment Trump has continually makes. Birds of a feather!
I honestly can‚Äôt believe you posted this ridiculous video no where was Howard or Trump talking about underage girls get your facts straight
Yep....But I bet you won‚Äôt see it on Trump golf courses. Can you hear me laughing at Liberals ?
Great - but aren't with still 15,000,000 million plus in the hole?  15 MILLION people who lost their jobs, and likely won't be re-employed for 12 or more months.  Great job Trump.
You obviously are not researching hard enough!! But just keep blaming Trump that‚Äôs all the left does to deflect the truth
Ok üëå nobody denies Trump locker room talk isn‚Äôt out there at times but he is not a pedohile period it‚Äôs bs the left is creating to destroy a man that is trying to change the country for the best ( the left just can‚Äôt stand it ) period
Yes drain the swamp TRUMP 2020
Trump can only DELAY collection, he cannot waive or cancel it.  Companies to protect themselves are being advised to still collect the tax out of the employees pay, and hold it until it has to be paid.  If the company fails to collect and hold, they are likely liable for it.
Yeah...Liberals are always so angry. Where‚Äôs the love ? Trump people are so happy and they can‚Äôt stand it
Trump INHERITED a strong economy from Obama/Biden, it weakened every year until he absolutely imploded it this year. You have the worst job record of any President in modern times. Record breaking drops in GDP group. This thread is absolute nonsense.
Let Operation Warp Speed have this. If true this is huge. On another note TRUMP CURES CANCER
Only Trump can do this
Too late they have already exposed their agenda. Trump 2020
I saw a report that Kanye isn‚Äôt the one putting his name on the ballot in battleground states but rather Trump lawyers and supporters are actually doing it to draw votes away from Biden. Complete crap! üò°
Start by getting rid of Trump and his family along with McConnel, Graham, Jordan, and every Republican who voted against removing Trump from office.

Conservative values used to be fiscal conservatism, definitely not friends of Putin, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. And you always forget that Trump gave money to the Clinton's and numerous dems.  Living in Trump world requires amnesia!
I feel like Trump saying ‚Äúin numerous categories were lower than the world‚Äù isn‚Äôt getting the attention I needs...    I guess when you deem 155,000 deaths  ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù one stupid has to outshine the other. #coronavirus #TrumpIsALaughingStock   #TrumpHasNoPlan
You‚Äôd let us Americans in right now? Coming from someone whose family may seriously choose New Zealand as an escape route if Trump gets re-elected.
The phrase consider your source is self explanatory and widely used for decades. Are you suffering from the same issue that Trump has, a lack of understanding of the English language?
Yep... Then we can elect another Trump. Lets get that started. Funny
Have you seen anything about a remark Trump supposedly made about not being seen for awhile?
ATTENTION: Trump's people gave the test to Governer Dewine, they said he was positive, he takes a 2nd test later in the day on his own and tests negative, Trump didn't want Dewine there because he encourages masks and speaks SCIENCE, JUST LIKE HE WONT LET DR. FAUCI SPEAK
Wait where is the fuckers in the comments saying good another trump voter behind bars
People who put Trump flags in their yard are just asking for attention and trouble. Actually I think all political flags are tacky no matter who it‚Äôs for, but Trump flags are expecially tackyüòâ
If Biden can destroy God, then Trump should give up, unless he believes he is more powerful than God. But that would be blasphemy.
Gotta love after  tries dunking on DeWine over getting COVID despite preaching masks it turns out DeWine is negative and Trump testing is just bad.
We won't have a democracy if he gets elected again. Trump and Barr will be our new rulers. That's terrifying.

Trump says that Biden is against God because Trump thinks he is a god.
You would think  actually not having the coronavirus during Trump‚Äôs Ohio visit would be good news for the campaign, but instead it‚Äôs lead to reporting about... how flawed their own testing is.
Dewine power-played Trump. True conservatives despise Trump. It‚Äôs hilarious.
needs to be investigated for using tax payer dollars to travel to do presidential things that ends up turning into his campaign rallies.  I think that may be illegal. #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpFraud #Trump #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHasNoPlan #PresidentTrump
Can I rescind my membership of the white race? I mean, the fact that 50% of white folks would still vote for Trump certainly reflects lack of intelligence &amp; lack of values.
DeWine staffer: Sir, Trump is coming into town.   : I have COVID. Can‚Äôt  go darn.   Does this mean I‚Äôm now in charge?  DeWine: Suddenly, I no longer have COVID.
Trump says he going to do something outrageous &amp; repeats it a few times. Everyone says he just talking, trying to divert, he can't do that. Later we find out he did it, even if it was against the rules, Constitution, etc.
Not sure Trump has that much money. Might need to declare bankruptcy again.
Since Donald Trump is a white supremacist in office. We need a black supremacist in president office  so we can get justice

Things Trump has wrecked while trying to convince Americans he should continue to be President: - The economy - Pandemic response - The postal service What else?
Attack so. Attacking Trump is much easier  His gaffs are legendary. Bleach, ultraviolet light, yo sim mite? Really kellyanne you should be able to do better.
But  Trump literally already did it and called it his trade deal.
Trump‚Äôs own advisors recognize what a dolt he is...and the dangers of that self-serving idiocy.
Head lines :  Trump mispronounces one word. No Head lines Joe Biden is a dementia patient
get off the fence, Meghan, and show some respect for your father.  Endorse Biden and help get rid of trump.
In the past 48 hours alone, we‚Äôve seen Trump campaign misappropriate a picture of  in prayer for a sleezy attack ad and Trump question Biden‚Äôs personal religious faith. These are new lows in politics. Trump should not be lying and attacking  religious faith.
They certainly do. This something that could have been done years ago but President Trump DID it
Reminder that in ‚Äò16 Trump dodged a primary debate for a supposed veterans event his campaign then manufactured and then got caught failing to make the promise donation...
Never heard prison referred to as a beautiful resort, but given Trump‚Äôs mental loss, it may be true.
Biden is a devote Catholic and has been his whole life. He has even met with Pope Francis a number of times to discuss policy and has received Communion from Pope Francis. Who should I believe, the Pope or Trump?

It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting that Trump of all people would attack  as a man of faith.  Completely unfounded slander.
Trump has destroyed millions of American jobs this year alone. Manufacturing was in recession BEFORE the pandemic. You are delusional.
Still reviewing authority of Trump to issue Executive Order that suspends or changes the IRS tax code on payroll taxes (legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law by a former president). The law is clear; it‚Äôs not a matter of interpretation for Executive power.
I am still researching on what authority Trump can issue an Executive Order that suspends or changes the IRS tax code, which is legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law by a former president. The law is clear; it‚Äôs not a matter of interpretation for Executive power.

Trump isn‚Äôt ever going to hire you, nor will Fox, Ari.
You‚Äôre projecting. Trump was too scared to stand up to China on the virus or Hong Kong because he was afraid it might prevent his disasterous trade deal China is already breaking.
Yep, that‚Äôs utter garbage alright. Trump can‚Äôt even keep China keep to half of its commitment in his so called trade deal after nearly putting the country in a recession with his disasterous trade war.
Correction: Trump Campaign circulates and files petitions to collude to put totally unqualified man on Ohio ballot for president in racial stunt.

It‚Äôs ignorant as hell to think that all trump supporters are religious, racist, and rednecks. Like seriously can you tell me why you hate him so much? Genuinely wanting to know

Person. Women. Man. Camera. TV. =  Trump loses. Biden and a women win. Camera takes pics of Trump crying. Biden and Women on TV giving victory speech.
Donald Trump is a National embarrassment on the world stage, we must take the White House away from him he doesn't deserve to live within the scared walls of The People's House never has deserved it and never will. Vote on November 3rd
Don‚Äôt let the Democratic Party run game, Biden ain‚Äôt shit just like Trump. #NoVote #DefundThePolice
Because Trump did!!!!!
This isn‚Äôt opinion this is fact. Republicans are so worried trump will lose the election that they are trying to steal votes away from Biden
Trump's daily "Covid" briefings should be called "How many Lies can you tell in 30 minutes." Or "How many false self-aggrandizing phrases can you utter."
Seriously cause the right thinks it's to take  for Trump
Trump is technically correct. The Hatch Act doesn‚Äôt apply to the President though there were still a line they wouldn‚Äôt cross and it does apply to his staff.
. is correct. Trump‚Äôa trade war with China has been an unmitigated disaster.
Guess what  nobody cares, still voting for Trump in November.
Trump is going to BLOW UP!
President Trump said today on TV that it had not been determined for sure what caused the explosion. Did you not even listen ?
I doubt Trump knows that Joe Biden is a devote Catholic. Has been his entire life. He has stated personally he does not support abortion, but also understands that is the law in the US. As VP or POTUS he must follow the law. Congress must change the law.
I can‚Äôt either.  Trump 2020   There I have it figured out

Such a rebel aren‚Äôt ya?
Me! I'm in Ohio. Startes Twitter during the impeachment. My town loves the trump goon! So does my family. Fb is full of Magats ! Help!
They will not be "debates."  Trump will lie and Biden will correct him.  Trump screws up, MSM will ignore it.  Biden makes even a minor error, MSM will crucify Biden.  There is no upside for Biden. Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was afraid; NO ONE WILL BELIEVE TRUMP.
You don't help another candidate you are running against.  While I don't think Trump campaign is providing ‚Äúsubstantial assistance‚Äù to West, it appears close to colluding.   /EOM
Is this just another way of directing funds to Trump or one of his kids?
Trump is going to lose because he is an asshole ASSUMING young people and minorities bother to vote.  The summer protests show those groups are passionate but in 2016 they didn‚Äôt vote due to a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton.  Old man Biden isn‚Äôt exactly Obama as far as coolness.
I hope Biden just tells them to f'off.  These "debates" will be Trump lying and Biden correcting him.  No upside for Biden.  Let Trump rant all he wants that Biden was "afraid."  No one will believe it.
This list is a joke.  Biden needs to tell Trump to go f' himself.
My understanding (unconfirmed) is that the firm represents the Trump Campaign in Ohio.  Kayne is using other law firms that are also representing the Trump Campaign.
West needs just 5,000 valid registered voters signatures to qualify.  His "campaign" is being helped by the GOP.  His lawyer/law firm is the same as that working for the Trump Campaign. What a surprise.

Any idea if his team (should say GOP Team Trump) was able to obtain the number of signatures and whether they are VALID?  Kayne's had trouble in the past getting enough valid registered voter signatures. Was the deadline today? Thanks for the update.
Rightfully so since Trump thinks that injecting bleach is a way to go. They probably scheduled the test once they heard Trump berating Canada for burning down the White House. Not crazy, just stupid as fuck!
Trump never said that but of course you don‚Äôt care about facts before the infamous lie that CNN spreads  he unequivocally condemned the white supremacists who showed up in Charlottesville get your facts straight
Trump needs you on his campaign staff.
Sorry if you were a Trump supporter and you are black....You have turned your back on your people. No other way to look at it.
If Trump had said that to that host all hell would break loose.

President Trump has policies to help minority communities. They only see the Democrats when it‚Äôs election time. Then here they come with more empty promises
thinks workers should carry the risk of investing in a dying industry. How is that letting people have power over their money. Care to answer
A Pence pardon in this situation would be an abuse of power and an impeachable offense. The pardon won‚Äôt hold up to the litigation that follows. Trump can‚Äôt escape the multiple state felonies he will be indicted on, prosecuted and jailed. But otherwise OK.

That doesnt matter. What I think of trump doesnt matter. The root of the problem is there will never be changex when the 'good party'really isnt much better. Trump can be a shitty person along with biden, both can be true.
Yes it would be a good thing if Trump pardoned Snowden. Obama should‚Äôve without question done it. And Biden should if Trump does it. He‚Äôs a hero

They are hiding Biden's obvious diminished capacity. If elected, Kamala Harris will be the only Veep who can utilize the #25A as soon as there are enough cabinet members to sign off. I'm guessing she'll be quietly getting them to pre-sign it in exchange for their appointment.
They want Biden in office because he is not an idiot and does not let emotions run the country.

I'm not denying that by most standards Hunter Biden was overpaid.  I'd also argue that a surprisingly high number of executives and board folk are often overpaid, for their contacts.  I've, personally, overpaid to have some people, for their contacts.

Equal time. Biden or Harris should follow him.  Fact checking and shame him when he lies. I think he would hesitate to lie if he were held accountable when he does it.
Trump gives hour long press conferences regularly. Do you think Joe Biden could do the same?
Shameful that Biden did not interview and males, black or white for he VP spot - he was to hell bent on choosing a female and black women to play up to those demographics so he would gain votes. Harris is so left thinking, and unable to work across the aisle - sad
What is it with the Trumpers? They have to post their Trump signs in their yards. Are the Dems just more private?  Not seeing the Biden support. I am worried for Ohio!
They are definitely selling merch. One of the volunteers discovered a home in West Park today with a Trump shrine in the backyard. (Guessing someone trying to compensate for being in a neighborhood full of Biden signs)

Then you are voting for Trump. I hate Biden and I am still voting for him. But, by all means, use your "freedom of choice" to hamper any chance of ousting our soon to be dictator for life if it makes you feel better than everyone else.

Consistent with the last 40 years, Trump inheriting the longest economic expansion in history from Obama and Biden then running it into the ground is par for the course.
60% of Dems say somewhat or very likely. This does not say much for Biden, it seems to me. They could be correct if a) Biden drops out &amp; she wins this year, or ) Trump wins this year and Harris wins ‚Äò24. I say no chance on either.

AOC isn‚Äôt a factor offline though. No one in my family has even heard of her. It‚Äôs also hard to run when you have passed zero legislation. I don‚Äôt think the current ‚Äúleft‚Äù even exists in 4 years of Biden wins.
Its typically largely on speaking fees and book deals.  There are some moral politicians (see Biden, Joe) that don't even hold stock while they're in public office.  Other politicians flock to their own resorts on the country dime constantly, raking in millions.
I literally saw a Biden ad that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll actually read my daily briefings‚Äù like.... that‚Äôs the standard, sir
You're right. Let's vote green or some horseshit so Trump can further destroy the EPA even further and make sure the country is under water by 2035. No post office either. Let's do that because Biden isn't woke enough and how him and Trump are "BASICALLY THE SAME!"

Joel Bitonio and Joe Biden‚Äôs renamed adopted child
So, Burisma hired Hunter Biden to pressure Joe Biden to pressure Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, earlier than he was otherwise going to be fired, to stop an investigation which almost assuredly did not exist.  That's a phenomenal waste of money, if true.
Please explain, in detail, what is criminal about overpaying someone for a job.   Also, its insane to me that the belief is they overpaid to get Biden to fire a prosecutor, who was absolutely going to be removed regardless.  The man was horribly corrupt. The world was on to him.
This is an awful and entirely corrupt man that parts of the right wing are clutching to, in hopes that they can make Joe Biden look half as corrupt as Donald Trump.  That's your honest goal.  Just make him look a little corrupt next to the Trump Taj Mahal of Graft and Corruption.
Harris is at her best on television prosecuting the case against Trump or against bad actors in his administration. That's her superpower. Every good politician has strengths and other areas where they can improve. She also shares Biden's empathy, another big plus.
I just hope it becomes a little more clear before the election this is something that‚Äôs very important because I feel Joe Biden and Obama were really behind all this and Hillary they should have to pay

Totally disagree. Biden should keep his public appearances to the bare minimum. Let Trump talk. Trump is his own worst enemy. Nothing says, vote for Biden more than listening to Trump.
I promise he isn‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt it bother you that you will vote for a guy who said he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúraise his children in a racial jungle‚Äù? Or if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù like he is an owner? Or how he said the black community isn‚Äôt diverse in thought?
A vote for Biden is just a vote for Trump to lose his job and the hope that the next monster is slightly better and that is a huge wager that has no way of guaranteeing anything.
If people were honest and said that Biden/Harris is a bad dice roll they ate just hoping will be less bad, I might have more respect for them. Harm reduction is bs, and even choosing your enemy, while more honest than most cases is also pretty unsubstantive.
Everyone going full Kenzidor makes me wonder how this site is going to get its anxiety dopamine addiction fed after a Biden landslide.
Funny how we have never seen an original of trumps birth certificate. Does one exist?  Is he eligible to be president. If I were future President Biden I would hold off on the debates until he releases his tax returns and birth certificate. And his school transcripts.
I tried very hard to find an eloquent way to say this but all I can come up with as it relates to the Harris/Biden  spectacle is:  This is Bullshit!

Biden and Obama are very different, and tensions were inevitable. But that makes their relationship even more impressive. That said, I've been behind Biden the entire campaign. He's the right man for this moment.

You stuck on silliness. And the damn Dems keep play us, Roland. Don't act like Biden didn' t just throw black women a curveball lol. In my opinion, she doesn't care about African Americans. She's only black when it's time to vote. smh, so I might take my vote somewhere else.
Harris knows Biden is going to last that why this wants to be a black woman when it's time to get the black vote is all smiles. Cornel West should no this.
Since Joe Biden can hold a press conference and answer zero questions, President Trump should start a  program at his and say he will answer 2 more questions than Joe Biden at his press conference. So yesterday Biden answered zero so Trump should only answer 2

I believe Warren did really well with Latino and Black voters when they last polled, pretty sure it was better than Kamala there, but I‚Äôd like to see ticket poll numbers of just Trump v Biden with new cross tab breakdowns.

Presumably, people who think Trump is similar to (or more liberal than) themselves are likely to vote Trump (=33%)  People who say Biden is similar/more conservative than them are likely to prefer him (=42%)  Which matches Biden's approx 8-9 point lead in the polling avg.

This is just anecdotal, conspiratorial nonsense.  The media covered Biden the most, and Bernie second, because that's where they stood in the polls from the start.  Do you think the media was biased against Klobuchar because they gave Bernie 8 times as much coverage?

Why don‚Äôt they ask joe Biden Obama and kamala the same question lol
What in the world does that have to do with anything? You're saying that because one TV network didn't carry Bernie's announcement live IN A DIFFERENT ELECTION that the public was somehow duped into electing Biden four years later?
Look at the exit polls in the primaries for one. Two, CNN, and other mainstream media did nothing but feed the narrative that bernie, whonwas smashing joe at the time, was unelectable . Meanwhile when biden finally ekked out his first win, they declared it over.
This is such an absurd premise.  Biden led in the polls from day one.  Nobody "force fed" anyone anything.  There was a primary election, which Biden won overwhelmingly, even after losing the first two states which probably gave other candidates like Bernie a big advantage.
Trump cause then after this term he is gone and not really a Biden fan.
Joe Biden advocated for segregation, called blacks a monolith compared to Latinos, and said ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù for not supporting his old white career politician ass...Kamala put people in prison for Weed! And prosecuted parents for their kids Truency attendance from school...

I refuse to let 2016 get me scared. That was a historic fluke that required about 20 impossible variables all happening at once. My prediction: Biden wins a massive landslide, and even carries an unthinkable state (Alaska) and one ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù senate win.
There's a chicken and egg thing here about how Biden was Obama's VP pick in the first place precisely because he fit this reassuring image of a "normal old white guy politician"  And if Hillary had been VP that might not have helped her the same way it's helped him
Why.üòÇ What could possibly be the reason you get turned on by this. ü§¢üòñ
I mean, by all accounts, the reasoning Biden gave to Obama and others for breaking his original promise not to run in 2016 is that he strongly believes if he'd been the nominee he'd have beaten Trump  Because of, among other things, that VP cred
The article also has a bold-faced lie as its premise. No one cares about Biden‚Äôs Catholicism. What matters is that NO ONE impose their religious views on others. That includes evangelicals, RCs or anyone else with their hands on our uteruses.
Well, it's notable when you have lots of people seeing Biden as a surrogate that he apparently tried to tell Joe not to run (as he did back in 2016)
The irony is that the reason Obama did not do this seems to be he really didn't favor Biden as the best possible candidate (he didn't want him to run in the first place) but didn't like anyone else either

I see Biden riding a bike. I see Trump with one foot in the grave. The criminal deep state right wing media is so full of shit. RESIST THE MADNESS before it's too late!!!
Will Joe Biden ever take questions from the press?
If you don‚Äôt vote for Joe Biden, you are willing to tolerate four more years of deadly racism in this country.
Alright, I just know the homie  was talking about writing in a vote and people were clowning him.   Basically telling him he doesn't have a choice, he is going to vote for Biden or his vote don't count.
Even now Biden is offering to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare. That‚Äôs yet another giveaway to the insurers who would LOVE to offload sicker 55+ year olds to the government.
"The response has been overwhelming. In the last 24 hours, we've raised $26 million. One hundred and fifty thousand of you (were) first-time contributors," Biden said. "It's really palpable, the excitement, because there's so much at stake." (via CNN)
I *knew* people would begin to see Sen. Harris as those of us who vociferously supported her presidential bid saw her. We are fired up and ready to go! #KHive #BidenHarris2020

Imagine pretending to be from the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and thinking that supporting Trump‚Äôs opponent is ‚Äúterrible politics.‚Äù  Note of course that everyone this idiot supports also supports Biden/Harris.
I‚Äôm not saying republicans aren‚Äôt using propaganda but public information shows she‚Äôs going to do what‚Äôs good for the establishment. You know black and brown cops will do whatever to cater to law enforcement so they can impress their white superiors and who did Biden pick? IJS
you're angry because not enough people voted for your candidate and AOC doesn't get to speak at an event.  we're angry because there's a fascist dictator about to be re-elected, but too many of rose twitter are too privileged to vote for Biden because they're feelings were hurt.
If Biden was 1/2 the things Trump says he is, I‚Äôd probably actually vote 4 Biden
I don't get it.  Choose between Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.  Which ticket did you think she was going to pick?
Based on trumps little performance right there, we should just give the presidency to Biden!!!
I‚Äôd give up beef to get Biden elected, and I freakin‚Äô LOVE cheeseburgers. It‚Äôs literally my favorite thing to eat. That‚Äôs how much I despise Trump.
Look at it this way. I‚Äôm voting. I don‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. They aren‚Äôt Orange fuck. If the last 4 years has been an indicator of anything it‚Äôs that they aren‚Äôt him.

THE "FRIGHTENED LITTLE MAGA SNOWFLAKE TRUMPTARD MAGA FAIRIES" I was surprised Biden outlined "plans" to ban the manuf. &amp; sale of new assault rifles 1st term...  Thoughts?
I doubt it too. She's keeping that money and laughing all the way to the bank.
He has said before he's voting for Biden! This is simply a rejection of the platform. Christ, what more do you people want? You want even allow progressives to be conscientious objector WHO STILL VOTE FOR BIDEN.
And when the hell did it become guilty before innocent in this country?
So Joe Biden just admitted that he will resign on inauguration day??
She's still got worked for Biden in her twitter page. I don't know about you, but I sure and the hell wouldn't have my rapists name on my twitter page.
Its easier than trying to explain why Biden disappeared.
If the claims were true, Me too would of backed her. There's a reason no major network picked it up,beyond accusations. They looked into it and her story was all over the place.
He's the one who was OK with Biden groping his daughter.
I was surprised Biden outlined a "plans" to ban the manufacturer and sale of assault rifles in the US (I Really don't think That would actually happen, hopefully some compromise in the middle)  BUT.... Considering The current political climate and, the mindset of...
Biden will replace him.
I hope they do. I'm sure trumps 20+ victims won't mind doing interviews. And all the sexual assault that goes on at fox, they made a show and movie about it.
Dear god. Nothing more then a hustler. And people are dumb enough to fall for it. Don't she owe creditors? Isn't there a way they could put a lean on it and take their money first? Now that would be funny üòÇ

How did they get pictures from zoom? What did they act as Biden or Harris supporters?
I've called him  Hands Biden for years, lol....
The article is just about Rep. Khanna's vote on the Dem platform. It says nothing to suggest he won't be voting for Biden. Learn some reading comprehension.
Read the article. It says nothing of him not voting for Biden.
Jesus. She's gonna drag this out as long as she can. Then again she'll make more money from stupid people on twitter
I consider Harris more as a simbiote, as she is keeping Biden alive in the race and likely calling the shots!
My thing is if the complaint does exist, do we really believe Republicans wouldn't of released it by now? Or leaked it. Then again she wants us to believe her and not the 70 staffers that came out in support of Biden.
But nothing about a sexual harassment complaint? If I'm not mistaken I thought she said she made a complaint.
Biden-Harris ticket is 'Trojan horse for socialism,' says Marc Thiessen
I think the demoshits are urinating in your kool aid.  How could you ever vote for Biden. He has already said he wants raise taxes by a big amount.  Take away your insurance. Give all illegal aliens free healthcare open borders. We‚Äôre sending a lot of ms-13 gang members. ?????
It's a no-brainer. #ProsecuteTrump  There will be ppl who say enough is enough, Biden is President, don't make the country go through the turmoil of watching Trump get dragged across the coals and to those people I'll say they are wrong. We cannot let his behaviors go unchecked.
SO- Antifa has is endorsing Joe Biden for President- this is bullshit
If it happened why didn't she request any of her records from the senate? If she supposedly made a complaint, it should be there in black and white.
Sound like she just threatened to kill Joe Biden
I have no problems being a #cyberpunk vagabond if this country goes full #dystopia if Biden/Harris win.
Joe BIDEN is RESPECTED WORLDWIDE.  AND YOU KNOW THAT.  WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO YOUR CULT ON PARLER AND SPARE US THE BULLSH*T?
No, not really, it's kind of the opposite  Statistically Biden's eventual victory is not a shock at all, by the numbers it was the most likely outcome, but the media deliberately obscured this because it wasn't a dramatic narrative, they *emphasized* Bernie leading the horse race

Biden Harris choice a winner: Darcy cartoon
How Long Did Kamala Harris Know She‚Äôd Be Biden‚Äôs VP Pick And When Did the Democrats Tell¬†Joe?
I.e. telling the other candidates who were obviously no-hopers (Mayor Pete and Klobuchar) to stay in and protect Bernie from elimination and try to pipeline people away from Biden toward Bernie over the next few races
I say this as someone who has basically no affection for Biden  If you took the names off the candidates and just looked at what the actions are, the stuff you'd have to do as the DNC to keep Bernie viable longer feels a lot more like manipulation than what they did do
Yeah you can say a lot of things about Biden but he absolutely was not an "undemocratic" choice, he is very clearly the choice of the D electorate
I've totally seen this no joke. People who love Biden but hate Harris because she's a "careerist" and too "ambitious". It's very weird thing to be pissed about and smells of coded racism to me. Many real things you could say about Harris, but being ambitious is like all of DC
I mean to be blunt making Sanders Biden's VP is a horrible idea for the most obvious possible reason, which is that they're both 78  Biden picked Kamala because she's in her 50s
How bout that gun control bud? Trump has allowed more gun control to pass than Obama and even passed gun control using an executive order. Biden will take the guns, Trump will take the guns. Every politician is a gun grabbing socialist tyrant except the libertarian candidate üòâ

Certainly understand President Trumps numbers should go way up after all the Biden&amp; Harris mess! Democrats are desperate to decide this suicide mess!
I believe Karma Harris, believes Biden will only be her puppet and she will do his thinking for him. I believe Harris is a real phony ! Never will the Democrats, Republicans, Independents etc. allow this clown show. What a vomit mess!
Biden, Harris lash out at Trump
So, Joe Biden selected his VP running mate based on race and sex.  Isn't THAT the problem with America? There are words for this.
Eh I feel Biden is more conservative than any of the other dem candidates. I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden but I love Kamala and what she stands for. Trumps just gotta go. He has maybe done 10% good but 90% bad. And now he‚Äôs cutting pay roll tax (social security) and Medicare?  No thanks
Biden has to be seen for who is if voters are going to make an informed decision in December  The debates will reveal exactly who he is, and that won't be so pretty for Joe
People said that last time and he thoroughly embarrassed queen clinton..and She's a refined liar  You can't possibly believe it would end well for Biden
Because Biden will get thrashed in a debate?  We already knew who you are, but this is still pretty revealing

Oh yeah, he'll give it his all, and I'm not at all sure Biden will win, despite the polls. They're essentially meaningless, anyway. All that counts is the result, come November
Whether you agree with him endorsing Biden or not, it‚Äôs sure nice seeing a politician choose country over party. America needs more of this
And Trump told us we were going to get tired of winning.  It‚Äôs time for a reset in the country. Republicans who care about their bottom Line and that of the wealthiest Americans. Must go. It‚Äôs time for caring and empathy in politics. Joe Biden has it
Wow, I really just saw someone say something about republicans taking advantage of a man with mental health issues...talking about Biden...uh yeah and it's well deserved. Let's stick up for THIS guy

Don't worry. I believe we will see many of these names in Biden's administration.
Joe Biden took his time under pressure and picked a super running mate, Kamala Harris.  Their choices together will get this country back on track and clear all the bullet points Trump didn‚Äôt think important enough to read.

Any leftist who doesn't vote for Biden at this point will absolutely bear responsibility for Trump being handed another four years. That's why we need to vote Biden.
I'll say it louder for the people in the back:  Any leftist who doesn't vote for Biden at this point will absolutely bear responsibility for Trump being handed another four years. That's why we need to vote Biden.

Biden's not President, when the real president starts then Biden should follow suit. Don't ya think.
Oh yea...story of my life. You critize Biden or Harris and u must be a Trumper. Nevermind that their policies and actions have harmed minorities for years. Joe Biden was against busing black children to white schools. I hear you on your critism..its valid.
And I think not voting for Biden or Trump would only be MEGA COOL!

Which is why we‚Äôll all be voting for Biden and while he‚Äôs cleaning up the mess left behind from Trump, you and him can enjoy endless litigation of your crimes for the rest of your miserable lives.
All these libs talking about protesting as though protests have ever done something. If you vote for Joe Biden, you're voting for whatever hideous monster comes next to make Trump look moderate.
Hillary would be the Biden administration.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden Democrats are dangerous for America.   Every American needs to see this.
#ByeHannity Joe Biden has a racism problem
Vote for Biden anyway. He's promised to undo the harm Trump has caused.
Me, too. I can‚Äôt put a Biden sign out because it will be stolen or shot. Ohio Magats abound.
Respectfully family! We aren't looking to get married to her, make her a queen or lord of the world! We're using her and Biden to get the orange garbage slime out of power!! If we are concerned about records! Let's improve ours by demanding from politicians what we need!!
A major union representing U.S. postal workers endorsed Biden for president after Trump has acknowledged starving the postal service of money in order to make it more difficult to vote by mail in November's election
Biden is a total top.
vote against Trump. for Biden
All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
By the way do you think Harris was picked because she would make a good VP ? Pelosi has this all planned , because when Biden steps down because he‚Äôs an idiot , she takes over not Harris
Politico columnist:  This sudden media crush on Kamala Harris sure is something, huh?  The media's "glaring effort to rehabilitate a failed politician."  *I will not Vote For  Biden *I will not rely on USPS
You mean Joe Biden. There, I fixed it for you.
Living in a swing state, I need to make sure that my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, Desiree Tims, and other down-ballot dems will actually count this year. 1 vote can make all the difference
Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren‚Äôt happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you‚Äôre calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that‚Äôd fail immediately. The fact is, and it‚Äôs proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can‚Äôt move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
I'm glad that Biden has your support, then.
Look, you can either vote for Biden or be stuck with Trump. Sadly, 3rd party votes aren‚Äôt going to get us out of this mess.
WATCH: President Trump speaks at the White House before leaving for New York.
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn‚Äôt happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don‚Äôt give up the momentum we‚Äôve gained just to spite Biden!
Biden is a liar.
Great thread. Kamala understood the importance of #Medicare4All then. We need it now more than ever. Biden and Harris must push left and embrace #M4A in order to save the American people from the COVID-19 crisis.
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don‚Äôt want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden‚Äîbasically it was this: ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!‚Äù I was right. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was her making HIM exciting!
NO thanks I will be voting for Biden
Vote Biden.  We‚Äôve seen the mess Trump has made.  No confidence he‚Äôll do anything different if re-elected.
But Biden isn‚Äôt bland fish. He‚Äôs half a plate of shit whereas Trump is a full plate of shit. With Biden you‚Äôre gonna eat less shit, but it‚Äôs still shit all the same.
With little time until election, emphasis must be on electing Biden-Harris.  Most effective use of time and effort.
#KamalaHarris just doing what she did in SF...#BidenHarris Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Trump and Biden trade barbs over coronavirus response, masks
Just a reminder that Joe Biden has a long track record of supporting segregation. Like 46 years long. Here‚Äôs How Deep Biden‚Äôs Busing Problem Runs  via
Calling Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pieces of shit with bits of broken glass in it is a tad generous I think.
We know China is rooting for Biden.  Hunter is gonna make a killin if daddy wins.
Mornin boys. Saw this, thought it was relevant to this thread!  ‚ÄòHillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration‚Äô
So Biden wants masks for the next three months. What is happening in three months? The election!  Stop making the Corona virus political.
I'm voting #kamala Biden üí£üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüí¶üòéüòé
They are out of cards and ironically Biden/Harris have trumped Trump lol
Biden wants us to wear masks for the next three months? No üíØ
It's not about Biden or Trump, it's about America
So much misinformation in this I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start; Kamala and Biden in fact, *HAVE* done everything she listed. Anyone who is reading this just look up the Keystone Pipeline, or the history of the ICE detention camps under Obama and Kamala‚Äôs support of ICE.
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
Luckily, Kamals will be the Vice President. I've every confidence that she will serve as an admirable right hand to Biden. She really is the complete package! I've not hear her make promises to blacks, but, she speaks about specific needs and filling those needs across groupsüëå
You won‚Äôt get it from Biden or Trump but you will get it from Jo Jorgensen.  #JoJorgensen2020
She thinks he is a racist and believes #TaraReade. Strong candidate against?  She knows #Biden will fall down some stairs soon after the nomination and she gets the reigns...the country will be in trouble...#MAGA2020
To be fair, Joe Biden could shoot ME and I would still vote for him over Trump.
Rumor in GOP circles: Harris cannot succeed Biden if he would not complete his term since her Mother is from India and her Father is Jamaican. Sorry R's. To be President a person has to be a "natural born citizen" of the U.S." Harris was born in Oakland, CA.#OaklandisinAmerica
Biden has a dog. Trump doesn't  Case closed!!!#RescueAmerica
Pence said if the Biden - Harris team gets elected, she will do away with MEAT! YEP, MEAT.ü§°
But Joe Biden isn't Catholic. I'd say Joe is a better representation of being Catholic than the church hierarchy that swept the suffering if little children under the rug to protect the rich privileged Catholic Church and their illusion of saintly pedophiles.
Under no circumstances should Joe Biden concede to trump.
Fortunately here in Ohio the union I‚Äôm a member of seems to be tired of Democrat BS. The SS comments were made by Biden and Pelosi because Trump did the payroll tax reduction, they forgot Obama did the same thing and the felt different then.
Absolutely unbelievable!!! ‚Å¶ should be ashamed. A 3 yr old autistic baby removed from plane for not wearing a mask. Must have had Biden/Harris working as the flight attendants ‚Å¶ should address this
Help is coming, their names Biden/Harris
MAGAts don't read that much.  Maybe the Independents could be swayed, 60/40.  We readers are already voting for Biden/Harris.
And if Biden can remember his name
It's funny ur doing it now right before the elections that ur losing lmaoooooo to Joe Biden  but the pandemic has been since Jan and now ur lying about forcing them
You have the never to say Biden's been wrong, BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT, trump is and there's 4 million plus infected and 168,000 souls dead. Who's been wrong again?
True, Biden has no clue of the world around him
Biden and Pelosi believe that practicing Catholics (those few who actually follow the Catechism) are unfit to serve in our nation's courts.
Voting for Jo Jorgensen is worse than voting for Biden or Trump.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
That part I definitely understand, and for that reason specifically I‚Äôll never knock on anyone voting for Biden. We just need to consider that a racist abuser with a very evil prosecutor might not be great for driving racial justice forward
For sure I definitely get why people will continue to vote for Biden but he was the candidate that the left wanted the absolute least. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs any better or more fit than trump, and that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs important to begin change this year
Biden doesn‚Äôt support M4A, he doesn‚Äôt support free/accessible education, and he doesn‚Äôt have any policies that will enact eco friendly practices. His only finite plan is to increase police authority. I‚Äôd rather start change then elect discount trump in a blue tie
I definitely agree and it‚Äôs a weird subject because it‚Äôs important to get trump out, but in my view the final result of Biden+Harris shows that neither party will fix things. Biden won‚Äôt fix any problems that we face today so I think it‚Äôs important to begin the process of change
Well...if they let Biden become President first, it will be the Speaker.  How funny if the Republicans win back the House.
The spoiler effect, Biden would be one of the most progressive presidents in US history, and maybe say something about Bernie and AOC's endorsement?
My grandmother (WI) Trump My father (OH) Trump My mother (OH) Trump My sister (OH) Trump My brother (OH) Biden Myself (OH) Biden
Definitely gotta get 5%. Biden/Harris not only ensures a Tom Cotton presidency, it further sends us into a spiral of right authoritarian hell
If you're a so-called leftist and you plan to vote Biden/Harris, you are my enemy and the enemy of all progressives.
I mean, Biden wants to fucking go to war with Palestine.
What in the fuck would these shitstains do better? Are you forgetting that Biden lied and told his supporters that it was safe to go vote so that he could win, causing a spike in coronavirus cases? Are we forgetting that he held the health of millions of people hostage?
Biden didn't pick her his handlers did. Democrats know dementia Joe won't last 4 years
So if we dont listen to biden and not mandate mask wearing for the next 3 months and more than 40,000 loves are lost what do u think he will say then the mandate would've save those 40,000 lives and blame trump for not mandating it
Hope for Biden.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Joe Biden   " It is not about your rights"
One question I have is does the QAnon conspiracy get louder/stronger under a Biden presidency?  If Trump does in fact lose, they will think that the "elites" rigged it against him.
Bow down to the greatest president of all time. A BIDEN MEME?!?!??!! THIS MAN ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
So your for Biden who wants to raise taxes on the working class which make up 90% of the population by 4 trillion, make the working class pay for low income housing in the suburbs like my local area (Huber Heights), who wants to have the health care paid for by the stock market.
If Biden/Harris wins, are you sure that she will not be making all of the decisions from day one?
Ask Biden what he did...oops that would require journalism
People were clear during the primary that Biden was unacceptable. If beating Trump is so important, then perhaps Democrats shouldn't have nominated him.
You mean Trump will make sure Biden and headboard Harris can‚Äôt CHEAT
Whoever it is you know they will be there for most of the Biden/Harris term.
The fact that there will be no change means that Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump. Just because they're going in two different wrong directions doesn't mean one wrong direction is good. Less bad is bad. Why would you want bad? Less evil is evil. Let's just focus on the evil.
Hell yes -- #LetBetoSpeak #LetBetoSpeakDNC Biden just tosses him after Super Tuesday endorsement, and the Whataburger photo-op?  Hell no.   If you want a lot of Texas Dems to do more than just pull the lever for Joe in November, this needs to get fixed.  Now.
And yet Obama pardoned a solider who committed espionage. Who was the VP? Biden.

How much money are you donating to Biden/Harris ticket? You made a promise to use your money to keep drumpf from winning. Keep your word.
If what you say is true Manu.......then investigating Biden's campaign and its support from China is fair game
Holy cow! You have lost your marbals and need help! #UnfitForOffice You're making Biden look good. Morning Joe has a 100% approval rating amongst it's viewers. That's better than your 98% approval rating amongst Republicans. #TrumpIsNotWell #AmericaOrTrump
Don't get swept up in that this is the last election everything's on the line right now garbage. The reason why Biden was 'selected' is so that nothing will change.
Fuck no! That would mean she would have to turn on Biden!
She meant to say he inherited the slowest economic recovery in US history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden (who litteraly did nothing for the economy), then made it into the greatest economy in the world within 2 years.
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
Let's be real, none of us on the left are thrilled to be voting for Biden. Our candidate was rallied against and shut out by a tone deaf DNC. But this is who we're stuck with. If you really aren't voting for him cause he's "just as bad," you're a product of your own privilege.
When Biden/Harris take over the secret police
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
well biden has been accused of both so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Why does Biden look so robotic when he walks? Why didn‚Äôt he greet Kamala properly when she came to the Podium. Weird.
Hey, Kamala....do you still believe the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault? Please do tell. #MeTooUnlessItsBiden
Biden and Trump both brother
when Brett Kavanaugh was accused of raping a woman, liberals heavily pushed the idea that we should always believe women who come forward. but when Joe Biden was accused of reaching up a woman's skirt and penetrating, she must have been lying.
Harris‚Äôs selection in and of itself is unlikely to change many votes, but her presence on the ticket is likely to influence voters‚Äô opinions of Biden and whether they‚Äôre likely to vote for him, writes  &amp;   #veepstakes
Certainly is our future if Biden/Harris are elected.
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It‚Äôs on the rebound already
worked so hard to divide our nation‚Äôs emotions. The man ended up dividing his own party. Republicans are now committing to voting for Biden/Harris - 2020, because they understand it is the moral conscience of humanity who sees through Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership.
So you want Biden
he "inherited the longest economic exansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden," and "Like everything else he's inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." Snap!
A few things:  1. AOC is not a comrade. The fact that she won't back Shahid Buttar says all that needs to be said.  2. Anyone that votes Biden/Harris is a class traitor.  3. People that accuse other people of being a Russian bot are diddlers, it's totally true, pass it on.
Yes I think you missed the point. I don‚Äôt  vote for a person because they are a Christian. I vote based on the polices they push toward Christians. Biden and Trump are obviously flawed like all humans BUT Trump POLICIES have been good for Christians WHILE BIDEN and dems attack us
One thing is for sure. Joe Biden doesn't have the cleanest history when it comes to race relations. Look up what he had to say about integration and then combine that with who he  idolized as a Senator, Robert Byrd from WV. This can't be misinterpreted,but will be ignored
So she is planning on assasinating Joe Biden.
God will protect Joe Biden
ü§£ü§£ü§£hilarious coming from you, who picked a VP that rightfully obliterated you on national TV for your racism. At least you‚Äôre providing us with great entertainment Biden!
And Biden isn‚Äôt, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
Says Biden who supported racist policies, &amp; picked a VP who rightfully obliterated him on national TV for his racism.
Like Biden will do better
How about "Doc" Jill Biden?
Steve, this has been such fun for me. I'll let you get to finding those receipts abut Biden in the basement. Look forward to reading it. But I must wash my dishes. Goodnight!
LOL. Why do you want me to call you a racist? You didn't say anything racist (although you support one, which is quiet problematic). I'm waiting for that proof of Biden in a basement, tho.
Also saying she believes the women felt uncomfortable doesn't mean she believes he did anything inappropriate or at the very least intentionally harmful. None of those women said they felt assaulted by Biden too. So yeah, we can see hot this plays out, with FACTS.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn‚Äôt seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half üòÅüòÅ
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
‚ùìSo what does #Biden have to do with that? He doesn't support 'defunding of the #police', or violence of this sort. You should blame the #NRA if anyone. They are the reason people are carrying around #ar15 assault rifles.
President ‚Å¶ slammed by Former Vice President and his new running mate, U.S. Sen. ‚Å¶   (Via DaytonDaily)
Y‚Äôall talking all this shuff about #KamalaHarris but y‚Äôall act like that‚Äôs gonna stop y‚Äôall from voting for #Biden and her to win! I hope you know because of y‚Äôall mindset the elites is doing what you already accepted.
Yet another reason to vote   out of office in 2022,  I'm happy to fall in line and vote for Biden/Harris!  Anybody buy a complicit Republican.
As she hits a blunt, pushes Biden down the stairs and becomes prez....for sure...I actually like her..she believes Tara.  She put a bunch of thugs in prison and slept her way into a prominent role...perfect politician.
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Why are democrats on the top of my feed?  Biden, Schumer, Joe Walsh and Pelosi.   I do not follow them.  Disgusting.
Joe Biden didn't take it personally when, Kamala Harris attacked him during the presidential debates. He knew that that's how politics are. That's something you will never understand  . You can dish it out but you can't take it. #BabyTrump
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
No!  She can't win.  Any vote that isn't for Biden is a vote for Trump.  Do you want four more years of Trump? Hillary wouldn't even want you to do that. If you could ask her, she would say no. She would want you to vote out that piece of shit that stole the election from her.
Bruh is Biden is elected this will not be america anymore especially since Kamala gonna end up running shit she‚Äôs apart of the radical left?
I thought Joe Biden running for president dummy
You need to check your self into a mental hospital asap ,Biden was right "you ain't black and neither are the others in black skin voting ,supporting,excusing ,defending trump who works of satan as you do ! Satan is a liar! you ,trump and all aligned with trump are
Yeah, I don't generally hear people saying that either, but also I don't hear people reminding about the problems of the PATRIOT Act and the existence of DHS in the first place. And I see lots of unironic retweeting Biden and "vote blue" that seem ... uncritical.
At least two counter-protestors in the Biden crowd.
Pretty sure the lesser of 2 evils crowd knows Biden‚Äôs record sucks. But the point is A: Trump is worse and B: Biden can be pushed in a way Trump cannot.   At this point there are 2 options, and 1 is clearly worse.
The thing is she isn‚Äôt black she is Jamaican and Indian.   He didn‚Äôt even pick a black woman which is a another lie by Biden
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
hey just a reminder that most trump supporters refuse to call out any of the chaos he‚Äôs caused over the past 4 years so it‚Äôs not their place to put you down for supporting and simultaneously criticizing biden/harris‚Äô records either!
Biden / Harris 2020! Build Back Better! One Prison At A Time!Regarding Biden's comments in 1985  "As presented, the video implies that the words spoken by Biden were his own opinions, when actually he was quoting a white legislator and trying to expose the comments as racist."
Well I'm sure since Biden is soooooooo dedicated to the public option he will have no problems denouncing this article
Biden-Harris to highlight Trump‚Äôs failed leadership during all-virtual DNC convention -
I take that as his endorsement of Biden.
You‚Äôre not talking options but are cool with a FULL-BLOWN white supremacist and fascist  to stay in the WH because you think BIDEN is racist? ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Let‚Äôs be clear here: you know and I know ( actually, everyone knows) that there is not ONE single pic of Biden that looks like anything but a grandfather encouraging a child. That you guys even feign to find those pics ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù is not believable.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign raised $48 million in the 48 hours after he selected...
- Join the conversation on
Biden 2020 is all I got to say
On top of that Harris framed a guy for a murder he didn‚Äôt commit and had him locked up for close to ten years ! She is a terrible candidate. she only got picked because she is a woman and she is black since Biden has said so many racist things he needs someone to change that
So what would u call them ? Biden is attempting to be like Bernie and that‚Äôs what Bernie is. Truthfully Biden don‚Äôt have anything left in his brain. And Harris is a disgrace of a candidate. she locked up over 1k ppl for weed
"Tell me why I should vote for Joe Biden without saying Trump" is such a stupid premise lol. They are literally running against each other.
You mean to yell you you aren‚Äôt able to think for yourself ? I have my own views and have done plenty of research to know I wouldn‚Äôt support Biden or Harris  or their socialist views!
Polls mean absolutely zero. I guarantee he will win more than +8 this time around... I've been driving all over the state, all I see is Trump pence signs everywhere...obviously Columbus Cincinnati and Cleveland will go Biden.
Who would ever wish death upon anyone?! I can‚Äôt stand Biden but never in a million years would I wish death upon him. You people are sick. Tolerant left? Yeah right.
Yet you will vote for Biden in November, faux Conservative!
Trump speaks at press briefing as US sees number of daily Covid tests drop ‚Äì as it happened
Your like at 100 press conference in the last 75 days. Biden 2 in the last 145 days.   Biden doesn‚Äôt want to be a leader.
Ohio is not in play for Biden. It is solid red. üíØ
They didn‚Äôt endorse Biden, WTF are you talking about?
I've been angry for so long... I felt like a weight had been taken off my chest when Kamala was announced as Biden's choice for VP.  Now... I just have fear everyday. Self-induced, yes... Wondering what he's going to do when he loses.   He's unhinged.
You wanna know why? Take a read and figure it out... biden is already reneging on the public option he swore would be better then M4A
Not for a minute. And I think there are more Republicans who support Biden.
Then put 3 Biden signs in your yard.  And a bunch of those little flags ‚Äúthey‚Äù use to pretend they actually GAF about this country!
Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist a year ago lol
Lol the gall of this man
I'm hearing lots of talk about revolution lately. Sad and frightening that this is where we are today.
It won't stop. Our political system has been hijacked.
You could make the same case for Biden.
Good point. I can't live in this country if it is going to be what it is quickly becoming. I'm all about doing my part, but it's looking like Republicans will do ANYTHING to stay in power (gerrymandering, voter suppression, shooting protesters). That's not America anymore.
Fuck Donald Trump and fuck Joe Biden
Higher earners?  What number does that start.  I make 300k how much do I owe? Biden has not said this about the police the speaker called them storm troopers.  What does responsible funding mean that is bs for cuts.  You are blind as bat if you believe that shit.
POSTAL WORKERS FOR BIDEN: The union said President Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office, so they are endorsing Joe Biden.
And you‚Äôre Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. You lose.
You are suffering a mental breakdown. Ranting about Trump. Deflect. Place the name Biden where you said Trump and you will have actually said the Truth on CNN. How are those plummeted ratings?!! ü§î

Drove from Columbus Ohio up to Mansfield ohio then out to dayton ohio today. Counted 30 Trump flags 6 for Biden. Ohio is solid Trump. I didn't count the 15 thin blue line or hand full of dont tread on me flags for Trump but we can safely assume they won't be voting Democrat.
Hooooo weeeee! There's nothing like a fresh batch of manure to make yah wanna vote  #walkaway from Biden-my-time before he  forgets who his running mate is: Pamela Ferris.

Trumps attacks against Biden and Harris are so funny to me like bro you are not criticizing them for the right stuff üíÄ
you are a fraud.  You are not black, you attacked Kavanaugh for no reason, you flipped around and now are against the women claiming Biden was inappropriate with them.  You hate America and what she stands for.  SHAME ON YOU
In Ohio there are 100 Trump signs to every 1 Biden sign. Good luck! I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. No one sane would trust a man no smarter than rock or a woman who uses a crotch to get ahead. I thought Dems were against sexism‚Äô? RedRocket is coming! #BidenHarrisLandslide2020

Hello my beautiful Twitter friend üß°  I know... and you're right. I am NOT going to die on a ventilator because someone may perceive me as lazy.  This is the same guy I retweeted that told Bernie supporters that were unhappy about Biden, that they should go support Trump üôÑ
I hear you, &amp; I understand how you feel. We all had our favorites &amp; our ideal candidates, but the voters voted &amp; we have what we have. We've got to focus on using what we have to make the change we want to see. Biden is still a far better man than Trump ever dreamed of being.
Hey wait, I'm an admitted Bernie bro but I voted for Hillary. I'm voting for Biden in November. We're not all idiots.
VOTE EARLY. I love voting at my polling place on Election Day, but let's be honest. Is there ANYTHING that Biden or Trump could do or say to make us change our mind? VOTE EARLY. VOTE EARLY. VOTE EARLY.
A few gaffs? The man literally said you aren't black if you don't vote for him and that minus a few notable exceptions black people aren't diverse, but go on about how he's a cognitive wizard. I do believe everything POTUS says but Biden literally said those things.
2 reasons to vote Biden, even tho it‚Äôs ü§Æ 1) If Dems win the senate, Bernie is chairman of the budget committee 2) Normies who think Trump is the problem will only join the left if they see Biden blocking change The left is awake this time. The fight won‚Äôt end, just the opponent
Funny how Biden says if he‚Äôs elected there‚Äôs so much he would do and change for  America . I like to know what the hell he did as Vice President, and all the years he‚Äôs been in politics. Just like his former boss, Nothing!!!!
Disagree Greta. Trump's campaign has already started and Biden's has already ended.
You are a freaking joke.  The USPS should have been dismantled 50 years ago.  They failed with Amazon and literally can‚Äôt deliver anything on time, but yes let‚Äôs just randomely ship ballots out.  I think Biden and the dems are freaking out that their platform sucks

Hahaha ok, the party has been hostile to progressives for a long time. Ro is a pledged delegate for Bernie and thus will vote for Bernie. If the situation was reversed and bernie had the majority of delegate some would still vote for Biden
Almost as defeatist as nominating Biden/Harris and being like, "this is fine"

‚ÄúThis guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,"" Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. ‚ÄúAnd I'm telling you on Nov. 3 you're going to be getting it back."
That's a start, but don't stop there: fuck Biden, fuck Harris, fuck Congress......
But that's dumb, because it will simply juxtapose Trump's incoherent lies with a clear and articulate message from Biden. Trump is dumber than a rock.
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum," said Joe Biden, adding that the effort could save tens of thousands of lives.

It's wild how much I stopped caring about politics after  dropped out. I'm still voting Biden/Harris but settling is whack.
Biden doesn't even know where he is or what he's running for half the time. I'm not sure he even knows that Harris is his running mate.

If we elect Biden we have a chance of instituting ranked choice and abolishing the electoral college. Doing that would make it so third parties are actually viable. I really think using Biden to lay the ground work to help third parties is a key part of my support.
this is just the first, of many, that were trying to frame trump. Biden is only running so he has "political opponent" status.
Biden gives an honest answer. Trump couldn't give an honest answer if his life depended on it.
Only if the house of representatives can't choose a president or the Senate can't choose a vice president. The democratic house would choose Biden, and the Republican Senate would choose Pence. That would be your White House.

If Biden was in now and got on TV and said ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre working on a solution and all Americans will receive the help they need!‚Äù them everybody took a hiatus until Labor Day and nothing was passed / the bill passed was inadequate, would you still have the same rage? Doubt it.
My last tweet also ties into this whole voting shit and I saw a tweet earlier that was spot on. Y‚Äôall want to rally black people to vote Trump our cause it‚Äôs an issue for everyone. However, Biden / Harris is a large issue for black people, so our struggle is fine, just not yours?
If they endorsed Biden you wouldnt have a damn thing to say.

Fauci says there is 'no reason' Americans can't vote in person in November  #FoxNews   Can we sum it up....  SCREW YOU BIDEN AND HARRIS.  YOU SAID LISTEN TO FAUCI ALL THIS TIME.  ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO HIM NOW????
The BLK entertainers push that liberal BS cause it's safe, pays more won't lose that many fans rather than calling out both sides on their BS. Biden could go on TV right now day we gon lock up and kill all you niggas and they'd still vote 4 em. "TRUMP is racist" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
We are much safer advocating our position under Biden than under Trump and would be no less effective at doing so.
Yep....trump keeps saying if Biden wins the stock market will crash. And it will because Feds and Minunchin will stop feeding the stock market and then everyone will blame Biden.
No, but I am willing to bet the future of the left that Biden is not capable of getting away with as vicious a retaliation as what Trump would be.
This is why Joe Biden is known as a ‚Äú Pathological Liar‚Äù Pres Trump does absentee Mail voting like so many us do which require verification of who u r and your address. Mass mailing that Joe wants there is zero verification ! Joe is a Liar ü§•!!
In that instance we can use the ridiculous mentality of the "ultra-patriot" to ensure that a dem can't just McCarthy all of us, because they won't let Biden get away with it like they will Trump.
Tough question no one can answer. Name one policy Biden would implement that would make America better???
It's not about Biden and Harris not capitulating to us, it's about the fact that they won't do what Trump is willing to do to violently suppress social progress. Them saying "We hear you, we see you" and doing effectively nothing is better than Trump saying "Fuck you" with feds.
and that‚Äôs on what? joe biden.
Biden calling Trump the first racist Prez is funny especially coming from him. I guess BLKs and other non whites had it great before Trump. FOH. Shoot the ballot box, no voter card they all are frauds. This is a blood related gang they're homies/family not opps, smoke n mirrors
It is a blatant lie to try and say that anyone voting Democrat has been sequestered like Biden in their houses for the last 4 months and will be until November 3rd.  They can leave to riot without masks but not to vote?????
Obama is still worthless.  How can it be against one party if Trump is pushing against 100% mail in voting for BOTH PARTIES????  Could it be because Biden/Harris supporters wouldn't walk across the street to vote for them...
And now, Biden corruption:
I hope Biden/Harris crushes Trump on election day.
This tweet goin off thanks everyone. Never forget: all black lives matter, men are the root of all evil, vote for Biden, and wash your masks üòå‚ú®
Because your logic is so flawed it makes you a perfect example of why swing voters need to run away from Biden &amp; Harris, who are extremely corrupt.  All we need to ask is, "Do you really want to hang out with this twit?"  Ladies (corrupt) first:    (more)
Vote for Biden - he's definitely the lesser of two evils!

I am developing a very contentious relationship with Joe Biden‚Äôs texting service
After calling Biden racist, supporting women filing complaints against him,  she becomes his VP and describes him like he walks on water?!?!?!?!
Reading Biden's family was uncomfortable with the way Sen Harris attacked him. Illustration of the law of power, "rely on enemies more so friends". She won the veep nod on that debate stage.
Black Voters Know Biden Is Clumsy‚Äîand That Trump Is a Menace
"Mike Pence claims Kamala Harris and Joe Biden want to stop Americans eating meat" -
Man I'd like you to introduce you to Hunter Biden. And please do provide some facts for that, I feel like that'd be a bigger scandal than it is if true.
I‚Äôve also been traveling thru out the United States, California, Nevada, South Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Iowa and Kentucky.  I‚Äôve seen one Biden sign and thousands of Trump signs!
Saw an interesting question posed today: If Beau Biden were still alive, would  have chosen him as running mate?
Biden sniffs them what's you're point
Micheal Jackson wasn‚Äôt diseased, he just didn‚Äôt vote for Biden
Also bad grammar there, like Biden, I also cannot formulate a coherent sentence üòÇ
And all Trump picks is white people. White men in particular. Have you seen his administration? Biden said he specifically picked out members based on what the country looks like. Men, women, and poc. That's not racism at all. It's a reach on your part but not racism.
Biden campaign vetting of Kamala Harris 'incredibly thorough'  via    #ProsecuteTrump
Even in this poll, Clinton isn't over 50%. Biden is over 50 and still climbing. I wonder if that will make a difference.
Biden and Harris and the rest of the Dems have been saying listen to god Fauci all this time....now will they turn on him or will they make him recant?????
On a serious note, the potential of having a neoliberal (ü§¢) as opposed to a conservative (ü§Æ) SCJ replace RBG, as well as the issues with the post office, are the only legitimate reasons I see right now to vote for Biden. And that's only if you believe electoral politics work.
If he won't leave office peacefully that's a problem on its own completely independent of who wins the 2020 election (which I hope is Biden)
Did you see her response to me?  This is why Biden will lose big time.  Nobody votes for hate.  It's not too late to walk away from hate.  It's not too late to #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
When are Biden and Harris going to take credit for this arrest like they did for the Middle East deal?????
Happy Friday everyone!   Joe Biden will stand up to Russian interference in our elections.
While there is a lot of discourse over Biden's "racial jungle" comments regarding bus desegregation, the commonly spread quote is false. Somehow his defense is even worse. Sorry guys, turns out he might call you the n-word after all.
Biden voted for the Iraq war and is, like every US president in history, an imperialist. BUT, he would never call middle eastern civilians the n-word while drone striking them.
The "kids in cages" thing, exacerbated by Trump, started under Obama/Biden. BUT, Biden never (on record) called the kids the n-word.
Like Trump, Biden supports the privacy invasions of the PATRIOT Act (which he wrote.) BUT, he won't call you the n-word while he takes away your rights
Like Trump, he opposes gay marriage and has a history of homophobia. BUT, he won't call you the n-word while he takes away your rights
BIDEN IS OUR BEST CHANCE TO BEAT TRUMP, AND WE MUST UNITE BEHIND HIM. HERE IS A LIST OF REASONS TO VOTE FOR BIDEN (Thread)
The craziest part of the 2020 campaign is still how the Biden campaign went from being on life support to an unstoppable juggernaut in less than a week.
Want to bet?  How about $1,000?  50% of Democrats say they are afraid to reveal their political leanings.  Now why would a Democrat be afraid to say they are voting Biden?  They wouldn't.  Everybody I meet is voting Trump.  Get out more, talk to real people and you will see.
I gave Biden a few bucks and if I get another email from him or Kamala, my head is going to explode (or I will just politely unsubscribe).

Saying Biden has early onset dementia means a whole hell of a lot less when compared to the guy who they had to give a dementia test to while in office ‚ÄúMan. Woman. Person. Camera. Tv‚Äù
I've seen a lot of people say, "but the environment! The EPA!"  Biden and Harris *will not* do enough to correct the impending doom of climate change in 4 to 8 years. I doubt they'll even try.
When Biden and Kamala come out at the DNC the entrance music should be the Bad Boys theme or Akon/Styles P "Locked up" theme. Two mass incarcerating fools a match made in Hell.
Also - this virus has claimed less lives than the FLU, alcoholism and smoking. How were you convinced that number compared to the number of survivors is worth holding? Biden is clearly a pedofile but that‚Äôs to be ignored because he has proven himself when and how?
Former presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who famously accused Joe Biden of being against desegregating schools through busing, is now his right-hand woman.   WOSU‚Äôs politics podcast Snollygoster discusses the pick:
Can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden by mail.
Early voting in Licking County Ohio is October 6th, my birthday! I will be voting that day for Biden/Harris!!! VOTE EARLY! VOTE BLUE!
I don‚Äôt like Biden/Harris but at this point it‚Äôs like having multiple surgeries to get a tumor removed.
At least you acknowledge Biden is senile and unable to answer questions.  The question I have is why anyone would vote for a guy who can't remember what office he's running for.    The good thing is we won't have a president with dementia.  Trump landslide.
Is there a third outcome I'm not aware of?  Besides us doing an ineffective boycott (Biden winning comfortably without us, but us still getting to hold onto high ground?). Also: The Dems having power is a consistent if definitively embarrassing component of the broader struggle.
Get used to it.  Biden is losing his cognitive ability more and more each day.  He hasn't taken unscripted questions for many months.  There is a reason why.
This is the bed that the  has made for the country, having encouraged and cultivated a growing slice of the electorate that is fed on a toxic blend of conspiracy theories and YouTube rabbit holes.
Do you think Trump would care or say anything if one of Biden's (Or Harris, Pelosi, etc) brothers were ill?
What people must realize is that Joe Biden has not yet been nominated  for President of the United States by the Democrat party. All of this might be for not? There are questions if Kamala Harris is even eligible to be his V.P. pick? Does the DNC have a surprise in the works?
Trump answer questions all the time.  Biden hasn't answered unscripted questions for many months.  Trump will win in a landslide.  Nobody sane will vote for a senile racist.  Prepare yourself.
Trump just brokered a peace deal that may just lead to a cascade of Arab states recognizing Israel. Friedman's big winner? Joe "Iranian Centrifuges" Biden.
On of my friends tried to discredit Biden because he and Harris don't always align on policy. Why do we live in a world where augmenting your team with someone with differing views (but a common purpose) is seen as a detriment instead of a strength?
My biggest complaint of Biden's campaign is he doesn't seem to have any specific policy agendas he's running on, unlike Bernie and Warren, for instance...I'd like to get some kind of idea of what he's planning to do with his 4 years in the WH before election day
Oh, yes, it will be a great concern for Right-Wing so-called Christians. They will not have power over the Biden White House. Biden won't make a mockery of Christianity by showing photos of fakers laying hands on him while speaking mambo jumbo.
Have any of the Obama people ever reckoned with the horrendous mistake he made by backing HRC over Biden? Not only was it a dick move on a personal level, but he should have known how unpopular she was outside the DNC.
If you are feeling underwhelmed about the Biden/Harris ticket, please listen to this excellent and inspiring  interview with  (starts at 1:05:06). I left feeling more fired-up and hopeful than I've felt in years.
The only thing Biden saved as far as wind breaking was the pathways he helped to create for career politicians to sell out their principles for investment deals with private industry to make themselves rich!  Sell our guns back to you Kamala? YOU'RE THE ENEMY
And some contemporaries of Joe Biden, like Mozart and Bach.  Okay, that's intended to be funny and not a political statement.  I made fun of Trump earlier today.  Please accept as such and control your blood pressure.
No changes here over the past few days (Lots of schedule revisions from Biden campaign though. Thanks)
I‚Äôd much rather vote for Dolly Parton than Biden.
Says everything you need to know that Biden is coasting in the polls basically running on "I'm not Trump" as his main selling point lol
‚ÄúNot only would a Biden-Harris ticket prioritize addressing climate change, but it would focus on ensuring communities already burdened by pollution would benefit from a transition to clean energy.‚Äù
I mean, Warren has wholeheartedly endorsed Biden and Harris. She's going to campaign and fundraise for them because that's the right thing to do. It's what we should all do. Her campaign was supposed to be about policy, pushing for it and influencing it. It still should be.
Just goes to show you that literally nobody wanted Joe Biden to be president until he was the last man standing against Bernie

America is ON A VENT right now. Biden/Harris will resusitate it. You are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans with self-serving negligence.Literally DEAD. GONE. Now you are actively trying to stop a fair election-THE VERY DEFINITION OF AMERICA! BY.THE.PEOPLE. #ByThePeople
DT's responsible 4 dems deadly nursing home policies that killed thousands? If it were Biden he wouldn't have stopped China travel and the # would be 3x what it is. People are losing their jobs because of ineffective dem lockdowns. Republican states are open AND have less deaths.
'Not a great fit out here': Republicans say Kamala Harris harms Biden in crucial Rust Belt
Biden is leading in voters that don‚Äôt like either candidate... hey, that‚Äôs me!
Biden‚Äôs in his big boy chair!
Doesn't really matter if Biden's politics and party are just about serving the interests of the elites and whatever rationale squad they have deployed on any given issue
The party has to have a plan in place to deal with the reaction to Biden's mental competency if/when that gets exposed on the campaign.
Their convention isn‚Äôt long enough to talk about all their lies, corruption, and inappropriate actions with others. Questions:Biden,exaggerates, makes stuff up, forgets &amp; Kamala just can‚Äôt answer a question if not scripted and shoots from hip!
Your life does depend on it.  If Biden wins our country is over.
I hope Barr is shitCanned once Biden is elected...and he uses one of Trump's videos
With Biden, it‚Äôs never about our rights.

Do people actually think this country just...won‚Äôt exist if Biden is elected? It‚Äôll still be here.
SAY WHAT?????   America for what it stands for. Our lives do depend on voting for Biden and Harris they will defend the Constitution, return the government to a working body of the systems that our foreFathers fought for so we could live in a democratic society
Joe Biden said he‚Äôd use executive orders to enforce a mask mandate. #NeverBiden #JoeAndTheHoe #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #Trump
Trump claimed Biden has been wrong about the coronavirus pandemic at every turn, "ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence."
Is there anything about 2020 so far that would suggest Biden would not implement such top-down mandates because of state‚Äôs rights?
Have you lost your mind? First of all, Biden isn‚Äôt in office. Second, you‚Äôre describing the orange menace!
I'll tell my little girl (who's 3) that Joe Biden doesn't give a fuck about her becuase the color of her skin. Solid leadership. I bet youd like to smell her hair tho...fucking creep...maybe you should stop talking about little girls ...
That the community faces. Yes I‚Äôm white but you don‚Äôt know where or how I was raised. I certainly don‚Äôt support any movement that destroys cities to try to accomplish something. The BLM protests and riots raised a shot tone of money and gave it to the Biden campaign. How the

Please take 10 sec and google Biden‚Äôs history on Segregation.  Also Biden will not last his term if elected his health is so poor and no one cares.  He should relax and enjoy the rest of his life but no the left needs a puppet.

The system is fundamentally flawed. Biden wants to build on a fundamentally flawed system. That means it will remain fundamentally flawed and people will needlessly suffer in health and financial well being.
I was a teenager right in the middle of it in Hollywood,CA.. We had few months 'epidemic' of copicat killing for Starter Jackets,fewer for Jordan's...which okay, it was a problem, but JUST LIKE NOW, Biden and DNC use dragnet judges &amp; media for POWER TRIPS!

I believe history will show Trump to rank among our worst presidents, if not the worst. Biden, along with Obama, pulled us out of the *last* Republican recession. As for "hate," it's true I've had no use for Trump for 35 years or so. "Hate" might be strong. Did you like Obama?
Late on this but, Biden should have leaked Melania Trump as a running mate.
You realize biden started his career as the senator from MBNA which was a major bank. Also remember Wallstreet stocked the Obama cabinat and then the headline that wallstreet breathes a sigh of relief when harris is picked as VP

A vote for Joe is a vote for the future of our planet. The Biden-Harris ticket will take the most aggressive approach to climate change we've ever seen.  It's not just a want to have net zero emissions by 2050. It's a need.
Full disclosure: Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice. Or my second. Or even my 3rd or 4th and I even almost worked for multiple rival candidates. But ultimately, he won the Primary, meaning he‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. All I ask people is to think, can this country take another 4 years of this?
On my way home I have to drive through an upscale neighborhood to get to my apartment.  Today I notice in that neighborhood several Biden yard signs and Zero Chump signs. He messed with their money.
NY Times: Biden, Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for a Mandate
We‚Äôve already seen what economic recovery looked like under Obama/Biden verses Trump... Trump‚Äôs was measurably better for every demographic. And it was Biden who criticized Trumps attempts to control the virus early on, then changed his mind. Weak flip flopping is not leadership.
What I don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù is the 3 months. :) I mean, if the incubation period is 10-14 days, you would only need that much to mandate. Add 2 weeks as ‚Äòinsurance‚Äô and it would be a month, not 3. 3 months covers Election Day which means Biden‚Äôs idea is bunk.

I don't think they've ever had Biden at a net negative favorability in the race even when most other polls had him at around -5. So they've always been a little high on Joe
No the JD didnt say tht, no we didnt "embrace" Joe rogan, it was more he look we convienced a normal dude who isnt into politics tht our policies werent crazy as every1 else said. Do u think after stonewalling Biden during obama yrs they'll magically want to work with biden again

Tyranny from the Biden camp
Biden: All governors should issue mask mandates// yeah I‚Äôll definitely wear a Mask when I go vote in Person.
Yourself with this. Like I said, to desparate. I was a supporter until you selected Kamala. She is TERRIBLE Biden! WHY!? You said yourself many times before how vile she is. So this was an upset and now... I am #Trump2020
Biden, you have got to stop focusing so much on black and minorities. We get it, you support them.. we all do... but you are starting to isolate white voters because you are quickly becoming to obsessive w the minority vote! You already have it. U did long ago. Now, ur hurting

With Biden-Harris? I'm ready to go to work!  Let's get this misogynistic loser out of the White House!
My great hope is that Biden has already begun to think along these lines (not to mention that sharing such plans with the public will go a fair way toward his election #BidenHarris2020
I don‚Äôt agree. She bowed out b/f a single vote was cast. She‚Äôs now on the ticket only b/c Biden choose  her. Being on top of the ticket is earned. Kamala Harris didn‚Äôt earn it
my birthday is nov 4 and my bday wish is 45 gone out of office and president biden in office...
It‚Äôs one thing to vote for Biden or to simply suggest others vote for Biden, it‚Äôs another to, as a national organization, constantly waste your resources doing the Dems‚Äô work

Oh, this messing with the post office thing will make me pull the lever for Biden in the end. But I am not going to waste a second pretending to be happy about it. And unless something radically changes in that party they will never ever get a vote from me in a general again.
Idgaf what the beef is with Kamala y‚Äôall better vote Biden purrr.
Biden you're 80 and probably don't exercise nor go outside of your basement  Read the fine print or have one of your handlers read it for you. All of the mask say they do not prevent the spread of viruses  Sorry but I'm not gonna wear a mask while running

Well I just made a Sieg Heil reference to Biden calling for mask mandates. So I'm sure be Aryan Ken anytime now;) lol.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews   Wasn't it just a few short months ago the Dems said Trump had no authority to mandate anything on a nationwide level???  Now that Biden wants to they say it's a great idea.  HYPOCRISY
Biden will go as far as wallstreet and the donors allow him to go. Remeber when they crashed the economy? Do you want those ppl dictating how far Biden can go?
Google and Twitter are scrubbing right now trying to delete her ever saying anything negative about Biden!!!
By not supporting anyone that built that system, as Biden did. We had multiple options in this race to pick someone else, even if you despise Bernie, most the rest of the field were knew enough to federal office not to have been involved in creating this situation.
We should have people ask Biden about it live, rather than get a statement from his staff. Let's hear his exact words about the details of the situation.
I haven't - that's why I just doubled down on my vote for Biden's ticket!
Sieg Heil! Mein Fuhrer.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
The Democrats are going crazy because Herman Cain's twitter account posted a tweet today condemning Biden and Harris.... Imagine how the Republicans feel knowing that there have been a lot of Democrats voting by mail after being dead years!!!
That's all democrats do...Clinton cleaned up old man Bush 1 term President's mess then Obama saved country from another depression after Bush son's Presidency and now Biden will have the biggest cleanup - great job by people like you
I think she should've ended to but something that needs to be talked about is that a twelve year old is canvassing for Joe Biden and everyone's acting like that's completely fine
Executives at the nation's two largest private prison companies have been donating large sums to Pres. Trump and Republican candidates.
Once again..fact checks on Republicans but I have not seen one fact check on any speech from Harris or Biden...THEY MUST BE PERFECT.  ITS NOT CALLED JOURNALISM ANYMORE....IF CNN REPORTS-IT SHOULD BE CALLED URINALISM.

This was a desperate pick like McCain and Palin. I hear Biden first choice was the WW Michigan Governor but he wanted to get any BLK vote he may have lost with his comments so he went with fellow Mass Incarcerater.
If Biden wins Right and Left stay divided. If Trump wins Right and Left stay divided.
I honestly think both parties are fucking ridiculous choices... This election is gonna be something else. Trump wins- Riots and Chaos, more stupid Twitter. Biden wins- PC/Apology culture is gonna run wild, even more divided. It's really the worst both parties could forward.

Your administration inherited a healthy job market. Your administration didn't NOT inherit a deep recession like the Obama/Biden did.

It‚Äôs 3 months from the election, and Biden is losing ground in the major swing states. Given the historical trends, and current approval data, the odds are on Trump‚Äôs side.
Wait until Biden is in office. Then charge #IMPOTUS45. This prevents anyone from pardoning him
Biden is continuing the work of overhauling our healthcare system (not to the degree we‚Äôd like).   He‚Äôs committed to creating hundreds of thousands of jobs by investing in green energy.  And he‚Äôll put in Supreme Court justices that will uphold Roe v. Wade
Is this the lady that‚Äôs running with Joe Biden ?
Never really thought of that..lol Just figured it was some bullshit grab for more attn to sell clothes or more shitty music. But that does make sense, if he even gets 20% of the minority vote that was going towards Biden, it would be a HUGE win for Trump. This 2020 world man
What happened to all that money he was supposed to spend on Biden ads?
Just takr a big shit on stage and yell "fuck the DNC"  But really, push for policy. Blast the DNC and Biden for not following the will of the voters.
To call Trump a warmonger and not Joe Biden is just crazy. It‚Äôs weird to be out in a position to support the loser scumbag Trump but here we are.
Yeah, sure. I've never heard Joe Biden advocate for poverty, a weak military, over-regulation. . .well, nothing in that list. It's lies. And your list for Trump isn't much better.
I actually saw tons and tons of Hilary signs so I am comforted by the lack of Biden signs..

Joe Biden has advocated for and or voted in favor of every war and military action we have undertaken since he started his federal political career. I mean I already stated this fact but was not clear enough apparently.
Biden &amp; Harris are both RADICAL LEFTISTS...  no where near moderate, let alone conservative.
It's more than what Trump says. I guess you didn't listen to Biden's latest speech. Trump literally looks down and reads what people write for him because they know he's a moron. Trump says things like, "America is very huge. Bigly. We have very nice things. Very, very nice. Uhhh
So is biden gonna transition out to make kamala pres. then nominate you?
Harris also gets more likes on her tweets than even Joe Biden does.
Here is where people get this wrong . they are not so-called Trump supporters.they are conservatives.Why would a conservative vote for Joe Biden? His party is against everything conservatives believe in. Second amendment. Pro life. Small Government.
I know there are plenty of people donating to Biden and that‚Äôs great. We also can‚Äôt overlook local elections especially in a census year when districts are drawn for the next 10 years. That‚Äôs what has hurt Dems in the past.

No factual basis for this. Look at the plans being proposed by Biden. Do some homework. There has never been a credible charge against Biden.
Do you think Bernie would have dropped out if there were no pandemic? Without the pandemic hit on the economy, bad as it was, terrible as the system remains, Trump would likely have cruised to a win. Biden/Harris are HRC 2.0

It's got to be the most insane position among Democratic elites. 88% of Dem voters and 60% independents support Medicare For All. Adding Medicare For All to the platform would energize so many voters and beat Trump in a landslide, but Biden refuses to offend his donors.

Yes, it does. I know, the plebes don‚Äôt really matter. Harris touted the strength of the Obama Biden economy a feature of which was most people without degrees were still making less in 2016 than they were in 2007. Democrats seem to think that is a strong economy.

Have you seen the presidential polls lately??? Biden doesnt even speak let alone gibberish when he does and still kicking trumps ass.
JOE BIDEN DOES NOT WANT THE PRESIDENCY! He is a PLACEHOLDER FOR THE EVIL BEHIND THE SCENES AND WILL APPOINT KAMALA AS PRESIDENT IF ELECTED!!! Wake THE FUCK UP PEOPLE AND PAY ATTENTION!!!
Did they really !? The USPS endorsed Biden?? That seems totally inappropriate!! Especially since they are so closely involved in the voting process. That is insane!
nah biden's tits aren't that small
This is the culmination of a long term trend that's been decades in the making. Trump is a symptom, not in any way a root cause. Biden winning, while certainly preferable, is not a make or break thing.  We're in very bad shape either way

White middle class want to keep their businesses and jobs from burning down from the destruction of the left. The protests have pushed them soo far away from Biden and Harris
Herman Cain is deceased. It's creepy for someone to use his account and pretend he's still alive critiquing Biden and Harris. Eerie.Yes, part of joke is if Biden is elected, the MSM &amp; Dem politicians who support him won't want him having to deal with a pandemic, so *poof*, away it goes.  The other part is even if Trump is reelected, the desire to keep it going won't be as great, b/c they failed to stop him.
Joe Biden is a much better person than the corrupt, lying Orange Monster. Donnie Crybaby has never been ‚ÄúPresidential‚Äù.
All Trump is trying to do is cripple mail delivery because he knows that a large voter turnout will result in a Biden victory.
Balloon but these left wing anarchists destroy entire cities put cops in the hospital they don‚Äôt even get a slap in the hand. It‚Äôs only going to get worse if Biden wins because the democrats will think that all of this worked.
Is that not at least somewhat better than not having a Biden administration at all?
For the record, I‚Äôve only seen 3 Biden yard signs this year, so clearly Biden is running 3-to-1 against Any Functioning Adult.
I'm not saying we can't do better folks, but I disagree with anyone that thinks Biden is not on the right side of this issue, especially when compared with the alternative. The choice is between him and Trump, whether you like it or not.
Please, please, please; I am begging you, do not take this attitude. *Always* keep pushing for your ideals, but do not sullenly reject any victories that you achieve. Biden helped get us a *lot* closer than we've ever been on this issue.
Thank you. It was a tough decision with Biden, I will agree with you there. Have a good night.

I am Indian American and my favorite candidates were Amy Klobuchar and Mike Bloomberg. However, Biden-Harris is a compelling ticket and significantly better than the broken man we have in the office now. The spectrum of humanity is too much, not everyone votes for same identity.

Remember...if you don't vote for Biden, "you ain't black!" And if it's because you don't like Harris, it's because you're racist.
Johnson's spurious "investigation" is obviously an abusive attempt to use his power to damage Biden by "allegation" - a longtime Republican tactic. It stinks to high heaven &amp; it will fail coz there's no there there, BUT it illustrates the depths of Johnson's corruption.

If you're pro-life, pro-liberty, pro-science, and pro-sanity, you can't vote for Joe Biden. The choice couldn't be clearer.  This election isn't about political preferences like usual, it's a national decision about whether truth and liberty matter anymore.
IMO if Biden wins, the panic will be reduced, but the control over citizens will remain the same as if the panic was ongoing, because Dems like Biden have been conditioning people to accept more govt control over their lives (new normal). That's what Biden's mask mandate is about
This virtue signalling to the far-left isn't going to go well for Biden-Harris on election day. I'd be very interested to see swing state polls on this proposed mandate.
Correct...but even with this, how does ANYONE take serious what Biden says?  I'll be doggone if I ever listen to the words of a puppet.

Joe Biden played his hand and lost. Hypocrite Kamala Harris (who openly labeled him a racist) will not pull him through. Trump for 4 more years. #MAGA2020
My opinion, for the little that its worth, is to elect Biden/Harris and STILL show up in the streets regularly to demand the action and policies we want. The people have been awoken and it is up to everyone one of us to keep them awake.
You finding something hard to believe is a failure on your part. I truly have no preference between Trump and Biden. They are both trash. Our system is stronger than either of them.
I don't owe my vote to anyone. Don't bring that "throwing away your vote" bullshit my way. Both Biden and Trump are trash and I don't want either of them in office.
At this point, that is more than enough. I'd love to see a progressive revolution, but I don't think its going to happen this year. Instead, we will elect Biden/Harris and then harness our passion for progress to hold them accountable at every turn. If they fail, they go home.
OMFG!! What a mess this fall is gonna be...stay tuned. Lock her up!!  Threats against former VP Biden...

I'm not sure you've seen the state of politics in this country lately. We don't have a ton of great options laid before us here. Realistically, Biden and Trump are our options and while I strongly dislike Biden I despise Trump and everything he stands for. It's a no brainer.

Billy want no debates between Trump &amp; Biden bc Trump will trumped Joe every time! Pence will have to be aggressive more than Harris bc she will be president if they win!
Agree, but Dems don't live in reality. To answer your question - Beijing Biden.
Kamala wasn't chosen to be VP nominee b/c she'll win over new voters for Biden, although she may win some minorities who vote based solely on identity politics.  She was chosen to be Biden's attack dog, to make the election a referendum on Trump &amp; scare ppl away from voting Trump
You know she's going to claim the election was illegitimate when Biden loses. Maybe Russia hoax 2.0.

Trump literally promised to defund SS over the weekend. Biden wants to keep payroll tax and expand it to income of 400k+ with no cap, which will in fact expand social security so that argument is moot. Plus Kamala left that position nearly a decade ago

Biden's running mate running the show would be true no matter who he chose though, whether it was Kamala or someone else. So your reply doesn't address Kurt's question.
Kamala was chosen because she's as shameless a liar as you'll find, &amp; will be Biden's attack dog, while the MSM writes puff pieces about her unique heritage, as they've already begun doing.  Dual goals: make election referendum on DJT while hyping potential of 1st black woman VP.
Just so we can catch our breath for a minute and get the Rona under control. I haven't craved stability like this since I was 8...Biden flawed as hell, but like...lol
Elizabeth, I‚Äôm responding to the constant attacks on Joe Biden that he is in decline and hiding in his basement. You think those attacks are okay?
She can't even pretend to be an advocate of law &amp; order, b/c the Dem base is openly calling to defund police in cities across the US.  Kamala is just Biden's attack dog who will constantly attack Trump &amp; try to make the election a referendum on him as Biden has been trying to do.

Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out as they say. Good luck with loosing everything you've EVER worked for, should Biden win. But it won't EVER HAPPEN.
Obviously Biden doesn't have any balls to stand up for himself. And its disgraceful to be picked only because you're a Black woman, not because of your qualifications.
I just wanna watch the Biden vs Trump debate .
There is no way on earth Biden would last 4 years . I‚Äôll bet anything he steps down after 2years at the most and hands it over to who the real DNC candidate is . Listen to joe just 4 years ago compared to today . He‚Äôs got some serious cognitive issues.

If you vote Biden, you need to take a break from the news. If you vote trump, ur suddenly a racist? This country is a joke. Again, like in 2016, i will not be apart of this artificial mess. Presidents are puppets of the pharmaceutical and military industial complex. Role playing
Riding with Biden you little criminal
No, Biden is his own unique Criminal
If Biden wins . Christianity will be a crime in the near future . The more they take Christ out of America the more fkd up gets . Think about that .

That doesnt matter. What I think of trump doesnt matter. The root of the problem is there will never be changex when the 'good party'really isnt much better. Trump can be a shitty person along with biden, both can be true.
Yes it would be a good thing if Trump pardoned Snowden. Obama should‚Äôve without question done it. And Biden should if Trump does it. He‚Äôs a hero
Trumps gonna win. He‚Äôll announce a vaccine in October &amp; the stock market is already hitting new highs and going higher. Biden won‚Äôt get enough progressives and blacks aren‚Äôt all that thrilled either. Add in voting shenanigans.
If Biden doesn't move "Save the Post Office" to the top of his campaign issues, he's a fool. #SaveUSPS
They are hiding Biden's obvious diminished capacity. If elected, Kamala Harris will be the only Veep who can utilize the #25A as soon as there are enough cabinet members to sign off. I'm guessing she'll be quietly getting them to pre-sign it in exchange for their appointment.
They want Biden in office because he is not an idiot and does not let emotions run the country.

Equal time. Biden or Harris should follow him.  Fact checking and shame him when he lies. I think he would hesitate to lie if he were held accountable when he does it.
Trump gives hour long press conferences regularly. Do you think Joe Biden could do the same?
What is it with the Trumpers? They have to post their Trump signs in their yards. Are the Dems just more private?  Not seeing the Biden support. I am worried for Ohio!
They are definitely selling merch. One of the volunteers discovered a home in West Park today with a Trump shrine in the backyard. (Guessing someone trying to compensate for being in a neighborhood full of Biden signs)

AOC isn‚Äôt a factor offline though. No one in my family has even heard of her. It‚Äôs also hard to run when you have passed zero legislation. I don‚Äôt think the current ‚Äúleft‚Äù even exists in 4 years of Biden wins.
I literally saw a Biden ad that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll actually read my daily briefings‚Äù like.... that‚Äôs the standard, sir
You're right. Let's vote green or some horseshit so Trump can further destroy the EPA even further and make sure the country is under water by 2035. No post office either. Let's do that because Biden isn't woke enough and how him and Trump are "BASICALLY THE SAME!"
The worst part is they‚Äôre just scrapping the boxes and the hundreds of sorting machines - even if Biden wins it will cost an enormous amount to repair the destruction of a core part of our society
Kanye has already said he‚Äôs in the race to steal votes from Biden and make it easier for Trump to get in again. A vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump, don‚Äôt be dumb.
Well you have a guy in the  now that refused to acknowledge #BlackLivesMatter and openly spouted his racist ways. He has no compassion for anyone other than himself. Are we going to hold Biden and Harris‚Äô past against them? Think about how many 2nd chances you got...

Thanks to Obama/Biden for letting China be alpha.
He shut down the country. He paid us to stay home. He cut off traveling in and out of our country. The health experts said he was overreacting. Biden called him xenophobic. What else did you want him to do?
What is sad about Joe Biden and showing his fakeness as I have to do is look at his record and then the Black people they Cantel to Joe Biden and it‚Äôs sad they should have more pride than that I wouldn‚Äôt want someone represent me that‚Äôs a racist
VP is a different role. Biden barely made a blip in 08 when running but he generated lots of good will as the VP choice. Kamala made rookie mistakes as a presidential candidate. Embraced some Bernie politicies. Now she compliments the ticket.

Harris is at her best on television prosecuting the case against Trump or against bad actors in his administration. That's her superpower. Every good politician has strengths and other areas where they can improve. She also shares Biden's empathy, another big plus.
I just hope it becomes a little more clear before the election this is something that‚Äôs very important because I feel Joe Biden and Obama were really behind all this and Hillary they should have to pay
It‚Äôs actually mind boggling out of 400 million people in the US we get stuck with Biden and trump
It appears with the Durham report starting to come out and people making deals that are bombers distancing himself from Biden looks like all sleepy Joe might be left holding the bag in the spinal Trump thing just a guess

If Biden wins, does he get the AG role?
Totally disagree. Biden should keep his public appearances to the bare minimum. Let Trump talk. Trump is his own worst enemy. Nothing says, vote for Biden more than listening to Trump.
I promise he isn‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt it bother you that you will vote for a guy who said he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúraise his children in a racial jungle‚Äù? Or if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù like he is an owner? Or how he said the black community isn‚Äôt diverse in thought?
A vote for Biden is just a vote for Trump to lose his job and the hope that the next monster is slightly better and that is a huge wager that has no way of guaranteeing anything.
If people were honest and said that Biden/Harris is a bad dice roll they ate just hoping will be less bad, I might have more respect for them. Harm reduction is bs, and even choosing your enemy, while more honest than most cases is also pretty unsubstantive.

Insane to me how people have forgotten how much he's fucked up the EPA, department of education, and now post office and yet so many are still saying that Biden is just as bad
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm primarily focused on too.  It‚Äôs more a question of if I can vote for Biden based on personal morality than anything strategic.  Strategy is pro-Biden, sadly.
The probability distribution given here (27% Trump wins narrowly, 40% Biden wins narrowly or convincingly, 33% Biden wins in a once-per-century landslide) seems pretty realistic to me at the gut level ... though I'm a bit surprised by that 33%.
Biden is widely known to be a gun owner
If #tRumplestilskin &amp; #PMGüì≠#LouisDeJoy persist in sabotaging (RICO ACT) #USPS, lets set up "vote-by-internet", as in downloading the ballot.  Then "left-click" 2 ACCEPT Biden &amp; "right-click" 2 DELETE (dump) tRump!   #WeWillVote4. #ResignTrumPence
Thanks for agreeing that Trump and Biden have the same scientific temperament! üòâ
So, what action are you taking to secure the Postal Service and the General election?  I have asked similar questions of several Representatives and Senators as well as Senator Harris and Vice President Biden.  So far no replies.
It is worth us over 60 year olds drinking a vat of COVID on the way into the polling location just to relish the vote for Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris. Anything to get trump* out
I have heard Biden talk he doesn't sound like someone with Alzheimer. Now if you was talking about trump he does and it's getting worse
If twitter discourse was as powerful as some people claim, all the #insertnameisover people would have no jobs, and Joe Biden and about 17 other candidates would have never even been taken seriously. Yet here we are demanding that people with Squidward avatars be quiet

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
I wonder if trump is paying him, thinking he will take the African American vote away from Biden so trumpy could get enough electoral college votes
The closest thing to a Biden in the GOP primary were Jeb! and Kasich and neither had Joe's resume and recognition.  Also nobody wanted to eat their veggies.
No. He didn't give the outgoing admin. Information. That's not being untruthful. Even Strok said there was nothing. Everyone in the meeting on January 5th with Obama and Biden there said there was nothing.

Obviously you choose to believe that Clyburn wasn‚Äôt preplanned and that the day before Super Tuesday Amy &amp; Pete pulling out and Liz staying in was ‚Äújust coincidence‚Äù otherwise Bernie does win. Don‚Äôt blame me when your fucking Biden loses just like your fucking Hillary.
For the 1st and hopefully last time I'll be voting for leadership over policy. This country needs it badly. Then hopefully Biden we'll step aside after 4 years for a fresh election.
I get all of that. And I have plenty of criticisms of Biden. I just kind of felt bad for him after reading it. They just seemed totally dismissive of him and openly mock him behind his back.
I thought Joe Biden follows science üòÉü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden signs are all over Cuyahoga country (Cleveland) Ohio. So depressing. I can‚Äôt even convince close friends to come to their senses. üòû
That Politico article actually makes Biden sympathetic and makes me dislike Obama and his staffers even more.
Did I see the first bumper sticker for the Dem VP today on the East Side of Cleveland? "Biden/Harris 2020 Because I am not an Idiot!"
Mueller, like Biden, doesn‚Äôt seem to know what day it is. They are just props for the leftists. It‚Äôs actually kind of sad to watch.
Watch: Reporters AGAIN Herded Away From Biden as Questions Are Asked, Even Kamala Appears Tense
I‚Äôm voting for Biden but I hope he loses because I heard he‚Äôs gonna ban taking a shit more than once a month
She's not more popular with me, I'm voting for Joe Biden not her. She has to prove herself to me after that debate, and no it has nothing to do with her being female it is simply about respect.

UNACCEPTABLE!  is hijacking our Democracy‚Äîcapital D‚Äî&amp; our elections. Fellow VETS &amp; SENIORS  must get involved. If we can galvanize a significant portion of the electorate‚Äîmen &amp; women who‚Äôre mad as h*ll &amp; simply cannot take it anymore!
So how did RINO John Kasich get to the point where he is endorsing Joe Biden and speaking for him at the DNC this year? .... His CONSCIENCE of course! üòÇüòÇ
I am from northern Ohio. ‚ÄúBlue Territory‚Äù. For every 1 Biden sign there are 20 Trump signs. Cuyahoga county is a Dem county historically but Trump did extremely well here in ‚Äò16 and no reason to believe he won‚Äôt again.  These ‚Äúpolls‚Äù must not be actually polling anyone.Most Biden supporters probably can't afford boats at this point.
Overall, the point of this is to provide some background when people see Trump down 5 pts right now to Biden in the RCP average in Florida. Trump was down 3 pts to HRC on this day in 2016. Also, on a strong 2018 Election Night for Dems, they still lost the FL Sen / FL Gov races.
Biden and trump have 151 years between the both of em. And you fucking peanut brain sheep think either one of them is more fit then the other to lead our generation and country into the future. #gutthisshitfromthetopdown
So calling Biden a racist not?
The Mike Pence ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America‚Äôs meat‚Äù part üíÄ
A Biden Presidency would return Law and Order and sanity to American politics.
Up to Biden. So instantaneous
I don‚Äôt like Trump, but let‚Äôs be real: Biden is incompetent. Racism and police brutality is here to stay Biden won‚Äôt make it any better. Biden sucks at least we know what we‚Äôre getting with Trump
I don‚Äôt know why my trump supporter bumfuck Brookville, PA aunt continues to harass my 16year cousin who can‚Äôt even vote for posting Biden statuses on FB.
Also I watched some of her debates, 18-24 are stupid but yet she's open for conversation to allow 16 yr olds to vote. She slammed the hell out of Biden too. Called him a racist and he should be investigated for the rape allegations, she believe the women but flip now. Smh. Nope
Us: let‚Äôs give cops other jobs they could actually help people in  Biden: like Vice Presidency?
Sir,  Congressman Johnson says he has evidence against Vice President Biden that would guarantee 45s election.  Why not reclassify the briefing that you were just briefed that Congressman Shiff was speaking about.  Johnson is another Giuliani! Pass the Heroes Act please!

Biden‚Äôs opposition on busing,do you think these two will ever carpool??ü§£
Just some of the things the Biden family gets away with.
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
It‚Äôs really simple the US has a two party system. This is a fact. The are no members of Congress who represents a membership in minority party.  Any vote or non vote is always a plus for a incumbent.  If you don‚Äôt want trump your choice is the opposition that‚Äôs Biden.  That‚Äôs it.
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden‚Äôs campaign
This is a fun exercise and all but it‚Äôs not fair to compare official Biden campaign merch with random Trump hats made and sold by third party vendors. Both campaigns‚Äô official merch is made in the USA and you can absolutely find made in China aftermarket merch for Joe.
Vote for Biden to remove this scourge, then hope the Republican Party regains it senses in 2024.
Next they'll say Biden was born in Kenya. Don't laugh.
Eric Trump says Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP doesn‚Äôt worry Trump campaign
You are delusional......re you and Biden drinking the same water?
You really think trump, Biden, or ANY of these ppl care enough about you or your families well being to follow any of them blindly without question? I dont trust anyone enough to let them do my thinking for me
The fact that Bidens push cart was only 7 seconds behind a train at full speed is such a funny metaphor. It's like, Biden actually had to work where he's at, and is barely behind Trump in political status, while Trump took a well funded, fast easy track to where he's at
The next person that tells me I'm not religious, I'm going to shove my rosary beads up their ass. ~ Joe Biden  Not know your running for President is one thing sniffin‚Äô pple is another but mixing up rosary beads with plugs,is a whole different level of confusion!Prayers U need em
Or are you jus trying to put it on Biden what Trump already have done??ü§îü§îü§î
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
That's because Biden never leaves the basement
Before you go getting ahead of yourself, remember Joe Biden beat Kamala Harris in the primary.
You can cherry pick any "study" you want, but dead people have been voting for years. Fraud is the only way someone like Biden can beat Trump.
And yet Biden mask mandate got more airtime ...if ever a boycott was appropriate I'm all in for media boycott
So 3 days after Biden's Inauguration??
I saw 1 Biden sign today. I travel between Ohio and Pennsylvania every week. Trump stuff everywhere. 1 Biden sign. Got a Trump car flag, sub slogan "No More Bullshit"
You transposed Biden‚Äôs name for the totally incompetent tRump! #VoteBlueImpeachTheTraitors
So know we know who the real candidate is Jill Biden
got some news for you, biden and obama started that. it won‚Äôt change, you just won‚Äôt hear about it anymore.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the most radical Democrats in the country? Lmaooooo
This. As a socialist, I have major policy disagreements with Biden and Harris. But I‚Äôd much rather have them in office than a fascist asshole like Trump.

I would like to go to the North Pole and spend the next 2 1/2 months with Santa and not hear. see or feel what's going on here until 11/3/2020. I can't stand Biden or Harris.

I asked for no more scam calls and the first thing I get his news from CNN Joe Biden and Kamala Harris supporting the new green deal shut down the steel mills close the coal mines they're all in buy China the US will never be the same shove it
Biden‚Äôs Ultra Ego Joe/Jim/Crow üë±üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Luckily Biden has a big family or that crowd would‚Äôve been cut in half.
Although she got an Indian lineage but she is an anti- India and her agenda is similar to George Soros. It is just an attempt from Biden to curtain and to gain sympathy as their BLM and the foreign policies were exposed.
I agree. I don‚Äôt support a lot of decisions she‚Äôs made in the past but she‚Äôs still stronger than Biden in my opinion. He needs someone sharper than he is by his side. Warren would have put me at ease for sure though.

From the president to Biden and Harris to the Gov of my state, all the way down to my local representatives...I feel COMPLETELY unrepresented on every level. No one worth a shit as a human being is even able to get on a ballot to vote for to make any good changes cuz the system
Great endorsement for Biden
I don‚Äôt think the polls will affect Trump voters at all as there does seem to be an undercount of Trump support as there was in 2016, but as Biden begins to lose his lead the left will be having deja vu all over again.
Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly why you shouldn‚Äôt vote for sniffin‚Äô sleepy joe Biden
Hey pst I‚Äôm not voting for Kamala or Biden k thanks.
‚ÄòShe‚Äôs up to the task‚Äô: Democrats excited about Kamala Harris joining Joe Biden on 2020 ticket
I know Biden got in trouble for saying it...but to paraphrase him, it they don't vote this time "they ain't black".
With you all the way Dr. Biden. #BidenHarris2020
I can guarantee we'll be seeing some mainstream media outlets coming out with stories on why Biden and Harris don't actually fit together or something dumb like that.
Walking my dog listening to Joe Biden, I laughed out loud when he called Trump "whiny". Preach Uncle Joe, preach!
It is weird. I expected her to be Biden's VP for months. I am excited the announcement is made, but my enthusiasm didn't change. So I get the excitement everyone has, but I just am not overly pumped up. I wish I was. But I got my expectation. And I like all the choices.
Fuck Biden and Trump, the only one who can save us is Adam Sandler
Ask Pope Francis about  being a Catholic - read your Bible and DO NOT JUDGE.  VP Biden is a much better man than you, there will be enough bishops like you in hell to hold a Bible conference!

Waiting to see Biden/Harris   4pm now I guess. Dinner prep can wait.
Voting for Biden/Harris
You have been calling Biden a slam dunk for weeks now. Have you changed your mind?
Look, I'm a Liberal myself and understand the problems w/Biden. But our election system isn't built to support idealism. You gotta take progress anyway you can even if that means voting for less regression. You're not just voting for Biden, your voting for Democratic control.
you really don‚Äôt want me to vote for biden do you?

This ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äù can decide for herself as to who she‚Äôll for, thank you. I am an educated woman of the 21st century. I am deeply offended by Trump‚Äôs comments. Even in the 1950‚Äôs that comment would have been derogatory. Biden/Harris have my vote, as well as my family‚Äôs.

How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
I guess they figure since xenophobia worked so well against Obama, it's worth a shot versus Biden. Sad.
Yesterday Gad said Kamala called Biden ‚Äùracist‚Äù, she didn't. He got some push back. He pivots to ‚Äùsatire‚Äù. This is Gad‚Äôs crutch.

I‚Äôm not saying Biden is perfect but he‚Äôs a better man than trump in every way imaginable. I‚Äôll give trump the edge in a hotdog contest but that‚Äôs it
Well I make under 250k a year so trump couldn‚Äôt give two fucks about me. Maybe your rich if so I get why your republican. I do believe Biden has the better interest of the entire country and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs laughable. This country is a shitshow under trump
I don‚Äôt even like Biden that much. I liked Cory Booker by the was one of the first ones out. But come on dude you smile dabs your not an anti mask ass you should be in our side
Guilting me that‚Äôs low. I‚Äôll not lie I do hate him more than pretty much anyone alive but I‚Äôm asking seriously how can you think Biden is a rapist and trump isn‚Äôt? He basically said it himself with the pussy grabbing. And Biden had what one accuser trump had like 20
It doesn‚Äôt matter who Biden picked for his VP, leftists are determined to hate anyone who gets nominated and walk Trump into a second term lmao
Biden won for sure, that's why such drastic destruction, so the rich can hurry and buy shit up
Biden-Harris It took me three google searches to confirm it wasn‚Äôt satire, and that indeed, these are the picks.   How does this happen?

Politics is all dirty.Biden has been in office over 40 years, if pple wasn't fed up with our Government, we wouldn't elect Donald. I'm not for open boarders, I'm against socialism..No one should get to live off of others hard work unless they are disable  Helping to a degree ok.

Holy shit, I seriously hope the Pete Buttigeig rumor is true. Biden picking him as his VP would be hilarious. Not because Buttigeig is good. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs an awful VP pick. But because I want to see the centrist ‚Äúvote blue no matter who‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù Dems lose their fucking minds.

I'll most likely vote for Biden no matter who he chooses for VP but if he picks someone that doesn't generate enthusiasm and loses, that's on Biden. He's known for months that he has an enthusiasm gap and hasn't done anything about it.

I wouldn‚Äôt debate the motherfucker unless he addressed his opponent as Vice President Biden. He earned it.
Please clarify. Are you saying that Biden did this?
I met him once, just a regular Joe, so to speak. Trump, by comparison, made creepy remarks about his own daughter, Miss USA contestants and hung out with Epstein. Is there a tape of Biden talking about grabbing women by their, well, you know?
He'll flame out. He lost a lot of black folks when put on the MAGA hat. Not to mention, he's mentally ill. Pretty sad that some Republicans are so nervous about Biden that they're sending this kook donations.
No, it's fair game, Trump and his ilk will continue to question Biden's fitness, mentally and physically...just returning the favor.
Meghan McCain really isn't voting for Biden?
I feel like this VP choice is completely different though. Biden‚Äôs not running for re-election.

I predict that within 30 minutes of the first debate Biden will lose the support of 15-20% of his support. Look what happened to Ford in 76.
Do the Dems not realize that on day one of a Biden presidency the Repubs will push for the 25th amendment to remove Biden?  If not they are truly delusional.We don‚Äôt want him as President?

And you had the same thoughts about Palin? I think she was female. Too bad Biden thought it more important to choose a black woman then someone competent .
Like they did for Palin? Funny how you think this woman should be protected. If she can‚Äôt handle it she should step down. Too bad Biden thought a black woman was more important and someone competent .
Well Biden didn‚Äôt have much of a choice did he. Too bad he decided a black woman was more important then someone competent. Sorry but Harris way to far left we can let her win.
It shows their priorities when Biden &amp; Pelosi, who have been lauded by msm for being devout Catholics, support a woman that once said that being a member of the K of C should disqualify a person from being elected PUTUS.
Isn't the USPS endorsing Biden a conflict of interest ? I'm not even voting for Trump but can definitely see corruption happening with it. What's wrong with voting in person with an ID ?

That is a huge crowd for biden they must have came from all over the country
If biden is good for America why didnt he do anything good for America while he was obamas vise president? He had 8 years and done nothing but make his son rich and family rich
She should be in prison along with Biden he was saved by announcing or he would have been indicted with his son for money laundering!!
This is some funny BS rite here. Biden has no chance of beating Trump.  h
There goes that "nasty" line he uses against any woman who stands against him. When Biden kicks his butt during the election, Kamala can tell him to get his nasty ass out of the white house and never come back.

If Biden was President and did same thing. You would be praising him as a great president. So Frank just shut up!
Yes the liberal way,  even if they are a jackass we will build them up. Problem for Biden is he has no one to pick that doesn‚Äôt come with a lot of baggage. That‚Äôs what you get when you limit yourself to black women. Maybe he should pick a qualified person.
she won't be. she's a small fish. optics. it will be a woman of color from the Obama administration. my money is on Susan Rice. that gets hildabeast back in the door. declare biden incompetent, take the lead, pick VP. the trick will be to win. and they won't.

Cheater in Chief Trump needs to expand his tv viewing choices.  Trump will hear lots from Biden Harris and maybe learn a very foreign concept... not lying to the media, not bullying the media, not demeaning women reporters, not walking away from tough questions.
Biden is not sharp compared to when he was VP. He‚Äôs getting worse and to deny it is dangerous. He‚Äôs going to limp into the WH. And if he was able to actively campaign like normal he wouldn‚Äôt be able to hide it. Why can‚Äôt we all admit both candidates suck. Biden sucks less
Now provide excuses for avoiding any remotely respected reporter. And don‚Äôt site Trump. He‚Äôs another issue all together. Biden is mentally not able to handle the media and his people don‚Äôt want us to see it.

Watch Klobuchar? Who in the hell wants to hear one damn thing from her? Not me. I‚Äôd rather hear cat vomit. All in for Biden /Harris! Still support Warren as the best! Klobuchar can go pound sand.
I live in Ohio and can‚Äôt stand Kasich. That being said...if he can convince enough conservatives/swing voters it‚Äôs ‚Äòokay‚Äô to vote for Biden, in order to remove the cancerous orange tumor that currently sleeps in the White House...carry on.
WATCH: College Students Reject Kamala Harris as Biden VP Pick
This is one Progressive that will work hard for Biden/Harris and I congratulate Kamala, but KHive better give it a rest for a hot minute and let some pretty angry progressives pause for a reset. DO NOT ALIENATE THE LEFT. You will need us. Flat out.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
That looks like Biden behind her sniffing her hair...
I hope you understand that by not voting or by voting third party you are increasing Trump‚Äôs chances of winning. You don‚Äôt like Biden or Kamala? That‚Äôs fine, but have some sense and don‚Äôt hand multiple supreme court seats to Trump
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Whatever. You did whatever you could do to sink Elizabeth Warren. I‚Äôll support Biden/Harris but thank goodness I don‚Äôt live in MN because you would never have my vote. Congrats to Kamala
So Biden picks Harris, the one who slept her way to DC and also bragging about smoking dope while prosecuting others for doing the same thing.
NEWS ALERT:. The pick is in... It's a Biden-Harris ticket for Dems in 2020

47% of registered voters in Ohio are democrats. Biden stands a real chance here if they‚Äôre willing to put in the effort. (The same can‚Äôt be said for most democratic congressional candidates however, considering how horribly Ohio is gerrymandered)

Shameful that Biden did not interview and males, black or white for he VP spot - he was to hell bent on choosing a female and black women to play up to those demographics so he would gain votes. Harris is so left thinking, and unable to work across the aisle - sad
Beware of Trump Russian Republican freedom caucus propaganda beware vote blue up and down the ballot vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
Yes is Nancy  Chuck Schumer   Tom Perez  Joe Biden  Kamala Harris we need to beat Donald Trump  Enabler  I no it takes money to. Place campaign ads. How about showing the American people that Donald Trump  Republican freedom caucus are hurting from their political Policies

Totally disagree. Biden should keep his public appearances to the bare minimum. Let Trump talk. Trump is his own worst enemy. Nothing says, vote for Biden more than listening to Trump.
We don't need four more years of President Donald Trump.  Vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris end end the horror that President Donald Trump has brought to the United States.
Biden did more for women than any other candidate by choosing a female running mate, you did not a goddamn thing.
this is where i‚Äôm at. i think biden is potentially more dangerous to the left than trump. democrats opportunistically run interference for us and things like BLM as a cynical way to combat trump. but they have more incentive to eradicate the left then the gop has.
Imagine spending 2020 arguing for systemic change and criminal justice reform, and voting for Joe "racial jungle" Biden. The guy who helped create the 1994 Crime Bill which caused the mass incarcerations you are fighting against. And Kamala's past is an even bigger can of worms.
I‚Äôm not liberal, I just hate the direction this country is going, and I fear for our country if we have 4 more years of this. Not sure if Biden is the answer, I‚Äôm just very afraid.
By the way, I never said I was a Biden/Harris supporter. I‚Äôm not registered as Republican or Democrat as I believe in voting for the most qualified person. I cannot stand the partisan politics in this country. You can have the biggest fuck in the world and people vote party line
I'm open to anything. One of my best friends is a Democrat and I keep begging him to give me a candidate to vote for. Hillary and Biden??
Yes. It‚Äôs name is Biden.
It is. I am a Republican, but find it hard these days. I'm not a fan of Biden at all. I wanted Yang.
So are you saying only smart people votee for Joe Biden or Democrat?
That's what the original post is also talking about. I doubt he means that Biden became an unstoppable juggernaut over the past couple days.
How many would die or COVID-19, under Biden?   Remember when you were ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Mayor‚Äù and you exploited 9-11-2001 for your own personal enrichment?
Vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States.  The United States needs liberals in the White House again.
Biden-Harris Gaffs are also easy to come by and equally as embarrassing. I‚Äôd this the bar?
Pretty hot under these lights, right Biden?
Listen fool this moron is a divider and the only people he appeals to are the racist supremacist. This president is so flawed and so inept. He‚Äôs the biggest pathological liar to ever hold the Oval Office captive. He will be removed President Biden will have him removed
Lightbulb up ass, bleach down throat. It will just disappear. Yes, Biden is terrible
Isn't Biden's goofy slogan Build Back Better simply a different way of saying Make America Great Again???  Borderline plagiarism again??
Joe Biden, the basement dweller, is requesting a mandate for masks üò∑ for the next 3 months when we go outside.  What does he know about going outside? ü§î
So Joe Biden just admitted that he will resign on inauguration day??
I consider Harris more as a simbiote, as she is keeping Biden alive in the race and likely calling the shots!
Vote blue up &amp;down the ballot vote for Biden &amp; Harris PRESIDENT of the United States of America
When will go public and back all of Biden‚Äôs accusers like she claimed?
will you be as critical on a daily basis if Biden becomes President? Will you find something, anything every day to spend your entire programs and Tweets bashing him for anything they did or didn't do? Or do you just drink the Dem biased Kool-Aid?
If your a progressive and ur voting for Biden your not a progressive. Ur Just a Democrat.
yes it was. trump put a hit on biden and putin will see that it gets carried out if someone doesnt stop it!
Biden is like the blind leading the blind
Here's what he actually said, Biden. Quit misleading the public with more lies.
So the children (Lowest risk of catching COVID) can't attend school. But the woke left (With middle age to elderly) can attend the same school to see Biden...... #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmmmm
Joe Biden has integrity &amp; compassion leadership that it take to be President of the United States of America  Something that Donald Trump  dosen't have
Come on  . Take your Dem biased glasses off. You should be asking Biden why in his search he never spoke to one male black candidate? Talk about discrimination. For the next decade everyone will be ruling out hiring males  crucified for female/black discrimination
hey  - ask Biden this - so he discriminated in his VP search by not talking to one male black candidate who was qualified? He only spoke to females that were black - playing up to the gender/race card?
One particular thing Biden said and kept saying that I loved was "Biden and Harris administration"! Never have I heard Trump say Trump and Pence administration.
When Biden wins you watch how fast the hysteria of Covid disappears.
I hope President Biden doesn‚Äôt wimp out on us and fail to prosecute all the crimes now being committed.
Oh also I totally missed but that "across the board" thing is also just not true. He doesn't want to get rid of the middle class Trump tax cuts. This is easy stuff. You know you can disagree with Biden while also still be educated about the reality of policy, right?
Yeah Welsey Ross is right. Also, in addition to clearly misunderstanding Biden's proposal, you also really shouldn't be adding knock on effects to your argument like higher utility prices. If Biden passed a carbon tax it'll probably have a rebate or dividend for that anyway!
It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a walking ad for Biden!!
If you‚Äôre interested in some fun, check out the range of possibilities in their scenarios. Biden could win with 450 or more votes. Or lose with fewer than 200.   Add in what we know on polling since 2016 - which 538 desperately tries to debunk - and November is up for grabs.
She stands for dramatically scaling back the role of the gov, so if you'd like to actually end the past 40 years of neoliberal slide, them she certainly ain't your gal. If you are in a solid state, then Hawkins is good. But voting Biden is swing states is best in the long run IMO
Not aggressive enough =/ no plan at all that can't be expanded upon in future adminstrations  Groups like the Sunrise Org critisize Biden because they think we'd be safer with bolder climate policy, but they also would much rather implement Biden's plan NOW than wait around
Vice President Candidate Sarah Palin went up against Joe Biden when he was Barack Obama's Vice President Candidate in 2008.
Geraldine Ferraro (Working for Walter Mondale), Sarah Palin (Working for John McCain) and Carly Fiorina (Working for Ted Cruz for only one week) were also women Vice President Candidates before Kamala Harris (Working for Joe Biden).
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to get elected and all of this nonsense goes away.
Mitch McConnell must go for his inexcusable/unjustifiable obstruction of our  republic he is a Traitor to our country and the American  blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States vote up and down the ballot and save America &amp;Americans lives

Biden will blow it for himself.  Lol
Vice President Kamala Harris will be a great addition to the President Joe Biden Administration.
Glad and Joe Biden should never be in the same tweet. Not to mention he fondles women all the time...of course he wants to give them something...but it's not a voice.

I'm not even trying to argue that you need to vote Biden or whatever, I just genuinely don't think you know how entirely pointless that reply was, aside from the point of making people mad and making this hellsite worse.
Okay, let me put this into perspctive, that literally provides nothing to the conversation. The post you're replying to already accepts the premise that Biden won't go for M4A, but a more moderate reform. You understand all you did was say something everyone knows and ad hominem?
Harris and Biden need to use tomorrow as an opportunity to address their mistakes and commit to doing better. We obviously value progress over perfection but we also need accountability to develop trust and really rally behind the #BidenHarris ticket
Hope to see you campaigning for the Biden/Harris campaign!  We need your voice to get rid of ü§°!
Glad Biden didn't care about qualifications
Vote for Joe Biden for President of the United States of America and vote for Kamala Harris for Vice President of the United States of America.  This is going to be epic!!!!!!!!!!!  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris will be the next Vice President of the United States of America in the upcoming President Joe Biden Administration.
Missing my point bud. Even if Biden wanted to get M4A done, he probably couldn't do it. Bernie's healthcare reform would be better, but most likely not single payer.
I'm saying that both Bernie and Biden wouldn't have been able to get M4A through congress. Biden may get a public option through, and Bernie probably would have pushed harder and gotten a *better* public option, but there's really no path for full M4A in the short term
joe biden‚Äôs running mate is meg the stallion: confirmed
what voters? She was only elected as a Senator in CA - with a 75% Dem population. Biden is choosing her to gain advantage with female and black voters. She is a pawn. She has less knowledge on how to run programs than ex-VP Dan Quayle.
That's why Biden chose her - to play up to those voters. It wasn't about how knowledgeable she is or capable of running a large business - the USA.
I just got a text from the Biden camp that confirms Harris as VP pick.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt put a sentence together. And in the past when he did he said something someone else said. Joe Biden is a old fool
Go vote for Biden LOL. He seems all there SMH

If Biden wins, then he will become ruler of the Westeros Wing.
I don't know what's worse.  The fact that someone tries to pull this off running for office or the fact that the "Never Trump" people are going to try to pull this off as just normal Biden.
We can't allow President Trump to be reelected to a second term in office.  Vote for Joe Biden for President instead.
Seriously, even if I hated Trump, (which I don‚Äôt) there is no other way around voting for him. A vote for Biden is a vote for lawlessness.  Look around and tell me differently!
One could wonder if Biden graduated üéì at all?

Introduction to Sociology class. Before that I was unfortunately the Biden Democrat type...
President Joe Biden will bring our country back from fascism
It‚Äôs indisputable that Biden and Harris are far more in-tune with America.
Why should I trust a union that endorses Biden?
If Biden wins the election you will see the resurgence of these policies and curriculums.  The Trump administration is holding these things at bay currently. The sad truth is that both of these political parties unleash some demonic influences upon our country. God help us!
That depends on who Archer is.  A Biden relative?  College friend?
That is what Joe Biden calls her as well.
And Biden will get more of them trump is a con man
Biden's not President, when the real president starts then Biden should follow suit. Don't ya think.
Oh yea...story of my life. You critize Biden or Harris and u must be a Trumper. Nevermind that their policies and actions have harmed minorities for years. Joe Biden was against busing black children to white schools. I hear you on your critism..its valid.
And I think not voting for Biden or Trump would only be MEGA COOL!
After, by making sure every single centrist democrat loses down ballot. That includes Biden. Punish them. They just assume that they automatically have the left vote and try to use shame and attacks to guilt us into voting while bowing down and kissing the feet of the right.
No, because ALL AMERICANS need to know what Obama and Biden did to spy on the Trump campaign and to try to end his Presidency illegally! The truth hurts, but the truth shall set you free!
Reporter: So can you explain what Obama did to bring peace between Israel and the AUE?  Biden: I know about roaches and you know he did, he did, um you know he did the thing...
Which means not for many months, unfortunately.  I think Biden will mandate masks nationally, but some people will ignore it or wear the mask pulled down under their nose.  Too many Americans aren't willing to experience a little discomfort.  #WearADamnMask
Jo (no ‚Äúe‚Äù) and she can be if enough Americans want real change.  Change that‚Äôll bring our troops home, get innocent people out of prison, balance the budget, and on and on.  Otherwise vote Biden or Trump it really doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre both the same.
Which is why we‚Äôll all be voting for Biden and while he‚Äôs cleaning up the mess left behind from Trump, you and him can enjoy endless litigation of your crimes for the rest of your miserable lives.
All these libs talking about protesting as though protests have ever done something. If you vote for Joe Biden, you're voting for whatever hideous monster comes next to make Trump look moderate.

All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course

Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren‚Äôt happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you‚Äôre calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that‚Äôd fail immediately. The fact is, and it‚Äôs proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can‚Äôt move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
I'm glad that Biden has your support, then.
Look, you can either vote for Biden or be stuck with Trump. Sadly, 3rd party votes aren‚Äôt going to get us out of this mess.
WATCH: President Trump speaks at the White House before leaving for New York.
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn‚Äôt happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don‚Äôt give up the momentum we‚Äôve gained just to spite Biden!
Biden is a liar.
Great thread. Kamala understood the importance of #Medicare4All then. We need it now more than ever. Biden and Harris must push left and embrace #M4A in order to save the American people from the COVID-19 crisis.
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don‚Äôt want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden‚Äîbasically it was this: ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!‚Äù I was right. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was her making HIM exciting!
NO thanks I will be voting for Biden
Vote Biden.  We‚Äôve seen the mess Trump has made.  No confidence he‚Äôll do anything different if re-elected.
But Biden isn‚Äôt bland fish. He‚Äôs half a plate of shit whereas Trump is a full plate of shit. With Biden you‚Äôre gonna eat less shit, but it‚Äôs still shit all the same.
With little time until election, emphasis must be on electing Biden-Harris.  Most effective use of time and effort.

So much misinformation in this I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start; Kamala and Biden in fact, *HAVE* done everything she listed. Anyone who is reading this just look up the Keystone Pipeline, or the history of the ICE detention camps under Obama and Kamala‚Äôs support of ICE.
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
Luckily, Kamals will be the Vice President. I've every confidence that she will serve as an admirable right hand to Biden. She really is the complete package! I've not hear her make promises to blacks, but, she speaks about specific needs and filling those needs across groupsüëå
Joe Biden needs to have his own briefings with higher level experts as often as necessary. Show leadership and real scientific example.
If America has had ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù from the beginning, how come you Obama and Biden did nothing about it during your 8 years? You Obama stoked the fires of racial hatred and racism during your 8 years! Your unhelpful comments on Trayvon Martin &amp; Mike Brown before all .../2...

Pence said if the Biden - Harris team gets elected, she will do away with MEAT! YEP, MEAT.ü§°
Tell it to Biden.
But Joe Biden isn't Catholic. I'd say Joe is a better representation of being Catholic than the church hierarchy that swept the suffering if little children under the rug to protect the rich privileged Catholic Church and their illusion of saintly pedophiles.
Under no circumstances should Joe Biden concede to trump.
Get over it, ok?  I trust Kamala and Joe Biden!
Fortunately here in Ohio the union I‚Äôm a member of seems to be tired of Democrat BS. The SS comments were made by Biden and Pelosi because Trump did the payroll tax reduction, they forgot Obama did the same thing and the felt different then.
Absolutely unbelievable!!! ‚Å¶ should be ashamed. A 3 yr old autistic baby removed from plane for not wearing a mask. Must have had Biden/Harris working as the flight attendants ‚Å¶ should address this
MAGAts don't read that much.  Maybe the Independents could be swayed, 60/40.  We readers are already voting for Biden/Harris.
And if Biden can remember his name
It's funny ur doing it now right before the elections that ur losing lmaoooooo to Joe Biden  but the pandemic has been since Jan and now ur lying about forcing them
You have the never to say Biden's been wrong, BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT, trump is and there's 4 million plus infected and 168,000 souls dead. Who's been wrong again?
True, Biden has no clue of the world around him
Biden and Pelosi believe that practicing Catholics (those few who actually follow the Catechism) are unfit to serve in our nation's courts.
Voting for Jo Jorgensen is worse than voting for Biden or Trump.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Joe Biden is up 49-42 percent over President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup
That part I definitely understand, and for that reason specifically I‚Äôll never knock on anyone voting for Biden. We just need to consider that a racist abuser with a very evil prosecutor might not be great for driving racial justice forward
For sure I definitely get why people will continue to vote for Biden but he was the candidate that the left wanted the absolute least. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs any better or more fit than trump, and that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs important to begin change this year
Biden doesn‚Äôt support M4A, he doesn‚Äôt support free/accessible education, and he doesn‚Äôt have any policies that will enact eco friendly practices. His only finite plan is to increase police authority. I‚Äôd rather start change then elect discount trump in a blue tie
I definitely agree and it‚Äôs a weird subject because it‚Äôs important to get trump out, but in my view the final result of Biden+Harris shows that neither party will fix things. Biden won‚Äôt fix any problems that we face today so I think it‚Äôs important to begin the process of change
Well...if they let Biden become President first, it will be the Speaker.  How funny if the Republicans win back the House.
The spoiler effect, Biden would be one of the most progressive presidents in US history, and maybe say something about Bernie and AOC's endorsement?
My grandmother (WI) Trump My father (OH) Trump My mother (OH) Trump My sister (OH) Trump My brother (OH) Biden Myself (OH) Biden
Definitely gotta get 5%. Biden/Harris not only ensures a Tom Cotton presidency, it further sends us into a spiral of right authoritarian hell
If you're a so-called leftist and you plan to vote Biden/Harris, you are my enemy and the enemy of all progressives.
I mean, Biden wants to fucking go to war with Palestine.
Call me cynical, but I don‚Äôt believe this will remain a mere suggestion to governors if Biden wins.
What in the fuck would these shitstains do better? Are you forgetting that Biden lied and told his supporters that it was safe to go vote so that he could win, causing a spike in coronavirus cases? Are we forgetting that he held the health of millions of people hostage?
So if we dont listen to biden and not mandate mask wearing for the next 3 months and more than 40,000 loves are lost what do u think he will say then the mandate would've save those 40,000 lives and blame trump for not mandating it
Spotted a Biden porch flag and a shirt at the grocery in less than 24 hours. These people actually exist which is weird to me.
Hope for Biden.
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Joe Biden   " It is not about your rights"
Federalism is on life support now.  It will be dead within one year if Biden wins with both Houses of Congress.
One question I have is does the QAnon conspiracy get louder/stronger under a Biden presidency?  If Trump does in fact lose, they will think that the "elites" rigged it against him.
Bow down to the greatest president of all time. A BIDEN MEME?!?!??!! THIS MAN ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
So your for Biden who wants to raise taxes on the working class which make up 90% of the population by 4 trillion, make the working class pay for low income housing in the suburbs like my local area (Huber Heights), who wants to have the health care paid for by the stock market.
If Biden/Harris wins, are you sure that she will not be making all of the decisions from day one?
Ask Biden what he did...oops that would require journalism
People were clear during the primary that Biden was unacceptable. If beating Trump is so important, then perhaps Democrats shouldn't have nominated him.
You mean Trump will make sure Biden and headboard Harris can‚Äôt CHEAT
Whoever it is you know they will be there for most of the Biden/Harris term.
The fact that there will be no change means that Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump. Just because they're going in two different wrong directions doesn't mean one wrong direction is good. Less bad is bad. Why would you want bad? Less evil is evil. Let's just focus on the evil.
Hell yes -- #LetBetoSpeak #LetBetoSpeakDNC Biden just tosses him after Super Tuesday endorsement, and the Whataburger photo-op?  Hell no.   If you want a lot of Texas Dems to do more than just pull the lever for Joe in November, this needs to get fixed.  Now.

How much money are you donating to Biden/Harris ticket? You made a promise to use your money to keep drumpf from winning. Keep your word.
If what you say is true Manu.......then investigating Biden's campaign and its support from China is fair game
Holy cow! You have lost your marbals and need help! #UnfitForOffice You're making Biden look good. Morning Joe has a 100% approval rating amongst it's viewers. That's better than your 98% approval rating amongst Republicans. #TrumpIsNotWell #AmericaOrTrump
Don't get swept up in that this is the last election everything's on the line right now garbage. The reason why Biden was 'selected' is so that nothing will change.
Fuck no! That would mean she would have to turn on Biden!
She meant to say he inherited the slowest economic recovery in US history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden (who litteraly did nothing for the economy), then made it into the greatest economy in the world within 2 years.
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
Let's be real, none of us on the left are thrilled to be voting for Biden. Our candidate was rallied against and shut out by a tone deaf DNC. But this is who we're stuck with. If you really aren't voting for him cause he's "just as bad," you're a product of your own privilege.
When Biden/Harris take over the secret police
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
well biden has been accused of both so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Why does Biden look so robotic when he walks? Why didn‚Äôt he greet Kamala properly when she came to the Podium. Weird.
Biden and Trump both brother
when Brett Kavanaugh was accused of raping a woman, liberals heavily pushed the idea that we should always believe women who come forward. but when Joe Biden was accused of reaching up a woman's skirt and penetrating, she must have been lying.
Harris‚Äôs selection in and of itself is unlikely to change many votes, but her presence on the ticket is likely to influence voters‚Äô opinions of Biden and whether they‚Äôre likely to vote for him, writes  &amp;   #veepstakes
Certainly is our future if Biden/Harris are elected.
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
bro he been lighting biden ass up he 2 tweets away from dropping a diss track
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It‚Äôs on the rebound already
So you want Biden
he "inherited the longest economic exansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden," and "Like everything else he's inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." Snap!
A few things:  1. AOC is not a comrade. The fact that she won't back Shahid Buttar says all that needs to be said.  2. Anyone that votes Biden/Harris is a class traitor.  3. People that accuse other people of being a Russian bot are diddlers, it's totally true, pass it on.
Yes I think you missed the point. I don‚Äôt  vote for a person because they are a Christian. I vote based on the polices they push toward Christians. Biden and Trump are obviously flawed like all humans BUT Trump POLICIES have been good for Christians WHILE BIDEN and dems attack us
One thing is for sure. Joe Biden doesn't have the cleanest history when it comes to race relations. Look up what he had to say about integration and then combine that with who he  idolized as a Senator, Robert Byrd from WV. This can't be misinterpreted,but will be ignored
So she is planning on assasinating Joe Biden.
God will protect Joe Biden
ü§£ü§£ü§£hilarious coming from you, who picked a VP that rightfully obliterated you on national TV for your racism. At least you‚Äôre providing us with great entertainment Biden!
And Biden isn‚Äôt, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
Says Biden who supported racist policies, &amp; picked a VP who rightfully obliterated him on national TV for his racism.
Like Biden will do better
I forgot that Biden and Harris can start getting briefings now. That may change the game.
How about "Doc" Jill Biden?
Steve, this has been such fun for me. I'll let you get to finding those receipts abut Biden in the basement. Look forward to reading it. But I must wash my dishes. Goodnight!
LOL. Why do you want me to call you a racist? You didn't say anything racist (although you support one, which is quiet problematic). I'm waiting for that proof of Biden in a basement, tho.
Also saying she believes the women felt uncomfortable doesn't mean she believes he did anything inappropriate or at the very least intentionally harmful. None of those women said they felt assaulted by Biden too. So yeah, we can see hot this plays out, with FACTS.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn‚Äôt seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half üòÅüòÅ
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
‚ùìSo what does #Biden have to do with that? He doesn't support 'defunding of the #police', or violence of this sort. You should blame the #NRA if anyone. They are the reason people are carrying around #ar15 assault rifles.
President ‚Å¶ slammed by Former Vice President and his new running mate, U.S. Sen. ‚Å¶   (Via DaytonDaily)
Y‚Äôall talking all this shuff about #KamalaHarris but y‚Äôall act like that‚Äôs gonna stop y‚Äôall from voting for #Biden and her to win! I hope you know because of y‚Äôall mindset the elites is doing what you already accepted.
Yet another reason to vote   out of office in 2022,  I'm happy to fall in line and vote for Biden/Harris!  Anybody buy a complicit Republican.
As she hits a blunt, pushes Biden down the stairs and becomes prez....for sure...I actually like her..she believes Tara.  She put a bunch of thugs in prison and slept her way into a prominent role...perfect politician.
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Why are democrats on the top of my feed?  Biden, Schumer, Joe Walsh and Pelosi.   I do not follow them.  Disgusting.
Joe Biden didn't take it personally when, Kamala Harris attacked him during the presidential debates. He knew that that's how politics are. That's something you will never understand  . You can dish it out but you can't take it. #BabyTrump
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
No!  She can't win.  Any vote that isn't for Biden is a vote for Trump.  Do you want four more years of Trump? Hillary wouldn't even want you to do that. If you could ask her, she would say no. She would want you to vote out that piece of shit that stole the election from her.
I thought Joe Biden running for president dummy
You need to check your self into a mental hospital asap ,Biden was right "you ain't black and neither are the others in black skin voting ,supporting,excusing ,defending trump who works of satan as you do ! Satan is a liar! you ,trump and all aligned with trump are
Yeah, I don't generally hear people saying that either, but also I don't hear people reminding about the problems of the PATRIOT Act and the existence of DHS in the first place. And I see lots of unironic retweeting Biden and "vote blue" that seem ... uncritical.
At least two counter-protestors in the Biden crowd.
Pretty sure the lesser of 2 evils crowd knows Biden‚Äôs record sucks. But the point is A: Trump is worse and B: Biden can be pushed in a way Trump cannot.   At this point there are 2 options, and 1 is clearly worse.
The thing is she isn‚Äôt black she is Jamaican and Indian.   He didn‚Äôt even pick a black woman which is a another lie by Biden
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
hey just a reminder that most trump supporters refuse to call out any of the chaos he‚Äôs caused over the past 4 years so it‚Äôs not their place to put you down for supporting and simultaneously criticizing biden/harris‚Äô records either!
Biden / Harris 2020! Build Back Better! One Prison At A Time!
Biden's not in office yet, silly!
Honestly, I agree. Yeah Biden sucks but I'd rather vote for him than have Trump in office again. People are acting like there's another choice but unfortunately there's not and we need to face that reality. That doesn't mean we can't fight for change at the same time tho ‚ú®
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
I stick to print news and transcripts just for this reason. I mean I'm gonna #votegold and vote for  anyway, but I'm trying not to attack Biden/Harris. We need to stop nominating old men who can't speak.
Remember back during the primaries when Biden supporters said that since we're not democrats, we shouldn't be allowed to have a say on who is the candidate? Isn't it interesting that we're all now democrats and expected to vote for Biden?
Trump dead ass has plants in this press corps. Some chick just asked a question saying antifa/.com takes you to Biden's site and asked if Biden/Harris should denounce Antifa as a terrorist organization (it's not). Now he's on a tangent about Portland. Totally staged.
Biden will constantly need to be reminded of who his VP is &amp; what he‚Äôs running for. Plus, I hope Kamala speak the truths she spoke on the debate stage about Biden being a racist. Will be interesting.
I‚Äôm so excited about Biden/Harris2020. I‚Äôm in Ohio(important state) My voice has NEVER BEEN HEARD! My story is UNBELIEVABLE! You 2 or u zoom me or visit me, and fight for ME! I BELIEVE in you both. Please don‚Äôt let me down!!
Funny how President Biden finished every sentence while Trump read from notes for half an hour, the same notes he read yesterday without raising his head. He is a energy on sleeping pills.
Biden/Harris2020 are going to Unite this Country!! We need to quit this racism BS! We are all one race, the Human Race‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Can we get a split screen of Biden watching this... this... anxiety inducing auditory assault?
OMG.., reminds me of Obama &amp; Biden üò•üôåüòÉüòÉüíûüíû
What did Joe Biden do in 2008 to save us from the brink of collapse?
I'm seeing a lot of anti-Biden, anti-Harris rhetoric from my left-leaning friends on social media. Can't we like... Save it? Until after we get Trump out of office?   The Republicans don't even expect their candidates to be decent... Why must we expect ours to be perfect?
Okay, watching that press conference almost turned me into the K-Hive lmao  We need the Biden/Harris ticket to win in November y'all
I've talked to lawn furniture that's smarter than Joe Biden lol. Picking you as a running mate closes the case lol.
can you stop showing the press conference from biden and kamala? Its on a damn loop and its annoying
Biden-Harris   We need more than a victory; we need a mandate!
Joe Biden, a man of empathy???!! Isn‚Äôt he a rapist? Wasn‚Äôt he pro segregation??!! Didn‚Äôt he say that the African American community lacks diversity?? And he chose a cop to be his VP??!! Empathy is not in that man‚Äôs vocabulary. Go to hell
Only two people in the US died from Ebola. President Obama and Vice President Biden did their job.
This is such a good speech. Hitting on every point possible. Also, she's gonna make Biden sob.
Biden introducing Kamala Harris as his vice president... Bet she'll be introduced as the 47th president too. üòé
Reelect Trump and Pence administration!!!! Why start completely over on a random unknown program with Biden when we are established with trump? Not worth the "shot in the dark"
‚ÄúOMG #Biden picked someone he disagreed with in the primaries!‚Äù  Good.   I don‚Äôt want a VP that‚Äôs just gonna follow him around like a conditioned puppy dog.
Biden had a lot of slip ups in the Primary debates but he's really pulled it together and is giving a hell of a speech here. Gotta give him credit.
Maybe cancel him for stealing donations that he claimed were for the mothers of those killed by police. Maybe cancel him for totally reversing his opinion on Biden/Harris for a check. Maybe cancel him for being a white man pretending to be black.
Watch Live: The Biden/Harris ticket to debut first remarks as running mates.
If I hate white supremacy, why would I vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, two people that have done more to harm black folk in this country than possibly anyone alive.
People with any sense of morality don't vote for scum like Biden and Harris.
Wait so you think joe biden is a better option? you‚Äôre lyin
For those curious about the spiritual background of Kamala Harris, here is an article that shares a bit. What I find delightful is the broad exposure she has had to many different traditions while also embodying and claiming for herself w/in a tradition
How much are you in love with Biden?
When McKinley was assassinated Teddy became President, the same thing could happen if Biden becomes incapacitated for mental health issues. The only difference is McKinley and Teddy were republicans.
If I don't vote for Trump I'm helping Biden win. Your argument is stupid. I don't care if he wins or not, I'm not some privileged liberal shitstain that wants to beat Trump so I can go back to living in ignorance.
I'm going to help Howie Hawkins win 5%, I don't give a fuck what you do. However, l'll put it this way, with as disgusting as you people are acting, a vote for a third party is a vote for Biden since we're not voting for Trump to spite you.
It won't, but neither will Biden, that's why I'm not supporting either one. I'm voting for Howie Hawkins to hit 5% of the vote so that we can get federal funding and recognition. The green party is far from perfect, but infinitely better than the DNC.
Thank you and I‚Äôm not convinced that Joe Biden is any better just because his name isn‚Äôt Donald Trump. Like I said I‚Äôd rather focus on where the real issues lie which is congress. They don‚Äôt have to leave &amp; we just let em sit which means the government is hardly changing truly.
You should be asking yourself that question. We're not willing to budge or work with you because We. Don't. Need. You. We don't need Biden in office because it doesn't help us. We have nothing to lose. You need our vote to win, so now you need to start courting us.
She had my support... and still does!  Along with Biden!  You‚Äôre going home dude.. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I don't care about beating Trump, I care about saving lives and ensuring freedoms. I care about platform and issues. What's happening in this country isn't a trump problem, it's an America problem, and voting Biden will only make it worse in the long run.
Like I said, Biden could‚Äôve chosen Keith Sweat as his VP and I‚Äôd still be voting for Biden over Trump!
The stuff you're talking about is going on now. Do you know who the  president is  now, it's not Joe Biden
They'll try. There is just literally no chance that Biden voters and left leaning moderates will possibly care. The GOP is also going to paint Kamala as anti black for locking up so many people while portraying Trump and a true friend of blacks for letting them out of prison lol
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
This is where I'm at. I live in Ohio a swing state. I'm sick and tired. I have said on numerous occasions I will not vote for Biden, but honestly I'm scared. Am I making a huge mistake? Uuuggghhhhhh
After analyzing the political history of Joe Biden I believe him to be no better &amp; maybe a little worse than Trump. I would instead look at the Congress members &amp; vote there as that‚Äôs where real change needs to happen. A president won‚Äôt do much. Congress is where the issues lie
'One of our own.' Indians cheer Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as White House running mate  via
Meh, anyone who actually votes for Kanye probably wasn't gonna vote for Biden anyways
#Squad ...Hey Biden Dems when you take a shot you better not miss.
Sen. Mommie Dearest? Biden would never do that to his staff.
Biden harris is nowhere near the life or death situation that trump/barr are.
Maybe you should have listened during the primary instead of rallying around Biden in order to prevent people from getting health care.
So going to college to get a degree for a high paying job is a bad decision too? Wow she‚Äôs going to bring the Biden campaign down to its knees.
I don't think Biden is president right now when all these things are happening I do believe it's president Trump
But Biden and Kamala has been complicit in legislations that directly caused pain &amp; suffering to so many black families! Why is that part being ignored?? Why is that part being swept under the rug
Nice try Bill.  Busy trying to hide Biden‚Äôs dementia much?
Biden openly admits he will not be leading the country if he wins the election. #NeverBiden #MAGA #KAG
Why do you state ‚Äúshe‚Äôs ready to lead on day one,‚Äù yet not state you are ready? Who would be running the country under a Biden administration?
Don‚Äôt forget that Biden will not save America, he will destroy it.
Joe Biden said "Come on guys. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù his entire campaign and y‚Äôall bought it.
Than why are you down 23% to Biden in that category?
And the dramatic part being what...could it be that Biden isn't supporting are brothers in the FOP. Or that he isn't condemning the riots that have hurt brother firefighters. Or what good is collective bargaining when a city is brokeü§î
"People are dying. The earth is dying."  Sounds like an argument to support Hawkins over Biden.
That is a straight lie. Biden and his running mate are poised to divide this country even further and run it into the ground purposefully. Really who choses an ex-cop for a VP during THIS TIME. They are playing with our morals. üòíüòíüòí
Can‚Äôt tell if my favorite authors are woefully ignorant about Biden‚Äôs record, or they‚Äôre being willfully obtuse. #TeamDemocrat #RahRahRah
Is it just me or is Biden a better representation of the Catholic faith than the church hierarchy that sweeps the abuse of children under the rug, then hypocritically call out others?
The Biden-Sanders platform won‚Äôt even legalize marijuana, and the only concession Biden made on Medicare was to lower the age from 65 to *60*. Stop pretending it‚Äôs a progressive campaign.
And every Biden supporter I‚Äôve talked to on here says his victory is in the bag because he‚Äôs high in the polls now ...see a pattern here?
There‚Äôs nothing more to say. Besides, it was Biden people who spent the last primary season invalidating Jewishness as if there wasn‚Äôt a genocide less than a century ago. If that‚Äôs the precedent you guys set don‚Äôt be surprised when other people gatekeep as well.
Could've picked a  brick and I'd still gladly vote Biden
There is no change with Biden lol. üòÇüòÇüòÇ he‚Äôs Neoliberal like all the rest, he won‚Äôt even budge on legalizing marijuana.
Yikes dude. Why can‚Äôt we have any good options??? Morally, voting for either Trump or Biden just does not sit well with me. I can‚Äôt stand this.
Kanye is on the ballot in a few states including Colorado and Ohio. Also, I don‚Äôt care whether or not Biden loses because it‚Äôs inconsequential, returning to the conditions before Trump will probably lead us to another Trump.
Good enough that Democrats cry we make them lose elections, hell, Biden supporters are afraid *Kanye* is gonna make them lose. üòÇ
Voting is a choice, plain and simple, and there are always more than two options. Convincing people to vote for you is the entire point of campaigning, and Biden can't win unless he convinces more people. But if you'd rather condescend rather than convince, I wish you luck.
You probably don‚Äôt have much place accusing people of wanting white saviors when you‚Äôre voting for whitebread Joe Biden lol. It‚Äôs also a lie to say she shifted her policy, she laughed at the prospect of opening more schools instead of more prisons.
I'm truly glad that it's an easy decision for you, but I hope there are some in the Biden camp who feel that it's important to convince people, because that's the entire point of campaigning. Those at the center and far left need to be convinced. Biden can't with without them.
The fact that you think Joe Biden wouldnt choose conservative SC justices shows that you know nothing about Joe Biden. Lol
Joe Biden is a much better representation of his faith than a member of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that have swept the abuse of children under the rug, dont ya think Bishop?
The plan is to get Biden elected then remove him for his incompetence and let Kamala become president.
Who has made the claim that this selection was based on skin color and gender?  This article is about Biden's process and what he communicated in that process, as well as Kamala Harris' accomplishments and how they complement Biden's approach.
Seems like an idea from someone who knows Joe Biden is incapable of speaking in public without making another racist gaff on national television. We want to hear from the potential leaders of the country, not the second in line that ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù as Joe claims.
Progressives! Biden/Harris isn't a defeat. The VP slot was never going to be a progressive. Now we know who we are working with. Now begins the work. Step 1: Defeat Trump. This is the baseline. Step 2: Contine to fight for progressive values. It's that simple.
Yeah! Biden/Harris 2020!
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate
Biden &amp; tariffs. What‚Äôs behind the fog? Thread from  ...
If you've follow me on the political side, then you know I wanted a Bernie Sanders Presidential run against Trump, not Biden.  That said. The Tumor needs to be removed from our nation! Biden/Harris is the ticket. Support it.  But come 12:01 p.m. on January 20th, my voice rises.
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
So, if Biden/ Harris wins, she can be the President of Vice.
If Trump does lose badly (knock on wood), I think they'll change, but a narrow Biden win or even a Trump win, it'll only get worse imo
I agree Trump is the easy choice Biden has been in office for over 40 years and Trump has done more and bigger better things in 4 years then hidden Biden has done his whole career

Joe Biden has been in politics for 50 years  Trump has been in politics for 4 years and you think Trump is more to blame then Biden? You need your head examined..
Joe Rogan is always on point! Hidden Joe Biden would be the worst president in history and would be the down fall of America. Only brain dead heroine junkies will vote for Joe Biden.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Maybe he thought she was talking about the other Joe Biden
Joe Biden has a racism problem
Joe Biden Democrats are dangerous for America.   Every American needs to see this.
Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden for racist policies. Now they're jointly embracing the radical left.

Just to be clear, Biden could have picked a literal sack if shit for VP and I'd still vote for him. This isn't about putting him in the white house. It's about getting 45 out. Biden is trash, too. We're hostages of the two party system.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
I was wondering what you thought!  My dear friend just said, "well Biden/Harris way better than Trump". I asked can she name me one policy Harris lead with in California that made our lives better.  We both came up with nothing.  zip.  zilch.
Even if there were no clip; like Joe Biden wasn't there?
You want Biden to win, but are you going to go vote ? Just checkin because people want things but don‚Äôt go get it or take action on it.
You've failed to explain how. He did what Biden would do.
The odds were that this was gonna play out like this, but you SCREAMED the other way and riled up a real lot of people. People that are refusing to vote for Biden/Harris and writing someone in or sitting it out. Just don‚Äôt anymore.
Where is it? In what was is Biden better than Trump?
Hopefully the Biden/Harris administration will honor him by finally fighting climate change.
Hey I did sign it but I was duped, shucks the signature gatherer said it was a petition for Minnie to be Biden‚Äôs running mate

It's going to be irritating to listen to these talking heads criticize Biden and Harris when they have Satan and Casper Milktoast that have killed 162,000 of our people due to their arrogance and ignorance.
Political purity does not exist. No. But politicians exist to represent the people. Not corporations, not donors, not political party - the people. The Biden-Harris ticket is the best ticket of the two, but we have to keep the pressure. Winning is just the beginning.
Democrats trying to vote for Joe Biden
Biden sad no popcorn appeared after pushing 'popcorn' button on microwave
Just remember your hard right segregationist needs our votes, but you said you don't need us. Keep that in mind when you whine about us not voting for Biden.
And there you have it. Biden's VP was chosen (not likely by him) with hopes to carry on the Democratic establishment‚Ä¶  they spell it out that they are waiting for Joe Biden to obviously step aside for dementia or worse. Not that it wasn't obvious before‚Ä¶
I am happy with Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris is VP Running Mate in the #2020Elections when Joe becomes President it's going to be history in the making where she will be the first black woman to be a Vice President this is truly revolutionary. #JoeBiden #KamalaHarrisMike Pence claims Kamala Harris and Joe Biden want to stop Americans eating meat
What personal benefits?  Was Hunter Biden overpaid?  Yeah, probably.  Did he get the job solely on his name?  Yeah, probably.  There is ZERO evidence of ANYTHING illegal.    Unlike, you know, pressuring an ambassador to drum business to your private golf club.
I'm not denying that by most standards Hunter Biden was overpaid.  I'd also argue that a surprisingly high number of executives and board folk are often overpaid, for their contacts.  I've, personally, overpaid to have some people, for their contacts.
Your mistaken it is obvious your thinking is not correct.  Biden and his half wit junkie son should be reflected in your thinking  you mention disgrace.  The whole Biden family is a dirty national disgrace.
Oh, you brought the hashtag and made up scandal into this.  You realize that "scandal" had nothing to do with Ukraine or Hunter Biden, right?    That scandal was about unmasking Trump's first NSA for illegally working with foreign countries.    Have a nice night.
Oh, okay.  Shes totally not making money off the millions diverted to Trump properties time and again.  Absolutely.  What you or what Hunter Biden makes from a private company is not really my business.  What happens with tax dollars undoubtedly is our business.
Hi!   You should really read up on Turkey.  Which is 20x the enemy of Ukraine.  Also, no Biden took money from Ukraine at all and is never even alleged to.
1) Its Burisma.   2) Pretty much every country said that prosecutor was crooked and people within his own office have said he wasn't investigating Biden or Burisma.    He came up with it after the fact to try and gain favor with Putin's friends, like Republicans.
You really think that Biden could be a leader???  What are you thinking.  He has dementia. He‚Äôs already shown that China would own him. Obama let Russia run all over him you think spineless Biden would do better??? The Ukraine‚Äôs still hurting from Obama‚Äôs gutless lack of action
I've kept up.  Hunter Biden did not have a government position, nor salary.   This entire thing is manufactured off nothing more than an allegation of cronyism, without the slightest crime attached to it
Anything is better than this moron. Awesome that you admit your mistake. VOTE BIDEN
And they're all making their money from your tax dollars while Hunter Biden was paid by a private company.    And they don't have skills.  Look at the general shape of this country for proof
I'm not saying Hunter Biden was the single most deserving person of a board seat at Burisma.  But, everything I've seen and read says he got hired hoping it would curry favor, by a private company.    Ivanka is working for the government and profiting from it.
Joe Biden, the elected official, got 85k/mo while in office?  I'd love to see this story.
That false equivalency thing is old &amp; tired. No, Biden is NOT within light years of Trump as far as being an active racist. Drop it.
Its typically largely on speaking fees and book deals.  There are some moral politicians (see Biden, Joe) that don't even hold stock while they're in public office.  Other politicians flock to their own resorts on the country dime constantly, raking in millions.
Dementia Biden?  Man.  Woman.  Person.  Camera.  TV.  Its never a good thing when doctors are surprised you pass a dementia test.  Let alone when you shout it from the rooftops.
So, Burisma hired Hunter Biden to pressure Joe Biden to pressure Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, earlier than he was otherwise going to be fired, to stop an investigation which almost assuredly did not exist.  That's a phenomenal waste of money, if true.
Please explain, in detail, what is criminal about overpaying someone for a job.   Also, its insane to me that the belief is they overpaid to get Biden to fire a prosecutor, who was absolutely going to be removed regardless.  The man was horribly corrupt. The world was on to him.
This is an awful and entirely corrupt man that parts of the right wing are clutching to, in hopes that they can make Joe Biden look half as corrupt as Donald Trump.  That's your honest goal.  Just make him look a little corrupt next to the Trump Taj Mahal of Graft and Corruption.
This was not a Biden thing or an Obama thing.  This was pretty much an all country's that aren't in Putin's back pocket thing.  But we're suddenly quite content in Putin's back pocket.  For some reason.  Can't figure that out.
But sure, I deeply care in comparison that Hunter Biden got a board seat based off of his name.  That assuredly never happens.
And I'm supposed to care that Joe Biden's son got a board to seat to help influence?!  Jesus, Ivanka Trump magically got 20+ Chinese trademarks.   While working in the damned White House.
There were literally so many better candidates to be the democratic nominee. Like Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, or Bernie Sanders. And we got stuck with fucking Biden
OMG, there is so much emotion and no logic in this election. How could Biden be better than Trump. Same feather and bird üê¶
Where have you been.  Half wit hunter was placed on that board of directors in China. He admits he got that position illegally by his ahole father.  Hunter is a half wit junkie  thrown out of the service for drug problems. The Biden family is scum
Comm on man.  Wake up Biden and Harris will bankrupt the country and turn us into a fourth rate country   You should be afraid of these aholes
I heard todAy joe China is flooding twitter and Facebook trying to insure trump does not get re elected. I hope they don‚Äôt take advantage of the demoshits mail in voting. They could send in millions of fake votes for Biden. It‚Äôs clear China does not want trump around
I know you can tell how much I hate demoshits . They have been trying to destroy the country for over 3 years. I need to know how could anyone vote for Biden and Harris. I really need to know.  Help!!!
As I said. I didn‚Äôt forget. He‚Äôs not on that list.  I confused and need an answer.  Why in the holy hell vote for Biden.  We wants to enormously raise our taxes.  Give amnesty to illegal immigrants who cares if they jumped in front of immigrants trying to get in the country legit
No, Biden is not a white supremacist, but trump is and so are his supporters. Trump is also a criminal. Guess you're ok with that...
She will bring at least 3 points to Biden's total.

Imagine voting for Biden ü§¢ü§¢
I think in this very difficult case ahead of us, voting vs not voting 1stly involves: the pro voter argues Trump is absolute hell 4 us, voting him out is necessary good; the anti-voter says my vote gives Biden a mandate to export our hell like Bush etc did, but to Russian sphere
Iris &amp; I went for a walk down our street. Neighbor was out with Cooper (bigger dog). She asked which house was ours. Said was one with Biden &amp; BLM signs. She said ‚ÄúOh good!‚Äù I am that white suburban woman that scares Trump. #BidenHarris2020

It‚Äôs FAR more about  than some wish to believe. Many were withholding contributions until we knew whether she‚Äôd be  pick. The credit cards only came out after the announcement. I would‚Äôve voted Biden, but not contributed otherwise. #BidenHarris2020
Must be Joe Biden‚Äôs burner
The wait was EXCRUCIATING‚ÄºÔ∏èIn the end, it was well worth it. #KHive #BidenHarris2020
Anna like I said the other day, if you knew me, you'd know that I'm very familiar with Biden's past. I've been speaking out publicly against him for more than a year, from the perspective of a rape victim with a similar story. He harassed one of my friends.  But Trump is worse.
You realize there are two options on the ballot, right? not voting won't collapse the system.  If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. You can pick the candidate who might be willing to listen, or you can jack off to your tweets about this shit.   I'm going w harm reduction.
Ok but trump and his crony republicans ARE THE MAIN reasons why we voting for Biden!
My wife agrees that Harris is a ho that slept her way to the top. So there's that. She also did not vote for Trump in 2016 but is going to this year because Biden/Harris is a horrible ticket.

Biden is not president.
Do you‚Äôre research. Biden Lowkey worse and sneaky, at least we know what we getting ourselves into with Orange. Not saying orange is good or anything but he straightforward.
I see Biden riding a bike. I see Trump with one foot in the grave. The criminal deep state right wing media is so full of shit. RESIST THE MADNESS before it's too late!!!
I *knew* people would begin to see Sen. Harris as those of us who vociferously supported her presidential bid saw her. We are fired up and ready to go! #KHive #BidenHarris2020
Based on trumps little performance right there, we should just give the presidency to Biden!!!
I think the demoshits are urinating in your kool aid.  How could you ever vote for Biden. He has already said he wants raise taxes by a big amount.  Take away your insurance. Give all illegal aliens free healthcare open borders. We‚Äôre sending a lot of ms-13 gang members. ?????
I liked Joe Biden when he didn‚Äôt talk so much as VP. üòÇ
In a primary you have to get MORE votes than your opponent.  That is how it works!! Hence Joe Biden is the opponent of Douchebag Donny/satan. That is your choice, if you are satisfied with the Douchebag  so be it. Not or voting for some else ALSO means you are satisfiied .
Meh...people have said worse, posted horrific pics, and don't give a rats ass about pedophiles...and now are flippin over this!?!? üôÑ
C'mon Candace you got better information than that, how true is it that she lock up 1500 black men but no conviction, unlike Biden. Tell the truth, that's all I'm asking.
Biden/Harris, cause I don't like morally bankrupt sociopaths cosplaying as a head of state.  Also, the last three years have been flat brutal.
I think Biden and Harris will win like Obama and Biden did: Americans live in a world of surface effects; race is a superficial idea; it prevents reasoning about causes; it thus breeds grave consequences; a friendly black/white image is the good face; it hides deep daggers
And you want Joe Biden to be elected so he can defund the police so this doesn‚Äôt happen??? And his VP takes all our guns away?
"You can't hold Democrats accountable if they know you'll vote for them no matter what."  Excuse me but did you even see Biden's 180¬∞ on Hyde?   Watch abortion orgs for a while. You might learn something.
Its either Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.. all that other sh*t is irrelevant distractions........ oh and I almost forgot F*CK kanye!
Among the 368 people who ran for President in the Democratic Primary, Kamala Harris was my first choice. So I am very happy with the choice for Veep from Biden.
sank his own battleship? Bro, Biden could have picked a ham sandwich and we'd still vote for him. TRUMP HAS GOT TO GO!
I know you're not implying that Biden has dementia, when trump is unable to 1. stop lying and 2. speak in a coherent manner.
joe fuckin biden , he ran wit obama . putting ye in office is putting trump back in office
Politics &amp; Religion is not a debate we should ever have on twitter. Y‚Äôall think because we black we should all agree &amp; that‚Äôs the dumbest sh*t in the world to me but I ain‚Äôt gone hold y‚Äôall f*ck Trump &amp; Biden but ima still vote

People dumb af you can not like Biden n still vote trump out
All you "I'm not voting for Biden because Kamala's a cop" people better not be registering your cars or putting money in your parking meters.   Where do you think that money goes? You know what they do with it?  You can engage in harm reduction and fight back simultaneously.
Great piece on why Kamala Harris is the right pick for VP
No she won‚Äôt. Bernard, you and Biden are both out of your minds
I‚Äôm Team Warren myself, but you won‚Äôt see me do anything but vote for Biden/Harris without hesitation.
No, I think you were right on target, when Wall Street loves your democratic VP candidate ...
People who won‚Äôt vote because they think Biden is sh*t annoy me so much, like Biden might not be great, but he is miles better than Trump.
It‚Äôs not just gonna be Biden, he will have progressives in his cabinet and will sign progressive laws .
LOL. One thing I don't want to see is Biden dancing. White guys cannot dance.
I get it. Voted for Bernie this time and in ‚Äò16. I‚Äôm disappointed, but I MUST vote against Trump. I‚Äôm worried about the environment and while I don‚Äôt think Biden is great on it, I think he‚Äôll listen more than Trump will. Health care and police reform will also fare better
I don't think Biden will win. I think people will vote angry about the riots (since no one can bully them in the voting place) and they hate the virus, the WHO, the doctors and the lockdown. It's 2016 all over again.
I'm not acknowledging Biden from now on btw. Only Harris.
Biden did succeed in destroying all chances of shifting the conditions of a ruling coalition toward leftist interests. The billionaires and trillionaires are not going to feel any bit of our pain and dread for a very long time. No. We will be cutting things off we love. Not them
Yep yep yep. Enthusiastically. Voting Biden/Harris.
I still plan to vote for Biden/Harris.
I to don't trust her politics, as a VP and president if Biden falls to sleep while on duty. We are going to be in trouble, just beware of her politics america this woman has to many emotional battles with herself,

See, I'll try to bring some actual facts to it.  The platform committee, of the Biden and Sanders campaigns, came up with the most progressive platform in American history.  Setting a clear path to M4A, moving the country forward in multiple ways.
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris for joining Joe Biden as his VP :D &lt;3
Like she wanted to be VP to Biden???? That people are still so desperate to dunk on her like this is so pathetic honestly

Biden could have picked a malaria carrying mosquito.....and I still would vote for him to get the #TrumpCrimeFamily out of office. #BidenHarris2020  #BidenHarris2020
A Biden/Harris ticket being a puppet of ANTIFA is a pretty hard sell.    Hell, the Trumps even donated to her campaigns.   But good work on your pre-made videos.  Outside being useless and looking poor, they're great.
IMO I believe by Joe Biden picking Kamela Harris he will now lose the election to Donald Trump. I like Senator Harris but what is she going to bring to the table, Biden was going to win California and get most of the African American vote anyhow. Harris might be better than Biden
Aw hell naw. Biden Benson even do I don‚Äôt want to
You meant to say "Biden" &amp; made a typo, I'm sure.

I honestly don't think Biden is that stupid and tone-deaf especially after saying it WOULD be a woman.
Bout to be salty asf when Biden picks a black woman vp and the world says he just picked her because she was black
Man if Biden pick Kamala as his VP, I‚Äôm movingüíÄ
Biden should pick a damn can of soup as his running mate for all I care
Wrong again. I'm a black SJW and like I said, we're on twitter!  I don't have to cue up ANYTHING! Go look at trumps tweets and then decide if attacking Biden is worth it....
Your right on Biden is very racist. If you take a little time and check his time in Congress you would be appalled. He honestly does not like black Americans.  He likes Latinos but not blacks.  Check it out for yourself. Demoshits  no conscience.  No shame.   No honor they suck
Like causing direct harm to Ohio voters, Ohio candidates, and Biden himself by doing even more to depress the votes he thinks he can count on.   Where's Cardi B? Where's LeBron James? Where's anyone on that stage speaking to the Black community? Kanye is.
Biden is 78 yrs old. What u mean he don't know enough about himself?
Not true. Demings and Bass are also not listed as speakers. I think people are making too much of this. Biden is not signaling his pick through the speaker list ‚Äî that would be stupid.
I imagine you must hate yourself then. Seems to me you are the epitome of stupidity and ignorance. But you vote Biden. After all he did say you aren't black if you don't.
FYI When Biden makes his VP pick I‚Äôm logging off Twitter for a month.
I‚Äôm for Biden/Harry
No, he can't run against Biden unless he switches parties. He's too far right for Democrats and too far left for today's GOP, which won't shift in his lifetime.
so neither biden nor trump
So what? Even Bideb knows 2 white men on a ticket at this time would be a disaster. And Pete is more unprepared to assume the job than ANY woman who has been mentioned. Biden's not that stupid, I hope.
He sounds like he's making a desperate last-ditch plea to Biden who has probably ruled out Warren. She'd be good, but she's not the be-all &amp; end-all &amp; with her age &amp; loss her seat, she's very unlikely to be his choice.

President Joe Biden will bring our country back from fascism
Yet after Election day, millions of votes for Biden will magically appear from the Mail and he'll win all the States that Hillary won and likely key battleground States as well. The Left is basically making it illegal to vote in person, this Election will be unwinnable for Trump.

It's a tribal marker though. One of Biden's assets is that there a lot more voters in the "middling academic record at State U" group than in the "meritocratic super-elite" group.
Joe Biden needs to have his own briefings with higher level experts as often as necessary. Show leadership and real scientific example.
Tell it to Biden.
Coach was funny, Biden‚Äôs an idiot.
Seriously, what are we going to do after the Left steals the Election? Will we have a second Revolutionary War? Will we allow Joe Biden to be sworn in as President? Will we allow our Nation to become a Socialist, Fascist, Nazi Nation? Will the Police and Military support us?
Hold on. Trump in Biden skin possibly
Still think Biden is a RAPIST and a RACIST?
bro he been lighting biden ass up he 2 tweets away from dropping a diss track
half of y‚Äôall talking abt how biden picked kamala are the same ones that say ‚Äúat least Biden isn‚Äôt Trump‚Äù when they‚Äôre the same person. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt get an opinion.
And the division between minorities and white people hasn‚Äôt been lessened, not when I still see y‚Äôall on this Trump or Biden train, openly. The legality of racist actions are being condemned more, that‚Äôs it.
OMG.., reminds me of Obama &amp; Biden üò•üôåüòÉüòÉüíûüíû
They always say pick someone worse than you to be Vice-President, that way people won't want to assassinate you. Well, Joe Biden picked somebody worse than himself, who actually makes him look competent, which is amazing. Harris is so bad that Biden look like a Smart choice. Wow.
..but we know have the #BuffoonBitch2020 ticket, with Biden being even more of a criminal than Hillary (he actually did what Trump was accused of and impeached for) and Harris was a corrupt attorney general. It's literally Law &amp; Order (Trump/Pence) vs Lawlessness (Biden/Harris)..
They're not airing The Five for this crap of Biden introducing the bitch, Harris, WTF? At least Fox News could keep interrupting it like the 'Fake News' does and fact-check every lie spoken by both. I thought that Hillary and whoever she ran with was the worst ticket in history..
damn Biden, I thought you had more common sense than that.  You picked the one that slammed you the most in the primary.  I guess being a senile fool has its rewards.  If you get elected, I bet you won‚Äôt make the 1st 100 days before they 25th amendment you, the puppet.
If you've follow me on the political side, then you know I wanted a Bernie Sanders Presidential run against Trump, not Biden.  That said. The Tumor needs to be removed from our nation! Biden/Harris is the ticket. Support it.  But come 12:01 p.m. on January 20th, my voice rises.
CPH congratulates Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. sister Kamala Harris on her selection as the VP running mate for Joe Biden! We know our NPHC sisters must be so proud. üíóüíö
Democrats trying to vote for Joe Biden
That was fast: thoughts about what Kamala Harris brings to the Dem ticket.
After what Biden said about black people, any black taking the job is in it for themselves, not the country. This ‚Äúselection‚Äù is a joke.
Sure, Biden picked a woman, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that his VP is an authoritarian abuser of power, and ‚Äúhoping‚Äù that she would use her power for good in the office of VP is a pipe dream. This is such a desperate grab for the youth vote it‚Äôs pathetic. #votegold
I am hyped and excited to be voting for Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket!!!!
So, 4 more years of basically the same no matter who you pick except this time you really think there's a difference because Biden has been pulling a Sony at 2013's E3
I'll say it right now, I was wrong, I really thought that Biden would pick Bernie Sanders as his VP, which would make sense to get all the Bernie Bros. Now it's the #BuffoonBitch2020 ticket. We'll see how the next few months go.
That's not the only thing to drop, as I can say that she the one who dropped down for Biden (take that however you want).
It'll be great as people start showing all the clips of Kamala Harris calling Joe Biden a racist and a rapist, then now telling everyone how great he is. Hypocritical hilarious. #BuffoonBitch2020
We already know the Vice-President Debate will be ridiculous, as Bitch Harris will claim racism or sexism against everything Pence says. Can't wait until Trump/Pence destroys Biden/Harris.
Can't be the only one who finds it funny that Joe Biden is being forced to select a Black Female Vice-President. The Party of Slavery is demanding their old White leader select a Black lady as his play thing. Obama was forced to pick Biden, now it's reversed. Just sorta funny.
Biden and son are liers.
Yes and no.  I'll vote for Biden regardless, but I'd love to see Tammy Duckworth get it.
I am ready in Ohio.., voting for Joe Biden and all blue in down ballot
DEMAND THE DEBATE COMMISSION to move the first Presidential debate to the FIRST week of Sept. Why are they covering for Joe Biden?? Pre Trump wants your input. #LeadRight
Covid will disappear if Biden and Communist takes the White House.
Gates and Biden can have mine. Gates is full of demons. Have a great day gorgeous and be safe üòòüíïüåπ
#LetHerSpeak is another Jill Stein.., how stupid can you be.., haven't you learn from 2016.  Another Republican and Russian candidate running to steal votes away from Joe Biden.  It's not gonna work this time!
I hope Joe Biden puts Hillary Clinton back into the State Department so she could fix the broken system.  Oh wouldn't that tee off Putin! lololol
I hope the video  #VoteOutRacism is put on TV ADS.., the nerve of Trump projecting his racism on Joe Biden!
Russia trying to undermine Biden in election, White House intelligence report says
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump  viaOh Bill....  you silly moron Biden supporter.  If you read my tweets in this thread you‚Äôd see I‚Äôm a vacation this week. Nothing but time to answer you trolls. #MAGA
I have faith in the American people not to give us a Biden presidency because of what he wants to do to this country. Trump will win and the silent majority will make it happen, I have hope that is what will happen Trump 2020
I can find 10 quotes in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament that justify murder and the wanton murdered of innocents . And by the way everyone applies to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as well. Trump to his credit is more honest about how he feels. No guile- honesty!
The MSMORONS are willing participants in the cover up of Biden‚Äôs dementia and never ask any questions in his TWO MINUTE press briefings. Joe Biden will never debate Trump. His dementia would be on full display and they will never let that happen
Mitt Romney didn‚Äôt hold daily press conferences in ‚Äò12, nor did Kerry in ‚Äò08, or Clinton in ‚Äò92. Biden does interviews all the time and by outlets Trump has YET to appear on since becoming President.
I will be voting Biden and I have voted Republican since I was 18
Rashida Talib already said that Biden is ‚Äúmoveable‚Äù.
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, your daughter just announced her support for Biden/Harris!üòÇüòÇ
Hmmm, Biden never apologize for his stunning praise filled eulogy for KKK Robert Byrd who by the way never apologized for his past KKK proud participation. But I guess as long as he is a Democrat he gets a pass
let‚Äôs see, Biden supports un restricted abortion. He supports Christians being forced to pay for abortions. He supports the abolition of private health insurance. Biden is a China syncophant. The Chinese government is aggressively eliminateting all religion including Christianity
Exactly what I‚Äôm saying!!!! Use your vote for where it counts!! On Biden! Maybe one day the United States will be more than just a two party system and parties such as the Green Party will finally have a chance on the national stage but that day is not today. Vote blue.
And they have Biden ahead in the polls. I call BULL SHIT.
Further Trump is a champion for the unborn. while abortion is rampant in this country there can be no real ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù. He is also a champion for religious liberty. You‚Äôve got your priorities screwed up buddy.There is a reason Biden‚Äôs bishop refused him communion
I already wear a mask willingly. My state requires it in public places. But, why wear one out mowing my lawn. If mandated to that extent I would flat refuse to wear one. KMA Baby Biden. Girly Guy.
Keep working towards the top...McCabe, Comey, Biden, &amp; Obama!
Soon as Biden named Kamala Harris as VP, a whole bunch of fake woke niggas got exposed.
No one will get my guns go somewhere joe Biden and your non us citizen that you picked for vice president who her parents own slaves wow your sick Trump 2020
Hey Buck, Biden told us he doesn‚Äôt care about our rights when he made this proclamation so why would he care about the constitution?
I don‚Äôt even know what a Biden flag looks like
I don‚Äôt even know what a Biden flag looks like
Biden is out foxing Trump into taking his bait and favoring ridiculous position opposed by most Americans. Brilliant.
We will in a few months when the headlines read: Biden/Harris carry Ohio; Trump defeated‚Äù
Hard left will do anything to get rid of our real leader. They fear this red repeat map more than God. God will decide leadership over Biden/Kamala anti God  stance.
Talking about Pelosi and Biden again?
Biden and Harris proved it doesn‚Äôt take a rally to deliver a big message
I‚Äôm sorry but we need to be realistic. I support what they stand for but the Green Party will never get close to the number of votes it needs to matter. What they will do is take away votes we may need for Biden/Harris. They may not be the one‚Äôs we want, but they‚Äôre what we need.
Is it true your daughter endorsed Biden/Harris, rudy?
Vote trump or you‚Äôll get Kamala Harris! If creepy Biden gets in, he‚Äôll last about a year before he resigns
Talked to a old friend today. He's s independent. Said he most likely will vote Biden. Says he doesn't mind information tweets but hates the negative attack tweets. i knew that was a problem.
I can't wait to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
We got cha . The ones that didn‚Äôt laugh are Biden supporters
Does Biden smoke cigars. Just asking
I get it. She‚Äôs not perfect and she made mistakes but if she and Biden win she can do some serious good in this country to make up for them
Just a reminder to everyone that a vote for anyone but Biden and Kamala is a vote for Trump and his campaign of hate
I preferred Harris to Biden for president and I think it‚Äôs possible Joe is pulling a Weekend At Bernies so I‚Äôll end up getting my wish..
Get her and Biden tf outta here
VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS HIGHER TAXES OPEN BORDERS NO MORE PRVT HEALTH INS GUN CONFISCATION DEFUNDED POLICE CHINA CONTROL OF AMERICA FREE HEALTH CARE 4 ILLEGALS ABORTION - ANY TIME INCLUDING INFANTICIDE
‚ÄúVote Biden-Harris:‚Äùopen boarders, defunding police, elimination of prv. health ins., needless wars, unrestricted abortions anytime anywhere any reason, taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal aliens, confiscation of legal firearms, Capitulation to China, higher taxes.
I pray not it will take biden 4 years or more to clean up trump mess he made of the us
You really need to get glasses biden is way ahead of you clown
Is he confusing Biden for McCain even though that was 2012...no wait that was 2008!
He might want to check first with Pope Francis who has served Joe Biden Communion and believes Joe is a good Catholic. Pope Francis understands the distinction between your faith as a Catholic and your duty to uphold the laws of the US.
Might want to check in with Pope Francis who not only believes Joe Biden is a good Catholic, but has also served him Communion.
So, no, M4A isn‚Äôt the most popular health reform plan out there. The one Biden is running on and put in the platform is.
Um, no, it was also this which unlike the Hill Poll tested both proposals and (like Silver noted in 2019) found Biden‚Äôs approach more popular than M4A. Read what people cite then comment next time:
Except you weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry, but what you just said isn‚Äôt factually accurate. Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedicare for the those who want/public option‚Äù polled better then M4A, every time.  That‚Äôs why he won.
I‚Äôm elated to see a Biden/Harris ticket!  Great choice Joe!
Biden is a Catholic.
Yeahhhhhhhh, Biden Harris 2020
You are right. That was misleading. I agree with what you tweeted. He is a Putin apologist. I didn't clarify that. I just made point that he is the type that make up lies about Biden. Sorry about that. At least that was my intent. I rather botched it up however.
Just want to advertise her that way.  Same as labeling Biden liberal leftist, which would be news to me.
Men have never been as genuinely gracious and publicly supportive of a former rival as every other woman Biden considered has already been to Harris.
picks  "Lipstick.on a pig"!....  "A step backwards for Women"...Joe Biden
If he were to win, Biden would be wise to populate his cabinet and advisors with many progressive-minded individuals, and I think he will. But the whole "Kamala is a cop!" thing is literally only an issue on red rose twitter. For the average American, she's a solid pick.
Tulsi Gabbard was a non factor. Her poll numbers went down because Biden and others went up. Gabbard has nothing to do with it.
You‚Äôve been trying that all summer on Biden, too. It doesn‚Äôt work. The GOP is going to lose and it richly deserves to.
Because they want to attract more GOP members to vote for Biden. Seriously, you can‚Äôt figure that out?
So, the opposite of Biden.
Kamala Harris scheduled to speak right before the Biden family and Joe Biden.....
If this were the current Trump campaign, not only would we know the pick. But we‚Äôd know who in the inner cycle was for it and who advised against and the shameless act of pandering the nominee did to flatter Trump.  Team Biden? Nothing.
It‚Äôs pretty incredible where a two-point change that still shows a double digit lead is presented as ‚Äútightening‚Äù of race. Trump‚Äôs biggest advantage is media will handicap Biden now to try to bring it back into a horse race.
You‚Äôre ignoring that polling shows Biden‚Äôs plan is even more popular when polled against M4A. People have only been pointing that out for over a year.
You will never hear a Democrat call for reducing taxes. Biden is openly running on raising them. A vote for Dementia Joe is a vote to raise your own taxes
Trump doesn‚Äôt have senior moments. Biden has senior eternities!
I‚Äôm always going to hope, but I feel as if it‚Äôs a bit on the edge of pandering.  I don‚Äôt want to think it but I have that feeling in my stomach , that woman‚Äôs intuition thing, gnawing at me that nothing will happen before the election.Then, what if Biden wins?  Bad news for us‚òπÔ∏è
Biden/Beatty has a nice rhythm to it.  has the Congresswoman been to DE recently?
So Biden will be in attendance. Great news. Doubt he will invite Putin.
NY Times reports that  is likely to announcing his running mate pick as early as tomorrow to Wednesday:
Some of y‚Äôall really sick in the head to think that 1. Kanye would make a good president. And 2. That Kanye even intends on becoming president. He is doing this to pull votes away from Biden!!! He has no intention of winning. He is in league with Trump.
show this to CNN reports in a president and ask if they covered this.
What fake CNN won't report.
Some folks claim that Harris was too aggressive in the debate with Biden. But think of a debate between her &amp; Pence. She will demolish his sanctimonious butt.

Yet another example of why  owes  a public apology for criticizing Biden for saying Trump night try to steal the election:
Today: - Did call time in the morning to fund GOTV - Manned the office this afternoon to start handing out Biden yards signs (got unsolicited $ from that)  - Communicated with campaigns on updates on GOTV plan. - Did some emergency light plumbing in HQ. (No really.)
Biden trolls Fox News on running mate pick while biking. I‚Äôm here for all this.
I am with TRUMP. That joe biden is nuts
I wonder if Biden is listening from his basement so he can plagiarize Trump ?
87 days until we vote &amp; Joe Biden becomes the President Elect of The United States of America
Whitmer is a popular governor in a state that voted for trump last time.  Ohio and Wisconsin are near bye.  Biden will win California no matter what happens.
A vote for Biden is a vote for the Squad
The Communist Party has endorsed Joe Biden
MSM can always find someone to predict what THEY want to happen. I have not seen one Biden sign. We are not electing a dementia patient for President
Joe Biden and others are prime examples why we need term limits. Their main concern becomes getting re-elected
Trump on preexisting conditions EO: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been done before....‚Äù Except as statutory law by Obama/Biden that Trump has sued to invalidate... repeatedly.
If you want to vote for an established racist (Biden) that‚Äôs your choice. Just like it‚Äôs my choice not to.
I'm still voting for Biden lol I didn't even think it was bad
Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by NovemberI am not a fan of the President. Also not a fan of Biden. Right now if it was Election Day and they were my two choices, I believe I would vote for Biden.
I hear Disney has been contracted to provide an animatronic Biden that will be going on the campaign trail since the real Biden isn't lucid enough to do so.

Earned everything huh?  Does Joe Biden not know how she got into ‚Äúpublic service‚Äù.  For that matter, he went out of his way to announce that he wasn‚Äôt worried about the person‚Äôs qualifications but instead he picked her solely based on her being a woman of color.  #lies #Marxists
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Too early to tell. Based on her primary though, I liked her better than Biden. Ask in October assuming we can actually vote.
Really Biden, really? You picked a woman with a record of throwing people in cages for non-violent crimes? Way to go.
TERRIFIC choice ‚Å¶ !‚Å¶ will be an AMAZING VP and ultimately President after your 8 years!
Biden picks Kamala Harris as his candidate for vice president
Sad to believe you think Joe Biden and the Democrats are the answer! So everything you said you believed in has been reversed since Trump won ! So you are no person to believe in !

Biden would fail
Biden will struggle because he is delusional.

Really wish we had you instead of Biden. Gonna vote for him, but only to defeat trump.It was during the Zer Obama/Biden administration that the Postal Service was nearly destroyed. The Dems have no one to blame but themselves for our bankrupt Postal Service. Check the Dates!
Biden must be pretty damn healthy.  It can‚Äôt be easy pumping that hand car.   Btw- this cartoon is so basic.  Lol
Your mistaken it is obvious your thinking is not correct.  Biden and his half wit junkie son should be reflected in your thinking  you mention disgrace.  The whole Biden family is a dirty national disgrace.
You really think that Biden could be a leader???  What are you thinking.  He has dementia. He‚Äôs already shown that China would own him. Obama let Russia run all over him you think spineless Biden would do better??? The Ukraine‚Äôs still hurting from Obama‚Äôs gutless lack of action
Weird to complain about Republicans and Independents who are helping elect Joe Biden. Democrats can‚Äôt move forward the way they wish until trump is gone, and if Republicans want to help with that, what‚Äôs the issue?  #CountryOverParty
Or to look Into and prosecute Biden. Obama and their swamp with the corruption and spying they did against the Trump campaign?

I heard todAy joe China is flooding twitter and Facebook trying to insure trump does not get re elected. I hope they don‚Äôt take advantage of the demoshits mail in voting. They could send in millions of fake votes for Biden. It‚Äôs clear China does not want trump around
I know you can tell how much I hate demoshits . They have been trying to destroy the country for over 3 years. I need to know how could anyone vote for Biden and Harris. I really need to know.  Help!!!
As I said. I didn‚Äôt forget. He‚Äôs not on that list.  I confused and need an answer.  Why in the holy hell vote for Biden.  We wants to enormously raise our taxes.  Give amnesty to illegal immigrants who cares if they jumped in front of immigrants trying to get in the country legit

The Trump and Biden campaigns are like competing airlines, both with just one flight to the same destination.  Biden's planes are just a little slower, and the attendants quietly spit in your drinks instead of directly in your mouth.

Any sense of self worth and dignity that Biden had just got thrown out the window when he picked (or the left picked) Harris. It goes to show you what Dems. are worth! Vote Trump 2020
Kamala Harris uses politics to the utmost of her advantage.  You might as well throw honesty and justice and the people out the window. She originally was anti Biden and look at her lie now!!!
Mr. President, all you have to do is tell America exactly how Biden is going to destroy it. It‚Äôs unbelievable what he wants to do to the people of this great country. Vote Trump 2020
Only a clown would vote for Joe Biden
Lmfao look how scared the dems are to put Biden on stage with trump
They are so dumb. They will still blindly vote for her &amp; Biden.
Let‚Äôs compare achievements. Trumps 3.5 years vs Biden‚Äôs 48.   Trump does what he says he‚Äôs going to do.  It‚Äôs very refreshing.
CNN complained Tucker mispronounced Jamal's on purpose.  Just saw a clip where Biden mispronounces it.  CNN =idiot
Cool. I'll follow both your advice here &amp; Biden's "vote for someone else" &amp; give my vote to  &amp;    #M4A, community cont'l over police (not abolition, but you said closest), a better Green New Deal, etc.  Good advice, Mohamad!
Biden and Harris will destroy the USA!!!
My outlook on Biden's odds before he slapped more than two consecutive months of demonstration in the face was grim to begin with.  Predicting a landslide in his favor after he went with the "top cop" candidate seems completely delusional to me.
I thought he was running against BidenüòÇüòÇ
If, by the grace of God, Joe Biden manages to remove Trump from office, he 100% needs to be primaried in 2024 if his cognition lasts that long.
Name a single voter who wasn‚Äôt backing Biden that was been persuaded by the announcement of Kamala. I dare you.  Conservative Dems are how Biden won the primary so they were already on board. This choice shows he doesn‚Äôt give two shits about progressives.

I think it‚Äôs obvious!  Not everyone is happy about Biden‚Äôs choice!!! lol Republicans are though!!!  The winner is Trump 2020
If it‚Äôs really true...then Kamala Harris is not African-American??? Why in the hell did Joe Biden choose her.  I thought some of my black friends wanted a black woman who is qualified to be VP???
She criticized Biden, then Tulsi and Biden ripped her over her track record as AG. Then she dropped out of the race. Then she endorses Biden, and 6 months later he ‚Äúchooses‚Äù her. Interesting way of doing things. Everyone seemed to be more happy for Maya Rudolph than Harris.
The economy and taxes.  Read the Biden plan.  Would kill small business and middle class.

Vote Biden and the American Dream and the English language will continue to go down the drain with the Democrats and Radical Left!
Looking forward to hearing Joe Biden find out who his VP will be.

No need to mandate everyone when not all areas are as hard hit. That's like giving everyone a band-aid when only one person has a cut. Plus, didn't we try that already by shutting down the whole country? Biden must have forgotten! Signs of things to come if he is elected.

Here are some popular but completely untrue stories circulating on social media this week, in order to help you separate facts from fiction:
I agree 100%. This is a must.  I fear that even if Biden wins trump, Barr and Putin will fix the election for trump to win.  We must elect a blue Senate.
He can kiss Biden
Someone picked his VP, I'm sincerely doubt it was Biden.
Biden couldn't find his ass with both hands and a flashlight.
No matter what you republicans TRY to pin on Biden I will Vote for him.  Trump is the biggest criminal and liar that ever walked on this earth.
I really do feel bad for you, Jeff. Your blind faith towards this President that makes him immune to criticism in your eyes would make our founding fathers weep. Trump has sold out American workers and Biden‚Äôs union backing is clear of that.
So sad this monster is loved by ~40% of the population. Biden/Harris (plus our society) have a lot of work ahead of us...
It's not about Biden It's not about Kamala It's not even about Trump It is about what normal people are experiencing in thier daily lives
Stop being a part of the problem. If you don‚Äôt vote, then it‚Äôs a vote for trump. Vote for Biden.
As much as I like Bernie I doubt it. Him, Warren and Biden are gonna be like 90 years old by then (assuming the world lasts that long)
Why not? Biden says whatever he wants and he's running for president
Karmala Harris was born in Oakland, California. Therefore, as a natural born citizen, she meets the Constitution's requirements to serve as vice president or president. There is no question about this.

Only Racist Joe is allowed to apologize and have every lemming accept it right? He says racist crap every time he opens his mouth ...remember "Poor kids are just as bright as white kids" Joe Biden ... I will say this no team has jailed more black men than #BidenHarris2020
"Poor Kids are Just as Bright as White kids" Joe Biden
Powerful question. Why are Harris and Biden running, almost literally, away from any media questions ? Why are they frightened? Will they finally agree to take questions from the media if they can get the questions in advance? If they can have time to prepare the answers for Joe?
I told Trump.. You can‚Äôt find a Biden sign with a search warrant..üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
You just said what Joe Biden is going to do....
If it's from Russia , no way or if it's brought to market without proper testing, no way. If it's a legitimate vaccine with  good efficacy and safety , absolutely  That being said, a vaccine brought to market this year would probably be 1 or 2. I'll wait until Biden is President
Wow, I wasn't thinking.  I just changed mine, thanks for the wake up call!
I BET SHE WOULD
She was my old big boss during 08 Iowa Caucus, I was touting her to everyone about how good, disciplined and organized she is. Hiring her is def one of Biden‚Äôs best decisions he ever made
I‚Äôve seen less Trump signs than 2016, but very few Biden signs in SW Ohio.
Bernie's not running for dog catcher, so we really don't need to listen to him.  Where is Biden-Harris?  That's who needs to step to the podium and be accountable.
Dumb ass. But people will complain this is cancel culture. Naw it's the consequences of your actions
That's because Joe Biden can't put two sentences together they gave him a script to call Kamala Harris what a joke and they want him to run our country no freaking way
When we escape..  As Biden/Harris destroy his campaign, it's terrifying to consider what more he might be capable of when things get truly desperate. We're still 158 days from inauguration.

This police union things quite a bit deeper than anticipated, pretty impressive. Things about to heat up since Biden finally mumbled a VP.
Joe Biden can shoot someone in the leg, send the military to shoot protestors, send people to prison for weed with Kamala sending parents to prison for truancy while becoming an authoritarian dictator and I'd still vote for Joe Biden over Cheeto. Either vote Joe or you're Hitler.
O wow I only get a choice to non follow Biden and Harris I support them well u got my answer
The Democrats have to resort to mail-in ballots that can be forged by a number people all over the country to get Biden elected. If everything is on the up and up, Biden knows he will lose. Be an American and vote in person if possible.
As a retired carrier, I ask ALL postal employees to support and vote for Joe Biden. Joe has always supported the postal employees. Joe has ALWAYS had the support of the Firefighters Union. He is one of us. Can you HONESTLY say that about Trump???????????? No you can't!!
At least Biden can use one hand to drink a cup of water.
I‚Äôm actually sorry man, I saw her face and it doesn‚Äôt look good. I‚Äôm just so used to blatant political posts and took it as one. My bad, just skimming at it.both parties have garbage candidates. Biden is just as corrupt
No, what I‚Äôm saying is that with a 7-2 far right Supreme Court, $15 minimum wage is impossible for a generation.  Even if Biden doesn‚Äôt get it done, you can primary him from the left in 2024 and get it done then.
As a retired letter carrier, I ask my brothers and sisters to fully support the Biden/ Harris team. For YEARS we have heard that the GOP wanted to privatise the PO. That time has arrived. Your jobs REALLY do depend on removing Trump from office. Vote Dem on Nov 3rd.
Of course you endorse Biden. Your jobs depend on him winning. The Clown in Chief is destroying the USPS. The Postmaster General isn't helping with his ridiculous demands regarding routes, sorting and delivery. As a customer, I want my mail. I like &amp; support my carrier.
Recent loss of liberal followers and biden supporters. Good. :)
One domino has been teetered. It may very well fall, but will it start a chain reaction that blows up the Biden/Obummer Criminality?  all talk no action has promised so much and delivered, nothing!  deserves better from the  #WillJusticeCome?
This is hilarious. Biden hasn‚Äôt answered any questions on the national stage unless they are scripted before hand.
it‚Äôs defund the police not elect the police
if so, then your incrementalist approach is pre-k level. tweaks around the edges and leaving people in desperation while acting like the mission was accomplished is what led to the rise of trump, and if biden wins and passes no progressive reform, will give us someone worse

You mean the deal that‚Äôs not even a deal? The one Israel said yesterday wasn‚Äôt really a peace deal. So he lies about it being an actual deal, then lies some more about Biden trying to take credit for a deal that isn‚Äôt even real. Sums up trump &amp; the republicans pretty well.
Trump can't win a free and fair elections, he's trying to sabotage the postal system. Laura Ingraham is a pathological liar. Obama never tried to discourage Joe Biden from running. We are currently in pandemic to save lives mail-in voting the only way out. Cheaters, scary tactics
Either Trump or Biden is going to win, and I know Trump/Republicans will change things:  - make abortion illegal - outlaw gay marriage - make it harder to vote - deny climate science  Biden might not move your causes forward as much as you like, but Trump will set you back 30 yrs
Joe Biden doesn't even know what day of the week it is. The only science he knows about is when he urinates his Depends.
biden is gonna win california? just cancel the election, he‚Äôs already won.
The capitalist state and ALL its functions (elections, policy, laws) are tools of the ruling class! The PEOPLE have NO power, no influence! Biden is accountable to his constituents and his constituents are not the people but the ruling class of which he is a direct tool!

That‚Äôs a funny/good analogy because Biden looks like a bad version of Bobby barker.
Biden has literally been moved left since the primaries ended. Which never happens, nominees usually tack to the center after they get the nomination. Joe asked Bernie to help him set up working groups to draft new plans, which include the $2 trillion climate one.

So Trump is better?   I think we need ranked choice voting in America, but until we have it we‚Äôre stuck with the fact that either Biden or Trump will be President next January.   I think there‚Äôs more chance to move Joe to the left than there is to move Trump

This race will be between Trump and Biden. A third party vote will be lost in this election. We need every Blue vote who is interested in saving this country, our constitution, and our democracy. This is a fight that we must win for our country.
I agree with her 100%.  Biden, Harris and DNC are deeply flawed and must be taken to task if elected. But current situation is pre-apocalyptic fascist hellscape. Got to stop the bleeding first and foremost.
A no vote for Biden is not a proxy vote for Trump. A no vote for Trump is not a proxy vote for Biden. Our vote has to be earned.  Neither candidate has offered any policies to better the lives specifically for #ADOS.  The "1st black women" VP candidate doesn't count for anything.
Earlier this year, Kamala Harris said she believes Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. Now, with much alacrity, she has accepted the offer to be his presidential running mate lol. Harris is a textbook careerist.

Indeed, but they‚Äôre missing the point.  Those who oppose masks are just fine with sacrificing any potentially saved lives to their cultural identity/world view/comfort zone.  That‚Äôs what Biden/Harris need to be calling out directly.
Hilarious to me that he uses disgusting Biden quotes bc we could write a mf book on his racist, misogynistic, sexist statements. For fun we will add a whole chapter on lying. Ppl talk about all the good he‚Äôs done in his term but he doesn‚Äôt ever highlight that for some reason.....

I totally agree Richard it was time for a businessman to run that Oval Office called the people's house he turned our economy around like never before cut those regulations that Obama and Biden put on our businesses brought back thousands of manufacturing job that Obama lost

Of course they answer yes, especially today when contrary opinion gets you assaulted. Now ask them if they favor a national mask mandate that results in fines as Biden will direct. Big difference.
Getting desperate for money? When you have a Biden ad I change the channel. You know that what he did on video is an actual crime? Extortion maybe?  You all have lost the confidence of lots of patriots. Ever since you put Paul Ryan on the board, you suck

Ah, don‚Äôt be.  No way he wins unless it‚Äôs by fraud, the guy hasn‚Äôt managed more than a few hundred live viewers in person or online.  Sure you‚Äôll have a villiage idiot, have for generations, but media is still lying.   Biden/Harris live vs Trump live
AOC liked her tweet. I‚Äôm a Dem, but have concerns about the future of the party as it relates to Israel. I feel pretty good about Biden, though.
President Donald Trump is rejecting former Vice President Joe Biden‚Äôs call for a national mask mandate to combat the coronavirus. What do you think?

Since you posted the video of Joe Biden saying racist things, I'm surprised you don't support him. He also doesn't believe black lives matter so it seems like you would be a fan of his. Am I missing something?
The twist, Kamala transitioned and actually was Cornpop until the 80s. Coming to exact his/her revenge for gettin tossed from the pool.  Genius since we all know Biden never sees 2021 if ‚Äúelected‚Äù.
I think all USPS workers and their union should know for certain who is committed to destroy their work place. Vote Biden, save your jobs. Pass it on to friends and familIt‚Äôs.
Lol, Biden not gonna win. So it doesn't really matter either way.
I heard Biden picked Kamala bc she is more Indian than Pocahontas
I am all for the President being re-elected. As for the people, they need to question themselves, is their hate for the President enough to put this country down in the toilet by electing Biden. This country will crash if Biden is elected.
yeah, i don't get it.   i can not comprehend how they have the time and energy to complain about biden/harris when the alternative is trump/pence.
Also, right now we really need you leading white Jesus-following women in voting for Biden Harris. Let‚Äôs do it!
This is just a sneak peek of what Joe Biden will do to y'all if you vote for him.....
Now that the Democratic President-Vice President ticket is set, and Vice President Biden with Senator Harris are going to be the Democratic ticket on the November ballot, I figured now is a good time to remind everyone that, you might not have gotten your way or your choice ‚Ä¶
All the candidates who dropped out before super Tuesday are "owed" gifts by Biden too. Likely cabinet positions.
My cousin is somehow trying to make a point that me being upset about mark kozelek being a rapist is hypocritical of me being mad that joe biden is a rapist
Well Trump thinks pedophiles should get the death penalty, so that means he feels the same way about Biden and many of the Democrats...and some Republicans, celebrities, and aliens.
Obviously I'm voting for Biden but that doesn't stop this from making me laugh out loud by myself on the couch

My cousin-in-law's parents hate Trump but won't vote for Biden because they draw a hard line with their 'pro-life' stance. This is selfishness and an inability to understand context at it's peak, IMO. Writing in a third-party vote ensures we live in this hell another 4 years.
I would personally love to see Hillary have a place in the Biden administration.
Try real news. I know since Catherine Herridge left you don't have any real investigative journalists, but talking about polls is useless since they've been so wrong. How about fact-checking what Biden and Harris say? They're lying on a daily basis.ü§¶
Buck, 3 months at least is what he said.  What else is in about 3 months.  Just a ploy to use in his campaign.   He will continue to say Trump does not care.  JoKe Biden is at it again!
I wonder if Democrats realize, if Biden wins, the surge to remove him will begin almost from the day he takes office, and it will come from within his own party. BLM and Progressives are not going to let a dottering old white guy stand between Harris and history.
i understand that and i respect that, but i‚Äôm not sure bieden will actually end fascist policies created under trump. children are literally still in cages yet i don‚Äôt think biden will change that practice. wealth is accumulated through exploitation.

Biden is right on this

Biden and Gabbard.  Even though Biden hadn't formally announced his campaign, it was so obvious that he was gonna run and win the primary. And I vowed to not vote for him.
i literally cannot even begin to fathom not voting for Biden &amp; Harris.   what part of 2016 are y‚Äôall trying to repeat???  of course i don‚Äôt actually fucking want Biden, but he‚Äôs what we got and for fucks sake you better believe he has my vote and he should have yours too.
Or tell her markets have a pretty good tendency to price these things in-not always, but usually. Right now the market is doing well BECAUSE Biden is leading. The big money sees the damage Trump is doing now.

That‚Äôs great, Florida can use her straight  ballot a whole lot more than NY. Thank you for supporting Biden/Harris
This is how totalitarianism is coming to the United States. Comply or else be jailed and fined.
Biden mispronounces Kamala‚Äôs name the same as Tucker. Nothing to see here.
So that they can dutifully parrot in the media every word Biden and Harris speak.
Why Biden though? It‚Äôs strange that in a time where we need police reform the only candidate the left has is a guy who wants to increase police budgets, has a cop as his VP and was a life long republican until he joined the Obama campaign.
And why Kushner?  Because Kushner believes to his core that a Black billionaire will steal the Black vote fron Biden, because everyone admires billionaires. No one ever questions Kushner‚Äôs judgement, even though Kushner has only succeeded in being a son-in-law.
Biden‚Äôs controllers won‚Äôt even let him do interviews or talk to national media unless it‚Äôs all scripted. It‚Äôs going to be a #TrumpLandslideVictory2020
So you're going to vote for biden? You'll be seeing that a lot if you vote for him
Meh...I don't know. If she'll support a terrorist group and vote for Biden she's obviously not too big on standards.

Exactly. You‚Äôre spot on. I worry about how his supporters might take it if he claims voter fraud.   In the end, I guess, he won‚Äôt be president anymore and therefore will have zero power. If he tries to stay, Biden can call the army to get him out. It‚Äôs still almost frightening.

Honestly, Joe Biden would love to be the person who ‚Äúsaves‚Äù the post office by selling off significant chunks of it.
People say this shit like they actually know what the hell theyre talking about. The reality is a Biden Administration is similarly corrupt to Trump, and in many ways more effective at deploying their corruption. All under the guise of ‚Äùthe people‚Äôs party‚Äù.
The problem with the right and left, is they don‚Äôt question authority. They don‚Äôt fact check. They say ‚Äúthis sounds good, must be true‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrump/Biden said it, it‚Äôs true‚Äù etc

1. It is 100% about our rights and always will be. That is what makes America the greatest country in the world.   2. Wearing a mask outside is absolutely pointless (just social distance)   3. Joe Biden is a fucking pedophile
Congress adjourns without negotiating a stimulus bill and Biden is making headlines calling for a national mask mandate that should have been instated in at least early March. Despicable
Had enough yet, America? THIS is what your future looks like with  Biden/Harris - complete government control of YOUR life. Reject this nonsense. Vote Trump 2020.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
Am I correct in understanding that you believe that voting for Biden will "move us to the right", as opposed to letting Trump have another 4 years?  Bernie has as much chance of getting the blue endorsement as my socks do. You've every right to be mad, but rational is good too.
kamala sucks. trump sucks. biden sucks. what are we suppose to do? voting third party is an option, but also not the best choice to get trump out of office. ü•µ
The chance that Trump gets prosecuted for anything he's done as POTUS is negligible. Best we'll get is a toothless report about his violations in 2-3 years, then the Biden/Harris admin. will decline to prosecute "in the interest of moving forward together as a nation". Bet on it.
People seriously think that Kagan and Sotomayer are the same type of SCOTUS judge as Kavanaugh and Gorsuch and Biden would really not appoint anyone better. I don‚Äôt like Biden that much but sometimes I wonder what worlds these people live in.

No, I misunderstood and was reading news about Dump. I tend to agree with you. I think Biden should push for a national holiday. Yes, not easy, but it‚Äôs the fight that counts.

Fuck Ryan! He trashed Liz the moment she endorsed Biden he can kick rocks
I have nothing but disgust for the contingent that seems to want Biden/Harris to lose in order to prove that the electorate chose the wrong people.
We are definitely in a battle for our souls. Joe Biden wants to sell our souls to the evil demons that want to harvest our life force energy. It's all part of their New World Order plan. This is all a Spiritual Warfare, one in which we will win by aligning with the Divine Source
This person assumes there will be any papers to place somewhere. I suspect during the time of the Election until Joe Biden enters office, they'll be busy shredding everything, laws be damned.
This is why I don't believe many Rs will switch  over this election and vote Biden. They stick together like flies on you know what. It isn't in their DNA to vote Dem.
1. Noone is impeaching Trump or attempting to and you know it. 2. Trump wouldn‚Äôt be trying to literally defund the post office if he didn‚Äôt think the votes would be for Biden.

Biden/Harris of course because I love the United States of America.
In summation, stop shilling for Biden, if he‚Äôs a good candidate he can win on his own without you forcing your politics down other people‚Äôs throat and shaming people for holding firm to their values because your‚Äôs are surface level and based in group think.
Yep! Believe that and you believe that Biden isn't a racist because he's always talking about his one black friend!
But if Trump wins we‚Äôre 30 years away from any progressive legislation that‚Äôs signed into law being affirmed by the Supreme Court  Which means we go from Biden‚Äôs $2 trillion climate plan mostly written by  to no climate legislation until 2050 even if AOC is president
Is it suppression? Or is it the fact that young Black voters aren't enthusiastic about the candidates?   #ADOS
So what? Biden isn't owed our votes.
When are people going to realize that you don‚Äôt owe Joe Biden your support. Yes, Trump bad, I know. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shill for his campaign and shame people into voting for him. The fact is it‚Äôs incumbent on Biden to win over voters with his platform and policy.
This is why I‚Äôm voting for Biden. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs perfect. But damn he‚Äôs better than Trump and unfortunately we don‚Äôt have any other viable options. But our country needs help out of this pandemic.
Yes, I registered green after voting for Hillary in the last presidential election left me feeling bad about my decision and will likely vote green this time around. Definitely not voting for Biden or trump.
VOTE:   Who would you vote for if the election was today? 1. Trump/Pence 2. Biden/Harris

I hate to break it to you but Republicans love Trump. They absolutely are not voting for Biden, and pushing away independents and leftists to try and please right-wingers is a guaranteed way to lose.
Biden hasn't done anything for this country except get he and his family rich. Plus he can't lead so who will really be commander in chief
She was picked for Biden because you can‚Äôt rape the willing.
Are you kidding me?  Biden makes racist comments all the time. Biden spoke at a kkk funeral.  He called a CNN host a junkie.   He changes the way he speaks when he talks to person‚Äôs of color.
Selecting Kamala "Top Cop" Harris after months of nationwide protests is merely the latest in a clear trend of Biden's decisions. It is a clear message to young people like me who find the status quo intolerable.  That message is "I neither need nor want your vote."
Well...looks like Biden has a lock on Rhode Island.   Update your electoral maps accordingly.
Finally we can look forward to Science Based Info on where we are at....#Biden_Harris2020 go Joe
Looking at how Biden has underperformed with younger voters both white &amp; POC as compared to that group‚Äôs disapproval of Trump picking Harris might help consolidate those voters
Food for thought:  Year after next Joe Biden will be 80.  His female running mate is first generation US citizen.  Dangerous deficiency in this choice.  "Jumping on the bandwagon" is not always wise for the bigger picture.  Please think of the next generation Americans &amp; past one

Biden's staff REALLY doesn't want him to be potus if they approved THIS tweet....HOLY CRAP what a PERVERT! Should have Harris send this one out.
It's amazing that the simple act of being human is all you need to throw contrast between Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence. Policy,leadership and integrity are important, but I now realize how much I crave real people back in the WH, not the narcissistic megalomanic currently there.
What is a "pool spray"? Will you be in a Biden/Harris splash zone? Personally, I wouldn't want them spraying me with anything, regardless of the COVID situation
Biden will fund the post office at least, which is a Constitutionally guaranteed right.  I doubt you have enough brain cells to comprehend that though, just believe what Fox News tells you and continue sucking the boot of a corrupt businessman who doesn't give a shi% about you.
Just now watching the Harris speech. One of the things that really struck me was her talking about how she relates to/interacts with others. Her kids, God children, her husband, Beau Biden. All we've gotten for the last 3.5 years is Trump talking only about himself.
Tears of sorrow, Trump is already doing those things, if Biden makes it into the WH are economy is doomed, stock market will crash, jobs loss, zombie apocalypse
I thought Joe Biden was a racist?

I'm pretty sure a Biden administration will work to undo a lot of Trump's damage, but also pardon him, in the unlikely event that he's actually charged with anything.  No US president has ever been punished for their crimes, and Biden isn't going to buck that tradition.

Harris has said that she would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement that sends aid to Iran, a regime that routinely calls for Israel‚Äôs destruction. This keeps her aligned with Biden, who was part of the Obama administration that brokered  the 2015  handout agreement.
Point the obvious.  Wag that dog. Joe Biden is being forced by the machine - sad. A follower 77 years of his life.  Leading is just not in his nature.  He won't last the first term.  Ppl (blinded by the media) is supplanting system with Kamala as president (not Joe).

I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden either. He will either die or be exposed soon imo. I think we need to be wary of them both honestly.
After much consideration Joe Biden has decided Kamala Harris smells like the right choice.  Ha ha
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Like what Joe socialism Medicare for all take away our guns open borders and the list goes on and on no thanks Joe and Kamala Harris I will stick with Trump he's making America great unlike Biden and Obama who was destroying our country depleting our military losing Manufacturing
Who is "we" lol. I mean Biden told me to fuck off
Americans are waking up to the reality that the battle for souls IS actually what is happening. ‚ÄúOne nation under God‚Äù and our Constitution vs the anti-God Marxist/socialist/communist doctrine the Biden/Harris ticket has been manipulated into espousing. #WakeUpAmerica #MAGA2020
Wait, wait: how is voting for Biden "aiding and abetting pedophilia and human trafficking"? I am not a particular fan of Biden, but US presidential elections (or selections) are often about holding one's nose and voting for the lesser of 2 evils. Is Trump divisiveness the choice?
üòÇüòÇüòÇTrump brought it to new heights that Obama and Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù strangle hold couldn‚Äôt and then the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù came during an election year......how convenient
A lot of stories today, How can Biden forgive the evil things Headboard Harris said about him during the primaries?  Truth is Sniffin Joe doesn't remember the primaries.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs gonna take Biden &amp; Harris 4 years to clean up the shit show Trump &amp; the GOP have created. You need to do some serious soul searching (if you still have one) about your priorities. Corporations didn‚Äôt need a bailout. The American people did. You fucked up!!
If anyone can manage to lose despite having victory handed to him on a silver platter, it's Joe Biden.

Those are not false claims against Biden.
Please stop using my religion, and the POPE, to push your partisan agenda. Biden is a disgrace as a Catholic.
Biden told people to vote for Trump. That should have been disqualifying. "Vote for someone else if you don't like it" is exactly what I intend to do.
It has been so nice getting to know more about Joe Biden than just as Robin to Obama‚Äôs Batman. Hearing of his faith as a Catholic, his life tragedy as a young father and watching him pick his fiercest critic as a running mate has moved me fully into a supporter. #BidenHarris2020

Wouldn‚Äôt Joe Biden make more sense... oh wait, ya better let Kamala lol
Lets see. Joe Biden has Kamala Harris and you have Mike "ass kisser" Pence. No brainer Diaper Don.
Biden and Harris ticket is what traditional America is going to look from now till the end of time. You better be on board or you will be left out. America future is one people with different colors living together as one family. Unity is strength.
This is all quite fascinating, but the simple fact is that when you wake up the morning after...or the week after...or the month after the election either Biden or Trump will be president. Can you seriously tell me you'd prefer it be Trump? All the rest is just window dressing.
‚ÄúDemocrats are counting on the cult of non-personality to end the flamboyant Trump era.‚Äù
These people are fucking nuts, I'm done with this reach. They have no examples to back this and they all  are repeating it. Imagine if Warren or Sanders was the nominee. Biden &amp; Harris are  moderate. I cant wait until the GOP dies and then they'll see what liberal really means.
It will make you dizzy!!! Here we go with the fake Russia crap again, it‚Äôs exhausting!
please for the love of god vote biden. he‚Äôs a horrible choice, but your third party vote will not win, i can promise you that. vote so that people like this are not in the majority
Biden‚Äôs right arm is jacked. Sure sign of some neurological disorder.
If biden gets in this country will be so broke with new green deal , free everything for anyone that steps across our border with job losses galore. Just like with obammy. And higher taxes to pay for all the poor peoples problems

Yes. Yes it is. We need to demand better from all levels of government. That's why Biden-Harris is a sick joke. They would both be Republicans just a decade ago. And the Democrats are just as complicit as the Republicans in this slide to right-wing reactionary garbage.

We've lived in an Oligarchy for 30 years. Corporations run the show. Its why biden is the candidate and not Bernie. Assuming theyre not the same is just surface thinking. They'd like you to believe there's a difference, its how they keep us revolting against the insanely wealthy.
Biden and Harris will go down in history as having gotten us out of a pandemic, saved our democracy, revived the economy and got everyone health care. What‚Äôs wrong with that?
Anyone have the video of Joe Biden arguing to cut social security several times?
No. Under Trump we only have 4 more years before we have the chance to force a progressive candidate. With Biden and Harris that process is delayed by 4 to 16 years.
You picked the right person Mr. Biden.  I support you 100%.
Democracy does not happen in USA. Those saying it is a conspiracy that Biden did not win the primary election, are fooling themselves. This happened over and over again, across the nation.  would be our nominee if we had real democracy in our nation.
It‚Äôs time we as Americans and our country vote out Trump and the rest of the GOP, we have an 4 years of hard times under Don the Con! Please everyone in our great nation to vote this year and vote for Biden as our next president

You're are spreading false propaganda because you know Biden is unfit for the president of the United States of America. The hysteria the media is doing is crazy
Between Biden not taking questions and a kind of third grader social hierarchy mentality on the part of the Veep, I have a sinking feeling about the election.
Trump's America. Not Biden's...
Hilariously naive. Much like Andrew Sorkin predicting Bernie will get a fucking CABINET position in the Biden administration. Democrats will scuttle their party before they give a bone to their progressive wing.  It's financiers all the way down.

Now is not the time to have endorsed Biden.
so genuine question i don't want to vote biden or trump so what would a good alternative to that be  bc otherwise we're starting a revolution right
The lesson is you just have to outlive and outlast everyone who dismissed you. I‚Äôm no Biden stan but I gotta respect that he has kept coming back for more for like FIFTY YEARS.

Dems have a racist past. Don't think there's many racists left in the Dem party at this point though, Biden being one of them. Southern Dems still left the party and joined the GOP in large numbers, these are just facts

Yes. He's 45 and started dissing on Dems. I told him I'm a proud Dem and am donating his inheritance to Biden. He got quiet lol. We actually ended the conversation just fine. I'll keep working on him. Told him to stop watching Fox News
Maybe prospective voters for  Biden should do some history research on the CDAN blog regarding Harris and her past doings in California!

Excellent as always. I wonder how Karrine Jean Pierre -Who was constantly pleading with candidates and DNC to involve progressives and non white voters before she joined Biden - Is doing? This is abominable in the face of the impact of COVID19 and police brutality on BIPOC
As much as I'm a Ye fan I still gotta be open minded here. Ye has openly admitted that he's fine with taking votes away from Biden. He's also been in talks with Jared Kushner so he hasn't really distanced himself from the Trumps that much. Ye knows what he's doing unfortunately

perspective, it can still be important, if only a little. That's what we mean when we say "harm reduction". Will voting for Joe Biden fix all the problems of America? Fuck no. But at least he isn't a fascist that blackbags protesters and wants to illegalize abortion
You literally can. You could be a campaign staffer to Biden and then live a secret double life of organizing an active coup against the US by night. Also, voting is only meaningless from a marxist perspective, but from a feminist perspective, a racial perspective, an antifa
Doesn‚Äôt matter, Biden is on deck... and will hit the grand slam.
Biden has never said to defund the police

No candidate is running for president on that platform, so let‚Äôs not confuse who is saying what. Biden and Harris are sure as hell not about to defund police at all.
When u vote for Biden/Harris take a look at their heritage &amp; also what they‚Äôve done 4 this country as career politicians. Then look  Trump. Two sides of the same coin on most cases except...  he hasn‚Äôt been a career politician. Good luck with your hate
Anyone who isn't an insane leftist already knows what's going to happen. Biden won't last his first term if elected. This was the only way harris was ever going to become president.

Criminal intent has clearly been established. Federal prosecution won't happen until after President Biden fires Bill Barr, though. State AGs, the courts, and the GOP Senate need to step up in the meantime.

Your tweet in response to Kamala Harris being chosen as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate was just classless.  And you set it so that your constituents, like myself, couldn‚Äôt respond.  I wish I could expect more from you and the rest of the Republican Party - but obviously can‚Äôt.
Which Biden policy do you like the best  Which Trump policy do you dislike the most
NO. Trump allowed investigation of Bannon for lying to Congress. This is not the Mueller Investigation. For 2 yrs there have been nothing but phony baloney go after Biden's son for doing what every R. Pres's kids have done forever. W &amp; rest of Bushes made livings being directors.
BIDEN AND HARRIS  BEING ELECTED  IS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE THE USA FROM BANKRUPTCY
Portland here ... zero Biden stickers none. Infact I saw my first big Trump flag on a truck lol! The best is if you get outside the city then you really see conservative state. It‚Äôs wild that the city runs the state. That said zero excitement here!
I hope RNC have ppl in each country verifying these incoming votes! If USPS is endorsing Biden I will find another way to mail things !

'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia  via
No.  The more he's out being President, the more Biden looks diminished.  Hiding in the basement is not going to create a lot of enthusiasm for potential dem voters. Trump out will energize his base and bring some others along too

Ordered Biden-Harris signs yesterday direct from  (Make your $ count as a contribution, do not buy from for-profit sellers. It's easy to get confused.)
Joe Biden is childish Gambino confirmed.
I agree we shouldn't want them to, but when Biden becomes Commander in Chief January 20, 2021, and the Army should back him if he has to forcibly remove Trump from White House.

A wonderful leader. If Fowler cant se√® how Biden lacks all leadership ability he is blind.
You and our narcissist-in-chief are the only ones who think there are "hundreds of cops" in that photo. There are a few dozen at most. Just like the rest of us, some cops are going to support Trump and some are going to support Biden. Hysterical overreactions are not helpful.
I'm ready to write BIDEN/HARRIS on a post-it note and drop it in a shoebox if that's what it takes.  This is a blatant Trump tactic to control us.  If we dont do something, welcome to life in Trumplandia!
That‚Äôs not for Biden for sure..
Heck, Trump gave press conferences daily for about a month. Let‚Äôs see if Biden can pull up his big boy pants and put sentences together on a regular basis
colonial one, because there is NO THIRD OPTION HERE, we will have either Trump or Biden, and you can help choose which one and still fight against colonialism
That article is basically all just saying "Joe Biden won't fix colonialism, so don't vote for him", but there are more reasons than just indigenous rights to consider. No leftist has claimed that Biden will fix colonialism. There's even a part of the article that basically says
Oh, we will know. And come January 20, 2021, we will have a new President of the United States, Joseph Biden. We will have the first Vice President who is a woman, a strong intelligent woman of color, Kamala Harris. You and your family will finally be gone.
I thought you were talking about Biden for a second
Valid but the question for you is whether you trust them to vote for Biden.
alternatively; please please please ask Joe Biden about WAP cause that might be the funniest shit i've ever seen
That's your right to vote for a liberal nut job! But, don't ever say you were a Trump supporter  because that's a total lie! Voting for Biden is a one way ticket to socialism and a ruined economy! #MAGA2020
Biden, keeping it respectfully witty!   #BidenHarris2020Landslide
It‚Äôs actually Harris/Biden 2020
Biden is a vaccine
Foolish liberal! China brought COVID! Tax breaks for majority of Americans! Prior to pandemic (perpetrated by liberals), Lowest unemployment for women, Hispanics and African Americans! Moved U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Ended the Biden Crime Bill, Freedom!! #MAGA2020
Now do the Postal union and teachers union endorsing Biden

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
President Joe Biden.... Yep, feels pretty damn good.
The pic is all ready to be photoshopped, eliminating Biden completely. Whoof, and he‚Äôs gone
I don‚Äôt care if I hear another word from Biden between now and election day. Trump is trying to manipulate the election by crippling the USPS. There‚Äôs nothing Biden could do to make himself less fit for office than Trump.
Still waiting for Biden to agree to debate our president on national stage .
The biggest pain in Biden‚Äôs ass
Did the MSM tell the story right or did they down play this historic peace agreement.  Muslim scholar slams media, Biden for reaction to Trump's 'epic and historic' Israel-UAE peace deal  #FoxNews
Russia and Saudi Arabia want Donald Trump to have a second term, especially Putin. So, your fake propaganda that Biden is China's man is about as fake as a three-dollar bill. Even your MAGA caps are made in China! So are all Ivanka's fashion accessories.
Perhaps it was the magnitude of the moment. Biden delivered a presentation that left no question that he will be elected POTUS November 3rd.
You‚Äôre not going to be Biden‚Äôs Secretary or State, Pierre.
Why didn‚Äôt Joe Biden mandate bill paying by US mail when he was in office?  Isn't that what is Really killing the USPS?

Upset by Trump appointment of 9 of 11 board members?  blame Obama/Biden...
Biden / Harris need to fight not just smile
China prefers Joe Biden because they realize you are an 'Unstable Clown".
And the evidence that Trump is spying on Biden is what exactly?
Ladies,stop glorifying the choice and talk about her and Joe's plan to win the office from President Donald Trump. People are in need talk about what her and Joe Biden plan to bring them out of this pandemic. Just put on a mask isn't the answer.
If you pay attention, a lot of immediate Biden/Harris supporters are the ones who jumped on the BLM bandwagon with those black squares...it‚Äôs ther performatisim that gets me.
What about foreign powers (perhaps even operating within the US) generating and mailing fraudulent ballots? I mean, there are admittedly Chinese nationals in the US who want Biden elected
if the teams that play have no outbreaks it will benefit Trump. If they do have outbreaks and have to cancel games the teams that sit out made the right decision and that benefits Biden.
Read This: "I Disagree With Biden a Lot. But He‚Äôs Not a Cruel Bigot. And Right Now, That‚Äôs Enough. "  Republicans who disagree with Trump or find him too distasteful are voting for Biden.  Progressives are as well.  #ONEV1  #BidenHarris2020
IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT Your husband only wished for this when he advised Sarah Palin
Tell me why you're voting for Trump. Leave Joe Biden out of it. Go ahead, I dare you.
Biden‚Äôs handlers are the cowards. I bet if you asked him, he‚Äôd say he‚Äôs ready for interviews to stutter and fumbled around for.
Constantly repeating this doesn't make it so.  China wants you in office because you're easier to 'deal' with than Joe Biden.  You'll do anything for a buck, and don't care who you do it with.
He doesn‚Äôt need to hold a press conference.  He can spend the next 80 days on a deserted island and still win.  Trump continues to self destruct so Biden just needs to stay out of the way.  No need to detract focus from this traitorous president.  Trump is done.
The biggest difference is that many more Americans are onto your con job now, and can fully appreciate the difference between you, a Reality TV joke, and Joe Biden, a man of integrity.   #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
President Biden is better
That‚Äôs why I ditched FB. Way too many Trumpers posting on my page. Not to mention you can‚Äôt say anything bad about Biden either.
Crack kills layoff the stuff, get educated there was already plans in place but Obama/Biden left the USA in such bad shape and relied on China for manufacturing that when it came time to replenish we the USA had limited manufacturing resources.  people need to wake up..TRUMP 2020
Biden spent 8 years in the White House and then he went homeüòÇ  Same thing Reagon did. Same thing Bush did.  Same thing Clinton did.  Same thing Bush.  Same thing Obama did.   You seem to have a deep rooted hate for Biden and that appears to have influenced your perception of VP
Their anger is so all consuming. If Biden is truly winning, why r they so angry?
The CCP wants Biden, but the Chinese people want a heroic leader like our favorite president, Donald Trump.  They need a hero, too!
And Biden? Haha
BUT do you agree with her/Biden policies
I wonder if Biden knows he ‚Äúpicked‚Äù KHarris? There is a very obvious reason he has been hiding in his basement for months now. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon man!!‚Äù
By the way both Biden and Harris kept wiping something off their nostrils at their big press conference Thursday, I thought they'd just come from the bathroom of a swinging nightclub in the 1980s. Somebody ought to drug test them both.
Health agenda based on evidence around the globe linking reduction in animal protein to reduced rates of cancer.   She‚Äôs more fantastic than I thought.
These crooks know they don't have a chance with Biden. The Dems will pull anything out of the hat to try and win this election. Sick.
Why would Biden need an assessment?
now there‚Äôs a woman who doesn‚Äôt know what she is talking about , if biden harris get in no way you will retire in 4 years,, dems never produce anything  except they stick together,now that you dont have a butt anymore,, wake up and smell. like uncle joe does and whats her name cc
Biden and strength, dont go together,,cc
Hunter Biden got one too, don‚Äôt forget. Remember when q showed all the pics of tall office buildings in Chyna? And the parking lots? Was this what he was pointing to?
Guess what Donnie... 70 percent of your people are forming their own republicans for Biden. There are literally no dems that have turned toward you.  There are millions and counting turning toward dems.  It‚Äôs a vote against you and my kids have said
yes he is guilty, Biden us on top of the list followed by Obama.and 6 others; Obama told Sleepy to unmask General Flynn, no way sleepy could do that on his own. the group tried to take down a dully elected president.  that‚Äôs TREASON at the highest level. cc
Thanks again AJ!üíô
Yeah liar.  People need the 600 and actually now they need 1000 boost. 600 is no longer enough. Thank God Biden Harris will provide.  All we have to do is hang until October 22
Exactly.  It‚Äôs political fodder and sadly some won‚Äôt know better.  This week hunger will be massive in our country.  Trump will never be able to fix it now.  He let 50 million people starve and children.  He let millions get sick and he wants kids to get sick too.  Biden/Harris
Biden will step down for medical reasons, he's not even fit to run, we're voting for Harris now.
also!!!! Watch Biden‚Äôs last interview with the ‚Äúare you a junkie‚Äù comment... he‚Äôs not in his basement in Connecticut or wherever he says he is... it‚Äôs a green screen. Look closely at the bookshelf in the back and tell me I‚Äôm wrong. Somethings up
Aren't they replacing the mailboxes? You have to be a complete moron to think a democratic state would be doing this in favor of Trump, which means mst likely they're doing this as a scare tactic knowing the media will spread Biden's propaganda
Just keeps getting worse and worse. Liberals say they won't vote for Biden/Harris, and more than a few say they're voting for Trump, and now this. Argh
He will likely not be allowed to cover the WH until Biden takes over.
I'll wait for the Biden-Harris vaccine.
There was a lot going on then. It wasn't just a baseball score. Nafta, Lieberman, Nafta, Clinton, Nafta, the economy, Nafta. The Democrats lose when they run to the center. Biden should be pulling ahead of Trump in swing states, he doesn't have a lot of time to waste.
Have you ever listen to ‚Äúorange man speak‚Äù. No one on the right has any standing to evaluate Biden after they defend tRump. #BidenHarris2020
Not like he needs to. Biden's donors would never let him prosecute Trump.
Uh, replace "Trump"with Biden and you'll have an accurate statement!
Literally everything that isn't voting for Biden is apparently a vote for Trump. A bad afternoon the day after eating massive quantities of high-fiber cereal is a vote for Trump.
Ah yes, the place where all the money is in leftist discourse... Supportimg Joe Biden
Dude's brain would probably explode if I offered up valid criticisms proving Obama and Biden suck shit too. Partisanship is a mental disorder
right before Biden! Way to go #YangGang!! We have such a strong voice when we all unite for the same goal!
Who else feels President Biden should give Dan Rather the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his advocacy of our democratic institutions?  Thanks Dan!
Theirs two options. Trump or Biden. I didn't pick them. The electoral process did. If it was up to me Bernie would be the candidate. But that didn't happen. So unless you got a third party viable candidate or another solution?
Same deal as Biden (money laundering etc.) plus had a kid or step kid (and friend) on board Burisma type company.
That right there was my biggest concern. We already have a grudge holding, egomaniac in office on the right. I wouldn‚Äôt want the same on the left. That being said, I‚Äôm still voting for Biden/Harris because we need a placeholder for 2024. Plus, Sen Maj Leader Warren sounds nice üíú
It IS voting your values to vote Dem in general elections even if you hate Biden/some other Dem  First past the post means forming coalitions pre election. FIRST PAST THE POST MEANS FORMING COALITIONS PRE ELECTION   Sorry just sick of having this argument w other millennials üò•
Thank you badd, I needed this tonight, a family member of ours told us they are moving away to Texas if Biden wins and wants us to move with them...üò≥ they are huge trump supporters.
‚ÄúLavey's public pronouncements show not only how far the president's stock has fallen in Oregon with what used to be the mainstream of his party, but that a longtime leader in that party feels safe talking about his dissatisfaction‚Äù
I think we will start seeing more of our older citizens go Biden/Harris. Make sure that they are able to cast their ballot. Drive them to the ballot drop or to the pills if they can‚Äôt drive themselves. #SeniorsForBiden
Remember a fellow by the name of Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi? Locked up in a Mexican prison and Obama and Biden did nothing. Remember that?  is pretty much solely responsible for getting him home. Where was  ? I don't forget Montel and am forever grateful.
And yeah. We get it. Biden is basically Trump packaged a bit differently. We just hoped people would see how awful Trump is. They don't. Democrats are even going to vote for him. So that's fun.
So does this fall under the domain of the FEC that can't produce a quorum or the DOJ that works for Trump?  This is starting to feel like a bad movie and we're watching it in slow motion. It seems nobody can help us before Jan. 2021 - assuming Biden wins in November.
Kamala blew (no pun intended) a great opportunity here to spin a political yarn about why she and Biden are getting along like champs, by repeatedly bludgeoning Colbert in front of his followers with the word ‚Äúdebate.‚Äù Even my most far-left Oregon acquaintances can‚Äôt stand her.
Check out Oregon.. they do vote by mail and we have idiots like Biden letting antifa burn the city every night for 80 nights... this is what you get for vote by mail.. it‚Äôs true... I live here.. it‚Äôs true.
I do this time if I want to avoid a fascist. If you really think Biden is a fascist, you don't know what it is. Read the Anatomy of Fascism. Describes Trump to a tee. Bidens not perfect but he's not a literal fascist. I'm still identifying as a socialist.
Oh yeah. Never heard a peep about how much the republicans disapproved of Obama. Totally silent. üôÑ  Also yes if he does win please get him out of office, I hate Biden too
The past? Hasn't Bernie gotten cosessions for the left from Biden now? Not everything, but he has made headway. The left and socialism in general is the most popular it's ever been in this country because people like Bernie and AOC have participated in the system.
Riding the blue tsunami with  Biden
Yeah we do. But your missing the forest for the trees. This is not the election to die on the hill of principles. There is way to much at stake. I wouldn't be voting for Biden if I didn't think our county depended on it.
#Biden needs to stop taking credit for the #PeaceDeal!!!!!

And that's why he's saying this shit. He wants Americans to think he's the one that gave us money. He thinks it will get him votes. He will say, "trump gave you a second check. Biden will turn suburbia into a ghetto" or some equivalent of that. In essence, trying to buy votes.
Biden is an idiot... we all know that.. yet Democrats want to push him in America... another Democrat trick...
So, the National Association of Letter Carriers union endorses Joe Biden.  Watch  and the  will try to break that union.  Mark my words.
Trump is trying to take social security away from Americans. VP Biden will protect Social Security and he will protect us from trump too!! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
...I thought the manipulation of the media was straightforward. It is using Hannity's words against Trump instead of Biden. Did people think this was actually Sean Hannity criticizing his cash cow?
I'm all for being critical of the candidate. I just don't think not voting for them does what you think it does. Politicians and their party's don't cater to people who don't vote. The only response to a Biden loss would be the DNC going farther right because those people vote.
Pepsi soda company mocked Fox News personality Tucker Carlson on Friday evening.  Carlson is a Prick!  Did I pronounce that right?  Carlson flipped out after a guest attempted 2 teach him how 2 pronounce. Kamala Harris's name, who's running 4 VP on Biden‚Äôs ticket.
Liberals, as you can see here and in actual polls across the country, have decided, because it's Biden and Kamala, that they're either voting 3rd Party or straight up for Trump. So....yup. Four more years of Trump. Which sucks but reality sometimes sucks. Or always does.
don‚Äôt let the people that have supported you down.  There is so much corruption and I wouldn‚Äôt leave my kids alone with Biden.  Please be the change!
Thought the document leak said it was only 2 trips? Either way, fuck Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Trump, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell, etc.
You must be falling down drunk. That would describe Trump not Biden. Biden listens to science. Trump listens to that tumor he calls a gut.

Because it takes money to do things? The fuck are you talking about. There's no way you could say that Trump will be better for climate change than Biden. Those are our only two choices.
If Trump is against it Biden will love it.  Trump really needs to hammer away on child porn, trafficking, voter fraud, stomping on kittens, police corruption and brutality and education and employment for blacks.  How could Biden-Harris oppose any of that?
Honestly fuck Kamala Harris for her transphobia and for being a cop but I‚Äôll vote for her and Biden bc it‚Äôs way better than 4 more years of Trump
But you are empowered in this democracy. We will demand the new Biden administration take this issue on.
I take Joe Biden's advice about as seriously as a Gas-X commercial.
There are legitimate differences. But people seem to think that Kennedy is some sort of neolib shill that is an enemy to all of our policy priorities. He's not! he's a consponsor of the GND (whilst Markey authored it) and also supports M4A.   literally left of Biden/Harris

I personally could not be more thrilled to have Biden/Harris leading the way out of this horrific morass of Covid/Trump, both of which are destroying our very future.  Hopeful for a more just society with integrated neighborhoods and equal opportunity for all!
So America is really just going to give  and  a pass on their blatant threat against  Saying that "Something is going to happen to Biden within two months and he won't even be on the ballot"? Not even a blip on the radar?
It's not about Biden now. It's about changing the current administration.
Right. Problem is you have had 4 years and you haven‚Äôt done shit. So I don‚Äôt think you got in you. We are looking for real leadership and Biden/Harris is the ticket!!!!!
As I voted Hillary when I was fairly certain she'd win (after voting for Bernie in the primaries), and it seems foolish to vote for anyone but Biden this year
Man I struggle to heck with this. I really don't like Biden and voting for Hawkins seems like an acceptable alternative, esp in a "blue state", but with them actively trying to suppress the vote &amp; going all in against Oregon it makes me greatly reconsider that, esp after Hillary
I'd sit through a Don Trump Jr book reading to vote for Biden
God forbid, if Trump looses. I believe Biden will not finish his first term and Kamala Harris will be President. It won‚Äôt be Camelot! It will be Kamaless!
That's something to add to the mix. Will his COVID-19 malice kill sufficient numbers of minorities &amp; will he do sufficient damage to the postal service between now and November to make up for a flood of unexpected Biden votes from USPS &amp; associated families?
I believe Biden will not finish his first term and Kamala Harris will be President.  It won‚Äôt be Camelot! It will be Kamaless!
Biden wins. America is done.
Will it be retroactive to Obama and Biden's terms? There are some Ukrainian prosecutors that want to ask some questions.

You are very mixed up then.  If Biden were elected Kamala will be president and "dear dictator".
Kushner has done great job being interviewed. No way Biden could be the lead. If he is people are really not very smart.
That's why I'm glad Biden didn't pick Rice.  It would've been a disaster. Whew!
A clue? Other than ‚Äòpray the gay away‚Äô Pence is basically a bobbing head. Harris gonna spank that ass just like Biden is going to spank trumps ass.
in the democrat's attempts to be more appealing to righties and moderates theyve become republicans. we can vote republican or right wing. i was truly like "srsly yall we gotta vote biden just so trump stops being actively destructive" but now i see it. fuck everything

Curious. Who was your first choice as a candidate?  (Assume it‚Äôs not Biden)
Yep... vote by mail is a Democrat trick... just look at Portland Oregon where they rigged the election for years with mail in  voting and now we have idiots just like Biden making bad decisions for us.
Don't bother watching this with the sound on...I'll quickly recap it for you...Rudy: Biden blah, blah, blah, blah...I married my cousin. Now just watch it, but look at Trump's face instead...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ it's hilarious!!

All these crimes are still chargeable when Biden takes office.

Yay!  Another union getting behind President Not Donald Trump!!!  Wahoo!  #SettleForBiden
Please, educate me on the other option we have. I wish Biden wasn't that nom but that's how it turned out. Are you really going to say "yeah this was because of Biden" when Trump's gestapo is beating you up?
Yeah, here's my theory:  Biden is a clone, and his thoughts are disorganized memories and suggestions, which make his life, waking or asleep, equally similar to a constant chaotic dream. He is basically talking in his sleep.  (Love you James)
I think Joe couldn‚Äôt care less. He knows that Biden/Kameltoe are just placeholders.
Trump doesn't want vote by mail. Why do you think he would use that to his advantage? Y'all got it twisted.   And why didn't Obama-Biden fix the USPS problems during their 8 years? They had plenty of time.
Some landmark legislation here!
No one is saying any of that. None of this stuff plus the things you said in your other tweet will improve under Trump though. Fuck maybe some of them wont under Biden but they have a better chance. Point is we are falling towards fascism and voting Biden is currently the way out
Just one of many and they will all lead back to Obama and Biden for treason!!!  A win for America
Biden is not competent to be president.
When Biden get elected? NEVER ü§£
actually the big difference is that Biden wouldn't be the first female so he won't be a good excuse to say all women presidents to be bad because she was dumb.
If you think Biden and Harris are far left than you don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúleft‚Äù is.
So good to see you again! üíôüíôüíô
He is trolling, but he also unironically supports Biden so it's legit shit he believes (the ones he denied replies on) and then the one he did put replies one is on something he doesn't actually believe.
Trump‚Äôs War On Mail Backfires As Postal Workers Union Endorses Biden -
I can't get over how angry with injustice I have felt for so long over the racist, misogynistic false propaganda campaign against Kamala Harris, and how Joe Biden said, "Fuck that," and chose her as his VP anyway. The man is going to have an amazing legacy.

Good for you, Troy!  See you soon! üíïüíïüíïüòò
Get this... Trump said Harris was "disrespectful" to Biden in the debates - even more disrespectful than "Pocahontas".  I don't remember Kamala Harris using insults like "Pocahontas" toward anyone.  Trump's blatant hypocrisy is almost evil genius.
He's like an incompetent, walking, talking, slurring campaign ad FOR Biden/Harris.
I didn't vote for him the first time either genius. No it's not shaming people to point out the reality that it's either Biden or Trump. Conservatives what nothing more than for you to not vote or vote third party.
Donald needs to fire the postmaster general he appointed and told to slow the mail. Donald says he is confident he will beat Biden. Why make it so people can‚Äôt vote??
The largest impact will be voting Biden/Harris. Everyone uniting on that one will get Trump out of office and give you 4 years to look at third party or 4-8 years to repair the GOP from Trumpism.
Let's talk about ENTHUSIASM. Kamala Harris has helped Joe Biden and the Dems raise $46,000,000 in donations in less than 72 hours. THAT'S REAL ENTHUSIASM!

I am voting for Biden- Harris because I want our President and his/her Administration to have integrity and to be honest. I want our Nation to work with world partners on global issues instead of against them. I want a team that works for all citizens instead of their base.

That‚Äôs so ironic you would say that! Trump is waaaaaayyy right of Bush, Bush, &amp; Reagan! Biden is a moderate, no hard left turn at all! Besides, Trump is incredibly corrupt.
No, it isn't, because no one willing to vote third party in a swing state is gonna vote for a Democrat like Gore, Clinton, or Biden.  If no third party candidate ran, people just wouldn't vote.  The problem is Democrats nominate terrible candidates, not that a third party exists.
Fair criticism.  Biden has plenty of blood on his hands.  I despise the DNC.  But you get more flies with honey than vinegar.  Work to educate instead of alienate.  Not everyone has moved as far left as some of us yet, but they‚Äôll get there!
"They (Obama &amp; Biden) were illegally spying on my campaign. And it's a very grave crime. It's the biggest political crime in the history of our country.‚Äù  Yup. This again. He's said it a lot. And it's false. Categorically false.

I don't want another 4 years of Trump. So I'm voting for Biden. I'm not going to shame people for not voting for him. But those who say they can't have to also acknowledge that they are only helping reelect Trump. That's only going to push our country farther right

You're right.  Why are the words "RAPIST" and "SEXUAL PREDATOR" not in every tweet and every broadcast?  If it was Biden - you KNOW what the GOP would do....

He didn't "support" it. He WROTE it. And he says a lot of shit he doesn't mean. His "regret" is meaningless. Biden has stood against every piece of progressive legislation in his entire career from bussing to Roe v Wade to gay marriage and now universal healthcare.
Joe Biden has always been racist.
Then start telling people to hand deliver those ballots to an election office.  Once Biden becomes president the USPS will get the help it needs. And your post master may go to jail for interfering with a federal election.  Truth Matters

It is stupid. Joe Biden didn‚Äôt pick Kamala based on her qualifications. The world is getting dumber daily. Equality isn‚Äôt bias, it‚Äôs opportunity. But here we are.

Does this person care that I am voting for Biden?  Nah. How does this unify Democrats?

Nice try! If Biden were my candidate I‚Äôd cringe at him attempting a debate too. Besides you trying to tell us your VP is who you will actually be voting for?

Not that many are on the fence, but EVERYONE‚Äôs parents needs to know this distinction between Trump &amp; the GOP vs Biden &amp; the Dems.  False attack ads on Biden cutting SS benefits (not true) are targeted at senior citizens.  With a HUGE deficit, SS benefits are in the crosshairs.
Probably not. If Biden gets elected they‚Äôll be the next president.

The never-Trump Ohio GOP was all put in place by Kasich. They will do everything they can to deliver the election to Biden.   We‚Äôve got to primary them ALL!
This is exactly why we can't get comfortable with or arrogant about Biden winning. It is still a very real possibility that Trump could take this election.
Mark you 'read' like a scorned Republican who's regretting that he put Trump in office.  If you're looking to argue against Biden... You're on the wrong side of the aisle.  There's no guarantee that any president is going to live through a four-year term. That's irrelevant.
Let's start here and not waste Biden's time.
Then what? Are you serious?  You think that Biden being put office is going to make no difference other than getting Trump out?
I don't give a fuck if Biden is wearing a bib and drooling. He's getting my vote.
Nervous about Biden? I don‚Äôt blame you a bit. Trump will bury him.

Definitely. The rest of the government is taking for granted that Biden is going to win, so instead of holding him accountable, they're just letting the clock run. Under these circumstances, even a numpty like him would have no trouble stealing an election.

You're right. Let's vote green or some horseshit so Trump can further destroy the EPA even further and make sure the country is under water by 2035. No post office either. Let's do that because Biden isn't woke enough and how him and Trump are "BASICALLY THE SAME!"

He shut down the country. He paid us to stay home. He cut off traveling in and out of our country. The health experts said he was overreacting. Biden called him xenophobic. What else did you want him to do?
What is sad about Joe Biden and showing his fakeness as I have to do is look at his record and then the Black people they Cantel to Joe Biden and it‚Äôs sad they should have more pride than that I wouldn‚Äôt want someone represent me that‚Äôs a racist
VP is a different role. Biden barely made a blip in 08 when running but he generated lots of good will as the VP choice. Kamala made rookie mistakes as a presidential candidate. Embraced some Bernie politicies. Now she compliments the ticket.

Harris is at her best on television prosecuting the case against Trump or against bad actors in his administration. That's her superpower. Every good politician has strengths and other areas where they can improve. She also shares Biden's empathy, another big plus.
I just hope it becomes a little more clear before the election this is something that‚Äôs very important because I feel Joe Biden and Obama were really behind all this and Hillary they should have to pay
It‚Äôs actually mind boggling out of 400 million people in the US we get stuck with Biden and trump

Because Joe Biden doesn't lie every time he is asked a question about anything you lie every time about everything
Yeah....lets see if that happens from the liberal media. How about the left biased reporters out there prove us all wrong and ask Biden (and Harris) tough questions with tough follow ups ?? Do that and the viewing public will give you credit
There's something going on alright! Biden has more intelligence, organization, truth, and love of his nation than any two bit chronic #RhetoricalLiar who hates America.

If Biden wins, does he get the AG role?
I promise he isn‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt it bother you that you will vote for a guy who said he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúraise his children in a racial jungle‚Äù? Or if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù like he is an owner? Or how he said the black community isn‚Äôt diverse in thought?
A vote for Biden is just a vote for Trump to lose his job and the hope that the next monster is slightly better and that is a huge wager that has no way of guaranteeing anything.
If people were honest and said that Biden/Harris is a bad dice roll they ate just hoping will be less bad, I might have more respect for them. Harm reduction is bs, and even choosing your enemy, while more honest than most cases is also pretty unsubstantive.

Neither...Biden is corrupt senile thief, and double-minded Trump betrayed us all by codifying DACA and agreeing to vote for traitor Mike Lee'd Indian giveaway that ruins the chances for native born American to get work.
Biden is doing hard work...  By that I mean, little to the point the media has to speak for him. How can you unequivocally choose to be highly selective in politics? I get it you hate Trump, that's something you are free to do. But this tweet is rather disingenuous is it not?

That is another man's own personal belief.  It's honoring his wife, but also honoring the reporter, and respecting her.  But let's also say Dr. Jill Biden did say Joe will be at the debates, so did she sign the permission slip?

The other staff picks are just former Biden staffers, so it doesn't say a whole lot about who he may pick. However, this pick makes me think he's definitely going to choose a WoC and more than likely, it's going to be Senator Harris. I'd prefer Demings or Duckworth, but none of
I would hate to see people do this. I truly don't care who Biden picks. He has work with them for 4 years. We don't. I will still vote for Biden.
It's going to be very interesting to see the reaction of the #KHive if Biden chooses anyone other than Senator Harris, especially if it's Rep. Demings, Rep. Bass, or Senator Duckworth.
This is why I get annoyed when people go after Biden for not being mentally there. Yet this fool keeps getting passes for this mess. If you still don't think Biden will be a better President than this guy then you are a lost individual.

I loved the interview on Rumble. I want to bring up a thing I disagree with you about. We don't want Biden to pick a VP could be envisioned as president, b/c there's a chance that person could run in the future and win only on name recognition and identity politics

Why  isn't in the top five is baffling to me. Even if she isn't the pick, not having one of the most qualified candidates out of all the possible choices is nuts.
Trump misspeaks, slurs, slips his dentures, and frankly, mispronounces basic American names, like  YO-SEM-ITE for Yosemite National Park, so often that Joe Biden's occasional gaffes gloss over me like water off a duck's back.  Go give Kimmie a botox injection, Donnie J.

5.) Overall a great read that is worth your time. Who can best implement some of these needed policy changes? I have zero faith in a career politician like Biden &amp; unfortunately even tho Trump has been good on criminal justice reform I can‚Äôt see him changing the drug laws.
No because I'm woke now.  To be honest a scary thought is that if Trump wouldn't have come along and made me curious to see what really is going on I would have followed the crowd with Hillary or Biden. Thank you Potus for not waiting to run any longer than you did. #WalkAway
If Trump loses, he‚Äôll resign before 1/20. Pence, as President, will then pardon him before Biden‚Äôs sworn in.

Mike Pence claims Kamala Harris and Joe Biden want to stop Americans eating meat
What personal benefits?  Was Hunter Biden overpaid?  Yeah, probably.  Did he get the job solely on his name?  Yeah, probably.  There is ZERO evidence of ANYTHING illegal.    Unlike, you know, pressuring an ambassador to drum business to your private golf club.
I'm not denying that by most standards Hunter Biden was overpaid.  I'd also argue that a surprisingly high number of executives and board folk are often overpaid, for their contacts.  I've, personally, overpaid to have some people, for their contacts.
Oh, you brought the hashtag and made up scandal into this.  You realize that "scandal" had nothing to do with Ukraine or Hunter Biden, right?    That scandal was about unmasking Trump's first NSA for illegally working with foreign countries.    Have a nice night.
Oh, okay.  Shes totally not making money off the millions diverted to Trump properties time and again.  Absolutely.  What you or what Hunter Biden makes from a private company is not really my business.  What happens with tax dollars undoubtedly is our business.
Hi!   You should really read up on Turkey.  Which is 20x the enemy of Ukraine.  Also, no Biden took money from Ukraine at all and is never even alleged to.
1) Its Burisma.   2) Pretty much every country said that prosecutor was crooked and people within his own office have said he wasn't investigating Biden or Burisma.    He came up with it after the fact to try and gain favor with Putin's friends, like Republicans.
I've kept up.  Hunter Biden did not have a government position, nor salary.   This entire thing is manufactured off nothing more than an allegation of cronyism, without the slightest crime attached to it
Anything is better than this moron. Awesome that you admit your mistake. VOTE BIDEN
And they're all making their money from your tax dollars while Hunter Biden was paid by a private company.    And they don't have skills.  Look at the general shape of this country for proof
I'm not saying Hunter Biden was the single most deserving person of a board seat at Burisma.  But, everything I've seen and read says he got hired hoping it would curry favor, by a private company.    Ivanka is working for the government and profiting from it.
Joe Biden, the elected official, got 85k/mo while in office?  I'd love to see this story.
That false equivalency thing is old &amp; tired. No, Biden is NOT within light years of Trump as far as being an active racist. Drop it.
Its typically largely on speaking fees and book deals.  There are some moral politicians (see Biden, Joe) that don't even hold stock while they're in public office.  Other politicians flock to their own resorts on the country dime constantly, raking in millions.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Dementia Biden?  Man.  Woman.  Person.  Camera.  TV.  Its never a good thing when doctors are surprised you pass a dementia test.  Let alone when you shout it from the rooftops.
So, Burisma hired Hunter Biden to pressure Joe Biden to pressure Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, earlier than he was otherwise going to be fired, to stop an investigation which almost assuredly did not exist.  That's a phenomenal waste of money, if true.
Please explain, in detail, what is criminal about overpaying someone for a job.   Also, its insane to me that the belief is they overpaid to get Biden to fire a prosecutor, who was absolutely going to be removed regardless.  The man was horribly corrupt. The world was on to him.
This is an awful and entirely corrupt man that parts of the right wing are clutching to, in hopes that they can make Joe Biden look half as corrupt as Donald Trump.  That's your honest goal.  Just make him look a little corrupt next to the Trump Taj Mahal of Graft and Corruption.
This was not a Biden thing or an Obama thing.  This was pretty much an all country's that aren't in Putin's back pocket thing.  But we're suddenly quite content in Putin's back pocket.  For some reason.  Can't figure that out.
But sure, I deeply care in comparison that Hunter Biden got a board seat based off of his name.  That assuredly never happens.
And I'm supposed to care that Joe Biden's son got a board to seat to help influence?!  Jesus, Ivanka Trump magically got 20+ Chinese trademarks.   While working in the damned White House.

I believe Warren did really well with Latino and Black voters when they last polled, pretty sure it was better than Kamala there, but I‚Äôd like to see ticket poll numbers of just Trump v Biden with new cross tab breakdowns.
Rather interesting numbers compared to when we last had polling on VP stuff. Harris boosts black women a fuck ton. Drives away white men a bit more, and overall makes more Americans likely to vote Biden than less likely.
I think in this very difficult case ahead of us, voting vs not voting 1stly involves: the pro voter argues Trump is absolute hell 4 us, voting him out is necessary good; the anti-voter says my vote gives Biden a mandate to export our hell like Bush etc did, but to Russian sphere

Not true. Demings and Bass are also not listed as speakers. I think people are making too much of this. Biden is not signaling his pick through the speaker list ‚Äî that would be stupid.
I imagine you must hate yourself then. Seems to me you are the epitome of stupidity and ignorance. But you vote Biden. After all he did say you aren't black if you don't.
FYI When Biden makes his VP pick I‚Äôm logging off Twitter for a month.
In past years you would be 100% correct regarding the VP position. However in these times considering Biden‚Äôs age and the shear volume of America‚Äôs reconstruction needs the VP spot carries a bigger challenge then usual. Just make sure the cabinet is filled with the best talent.
Really  you are saying that my job (business) that was lost (closed) due to trumps inaction is coming back and I will get my money back that trump gave away to his rich buddies only to lose it again to President Biden. Sounds ridiculous. Trump has taken it all already

I‚Äôm for Biden/HarryYes, part of joke is if Biden is elected, the MSM &amp; Dem politicians who support him won't want him having to deal with a pandemic, so *poof*, away it goes.

For the record, I‚Äôve only seen 3 Biden yard signs this year, so clearly Biden is running 3-to-1 against Any Functioning Adult.
I'm not saying we can't do better folks, but I disagree with anyone that thinks Biden is not on the right side of this issue, especially when compared with the alternative. The choice is between him and Trump, whether you like it or not.
Please, please, please; I am begging you, do not take this attitude. *Always* keep pushing for your ideals, but do not sullenly reject any victories that you achieve. Biden helped get us a *lot* closer than we've ever been on this issue.

One thing absolutely guaranteed in the 2020 Presidential election...  Biden will win the popular vote.   By a larger margin than Hillary.   By 6-8 million votes.
genuinely curious!! I don‚Äôt feel comfortable voting for biden, for obvious reasons. I saw you mentioned the same. What are you considering? Or DM me I really wanna know more
Poor   The  'reporter' is so geographically challenged that she can't tell the difference between "right here in Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania" and Wilmington, Delaware, where the graphics and the broadcast anchor identify as being her location
Biden wins, and in 2 years the pandemic abates as they all do eventually: see? It was a hoax to steal the election.   Trump wins, and in 2 years the pandemic abates as they all do eventually: God has smiled on our glorious leader, for he is Science.
If Biden wins he deserves 3 Nobel Prizes
Can you imagine calling yourself  but supporting Biden/Harris? That's like Abraham Lincoln supporting the South. You guys are trash. You don't care about democracy. You only hate Trump.
Biden campaign unveils 1st ad featuring running mate Sen. Kamala Harris - ABC News
This is the world Kamala Harris and Joe Biden wants.  What a tragedy. Remember, voting or not has consequences.  We need strong well trained police and strong well trained prison programs. These scumbags should not be in society.
Dummycrats need a brain and Biden‚Äôs is missing
Do you remember when Hillary did the rope-a-dope thing with reporters? This is the same thing Biden is pulling.
If only Biden or Harris were even remotely left of Reagan, they might actually have some support from the younger generations who were born into a broken country and economic system.

Born in the USA. Served in the Marines. Pretty sure I'm a "REAL" American. And I'm voting for Biden.
The USPS Union endorsed Biden. I‚Äôm sure part of their rigging the election plan.
I dont know if I am ready to sacrifice four more years of trump for potentially eight years of biden. Their scotus and federal appointments wouldn't even be that different. Kamalas ass is stuffed with aipac money and she is somehow tougher on crime and more hawkish than biden...

They‚Äôve come to a decision.  Polling shows there are very few undecideds.  Biden and Harris are making appearances, but only an idiot interrupts their opponent while that opponent is deztroying himself.  Trump loves the spotlight.  Let him have it.

PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
The last time he voted on a bill was 2009. He then spent 8 years in the White House. If you want to criticize Biden‚Äôs actual record, you could probably make some valid points. However, blurting out this nonsense, without researching, makes you look uninformed.
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
You're not wrong but having a president that is a different party can/will expose the R's and D's hypocrisy. Also, 4 years of nothing getting done would be better than 4 years of Trump or Biden lol. But I honestly think she could get a lot done.
I completely and fully agree! I never thought he did anything improper! He never touched her, she was asleep and it was a joke, he‚Äôs a comedian!! It‚Äôs disgusting that a pervert is in OUR White House.. and Al Frakeen was removed from office!! He‚Äôs a pedophile! #TrumpVirus #Biden

It will become a country of tyranny if Biden is elected.  Look how easily the government took away our rights and then manipulated data to maintain control. They now have the formula. A vote for the left will put an end to the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
VOTE BIDEN!!!! If nothing else, we won't have a Vice President who has to ask "Mother" what his opinion is.

Let the campaign of deception begin. Biden and Harris are the most radical leftists to ever run for Pres and VP in US history.
Remember...if you don't vote for Biden, "you ain't black!" And if it's because you don't like Harris, it's because you're racist.
Johnson's spurious "investigation" is obviously an abusive attempt to use his power to damage Biden by "allegation" - a longtime Republican tactic. It stinks to high heaven &amp; it will fail coz there's no there there, BUT it illustrates the depths of Johnson's corruption.

Since you erroneously state he has done nothing, I assume that you haven‚Äôt actually researched his record. Almost 300 bills sponsored by Biden in the past 2 decades, 8 years as Vice President, served and chaired the US Senate Committee on the judiciary. What did Trump do?

If by the grace of Satan Biden gets elected and we don"t have a civil war, I think we should treat him and Harris like they treated Trump. Starting with impeachment on day one.
So, As a Libertarian Gay male who wants nothing more than to get the current Nazi's out of office, exactly why should I vote FOR you and Biden?  Being the "lesser of two evils" is not an acceptable answer.

I‚Äôm a proud Democrat in Ohio.  I‚Äôd crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden/against Trump.  Governor Dewine‚Äôs done a decent job, especially on COVID.  I might vote for him because of that.  That doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with batshit Qanon lunatics.
Literally none of the trump campaign attacks can stick on the Biden/Harris ticket, but it‚Äôs adorable how they try
Poll: Voters approve Harris VP pick, Biden gets image bounce
If one more person who supports Trump calls Biden creepy I may lose my shit.
If you're pro-life, pro-liberty, pro-science, and pro-sanity, you can't vote for Joe Biden. The choice couldn't be clearer.  This election isn't about political preferences like usual, it's a national decision about whether truth and liberty matter anymore.
Mighty Joe Biden vs The New Jersey General ü¶äüì∫
IMO if Biden wins, the panic will be reduced, but the control over citizens will remain the same as if the panic was ongoing, because Dems like Biden have been conditioning people to accept more govt control over their lives (new normal). That's what Biden's mask mandate is about
This virtue signalling to the far-left isn't going to go well for Biden-Harris on election day. I'd be very interested to see swing state polls on this proposed mandate.
Correct...but even with this, how does ANYONE take serious what Biden says?  I'll be doggone if I ever listen to the words of a puppet.
The MSM is just going to blackout an Israel/UAE peace deal.  But then again this is the same MSM that lied about the Obama/Biden Iran Deal giving Iran nukes and funding Soleimani and the IRGC.

5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris‚Äôs First Full Day on the Biden Ticket
Who da greatest team ever.....Team Biden Harris
Make no mistake cerything coming out if your mouth is pure propaganda. Anyone who's paying attention knows that both Biden and Harris are tough in crime center-right leaning politicians. Since the gop has moved extreme right-fascist. dems now have to be both parties
There is no way Pence can debate Harris with any success.   Trump and Biden? Well that‚Äôs gonna be a lot of yelling and weird shit going on.
Shut up trump. It certainly didn‚Äôt collapse when Biden was Vice President did it? You‚Äôre the problem right now. You act like a baby
Yup. It will likely go Trump unless there is some dramatic shift. I can‚Äôt see the red going blue by anything Biden is saying, it will be a matter of Trump tripping up or losing them over something.
HOPE in what?   That Biden/Harris won‚Äôt discuss USA?!!!   TRUMP 2020
Kamala Harris's presidential campaign received contributions from a law firm used by Jeffrey Epstein.  Biden-Harris is the choice for pedophiles.
There is one shot to beat Trump. It‚Äôs Biden/Harris. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm gonna take a chance on them.
Swore in as Indian American now running for VP as African American... Kamala Harris is the Trojen horse for Joe Biden to hide his racism even she exposed earlier.
Joe Biden played his hand and lost. Hypocrite Kamala Harris (who openly labeled him a racist) will not pull him through. Trump for 4 more years. #MAGA2020
My opinion, for the little that its worth, is to elect Biden/Harris and STILL show up in the streets regularly to demand the action and policies we want. The people have been awoken and it is up to everyone one of us to keep them awake.
You finding something hard to believe is a failure on your part. I truly have no preference between Trump and Biden. They are both trash. Our system is stronger than either of them.
I don't owe my vote to anyone. Don't bring that "throwing away your vote" bullshit my way. Both Biden and Trump are trash and I don't want either of them in office.
This WH has thrown in the towel and admitted defeat against COVID-19 - they just can't handle the truth.  Bring in Biden/Harris #864511032020
At this point, that is more than enough. I'd love to see a progressive revolution, but I don't think its going to happen this year. Instead, we will elect Biden/Harris and then harness our passion for progress to hold them accountable at every turn. If they fail, they go home.
OMFG!! What a mess this fall is gonna be...stay tuned. Lock her up!!  Threats against former VP Biden...
If I had said this about Biden, I would be called to my boss's office by 9 AM. He says it, and he'll get another new show where he eats elephant perineum.
Oh man, he‚Äôs going all in ...  Trump: 'Some men are insulted' by Biden choosing female VP
MIGHTY JOE BIDEN U A ROCK STAR
That's because they choose "the truth over facts" like Biden told them to do ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
KING JOE BIDEN
Amen.  Everyone has to VOTE in order for this year Mickey to win.            JOE. BIDEN.                              AND                   KAMALA.       HARRIS  üôèüèøüî•üëãüèø‚òùÔ∏èüèøü•Ö‚òùÔ∏èüèøüôèüèøüéàüéàüéàüéâüéàüéâ
Are you even kidding? Joe Biden clearly has dimentia and doesnt know where he is or what he is talking about half the time &amp; was reading a prepared speech yesterday but Trump has cognitive decline? get outta here! Lets give them both a test!!!

Lol. Your about the 18th person to use that analogy. Its bullshit. Biden gets us no closer than Trump. Hard pass.
Oh the melodrama. Lol. Voting for Biden is voting against our interests. A man who would deny healthcare for millions during a pandemic isn't someone I want to vote for. Why replace one menace with another?

Umbrellas = antifa, right? Or it‚Äôs just Delaware being Delaware. Biden-Harris, the coastal elite ticket!
Here's my bottom line.  Trump is destroying the environment and Biden wants to do nothing about it until 2050 which is "passing the buck."  If we're not carbon neutral by 2030 we're living on a runaway Greenhouse planet.  Biden losing could mean a real progressive in 2024.
I know this isn‚Äôt coming from Biden. So who ever you are you‚Äôre histerical.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
That‚Äôs because you know Biden will not do well at the debates!!
While I agree in theory, when it comes down to more Trump or Biden I have to choose Biden. The two party system sucks but that isnt changing by November. Third parties, currently, are a waste of a vote politically. This needs to change but that isn't happening anytime soon.
"We've created more jobs In the last 3 months than Joe Biden &amp; Barack Obama created in their 8 years in office AFTER we plunge the country into economic ruin forcing 40 mil job losses &amp; presiding over the worst drop in GDP in US history b/c we don't like science."  Fixed it! üëçü§™

Ooo wee ooo im gonna kill joe biden
Biden certainly does have experience....fleecing taxpayers and pushing racist policies for almost 50 years.  The guy is as corrupt as they get.  And he fondles little girls and sexually assaults women.   But don‚Äôt let that get in the way.
Mmmm ... I suggest  Joe Biden-Kamala Harris:  Putting DCency back in DC
It‚Äôs the same person who writes Biden‚Äôs tweets.

‚ÄúBiden is a rapist‚Äù and Trump is accused of raping CHILDREN. ‚ÄúHarris is transphobic‚Äù But pence wants to perform electroshock therapy on ALL LGBTQ.  you‚Äôre an adult you don‚Äôt get what you want when it comes to the best canadate so you don‚Äôt vote?  GROW UP.

Y‚Äôall act like we want to vote for fucking Biden &amp; Harris.  As if we have a choice but Trump is literally the Devil and becoming a dictator so sorry but i don‚Äôt give a fuck. Especially if you‚Äôre white!! You don‚Äôt have to live with the shit POC have to when it comes to his status
i‚Äôm sorry...if you don‚Äôt fuck with Biden and Harris WHATEVER but anything is better than 4 more years of the racist torture black people live in with trump as president. shut the fuck up. if you‚Äôre not gonna vote then DONT but stop posting about it on social media shut up
2020 Presidential election: 2 candidates who won the first and only presidential election they competed in vs 2 candidates who've lost every election or nomination for president they've competed in, except for Biden winning the 2020 nomination.  Advantage: winners.
Yeah, and Biden is leading in the polls.
OH YA  RIGHT. SHE IS SO FUCKING SMART, IT HURTS. WE ARE IN AMAZINGLY COMPETENT HANDS AND SHE WILL DO JUST FINE ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. NOT TO MENTION, ALL ELSE. WE ARE TRULY BLESSED WITH THIS PICK. BIDEN MADE A GENIUS MOVE WITH HER
She‚Äôs backing a racist in joe Biden and a race baiter in KAAAMMAALLLAAA
Biden, Harris rake in millions overnight after running mate announcement  #FoxNews
I'm Voting for Joe Biden And Kamala Harris. Because Trump and pence has Committed Treason, Crimes Against Humanity And Genocide. And Trump Committed And trying to commit Election Fraud.
Sounds like an endorsement for Biden!!!
I'm not sure you've seen the state of politics in this country lately. We don't have a ton of great options laid before us here. Realistically, Biden and Trump are our options and while I strongly dislike Biden I despise Trump and everything he stands for. It's a no brainer.
Ok I guess  is in the business of getting Biden elected president.  They spent The Whole day covering him and Nasty ü§¢ Kamala Harris at nauseium   And then wouldn‚Äôt even cover Trump‚Äôs press conference
Billy want no debates between Trump &amp; Biden bc Trump will trumped Joe every time! Pence will have to be aggressive more than Harris bc she will be president if they win!
I‚Äôll take the adults. Biden/Harris.
A landslide is usually a disaster.  Maybe someone should've told them that.  Biden can't finish a sentence and Kamala is a dirty cop who put record number of African American males behind bars for petty crimes.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Agree, but Dems don't live in reality. To answer your question - Beijing Biden.
Kamala wasn't chosen to be VP nominee b/c she'll win over new voters for Biden, although she may win some minorities who vote based solely on identity politics.  She was chosen to be Biden's attack dog, to make the election a referendum on Trump &amp; scare ppl away from voting Trump
After being off of twitter for a whole day, I am finally speaking out: Biden/Harris 2020 y‚Äôall let‚Äôs GOOOOO
You know she's going to claim the election was illegitimate when Biden loses. Maybe Russia hoax 2.0.
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate
Put  in a google search - Joe Biden campaign website comes up
Did any one notice that Biden said that Kamala  knows about being both African american and Indian American ?    How many can you be?
So...  antifa . com takes to to Biden/Harris web page!  Lol...
Trump literally promised to defund SS over the weekend. Biden wants to keep payroll tax and expand it to income of 400k+ with no cap, which will in fact expand social security so that argument is moot. Plus Kamala left that position nearly a decade ago
Thought the same thing when I heard him pronounce her name.  Even though he ran in primaries with her &amp; Bo Biden and her were such good friends... Hmmm
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
Ha, I completely didn't realize what this tweet was saying when I liked it. I barely see Trump and Biden as on "different sides" so I didn't even realize that's what was being talked about.
hey Joe Biden who was your best friend back here in the Senate I think he was from West Virginia his name was KKK bird remember him the head of the KKK the grand Pooh Bah of the clue cluck clan. You are disgraceful
Joe Biden you are be ashamed of yourself talking about what happened in Charlotte and you know damn well Donald Trump put down the KKK and the leader of the KKK he was talking about the average citizen that was on both sides about tearing down the statues
Make no mistake about it, if elected, this weak Democratic duo will aid and abet the radical socialists and anarchists at every turn. Americans must reject Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their dangerous ideology.
Happily contributing to #BidenHarris2020 and can't wait to #VoteBidenHarris2020 in November!  Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
stop faking radicalism to keep your fragile idea of democracy in place. biden is an out of date racist and Kamala is a cop who‚Äôs been an active part of mass incarceration in the US. do your research and understand who youre voting for b4 its ‚Äúblue no matter who‚Äù
Joe Biden made the right choice, unlike Trump.
The Republican plan and the Biden plan are the same. Die, preferably as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Just the fact that they called Biden a liberal I just? He‚Äôs literally almost bad and the orange man himselfüò´I just hate it here
Yes, keep beating the ‚ÄúSlow Joe‚Äù drum because we see how effective that is when we compare Biden to Trump.
These comments by Kamala back in October make more sense now in light of Biden's team choosing her as VP nominee. She played the long game.

Please copy-paste and distribute widely:  Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.
I don‚Äôt know what that is but I am voting for Biden/Harris.
What does the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party David Pepper think about Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his running mate? Take a listen:
Let me be clear...THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT WILL KEEP ME FROM VOTING AND VOTING BIDEN/HARRIS...
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
I'm seeing a lot of people saying that we should vote for Biden because he's not Trump and I don't think anyone remembered what happened when we said that last time unfortunately.
Biden's running mate running the show would be true no matter who he chose though, whether it was Kamala or someone else. So your reply doesn't address Kurt's question.
It seems to comes down to greater uncertainty about this Fall compared to 2016 (COVID/Economy) but these are still large discrepancies given the Biden's greater polling advantage and the relative stability of his lead compared to Clinton's.
Kamala was chosen because she's as shameless a liar as you'll find, &amp; will be Biden's attack dog, while the MSM writes puff pieces about her unique heritage, as they've already begun doing.  Dual goals: make election referendum on DJT while hyping potential of 1st black woman VP.
Just so we can catch our breath for a minute and get the Rona under control. I haven't craved stability like this since I was 8...Biden flawed as hell, but like...lol
But you had Clinton at about an 85% probability to win at this point in 2016 and, as 538 has pointed, Biden's polls are much better than Clinton's were at their peak.  Why the difference?
Elizabeth, I‚Äôm responding to the constant attacks on Joe Biden that he is in decline and hiding in his basement. You think those attacks are okay?
She can't even pretend to be an advocate of law &amp; order, b/c the Dem base is openly calling to defund police in cities across the US.  Kamala is just Biden's attack dog who will constantly attack Trump &amp; try to make the election a referendum on him as Biden has been trying to do.
please explain how Kamala is bad for trump  lol  I mean Biden picking a cop is one thing in this day and age, but a CROOKED  one?!?  PLEASE! lol  Tulsi Gabbard had no shot at the nomination and crushed Kamala in the debates.
Biden at 71% is like saying The Ohio State Buckeyes have a 71% chance of beating ‚ùåichigan this college football season.    Side Note: Big10 season has been cancelled!
Wouldn‚Äôt you love to see Trump ride a bike or try jogging. He couldn‚Äôt last 30 seconds with Joe Biden.
I hope Biden/Harris is the worst ticket I ever have to consider voting for. Trump/Pence is obviously excluded because if I didn‚Äôt vote for him the first time how could I now
Cis folx, I‚Äôm going to need you to talk w/ yr friends. Come fall, the Trump plans to put trans youth in the crosshairs. Why? He‚Äôs hoping to appeal to cis women leaning Biden who are under-educated on trans issues &amp; susceptibile to scare tactics. Be prepared to defend trans kids.
Harris is such an aggressive personality  that she will quickly join Pelosi and Schumer in dominating Biden. As Biden grows weaker and weaker the election will focus on Harris‚Äô radical left positions and her ruthless use of government power to impose radical values.

You think they're the same? I am not asking this to be funny, I'm legit curious. Biden was not what I wanted, but I understand why he absolutely needs to win in November.
Fox News's Cavuto fact-checks Trump campaign claim that Harris called Biden a racist: 'She never did'  via
I really wonder if Biden took so long to pick Harris because of all the other quality candidates werent a good fit or said no? Was Harris the pick all along but strategy was why they waited? It just seems like when Biden first said he would pick a woman of color,
Any black person tweeting negatives about Kamala Harris is self sabotaging! Your are directly putting a negative impact on her and Biden‚Äôs potential election and ion like that!
Not gone lie I probably won‚Äôt vote at all this year. Biden and Trump can both go to hell!
Every time I see Joe Biden, I automatically smell an egg salad sandwich. Weird.

I‚Äôm not a fan of the whole Biden/Harris thing, but I would rather they be in the White House than Trump/Pence again...  But I would seriously much rather have #JoJorgensen2020 in office over everyone else
She did this AND Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill ... but somehow I‚Äôm expected to believe that voting for them is a vote for change?!
I can‚Äôt wait to vote, Biden/Harris! üá∫üá∏
Vice President Biden, I believe you, sir. Please, please listen to your advisors. You have a challenging election ahead of you so please be open to advice. I want you to win so badly. I will help your campaign in NE Ohio. I promise.
You mean Biden would do the right thing? You underestimate the intelligence of the suburban women, as you underestimate everybody‚Äôs intelligence but your own. They see through your unfounded scare tactics.

I'm watching Biden/Harris today!
It is interesting to imagine if:  a)SarsCov2 most strongly impacted predominantly conservative locations in the US instead of NY/NJ.  or  b)Obama/Hillary/Biden was POTUS instead of Trump in 2020.  Would the MSM's coverage have been significantly different than it has been so far?

Inside Biden‚Äôs unusual VP pick process: Tough questions, 11 finalists and many lawyers
you say that now, but come November, you know you are voting biden/harris   lol
But hey let‚Äôs not choose someone because of their history/experience/policies. Let‚Äôs choose Kamala because Joe Biden is seen as an old racist white man and Kamala will help get the black/female/Indian vote. And that one lady on SNL looks like her and is funny so thats cool too
I want my Biden/Harris sign!
Is this an ad for or against Biden and Kamala?
Fuck Biden. Fuck Trump too.  #JoJorgensen2020
THANK YOU JOE BIDEN!!!! Kamala Harris is the one candidate who can really get in the orange ones head. I can finally stop buying Alka Seltzer and Bourbon by the case, and maybe sleep for more than three hours at a time.
I don‚Äôt hope anything bad on anyone but bc Biden is old af there is a real possibility she could be the first woman president
Yeah, I hope she stays healthy.  Happily voting for Biden/Harris myself.  Be well.
I know Joe Biden is cuckoo but why would he choose soon deceased wrestler Kamala Harris to be his running mate?ü§£
"If and when biden decides to step aside"  WHAT DOES THIS ACTUALLY MEAN?!?!?!?!
Look who is in the background of this poster. Biden had to photo bomb to be in the picture. Very telling.
Fuck man. Joe Biden really had to go an pick the only Democrat worse than him as his VP.   Didn't wanna vote 3rd party, but Howie or Jo, here I come.
Did she have to sleep with Biden to get the job like her other ones?
Good morning America it's Wednesday. How we know who running for president Trump or Joe Biden it's your choice it's American dream at stake
His facts don't fit your narrative. Tough shit. She's terrible but so is Biden so she's probably perfect for him.
So let me get this straight Biden is a known racist and trump is the one struggling? You really are twisted
#nastywoman dude  is in full dbag mode:  "President Trump responds to Kamala Harris‚Äô selection as Biden‚Äôs VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race"
I‚Äôm a trans person who believes in abolition. My excitement over Harris is excitement over strategy: it was the smartest choice Biden could have made &amp; it‚Äôll help them win. These candidates aren‚Äôt my ideal choice, but they‚Äôll ensure the ouster of a transphobic white supremacist.
Put Joe Biden on mount Rushmore
Omg!! He most certainly should. I want him arrested on the steps of the Capitol after President Biden has been sworn in. Pompeo and Barr should go down with him for being his accomplices. The most corrupt administration EVER!!
Da fuq are you babbling about? We stopped listening to Bernie when he endorsed Biden. We don't give a shit about him anymore.

I hate Trump. I hate Biden. I hate political parties
Oh the irony, "She was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden," Trump said of the Harris and Biden clash, referring to his nickname for Elizabeth Warren. "She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful."
Do you really think anybody gives a shit about a debate between Pence and Harris? everybody wants to see the annihilation that Trump will put on Biden in their debate. Sleepy Joe is going to look really stupid!
Possibly, but we have 2 choices. Biden who has one complaint in a stellar career or Trump who brags about assaulting women. I will take Biden/Harris.
Biden/Harris: Liberty &amp; Justice for All Biden/Harris: Better Together, Better for All Biden/Harris: Together We Can
With that logic, They might as well just flip the ticket then since Biden is just going to step aside anyways.
What voters are Biden's strategists expecting to win over by choosing Kamala? I don't see her moving the needle with any group of voters.
Hell No.  no desire to be run By a socialist communist ticket of Biden/Harris
Your statement isn‚Äôt diverse enough. According to Joe Biden that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a member of the African American community. I will absolutely not be voting for Joe Biden. Having you in office would be even worse.
Did you know that the best way to defund the police is having a former cop as Vice President? It‚Äôs like Biden saw everything that was going on and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about this‚Äù. Can we have a new election where we don‚Äôt have selfish idiots running for President.
Did you know joe biden has an island swiming distance from. Pedo island  with a submarine port on it. Have you seen biden sniff girls on live TV. How about kamala falsely imprisoned blacks and POC's when a prosecutor, then joked about getting high on radio.
Oh, I‚Äôm so happy! History was made tonight! Good trouble will win John Lewis! Elijah Cummings!! We will make the America return that you fought for..we‚Äôll pick up where you left off! So yeah Biden Harris. It‚Äôs time. Let‚Äôs go. #TrumpVirus #ProtectUSPS #BidenHarris2020 #BLM #UNMAGA

I Would Get Way More Happy About Biden/Harris If They Actually Had A Chance At Winning. Trump Really Done Tricked These Black People üò≠üò≠
Here's my bottom line.  Biden wants carbon neutral by 2050.  Science says 2030.  Privileged or not, healthcare or not, this world is about to become a runaway Greenhouse planet.  Then we can all equally cook to death.  Biden losing can mean a real progressive in 2024.
Because Kamala Harris was on SNL. It‚Äôs easy to ignore indigenous communities being trampled and exploited when Biden gives his ice cream cone to a kid at a fair. ‚ÄúBack to normal‚Äù means you don‚Äôt have to act like you care anymore.
Forget Biden/Harris 2020  Wet Ass P-Word 2020
At this point does the DNC even anticipate Biden serving more than half his term if he wins?
Yes but Beau Biden was a phenomenal man. He died of the same thing my brother did.
She literally backpedaled every single ‚Äúprogressive cause‚Äù she backed so she could get the VP spot. FYI, Biden/Harris are against a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and legalizing marijuana. Not very progressive.
I'll  miss S. Cooper after we #864511032020, but not so much to change my vote from a Biden Harris win!

Harris wasnt my top choice for veep, but a Biden Harris ticket is good for me! Screw Loose Dons  reign of fear is over
Ngl Biden lowkey made the right VP pick fr I know people who‚Äôre actually informed don‚Äôt fw Kamala that much but y‚Äôall giving some people too much credit large majority of niggas gone look &amp; say ‚ÄúMy nigga Biden was with Obama &amp; he running with a black lady oh yeah he got my vote‚Äù
reminder that not voting for biden means you‚Äôre voting for trump to replace two supreme court justices which puts lgbtq+ and reproductive rights at serious risk. #SettleForBiden
Voting for Biden and Harris is not ideal, but is absolutely necessary in this election. However, a vote for Biden and Harris does not mean they shouldn‚Äôt be criticized. Hold them accountable and pressure them into making progressive change.
Well, I believe Biden is Catholic, so you're wrong.  Anyhow, religion doesn't belong in politics. I long for the day when the Prez. AND VP are both secular. Unfortunately, it probably won't happen during my lifetime.
Nothing compared to the perfect storm coming your way Fat Ass.. Biden/Harris2020
We had a black president and shit still aint change lol dunno what people are gonna expect with BIDEN and KAMELA HARRIS who is a literal op
I have no clue what you are trying to say mate... are you delivering me a message from Joe Finger bang biden?... bang bang? Yes dems are a circus. You know your party started the kkk right. Jim Crowe was a Democrat. And you side is the only1s who claim black lives dont matter
Do you hear it?? Those cracks in the glass ceiling are getting bigger and louder Biden/Harris2020üíôüåäüë†
Was Harris lying then or now about Biden? Or do you just not care?
What do you guys think of Biden's VP pick?
I know Biden did not pick Kamala Harris as his running mate.... ü•¥
Ok so Biden and Harris weren‚Äôt our top picks for sure, but now we band together, whoop trumps ass, then spend every day telling them what we want, protest, and Smash that vote button every two years and primary Congress people and senators who don‚Äôt hear us.
As is your Biden. Even smart people vote dumb.#Bloomberg always worried about your money with #Biden #Harris You keep thinking that this virus is going to stop it's not Its getting everyone slowly #Stocks don't matter when there are no jobs and no workers Your living a dream when really a nightmare is happening
I do. Biden is up in the polls but you guys are like revolting because he doesn‚Äôt share your values but the other guy is worst and would take your rights away if can get the courts in his favor
Exactly. If elected the  Biden Harris administration would immediately give $ 40 Billion in taxpayer dollars to farmers
Joe Biden is dodging the media lol. Typical. #Trump2020
American made Biden !!
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for CCP
Had Joe Biden never entered into the world of politics and political shakedowns, what do you suppose his net worth be today?
#trumpspying I am willing to bet large sums of money, that this SCANDAL GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO OBAMA, BIDEN, RICE, HILLARY, and the WHOLE OBAMA CABINET...THEY SHOULD ALL BE PROSECUTED, CONVICTED AND PAY THE MAXIMUM PENALTY!!
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble  via  Glad they fired his ass
Serve? More like get more richer under Biden‚Äôs nose.
There‚Äôs no crack there, so he‚Äôs not there.  Plus Hunter likes the stripper looks, and we all know Camela, as Biden would say, is not.
Do not vote Biden!!! Jsut don‚Äôt mf vote this year on god ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not to worry, Biden will just issue an Executive Order
Of course they REFUSED to take questions. One of them can‚Äôt remember his own name &amp; one of them has said the most egregious things about Trump supporters, that they have no defense,&amp; don‚Äôt WANT to explain Biden‚Äôs memory loss or Harris‚Äôwanting to HUNT down TRUMP SUPPORTERS. F
if you voting for joe biden like this tweet so i can unfollow you
Y‚Äôall a fool if y‚Äôall think Biden not racist, especially after what he said.
I'm not voting for #Biden cause RobinWillams opinion that's supposed to be a joke But in our country. we use every little word every action To attack anyone
To all you PRs. Vote for BIDEN
When corrected, did Biden break out into a whiny bitch fest?
Never! You're an inspiration! But true to form for a Democrat candidate for president, Biden went straight to the old "us against them" section of the playbook!People  don't respon well, to Doom and gloom,or having thier country berated, by the class of people who did the damage.
But. You‚Äôre racist Mr. Biden
Liberals are just as racist as conservatives but liberals lie to your face about it you prolly still don‚Äôt think that Biden is a racist lol
Unfortunately that‚Äôs not your choice. Don‚Äôt vote for Biden and re-elect Trump
Both Trump &amp; AG Barr knows their days are numbered, with Biden picking Harris, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before we hear the ‚ÄúLock him up!‚Äù chants. #BidenHarris2020 #AGBarr #DonaldTrump #JoeBiden #KamalaHarrisForVP #Trump #LockHimUp
I really want us to climb the ladder as a country. I really do. I think Biden is seriously the only real choice that we have moving forward. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs going to do a lot of good, and take us up the ladder, but we need to get him there.  Just please vote well. Thanks all :)
One election will not solve the past 4 years. But we can climb the rung that‚Äôs first on the path to the top. It‚Äôs going to be a while until things get to a good place. But if we don‚Äôt keep climbing we won‚Äôt get there.  Just consider that when you‚Äôre upset about Biden‚Äôs choice.
I already see people complaining about Biden‚Äôs choice for VP because Harris was ‚Äúa cop‚Äù. She was an attorney. People saying that Biden deserves to lose for his choice of VP.  That‚Äôs the kind of mentality that is going to put trump in the White House for another 4 years...
If people got paid to bitch and whine about #Biden and #Harris, there'd be a lot more millionaires on the left.
Short memory , you know I believe ‚Äú Dr Ford‚Äù, and Biden‚Äôs accuser,Yada. Yada
I need better Biden/Harris shirt design options!
Didnt she call Biden a racist on national television?
makes me 110% more excited about voting for Biden. Can‚Äôt wait to flush the turd. #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #BidenHarris2020
Who Is Kamala Harris? Senator From California Is Biden's VP Pick    Not sure what‚Äôs so historic?We‚Äôve already had a Black president.
I hope nobody leaks the VP pick. I want to hear it from Biden himself.
Haha! What a joke Biden is ! 3 degrees ..... REALLY?
Biden should stop doing it then we‚Äôll stop posting it
Joe Biden and Jill Biden please listen!  We need to have sll the votes counted!  They can‚Äôt just get the rural precincts majority vote to send the delegates they want to the Electoral College!  Then the 3 million more votes for Hillary were not counted!  70,000 in Detroit alone!
No one invested that much Fredo
No one-and let me emphasize, no one-thinks Trump is religious and Biden is  not. Except of course for the cult and it‚Äôs enablers
I‚Äôd be pissed because it‚Äôs not Kamala but I wouldn‚Äôt have any *other* objections to Biden choosing her.
That‚Äôs where Biden‚Äôs mind is at, last century.
Biden is openly racist and idiotic. He doesn‚Äôt need help to lose.Just one more reason to elect Biden.
Same here I know many lifelong Republicans that are either not going to vote or will vote for Biden. They say they are embarrassed
It‚Äôs indisputable that Biden and Harris are far more in-tune with America.
If Biden wins the election you will see the resurgence of these policies and curriculums.  The Trump administration is holding these things at bay currently. The sad truth is that both of these political parties unleash some demonic influences upon our country. God help us!
That depends on who Archer is.  A Biden relative?  College friend?
And Biden will get more of them trump is a con man
No, because ALL AMERICANS need to know what Obama and Biden did to spy on the Trump campaign and to try to end his Presidency illegally! The truth hurts, but the truth shall set you free!
All of your arguments against Biden are based off of could be and maybes, my arguments for him are based on what IS. Trump IS more dangerous than Biden, no other president has been so dismissive of our rights and protections as citizens. We need to push if Biden wins of course
One more thing Biden will have to fix.
Ok so long as you vote. I get why people aren‚Äôt happy. IM not happy, but Trump is dangerous, Biden is inconvenient. Not voting Biden is self indulgently stupid We gotta be good lil party boys and girls until Biden is in. Then we can give him and Kamala heartburn for four years.
If you‚Äôre calling for an armed revolution you are just as delusional as a red hat, that‚Äôd fail immediately. The fact is, and it‚Äôs proven, we can MOVE Biden, we can‚Äôt move Trump. Go for the chance greater than 0 and vote down the ballot for the progressives there. Be smart
No progressive is happy about the Democratic ticket, and it fucking hurts that we were all so excited for Bernie to sweep the primary. It didn‚Äôt happen, but we have gotten further than we ever have before. Don‚Äôt give up the momentum we‚Äôve gained just to spite Biden!
Learn to prioritize. Right now our chief priority should be removing Trump, hindering that goal is destructive to all our other priorities. Once Trump is out we can focus more securely on giving Biden and Harris heartburn for not being progressives. Priorities people.
I wrote a whole Facebook thing last year but don‚Äôt want to share it on Facebook cuz I saw mean things about Biden‚Äîbasically it was this: ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt gonna energize anything. KAMALA WILL! She needs tobe our pick!‚Äù I was right. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was her making HIM exciting!
We know China is rooting for Biden.  Hunter is gonna make a killin if daddy wins.
So Biden wants masks for the next three months. What is happening in three months? The election!  Stop making the Corona virus political.
They are out of cards and ironically Biden/Harris have trumped Trump lol
That 4.7% was all that was left after all the others had run through their unemployment. The total number of people out of work because the the Obama/Biden administration was the part at a 30 year high. You need to dig deeper.
a spring. His campaign had been spied on and the biggest frame job ever perpetrated against them.  And then Obama's lieutenant Joe Biden went and picked you, an outright Socialist/Comunist. The UNITED STATES does not need you or sleepy Joe. And that is why you loose November. Bye
If America has had ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù from the beginning, how come you Obama and Biden did nothing about it during your 8 years? You Obama stoked the fires of racial hatred and racism during your 8 years! Your unhelpful comments on Trayvon Martin &amp; Mike Brown before all .../2...
This USPS issue is important enough for Biden and Kamala Harris to take on and apply pressure from their point of view.
Biden didn't pick her his handlers did. Democrats know dementia Joe won't last 4 years
And if you're a Biden voter, you don't have to worry either, as a special service will be held for him that will take place in March or October, he hasn't quite figured it out yet... Little kids are appreciated in lieu of anything else... Fuckin pedos
A (D) poll has Biden up by 6, a (R) poll has Biden up by 12. Makes sense
I bet the Biden administration wont kill
Keep telling yourself that. This economy booming was all Trump. Nothing OBAMA/Biden related at all. The crash....i think you know why it crashed, nothing to do with Trump. It‚Äôs on the rebound already
worked so hard to divide our nation‚Äôs emotions. The man ended up dividing his own party. Republicans are now committing to voting for Biden/Harris - 2020, because they understand it is the moral conscience of humanity who sees through Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership.
And Biden isn‚Äôt, and most of Washington, Hollywood... ?
I forgot that Biden and Harris can start getting briefings now. That may change the game.
2020 sucks, but making us cap it off with deciding between Joe Biden and Donald Trump just doesn‚Äôt seem fair man.
Technically, the first State of the Union speech by President Biden wouldn't be until Jan or Feb 2022. The first address of a newly inaugurated POTUS is just an address to a joint session of Congress, not an official SOTU. A lot can happen in a year and a half üòÅüòÅ
Yes !! Made me feel so much better the future.  Biden and Kamala as a pair seems balanced and competent and safe
It's not that high. 5% difference in the popular vote would be a large Biden EC win. Trump's 2% deficit last time in 2016 is probably close to the limit given how close the swing states were.
Biden's not in office yet, silly!
Honestly, I agree. Yeah Biden sucks but I'd rather vote for him than have Trump in office again. People are acting like there's another choice but unfortunately there's not and we need to face that reality. That doesn't mean we can't fight for change at the same time tho ‚ú®
I‚Äôm so excited about Biden/Harris2020. I‚Äôm in Ohio(important state) My voice has NEVER BEEN HEARD! My story is UNBELIEVABLE! You 2 or u zoom me or visit me, and fight for ME! I BELIEVE in you both. Please don‚Äôt let me down!!
Funny how President Biden finished every sentence while Trump read from notes for half an hour, the same notes he read yesterday without raising his head. He is a energy on sleeping pills.
Biden/Harris2020 are going to Unite this Country!! We need to quit this racism BS! We are all one race, the Human Race‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Wait so you think joe biden is a better option? you‚Äôre lyin
When McKinley was assassinated Teddy became President, the same thing could happen if Biden becomes incapacitated for mental health issues. The only difference is McKinley and Teddy were republicans.
She had my support... and still does!  Along with Biden!  You‚Äôre going home dude.. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Nice try Bill.  Busy trying to hide Biden‚Äôs dementia much?
That is a straight lie. Biden and his running mate are poised to divide this country even further and run it into the ground purposefully. Really who choses an ex-cop for a VP during THIS TIME. They are playing with our morals. üòíüòíüòí
Yeah! Biden/Harris 2020!
CPH congratulates Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. sister Kamala Harris on her selection as the VP running mate for Joe Biden! We know our NPHC sisters must be so proud. üíóüíö
Hopefully the Biden/Harris administration will honor him by finally fighting climate change.
Hey I did sign it but I was duped, shucks the signature gatherer said it was a petition for Minnie to be Biden‚Äôs running mate
It's going to be irritating to listen to these talking heads criticize Biden and Harris when they have Satan and Casper Milktoast that have killed 162,000 of our people due to their arrogance and ignorance.
Biden‚Äôs connection is that he ain‚Äôt trying to kill us!! Trump‚Äôs podium hugging propaganda rallies have opened a greater divide in this country.

Yes!!!!  Biden/Harris!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
And that‚Äôs a good thing and why she has my vote along with Biden!
Biden/Harris is the BEST TICKET since Obama/Biden! I Love her‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèºüëçüèº! It‚Äôs time to make the world take the USA seriously again. Biden/Harris have the Class,Experience,and PROFESSIONALISM 2 make that happenüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
Best ticket since Obama/Biden!!
This is CNN reporting from the latest Joe Biden for President rally outside his home.  Hundreds of thousands are here in his garage. There is also maybe two dozen people attending.   Biden calls the rats on the floor as his pets and declares they will run his campaign for 2020.
The silent majority better SCREAM in November.  We do not need biden harris anywhere near the white house. #trump2020
. needs to spotlight Nasty Woman perfume oil again. This time have the proceeds go to the Biden campaign üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wow! Joe Biden goes against the grain. When the majority of Dems are against heavy handed policing, he goes and picks a heavy handed cop as a running mate.  I guess he's hoping to pick up more law &amp; order Rs than the base he's alienating.
Biden/Harris 2020!! YES! YES! YES! YES!
I hope you and all your followers will join us older Americans in voting for this great ticket; BIDEN-HARRIS!!!   Just think what they can get done in Biden‚Äôs 8 years then her 8 years!!!
Yes!!!!! Joe Biden Names Kamala Harris as VP Pick - WSJ
If Trump is having a press conference Biden should wait until then and upstage him.
Nice. When you google ‚Äújoe Biden vp pick‚Äù, a Tr*mp ad is the first thing to show up...
Can Joe Biden talk for more than 2 minutes before saying something wrong or saying something he has to try to walk back or saying something that makes no sense? Only one person was perfect - Jesus Christ. So, what‚Äôs your excuse? You are NOT perfect! Shame on you for criticizing!
Join me in supporting Chip in to support Joe Biden's campaign and Democrats nationwide via
And for the next three months. ALL of our energy needs to be supporting Biden ticket and destroying Trump ticket. Any other anger or issue or whatever can wait until Nov 4.
Have you heard something about her  unfollowing Biden‚Äôs campaign? It‚Äôs probably just bitchy gossip
That's for a male born today. Life expectancy for a man already 77 like Biden is would be about 86 or 87. The commonly quoted life expectancy number is always for someone born today, with that number being an average that gets lowered by the effect of some children dying.
Few really care who he chooses as VP because it's all about Biden is sane and Trump isn't.
So Biden ‚Äùbetter‚Äù chose a black woman? I'm not opposed to the choice, but if you alienate one gender, and alienate other ethnic groups, then are you really getting the best person for the job of VP?  #politicallyhomeless
DEMAND THE DEBATE COMMISSION to move the first Presidential debate to the FIRST week of Sept. Why are they covering for Joe Biden?? Pre Trump wants your input. #LeadRight
I was just ear raped by Biden.üò£
Makes no difference....Biden!!!
I take it seriously.   Under President Kamala, Brown would be seen as the Wise Old Man,  a national figure of a sort. He's signalling to old man Biden not to trust his protege. That says something.
Sort of like Woodrow Wilson. Crash, bash and burn Biden.
The Debate Commission is co-conspiring with the radical Dems to keep Joe Biden hidden in his basement until 09/29. GET HIM OUT &amp; onto the debate stage NOW. Sign the petition. #LeadRight
This is reason enough NOT to vote for Biden.
Of course they want Biden, he's putty to them. Wave money in front of democrats and they'll bite. They are like bottom feeding carp eating dough balls.
California is still gonna vote Biden by 25+ points
You‚Äôre right...Trump could very well lose the election.  Depends on the get out the vote efforts by the Republicans.  If Biden wins though, I‚Äôd have to question the cheating efforts by the Dems.  Most Secretaries of State are Dems thanks to Soros campaign backing.
If your platform was fully embraceable Bernie would be the nominee, as it is they are supposedly working together and Biden‚Äôs positions have shifted to the left
If Kanye is on the Wisconsin ballot and gets 20k votes and Biden loses the state by less than 20k and the EC to Trump - I will punch every third party voter in the throat until I‚Äôm pushing up daisies
Trump is being used to get us to accept a pos like Biden, won't happen. Policy or not getting my vote PERIOD.
Joe Biden is a creep!
Biden couldn't win a boobie prize.
Today is my birthday. Wish me a happy birthday by saying you will vote for Joe Biden on Nov 3rd.
These are the kinds of people Democrats praise and won‚Äôt criticize? Is this what America would be like under Joe Biden? Why doesn‚Äôt Biden condemn these anarchists and bullies, and support the police in locking them up?Oh Bill....  you silly moron Biden supporter.  If you read my tweets in this thread you‚Äôd see I‚Äôm a vacation this week. Nothing but time to answer you trolls. #MAGA
I have faith in the American people not to give us a Biden presidency because of what he wants to do to this country. Trump will win and the silent majority will make it happen, I have hope that is what will happen Trump 2020
I can find 10 quotes in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament that justify murder and the wanton murdered of innocents . And by the way everyone applies to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as well. Trump to his credit is more honest about how he feels. No guile- honesty!
The MSMORONS are willing participants in the cover up of Biden‚Äôs dementia and never ask any questions in his TWO MINUTE press briefings. Joe Biden will never debate Trump. His dementia would be on full display and they will never let that happen
Mitt Romney didn‚Äôt hold daily press conferences in ‚Äò12, nor did Kerry in ‚Äò08, or Clinton in ‚Äò92. Biden does interviews all the time and by outlets Trump has YET to appear on since becoming President.
I will be voting Biden and I have voted Republican since I was 18
Rashida Talib already said that Biden is ‚Äúmoveable‚Äù.
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, your daughter just announced her support for Biden/Harris!üòÇüòÇ
Hmmm, Biden never apologize for his stunning praise filled eulogy for KKK Robert Byrd who by the way never apologized for his past KKK proud participation. But I guess as long as he is a Democrat he gets a pass
let‚Äôs see, Biden supports un restricted abortion. He supports Christians being forced to pay for abortions. He supports the abolition of private health insurance. Biden is a China syncophant. The Chinese government is aggressively eliminateting all religion including Christianity
At least Biden can use one hand to drink a cup of water.
Exactly what I‚Äôm saying!!!! Use your vote for where it counts!! On Biden! Maybe one day the United States will be more than just a two party system and parties such as the Green Party will finally have a chance on the national stage but that day is not today. Vote blue.
And they have Biden ahead in the polls. I call BULL SHIT.
Further Trump is a champion for the unborn. while abortion is rampant in this country there can be no real ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù. He is also a champion for religious liberty. You‚Äôve got your priorities screwed up buddy.There is a reason Biden‚Äôs bishop refused him communion
I already wear a mask willingly. My state requires it in public places. But, why wear one out mowing my lawn. If mandated to that extent I would flat refuse to wear one. KMA Baby Biden. Girly Guy.
Keep working towards the top...McCabe, Comey, Biden, &amp; Obama!
Soon as Biden named Kamala Harris as VP, a whole bunch of fake woke niggas got exposed.
Hey Buck, Biden told us he doesn‚Äôt care about our rights when he made this proclamation so why would he care about the constitution?
I don‚Äôt even know what a Biden flag looks like
I don‚Äôt even know what a Biden flag looks like
Biden is out foxing Trump into taking his bait and favoring ridiculous position opposed by most Americans. Brilliant.
We will in a few months when the headlines read: Biden/Harris carry Ohio; Trump defeated‚Äù
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
Hard left will do anything to get rid of our real leader. They fear this red repeat map more than God. God will decide leadership over Biden/Kamala anti God  stance.
Talking about Pelosi and Biden again?
Biden and Harris proved it doesn‚Äôt take a rally to deliver a big message
I‚Äôm sorry but we need to be realistic. I support what they stand for but the Green Party will never get close to the number of votes it needs to matter. What they will do is take away votes we may need for Biden/Harris. They may not be the one‚Äôs we want, but they‚Äôre what we need.
Is it true your daughter endorsed Biden/Harris, rudy?
Vote trump or you‚Äôll get Kamala Harris! If creepy Biden gets in, he‚Äôll last about a year before he resigns
Talked to a old friend today. He's s independent. Said he most likely will vote Biden. Says he doesn't mind information tweets but hates the negative attack tweets. i knew that was a problem.
We got cha . The ones that didn‚Äôt laugh are Biden supporters
Does Biden smoke cigars. Just asking
I get it. She‚Äôs not perfect and she made mistakes but if she and Biden win she can do some serious good in this country to make up for them
Just a reminder to everyone that a vote for anyone but Biden and Kamala is a vote for Trump and his campaign of hate
I preferred Harris to Biden for president and I think it‚Äôs possible Joe is pulling a Weekend At Bernies so I‚Äôll end up getting my wish..
Ok your point is taken. And his criminal bill went too far. However you didn't live on Inglewood Ca when the bloods and crops started. Why? No jobs, Reagan. Bad schools Clinton and rampant murder. Biden at least tried to stop the carnage. Misguided yes. But no racial division.
I think you and I will strongly disagree on the goals/aims of the liberal establishment and who Biden would surround himself with were he elected, as well as what's needed re: police reform, but I can agree that we would be better off with less identity politics of all varieties.
..."conservatives and libertarians who don't identify as Republicans," because Biden has been courting his ideological foes and working with them for as long as he's been in politics. He's the poster child for moderate, establishment liberalism, not the old man version of AOC.
Even a Bernie nomination wouldn't have appeased the loudest progressives haha. But saying Biden/Harris has only pandered to the far left is categorically false, and this is coming from a moderate liberal haha. I think you're conflating "moderates" with...
Get her and Biden tf outta here
VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS HIGHER TAXES OPEN BORDERS NO MORE PRVT HEALTH INS GUN CONFISCATION DEFUNDED POLICE CHINA CONTROL OF AMERICA FREE HEALTH CARE 4 ILLEGALS ABORTION - ANY TIME INCLUDING INFANTICIDE
‚ÄúVote Biden-Harris:‚Äùopen boarders, defunding police, elimination of prv. health ins., needless wars, unrestricted abortions anytime anywhere any reason, taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal aliens, confiscation of legal firearms, Capitulation to China, higher taxes.
I pray not it will take biden 4 years or more to clean up trump mess he made of the us
You really need to get glasses biden is way ahead of you clown
Is he confusing Biden for McCain even though that was 2012...no wait that was 2008!
He might want to check first with Pope Francis who has served Joe Biden Communion and believes Joe is a good Catholic. Pope Francis understands the distinction between your faith as a Catholic and your duty to uphold the laws of the US.
Nail that exam!! #Biden - Harris!!!
Might want to check in with Pope Francis who not only believes Joe Biden is a good Catholic, but has also served him Communion.
So, no, M4A isn‚Äôt the most popular health reform plan out there. The one Biden is running on and put in the platform is.
Um, no, it was also this which unlike the Hill Poll tested both proposals and (like Silver noted in 2019) found Biden‚Äôs approach more popular than M4A. Read what people cite then comment next time:
Except you weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry, but what you just said isn‚Äôt factually accurate. Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedicare for the those who want/public option‚Äù polled better then M4A, every time.  That‚Äôs why he won.
I‚Äôm elated to see a Biden/Harris ticket!  Great choice Joe!
Biden is a Catholic.
Yeahhhhhhhh, Biden Harris 2020
You are right. That was misleading. I agree with what you tweeted. He is a Putin apologist. I didn't clarify that. I just made point that he is the type that make up lies about Biden. Sorry about that. At least that was my intent. I rather botched it up however.
Just want to advertise her that way.  Same as labeling Biden liberal leftist, which would be news to me.
Men have never been as genuinely gracious and publicly supportive of a former rival as every other woman Biden considered has already been to Harris.
Congratulations Senator Harris... If there were ever a time where your country needs you and VP Biden, that time is now!!! #BidenHarris2020
Madam Ambassador,  we still you in the Biden/Harris cabinet.  You are too valuable to not be used in a very important capacity.. #NoVoteNoVoice
picks  "Lipstick.on a pig"!....  "A step backwards for Women"...Joe Biden
If he were to win, Biden would be wise to populate his cabinet and advisors with many progressive-minded individuals, and I think he will. But the whole "Kamala is a cop!" thing is literally only an issue on red rose twitter. For the average American, she's a solid pick.
Tulsi Gabbard was a non factor. Her poll numbers went down because Biden and others went up. Gabbard has nothing to do with it.
You‚Äôve been trying that all summer on Biden, too. It doesn‚Äôt work. The GOP is going to lose and it richly deserves to.
Because they want to attract more GOP members to vote for Biden. Seriously, you can‚Äôt figure that out?
So, the opposite of Biden.
Kamala Harris scheduled to speak right before the Biden family and Joe Biden.....
If this were the current Trump campaign, not only would we know the pick. But we‚Äôd know who in the inner cycle was for it and who advised against and the shameless act of pandering the nominee did to flatter Trump.  Team Biden? Nothing.
It‚Äôs pretty incredible where a two-point change that still shows a double digit lead is presented as ‚Äútightening‚Äù of race. Trump‚Äôs biggest advantage is media will handicap Biden now to try to bring it back into a horse race.
You‚Äôre ignoring that polling shows Biden‚Äôs plan is even more popular when polled against M4A. People have only been pointing that out for over a year.
You will never hear a Democrat call for reducing taxes. Biden is openly running on raising them. A vote for Dementia Joe is a vote to raise your own taxes
Trump doesn‚Äôt have senior moments. Biden has senior eternities!
I‚Äôm always going to hope, but I feel as if it‚Äôs a bit on the edge of pandering.  I don‚Äôt want to think it but I have that feeling in my stomach , that woman‚Äôs intuition thing, gnawing at me that nothing will happen before the election.Then, what if Biden wins?  Bad news for us‚òπÔ∏è
Biden/Beatty has a nice rhythm to it.  has the Congresswoman been to DE recently?
