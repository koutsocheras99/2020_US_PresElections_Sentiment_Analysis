Let’s let the MAGA crowd know they have to vote for Kanye and Trump this year...President and Vice President....
A reporter just asked President Trump why many people in the room at his press conference in Bedminstsr, NJ aren’t wearing masks.  “It’s a peaceful protest,” Trump says in jest, to cheers from the crowd.😅
How old is this Denish guy....I would guess same mental age as Trump....toddler stage.  All the silly immature comments...just embarrassing for them.
Trump is the most recognized name on the planet, just ahead of Bozo the Clown.
The TRUMP VIRUS is OUT OF CONTROL....thanks to it's enabler!
Yes I would do to a rally GO TRUMP would you go to Bidens basement 😂
If you’re serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don’t think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.
i will say it here and now and ive made this prediction before in the last several months..our President  Donald J Trump will be assassinated in the next few  months..sad to say but i have no doubt there is so much hatred for his PRO AMERICAN policies..GOD  save and protect him🙏
Oops.
definitely Trump all the way!!!  100%
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.
Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!
I blame President Trump for failing us and not having a federal strategic plan on how to deal with this ongoing pandemic, Debbie.
I’m afraid Schumer and the Dems are going to perpetuate the lie when schools open up and post a bunch of fake numbers about how many kids are infected and then turn it right back around on Trump. I put nothing past these slime balls

Ridiculous. TRUST the man. Trump is destroying our democracy. Thanks heavens thinking like yours is limited to media wanting a attention.

How would you know...you are so OUT OF TOUCH with reality and hiding behind Trump corrupt rear end that you don't see the sunlight for the colon!
Many many instances where money does not buy the election. Trump's messages are blatant lies and not worthy of a fake reality personality.
Way to add to Rob's point about how childish this admin is👍 TX and FL couldn't be run by more ignorance...but hey, they know how to kowtow to trump.
Whoa...lots of numbers and graphs 🤩 you've changed my mind 🤣 who commissioned the study. I couldn't find the drs. that attached their name to this. Peer review? I'm sorry you feel the world is against trump.
I wish Facebook would have gone one step farther and removed Trump
is a nack ass fake ass nigga...to even think he would ever have a chance to be president is idiodic and all he is doing is stealing the black votes from biden so trump can win again. dont fall for it
Waiting for Trump's temper tantrum on Twitter to commence...
Nobody...nobody in their right mind believes that  “inherited” a growing economy from the previous administration!  Trump rebuilt the 🇺🇸 economy after  &amp; his “shovel ready” &amp; ObamaCare lies ! And you  went along with the whole mess! #KAGA2020
No need for debates until Trump releases his taxes. Why listen to a liar time and time again!
We hope that Joe Biden wins the election so that all the Trump voters get the mental illness care they so desperately need!
There is no rational explanation for that incongruence any more than there is for Trump's behavior. please don't drive yourself crazy looking for logic where none exists.
Haven’t seen anything great Donald Trump is done
I officially left the GOP when trump was nominated, but realized during Obama’s first term what a great president he was. Healthcare is a big issue for me and the GOP does not care about it. Religious right also took over party. #LincolnVoter
Maybe Joe should have a committee to research and list all the nastiness Trump committed to undo ASAP!
All name calling and not a single factual reason why America should not re-elect trump.
My phone just autocorrected trump to tumor and I haven’t been this pleasantly surprised in quite a while
I’ll be voting in person for Donald trump on nov 3
What sucks is that President Obama is such a great man that he'd attend Trump's funeral.
Cory Gardener?  How about the 59 other people on the sponsored list?  In six years the guy does nothing but following Trump around and this one trick pony is going to ride that thing to death!
Like in all of Trump’s distractions...the news cycle has moved on. So should you!

Exaggeration....it’s all the right has. If you can win honestly...YOU CHEAT!
Ummm. I watched like six democratic debates. Biden didn’t seem “incoherent” at all. But the Trump interview with Axios?  That’s another story altogether.
How many blatant lies did Trump say? And you’re aplogizing over a technicality. Please. You did great.
Thank God he sent Trump
He's even mimicking Trump's hand gestures!  Sick!
Because Donald trump has already made decisions that have impacts. This isn’t a hypothetical how will you handle this issue, it’s a why are you handling it this way
I wonder why only 25 Republicans voted for it? All democrats voted for it and it was started by John Lewis so why didn't trump say it was John's bill?
People are wearing masks, social distancing. What else do you want? Trump can not control a virus you idiots. Funerals for congressman and protesting is ok though!
Nope. ALL drop off boxes

Lara, are you really so foolish to think that?  Trump has done more than any previous president to stop human sex trafficking and pedo crap and you have the gall to suggest he is a perp.  It must suck to be so blind from hate.  MAGA 2020
Actually not sure why I'm engaging with you. Your posts are on the fringe. You retweet conspiracy theories. Inspirational retweets from Kayleigh?? There's someone to look to for integrity. Anyone that can look at trump and see a good man/Christian is lying to themselves.

You don't get it Birx....Trump only likes happy talk...about him.
Why don't they leave this man alone they make themselves look bad not Trump
You know President Obama isn't in office, right? Why aren't you using the current numbers? Or compare it to GDP? Pres Obama 8 years added $9 trillion to the debt. trump...$7trill in less than 4 years. Winning👍 silly metric to evaluate by anyway.
Of course it goes without and anyone who has worked an election knows valid signatures are required.  But this is the kind of stupid remark one has to suffer when listening to trump supporters
I’m starting to think it might be a good thing for Biden to debate Trump. It would create a good comparison in cognitive ability.
You're giving trump waaay too much credit...I don't think he even knows enough about the constitution to have any feelings about it. He is ignorant and fine with that.
Pretty craven and low behavior....but in these days, nothing is beneath Trump!
Wasn't that Trump's idea?
Trump could you shut up for just a day
Not only CAN'T Trump read, he clearly can't understand facts or refuses reality if it doesn't jive with his delusions!
“It will not be a platform for criticism of the government....and it will not be allowed to mess with Trump’s campaign moving forward.  It’s a matter of “Privacy and Security” of our Great Leader.”  What has Microsoft agreed to do?
My 82 year old mom is a GOP member and voted for trump in 2016. She will be #votingforBiden #RepublicansforBiden #RidenWithBiden2020.
Some of these Fox morons are playing into their soon-to-be competitors hands...OAN/Trump News will soon be having their lunch and halving their revenues.
Trump really doesn’t care about sending kids back to school...He merely wants them “warehoused” so parents can go back to work...assuming there are jobs to go back to.
That is pretty damn funny and probably the most hypocritical thing I’ve ever seen. They have marked Trump for years and never once challenged a policy position it’s always been he’s a racist he’s a sexist with no facts to back it up
Try to stay focused. Not talking BLM/antifa. Am I to assume you're in eastern WA? Inslee has done a very decent job. WA was ground zero for the pandemic and your numbers aren't the worst👍 what states that shut down followed trump? What was his guidance? I remember free MI...
What concessions did Microsoft make?...Violating user data is Trump’s excuse to attack  but let’s be real he only cares about how it’s being used to attack him.  He could have complained earlier if it was a true concern over privacy.
Like the ones that followed trump? Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia...so if a foreign army invaded the US each individual state should develop a plan to protect their own state? trump's failings are painfully obvious. The numbers and divisiveness don't lie.
There was? Please enlighten me. You do know that Dr. Birx came out yesterday recommending schools not reopen until outbreaks are under control. As did Dr. Redfield. trump tweeted this morning that numbers are down and schools need to reopen. Where's he following the experts?
You realize Trump created all those issues right? We’re fighting him. I wonder who is Satans spawn at this point? Don’t be on the wrong side of history.
Can you tell me the last time Fauci briefed the president? Almost 8 weeks ago. Provide where Fauci says trump is doing a good job. Early on he praised the hard work of the task force. Where's trump's mask. If it's up to the states why threaten money if they don't open schools?
How do you propose to stop the spread between state populations when there's no centralized plan? trump would've secured a second term had he acted responsibly. I would hate the thought of a 2nd term, but would've been happy that not as many died and our commerce reopened.
Who's politicizing the data? trump is ignoring the advice of his top 3 scientists regarding masks, HCQ, and school openings. Why are we doing so poorly with combatting the virus? Aside from the HCQ, what trump plan have the dems railed against?
The biggest deal is I don't believe President Obama is in office. You mentioned earlier that dems can't handle/accept that trump won. Seems more that trump and his supporters can't accept that Obama is far more liked and respected. *see the Reagan Foundation's request of trump.
Is the "va thing" in the beginning of his presidency the atrocities happening at Walter Reed? The terrible support veterans were receiving. How about veteran's choice? A program trump takes credit for but was started towards the end of President Obama's 2nd term?
To be honest, all my wounded Warriors homes served under Bush. Were you one of the one's complaining that Obama was reducing troop deployments? Winding down Bush's wars. Please inform me what troops trump has brought home? None. He's maintained the same force levels.
Trump has never been in congress, bud. You mentioned him signing the First Step bill...that's what I'm referring to
Biden has admitted he didn't get everything right, but always did his best. Would "I take no responsibility" trump admit a mistake? He won't retract his statements regarding the central park 5! I am happy he bravely signed a bipartisan bill. Next accomplishment?
🚨🚨🚨we have another simpleton making a complex issue sound simple🚨🚨🚨 You realize the 94 crime bill regards federal inmates. Many of you think it addresses the mass incarceration at large. This bill wasn't trump's idea and was passed with bipartisan support. Bold👍
Indolent? Now THAT is the laziest, tiresome, insular  and predictable explanation usually put forth by selfish, greedy grasping assholes, who blame the OTHER for all of the ills of a culture that knowingly, willfully and deliberately went headlong to Trump and the dark side. Sad
Can Trump reduce the Price of Tik Tok for Microsoft to buy.  Not ethical  ... not that it matters
Nobody is blaming trump for the virus. Only his mishandling of a response. Approximately 13k die per year from aids, which is sad. However, the Obama administration provided $4bill to research and aid to combat aids. Your claim 110k died in 8 years is less than 150k in 5 months👍
Why has Fauci become a hot topic for you guys? He makes recommendations based on current science. If he's so bad why doesn't trump and the gop get rid of him? States don't have to follow his recommendations. Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona didn't
I guess Biden is going to have to drain the swamp when he gets in. Trump just went and filled it up.
You use an opinion piece for your rebuttal? I'll stick with the scientific world and studies at large. I was and am for exploring treatments. HCQ was tested and rebuked. The only proponent appear to be quacks, conspirators, and trumpers. Show me where Fauci says trump follows
Trump is a pig. But he’s a fighter. I’d rather have a fighter then a pansy like Biden. Biden is passive aggressive. Trump doesn’t care, he’ll fight for the US anywhere he goes. It may not be cordial or politically correct but as long as he has the United States back, I am in.
You must not have watched the hearing. Look at the entirety of the hearing and not sound bites and clips from Fox. Why doesn't trump and the GOP act to remove him? Because unlike trump, jordan, gaetz, gohmert, etc... he is respected around the world.
Thanks for this link! Its amazing that anyone could vote for trump knowing what he did with those young girls! Wtf
Wow! Everyone should read this!
Your ignorance is astonishing. Do you believe the likes of "dr" Immanuel or the scientific world (CDC, FDA, VA, WHO)regarding HCQ? Fauci has not said trump has followed his recommendations and has in fact not met with him in nearly 2 months. Free Michigan is promoting safety?
Explain your arguments. Fauci has said that trump has listened to him. Doesn't mean he's following his advice. Does trump wear  mask? Did trump promote the systematic reopening? Does trump still promote HCQ? Why is the US leading the world in death/cases? Because of Fauci? Nope
You didn't answer my question. What message did trump put out there that we're to rally around? Sorry, I don't care to follow a guy for an ideology that has caused far more death than any other country in the world. Show me a "dem" that's promoting rioting and I'll opine. Focus👍
Is this your only claim to fame?  Oh that's right, you're Trump's buddy, the NRA's darling, and the guy who thinks he knows more than women when it come to taking care of their own bodies!!!  ONE TERM CORY!
Start with Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew, Wexner, and Dershowitz.
Negative   You have to vote for someone that can win against Trump otherwise you are throwing you vote away
But, but, but....your "arguments" are not based on reality. I don't remember Fauci recommending to Trump, "sir, don't do anything. It will miraculously disappear. It'll be a beautiful thing."
What was the "fight" that our leader proposed that we should follow? The, "I don't take any responsibility" doctrine? "Masks aren't for me"? It's the state's responsibility...until I say they need to force schools open. Trump's "leadership" is rudderless.
It is a vote against Trump

Ken is one of the reasons I left the GOP. Ken and Trump have never had the high ground. I had some hope for Cory Gardner, be he also showed his true colors very quickly. They all put power and party over country. #ileftthegop
Yep. Just another Trump kiss ass.
Why?  Trump is worse than Covid 19.
Where's the gay shaming?? He looks like he's giving Trump hungry eyes.
Repeat after me Trump will win and I will accept that win 🏆
So, I believe you like this guy for his ideology and not what he has accomplished. His current actions, tweets, and speech are still consistent with his (and father's) racist past. Why is the main GOP distancing themselves from Trump?
That's what you consider a rebuttal? I'm the one in fantasy land? He's a simple president for a simple thinker. More cops have died (by a yuuuge margin) from CV. Seriously ask yourself what has Trump accomplished. How's that wall? His magnificent health plan? American industry?
Oregon looks beautiful... some of the best running trails around.... that is when the city isn’t being burned to the ground.  Trump’s “little green men”, saved that city from going to complete hell.
I'm the uneducated one?? Says the guy that posts a tired meme that makes my point. You don't merely disagree with Democrats. Read what you post, retweet, and who you support. I do give Trump credit...he's made it way easier to recognize the ignorant and racist 👍
I see you are in CO like me, I’m in Doug Co which is pretty red and I don’t see any Q stuff... Trump flags here and there, but that’s wild. (Do they think JFK Jr would be a Repub?
I don’t use tiktok, but if trump makes it illegal to use it, we’ll lose videos like this and no one should be alright with that

Yes, he should not debate unless Trump shows his taxes...ENOUGH!!
I left the GOP the date after Trump was nominated. Any party that stood behind that idiot was no party I could be a part of. Since then I realized I will never go back. I am now blue through and through.
No..but who are racist support trump
2019: Ew, you have tiktok? Haha cringe  2020: Mr. Trump, if you BAN tiktok I will personally break your fucking kneecaps with a baseball bat while your family watches
Talking about "educating" people, I see you believe Trump signed the Veteran's Choice bill. Wrong... he extended the bill president Obama signed. You choose to hear things the way you want to hear them.
A conspiracy theorist is what you're going to base your argument on? Ask yourself seriously...is the whole world conspiring because they hate Trump? Far easier to just vote in lieu of letting 100's of thousands die. Keep the good doc's number in case you get CV👍
Or ask about this please - it should fit right in with your absurd narrative -  For the first time in a week, there were zero clashes between law enforcement and protestors in Portland last night.  Why?   Trump's federal agents left.
Trump should fire Fauci and hire Dr Gold.
Ummmm...no? The US has strict guidelines for the use of medicine and medical devices. Doctors have never been free to not follow science and do as they will. The virus is being handled differently because the WORLD hates Trump...shhhh🤫
I'll help you..."they" are the VAST majority of the medical world. All the legitimate studies that concluded this opinion. It's amazing people would believe hundreds of thousands of medical professionals are hiding a magic cure just to stick it to Trump.

Remember when you called trump " a fraud"?  What has he possibly done that would make you --or anyone  capable of conscious thought--think any differently 3 1/2 years later?  He gets worse every damn day.
We would have had half that already paid for if Trump wasn't doing his Trump thing....FAILING!
The biggest thing I’ve noticed is nationalism vs globalism. That was the entire premise that Trump ran on in 2016. You’ll find a lot of racism rooted in nationalism, especially white nationalists.
If Trump redesigned the Protests would stop ..... until they realized Pence was there
So you support President Trump and Republicans? As you can see from yesterday at the Furneral the Racists are on the Left.
Let me guess...  Ted Nugent, Scott Baio, Diamond &amp; Silk, Chuck Woolery, etc... Oh wait. That’s Trump’s A list speakers.
You have to stay strong. The alternative to Trump is so much worse. He's trying but so many forces are against him.
New York restaurant owner canceled for flying Trump flag | Fox Business
Hard to disagree. I felt the same way during the first impeachment. It’s a sad day when I’d take Pence as president. But after Trump has tried to sabotage the election, he’s infringing on our constitution. We need to uphold our democracy no matter the cost.

It doesn’t make any sense to me. It blows my mind how people can insist  Trump isn’t racist when he continues to use such degrading terms.
This is serious .... Trump needs to be thrown out of office along with his dregs
Hey Kevin, arguing with someone that peddles in conspiracies like Carole is pointless. You can use facts and data all day long and it wouldn't matter. It's just a worldwide conspiracy because people don't like Trump 🤣 just happy I don't live in Texas.
The "model" you quoted came out months after the pandemic started from the WH. It was a guesstimate on how many COULD have died. What national plan was implemented to curb the numbers? Do you recall Trump said it's up to the individual states? I'm sorry, but you sound foolish.
Don, with respect for the great work you're doing, this is not a useful approach. Trump wants to kill USPS as we know. But more funding now is not the answer. His hand-picked USPS leader is openly &amp; intentionally ordering employees to slow service. He must be removed immediately!
I would rather have a whole neighborhood of  than one neighbor who is a Trump! Except your sister. I would rent her a room😁
So it turns out the owner of this drive-through coffee business that has Trump n’ Jeeziz n’ guns bumper stickers all over is also a casual homophobe. Who would have guessed.No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.

Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn’t cared if you died fr so
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
Meadows is leading Trump around by the nose.
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
We could be at or near a point like this right now.  People continue to obsess over someone that is gone from politics, and who was investigated before they left.this is happening in part because the message "lock her up" was such a passionately successful one for trump that 4/5
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
Are they protesting Trump's environmental policies that harm unborn babies?
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.
Can’t face palm hard enough. Jeez   To a white, *almost* middle aged man suburbanite in the “heartland” the Trump years have been...enlightening in some respects
I'm in Denver. I see 4 Trump signs for every 1 Biden sign
Trump~instead of making us great, he’s made us ineffable
I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
I’ve had two people tell me that Beyoncé stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
Certainly Obama's is bigger than Trump's.
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.
Breaking News: Trump just announced his Health Care Plan.
Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. 😊
Foreign powers meddling in our elections yet again. Cue radio silence from trump
Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.
Has anyone considered Trump telling his negotiators not to reach a a deal on unemployment, etc. so that he can be the one that “saved the day” with an executive order and then blame Dems for not being able to reach a deal?

Trump wins in court about as often as the Knicks.   last win was March 11.
Just saw this tinder bio   “Pretty girls like Trump”  Me when I see a pretty girl
Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.
So Trump issued an executive order today that puts a stop to...himself?  #TrumpLandslide2020 my ass.
If it wasn’t seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn’t Trump’s defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?
Donald Trump’s Donors Receive Ominous Warning About Becoming 'Don's Next Con' | HuffPost
In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden
Trump is doing what he does to win the election  Lie Cheat Corrupt  Lie Putin Corrupt Lie Intelligence NOT! More bronzer Lie PUTIN
“Fake president trump”
Interesting...it doesn’t look like Trump is wearing a lifejacket in these rising waters 🤷🏼‍♀️
Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.
So trump is pro ACA, right?

The hot shots in your town who got an “early edge" are the ones everybody hates because of it. Big houses, fancy cars, pull with the local authorities... Yet the same haters shill for Trump bc... why? Why is he any different than the rich and famous in your town?
None of you people know what you’re talking about. Talk about low information voters. I love Trump but some of his supporters are lost in a cornfield 🤣.
The biggest threat were facing in the 2020 election is Donald Jerk Trump
I'm a christian and did not vote for Trump morals, integrity and common sense are valuable to me. He doesn't hold any of the values of Christianity and is not humble or a believer in God, Jesus, repentance or the bible.
Was wondering where Trump’s African American had been hiding. He might be Security, not sure
Is this a joke? We lost 40 million jobs under Trump.
I imagine every person who grew up in the Cold War reads this and thinks, “When did America let these guys decide who we elect?”  #facepalm

Yes. My mask says fuck trump on it. I wear it with pride!
Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let’s make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
Yo Jason. You’re a smart guy. It’s already the law. I have no idea what Trump thinks he is doing as he is simultaneously in federal court trying to eradicate Obamacare which covers pre-existing conditions. You are lunatics operating in some fringe reality. #TrumpHasNoPlan

So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

Just like Trump, schools are not even pretending to try.👹
Just like Trump has no plan to stop COVID19. We are officially the country with no plan. It is a common theme!👹
Did Trump say we wouldn’t see him for a while?  Or is that just another disappointing lie?

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
President Trump is suspending student loans for now, tricking you, just to get your vote! Only two terms for POTUS. Don't fall for it! You students will still be in depth, with interest! Be wise, He is not on your side! Go with the forgiveness, Democrat! More possible.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he’s going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.

I’ll only use Reels if trump threatens to ban it
Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump’s best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Hey Mr Biden. We can’t let trump do ANYTHING else. I’ve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It’s imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn’t expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
. did it first and better. It’s called the Affordable Care Act - the law that Trump is fighting to overturn via the Supreme Court.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.

Our suffering for Trump’s failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives — and it has been squandered by one man’s incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn’t seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I’m not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community’s assessment, the president said, “The last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.”  Pressed on the matter, he said: “I don’t care what anybody says”
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn’t make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!
Trump’s brilliant new healthcare plan is...Obamacare?! 🤣🤣🤣 #copolitics #ThanksObama

Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.
Wow, President Trump attempting to provide real relief to people while Democrats continue to try and destroy everything in their path.

Having failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump will now create Obamacare by executive order.
I dont know him personally.  But I know who Roy Cohn is and I also know most people in NYC despise Trump for his constant lying, attention grabbing, constant lawsuits and threats of same, and for stiffing contractors.

Uh, that's what Obama did.  Until Trump and republicans changed it.  Break it, Fix it then call it a win....
You’re trump
Thank you so much for not giving air time to Trump in his fake press conference this evening! I'm proud of you for not giving in to his need for attention.
This is where she got her 'talking' points, off a trump video.
what's up with Trump using your version of Live and let sure at his recent Ohio tomfoolery ?
Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.
I've got to believe if you called Merkel, Macron,  Trudeau, and nealy any of our allies, they'd all like to see Trump's fat ass out of the Oval Office.
He’s been on a rant about how Trump intentionally pronounced it that way because that’s how people in other countries pronounce it and he’s more cultured than the rest of us 🥴
3/3 preferred that Mr. Trump be defeated in November and was weighing whether to take more aggressive actions in the election.

Trump=Evil
Trump doesn't have anything to apologise for don't you get that?
Trump taking credit for insurance companies covering preexisting conditions is LITERALLY TAKING CREDIT FOR A PART OF THE ACA.
It is the soldier who is killed for a Russian bounty which doesn’t bother trump at all apparently
interesting the stuff trump has done is ok but this is where Liberty “ university” draws the line
in Trump University 😂 stable genius indeed.🥴
for someone that thinks they're so smart you really have no idea how business works do you? I don't have any knowledge of business but even I understand that Trump provided a name, a product and some funding.. and that was probably the extent of his involvement.
You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?🤔. Wanna clarify that?
Mary Trump  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
I blocked her. When she pulled the race religion card, I knew exactly who she was. A racist bigot. To think someone like trump is smart, a man who has done everything to bring the KKK back tells me exactly who she really is. #RidinWithBiden2020
Then, a little closer to home, there is Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, Steve Miller, Mitch McConnel, William Barr, and didn't I just see Steve Bannon ducking around the corner?
I heard an awful story that a BLM protester got life in prison from some tRUMP supporting judge. It's something about him pouring red paint on a bld. Only in tRUMP's America can something  like this happen - if it's true.
Trump has cleaned out the treasury and is about to slash SS and Medicare. He's billed the public for over $3,000,000 in golf rentals and fees against the Secret Service budget. You're laughable.
The asshole Trump is depending on to wreck the Postal Service doubles down and then some
LMAO  finally realizing and admitting how #antifa is a literal domestic terrorist group. All after defending them for months and allowing them to freely roam and terrorize his city while condemning Trump for it. These are your politicians folks.No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn’t call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you’re despicable.
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
While Trump has his press conference about an “Executive Order” on pre -existing conditions, he moves on the Post Office and decapitates it’s management.    WE ARE THIRTY DAYS PLUS OR MINUS BEFORE BALLOTS GO OUT.

Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
If tell them to fuck off! That’s what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!
Trump enterprise and crime family.. emoluments, stealing from kids cancer charity, the Hatch Act.. shall I go on?
Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.
Trump’s tax cut was great for the middle class!  You didn’t write this tweet - you couldn’t even say it w/o floundering.  You’re looking more &amp; more ridiculous &amp; Trump is running circles around you. Where’s Hunter? Why isn’t Hunter campaigning for you?
It was Trump at his best!  He bitch slapped the enemy press &amp; the audience loved it!  Who needs rallies?  MAGA Landslide On The Way!
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.
The "bailout / stimulus" should help the common working people... NOT CORPORATIONS !!!! NOT A WEST WING REMODEL !!! NOT A ROSE GARDEN MAKEOVER !! NOT A FBI BUILDING REMODEL !!!      (next to your Trump Hotel) NOT YOUR HIGH-DOLLAR BUDDIES!! TAKE CARE OF THE AMERICAN WORKER !!!
Who else is weary of BOTH sides of the aisle jumping up and down screaming "Trump can't do THIS or do THAT" while Komrade Trumpski does whatever the flip he wants.  Usually without any REAL repercussions, thus  encouraging him to keep up what WORKS for him personally.  C'mon!
#PostalService worked, Trump broke it by putting in buddies, like so many other divisions.

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
How has he done with the tRump virus? The families of the dead are waiting to know!
I guess I was mistaken. I blamed it on China. Is it Trump's fault in all the other countries, too?
In case you missed it, here’s the REAL reason Trump is pushing so hard for a payroll tax cut.  Hint: It helps Big Business‼️
Especially when our economy is the worst it’s been under Trump since the Depression.
“Good faith negotiations”⁉️ Does anyone else think this is Trump and the Rs behind the scenes⁉️
My ppl: I’m a PhD w/friends: academics, psychiatrists, medical doctors, nurses, Los Angeles to NYC. Small town to big city. One a religious ethics scholar from Vanderbilt. Many of us all can diagnose mental instabilty. None. NONE in my circle will tolerate crazy=TRUMP
Trump is doing WAY more than that for Russia‼️
The really stupid thing is that there's no way for the postal service to know which ballots are Republican ballots and which are Democratic ballots.  Trump didn't think this through to the end -- AGAIN!
Trump. Is. Corrupt. Period.
Those aren't facts.  It's the way you twisted to make it seem like it was Democratic governors.  Who had the intel and the heads up that this virus was out there?  Who, even today, refuses to tell the truth about the virus?  WHO DO AMERICANS BLAME -- TRUMP!
Is your argument that Trump is Australian or that he merely speaks *like* Australian on occasion?  Hey Dinesh, How do they pronounce "sycophant" and "toady" in London?
She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
Like the Trump Foundation, the NRA leaders will be held accountable for the corruption &amp; grift that has taken advantage of your members. And we're okay seeing the money from your cold, (metaphorically) dead hands.  Buh-bye.
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine “I wish her well” doesn't bother you?
Sorry Rick. I have to disagree. Trump really had no clue, no National Plan. The only thing he did was try to blame others.
The one thing Russia can't do is bring 160,000 people back from the dead!  Trump will always have botched the pandemic, and he will continue to try to ignore it, only addressing it in terms of PR for his re-election!
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.
Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.
Me too!  Dems are capable of doing anything to win.  Trump will win if it’s fair.
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
I saw my first people at King Soopers wearing Trump masks!  The irony of it all was just so delicious it was hard to take.
Dude, the poorer, less educated, home bound people are Trump's BASE! Only they believe he's a cosmopolitan, educated billionaire.  60% of us know he won't prove it by releasing his transcripts &amp; taxes. We know he's a mobster who lies &amp; bullies to get his way.  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Give it up, please.  This nursing home narrative is nothing more than a trumpie diversion from Trump's failures.  We all see that, now.
I almost forgot to send you this today. You must be reminded that your complete and udder incompetence and abuse of power is bullshit!!! I hope you get sued out of office. And quit blaming President Trump for you mistakes!!! #wrongforcolorado
I suspect Trump is well aware of DNA's persuasive potential.  I suspect he's had personal encounters with it in the past.  Anyone with that many NDAs and lawsuits must have!
Trump continues to flout social distancing guidelines even as he urges others to follow them
Trump hates y’all so much he had to create help create jobs fir y’all
I hope they are all trump voters.
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
Please introduce legislation for funds to ensure Colorado style mail-in efficiency nationally. Colorado should lead by offering to  share with any  the infrastructure that has made mail-in voting wildly successful in our great state.  NO  GOP excuses for Trump's defeat #Biden2020
Interesting take.  And all along I had thought it was God's punishment for electing Trump.
This is the whole reason for seperation between Church &amp; State. So no candidate can claim to be "Gods chosen candidate". Trump is trying to anoint himself as such because you may dislike him, but a vote for him is a vote for God...
Been hearing this for four years. Just like building the wall, lowering prescription costs, coronavirus disappearing.....  Trump is full of shit and you eat it up.
You can't be happy if you worship money and power above all.  Just look at Trump; a picture of misery.
This might help:
Watch Out For Failed Trump’s Next Bizarre  Move. The Narcissist is Losing Control Of America and  Often when narcissistic abusers are losing their mask, they grasp at straws and play dirtier than ever. #Biden2020
Trump's religious when it comes to his little, tiny eternity and his minuscule immortal soul.  He'll accept Jesus if that means he can get into Heaven.  He's terrified of Hell.  Other than that he doesn't have much use for religion.
Force of nature? What BS. Trump is more like a force against nature.  It'll be interesting to watch #FoxNews be buried in news cycles after the #BidenLandslide because we won't care what they say since it's all #FakeNews.
He can't. State charges do not operate under same guidelines as the DOJ. They CAN indict a sitting president and there is no commutation or pardon under these laws. Buh bye Jabba the Trump!
Trump should stop what Clinton started and Obama grew in enforcement.

You are pathetic. Trump lies with every word he speaks and want look for any misspoken words to distract from the real issue. We need a president who doesn't lie to us. A president who takes action to save Americans not kill us.
Over 160,000 of us are dead.   Where’s Trump and the Republicans?  Three day weekend!
As Trump pull the US out of international deals, agreements and organizations, do you know who fills the void?  You know who signs the deals and becomes a partner? China!  Trump is making this China's century. Just so you can understand, C-H-III-N-A.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.

Trump virus 🦠 Thighland
Health care would take work by Trump and that’s not happening ever.
Can you just hush...at this point folks who hate Trump bad enough will vote for you and hopefully that will be enough but talking is hurting you more than helping you most of the time 🥴🤦🏽‍♀️
At least Trump does it on purpose...
I dreamt last night that it was November and Trump lost the election. I felt a physical weight lifted off my shoulders. I can’t wait for November. Let’s get back on track!
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
How about you stay home and don't vote. I'll vote for whomever I choose by mail in ballot. Except I won't mail it I'll drop it off. We don't have to vote for Trump it's not your beloved Mother Russia with a forced vote.
Leave it to creative types to invent a world where Trump is “sweating” prosecution enough to retain the presidency for life. You people are insufferable...
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.
Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?
The GOP sold themselves out to become Trump's party just to own the libs  You chose to sink or swim with him - now you live with that decision

Congress is pathetic for letting this happen. "Trump is imposing a new 10 per cent tariff on Canadian aluminum imports":
Donald Trump’s major donor who’s slowing mail delivery hurts people who need prescriptions, operate their businesses, and vote in our elections. The USPS must return to their previous processes and access the money from the CARES Act now!

Stupidest thing I’ve read all day, and that’s tough to accomplish in Trump America... congrats!
The big tech companies don't define truth but they can sure tell when Trump &amp; his sycophants (like YOU) are lying. Stop lying and spreading misinformation, and you'll have no issues with social media.
Unlike Melaria who would like to thank her speech writers copy and paste or tRump who doesn’t have a coherent thought!
Unlike tRump who just gets mad and walks away!
Mitch McConnell is evil, he don't care about American middle class, actually all Republicans, but president Trump is a great president.
Are we just being punked? Like is Trump one day just going to pull of the mask and it's Andy Kaufman?
What's funny here is the fact that Trump is oblivious too: God is omnipotent, and therefore unable to be hurt.
enough with the childish nicknames.. if you want trump to be taken seriously, stop following his ridiculous vernacular and show how a grown up acts.. oh wait..
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
Trump can't even read tbh
Still a trump voter. spare us all
Trump is LYING? Naaaah, that couldn't be.
This is without question the most asinine thing you’ve ever articulated. Do you not see it just suggests that you’re looking for an excuse to vote for Trump? What the hell, SE?
Any #MSM covering these events should cut away as soon as he finishes reading from the notes he's obviously never read before. STOP GIVING TRUMP FREE AIR TIME!!!
Silvervii has such a raging hatred of Trump that he can’t reason logically any more. Over $1 million in damage is not “petty vandalism”. Homelessness has been on the rise in Denver since the failed Road Home exacerbated by legalized pot. The Left thrives on divisiveness.
I wear my Trump 2020 mask/ Trump 2020 shirt/ Back the Blue shirt or any other item that I think will piss off the snowflakes every time I go in somewhere public.  I’ve definitely gotten more positive comments than negative, but I love making the liberals react! Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸!!!
If his VP pick is the sticking point, you really need to look at yourself in the mirror and wonder why you think Trump is even an option.
Trump is going to be pissed
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
OOOO do the trump foundation now!
Trump was more interested in protecting Confederate statues than protecting Americans from COVID-19.
It does as long as a Trump enabling sycophant is left in office. At this point I'm so disgusted with the  that I'll never #vote Republican again. They, along with #Trump have failed America.
This is the strongest argument for showing that Trump is manipulating weak-minded religious people for support. The Bible itself says that we should be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Boy do they have that backwards.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.
Trump is losing it.

The comparison between Obama and Trump is awesome and scumbag 🌹💋
I agree with you about media, my mom is a Trump voter, and we discussed this the other day. CNN, Fox, MSNBC have all become political commentary rather than news. I read both CNN and Fox, among others, daily and try to piece the important information to form my own opinion.
"Pro-life" would be a lol if it wasn't such a hypocritical label for an ideology that is anything but. 162,000 and counting very preventable American deaths from COVID-19. Guess that's on you  Mike Pence, since Trump doesn't take responsibility and you were on the task force.

Fixed it:  BREAKING: Trump said he expects to sign orders on Friday or Saturday extending enhanced unemployment benefits and imposing a payroll tax holiday, WHICH HE CAN’T LEGALLY DO‼️
I wouldn't argue, closed minds don't listen anyway. There could be photo evidence of Trump breaking the law, and his supporters would make some excuse for why he didn't break the law. It's quite a phenomenon. You've been pleasant, I truly hope have a great day. 🙂
This is well worth the listen.  Nancy Pelosi calls out Andrea Mitchell for allowing another Trump media distraction
All the trump-related arrests and trials‼️
A remarkably confessional closing line from a Trump supporter: "In fact, the GOP has long been the party it is today, just waiting for Trump to come along. That’s the hardest truth of all for the Never Trumpers to accept."
Oh dear. You really need to stop drinking the Jabba the Trump kool aid. By this time next week he will be indicted by the State of New York for a variety of crimes. He'll look fabulous in orange.
Certainly NOT The Trump Organization. Gun ownership and NRA membership are not mutually exclusive, and the NRA was clearly not using the money to fight for anyone's gun rights like they should have been. Not everything has to be a partisan political issue.

Agree.  I do think there is a preponderance of evidence.   Nothing has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to my knowledge, but with so many allegations of sexual assault against Trump, a preponderance requires a 50% chance any is true.  I think that condition is met.
Thank you Letitia James! All of you NRA supporters put money right in LaPierre's pocket while thinking he cared about your gun rights. The same way Trump is taking advantage of you, but you don't learn.

Nope. His.

Fox News, "My view is that schools should be open," Trump said. “If you look at children, children are almost — and I would almost say definitely — but almost immune from this disease.” He added that children have "much stronger immune systems" and "just don't have a problem."
I heard that demon semen is the reason for women getting ovaries. I don’t know if it’s true, but Donald Trump Jr promoted the doctor that claims this so I doubt it’s false.
I’m not that curious/interested in who your choice for VP is - you will never be elected. No one  on your List is capable of being president &amp; you definitely aren’t.  We’re in good hands w/Trump for 4 more yrs. No one cares who the dem VP nominee will be.
I agree with you Jocelyn trump is the biggest racist prejudice hypocrite hitler wannabe president this country has. Cause of him the coronavirus has gotten worse that retarded piece of shit. Is so goddamn stupid. I am surprised no one has taken him out yet. He deserves prison
I agree with you 100%. Trump is the biggest racist hypocrite bastard. That dumb shit can’t put a sentence together without it being a lie. This country has hitler as president. That retarded asshole needs to be locked up for the rest of his life. Cause him the virus is everywhere
There goes President Trump trying to kill Americans again.  So how much do you think he owes Putin?
Hi Wayne. Is Jonathan of Trump interview fame any relation?
New Norm in Trump Country
Trump's account is locked until he deletes a BS tweet about kids being immune to COVID.   It's about fucking time.
why isn’t it news when Republicans working for Trump are trying to exploit Kanye West’s mental illness?  Trying to put him on the Colorado ballot?   What is wrong with people?   Don’t you want to know?
The Kardashians and Donald Trump are taking advantage of a mentally ill man.  How despicable can they be?
no debates until Trump releases his tax returns, and his Huuuuge HealthCare plan.
Right? When I see anything in support of Trump, the first thing I think is that person is an idiot!
Trump owns an interest in the pipeline and he owns the judge. Is the decision a surprise to anyone?
People a few houses down just put a Trump/Pence sign in their front yard.  They also belong to a biker club called BARI (Bikers against radical Islam), so we're pretty sure they're racists!
Trump tried to cut COVID-19 funding to everyone but Texas and Florida — now lawmakers are demanding answers -   needs to be impeached again.
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
Poor Michelle - Trump is causing her to be depressed &amp; have low-energy! Get a grip!  There are Americans right now w/o jobs/businesses/homes/$. Trump beat your corrupt husband &amp; ur constant demonizing of him isgetting old.Thank God now for a prez &amp; 1st Lady that love this country
He should say, "I haven't had a doctor recommend that test for dementia to me!"    Trump thinks it's an IQ test!
They honestly think that POC will just vote for Kanye because of the color of his skin!  They're not dumb, like Trump supporters!
Thanks for the Truth!  We need more courageous celebrities to speak up about what is happening  w/the destruction of our country as we know it, as the democrats totally deny &amp; ignore.   If you hate Trump believe me you will hate Socialism/Marxism more.
You state all of the reasons why people should vote for Trump.  Great work Michael
You just mad that most celebrities don’t fuck with trump
To my Twitter friends who might STILL be Trump loyalists... we luv ya, guys, but SERIOUSLY, can you STILL vote for this man? Consider his total DISREGARD for the safety of you &amp; your LOVED ONES?  This DOLT only wants to enrich himself.  Screw our kids?
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
We must all register to get our mail-in ballot, then do our best to turn it in personally to an official &amp; well guarded drop-box. That’s the only way to not stand in line for hours and secure that our votes count. We have absolute power to counter all of Trump’s I’ll intentions
He sure the fuck has not. tRump has done nothing for anyone except himself and Putin.
The easiest way to counter Trump is to hold a mirror to his comments because they are always about projection, especially when they are lies.
Cults always have great enthusiasm for their dear leader. Unfortunately for trump, his cult is shrinking.
I've been referring to attendees of Trump rallies, and now school children, as weaponized w/ the #COVID19 virus to infect family &amp; friends. This will create more chaos going into the election, which Putin wants.
Will NEVER vote republican again due to Trump and the Republican Party turning their back on decency and our constitution. Only voted for the D's in the 2016 election. Will do the same in 2020. They make me ill to see what they stand for now. #notarepublicananymore
CNN To Trump: Jim Acosta Talks To Covid-19 Task Force ‘More Than You Do #Biden2020
I agree. No need for any debates.  has all the leverage. With Trump requesting conservative moderators and still no tax returns, Joe can demand tax returns and moderators he wants. Otherwise, no debates to show Trump  slinging lies and bull shit all over the stage.
I'm here to defeat Trump and help lift Biden to the Presidency. #Biden2020  #NoComradesUnder1k
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
He’s sane, he’s smart, he’ll trust experts and be inclusive. It won’t be trump family crookery. I can’t wait.
Either does Trump....lol watching the deficit go up and up and up!
All Republicans leaders know how to do is project their own miserable failings onto Democrats. Who politicized COVID-19? Trump. Who politicized wearing masks? Trump. Who doesn't care if Americans die? Trump. Who supports Trump at every lying turn? Republicans.
Congress demands Trump administration release its vaccine-distribution plan
She testified under oath. Trump can’t because he lies as he breathes.
Trump can't even read tbh
I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
Love these fellow veterans speaking out against trump. We know how to identify an enemy, whether it’s foreign or domestic.
I think it’s shameful that Trump would not allow any of the Democratic co-sponsors to attend the bill signing.   And you did nothing to call that out.   Bipartisan, my foot.
I don’t care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.
And he’s still beating trump😂
And yet he’s still beating trump😂
President Trump Fires 'Deep-Swamp' Officials - Donald Says They "Betrayed American Workers" By Outsourcing Jobs ⁦ - BOOM YOU’RE #FIRED!!!
But the President isn't making a speech, Donald Trump is accepting the nomination as the Republican candidate for President.  That is, by the very definition, political campaigning.
Throw all the numbers you want, that doesn't make us expendable. Sure, it would shake things up but the void will be filled. At the rate Trump and his cabal are running things, we could very likely see it.  Are you getting the point?
These events are not news conferences. They are FREE Trump re-election pressers. He gets exposure &amp; sound bites for #FoxNews to share with Trump's base.  Please stop reporting on them as news conferences.
These are not news conferences. The are FREE Trump ads for his re-election. He gets free exposure to a mass audience while generating sound bites for #FoxNews to push to The Base.
Of all the treasonous crimes committed by Trump, this could be the largest to date.
They have nothing better to do than do nasty tweets like their puppet master Trump!💋🌹
Trump makes decisions based on knowing #RightFromWrong. The problem is he only does what is wrong. #BadPresident
The President is exempt, but not White House employees.  So unless Trump is going to set up the podium, camera, etc. himself....
Trump and his supporters own this.
Michelle realizes Joe Biden looks more inept by the day &amp; won’t be elected &amp; Her husband was the most corrupt president  ever.  But it’s so much easier to blame Trump bc she knows he will win in Nov &amp; lead us for 4 more more yrs.
Let's not forget that Fusion GPS was hired by the GOP.   After Trump won the nomination the GOP dropped Fusion and they were picked up by Democrats.  Let us also not forget that the Mueller report explicitly called out several cases of "collusion" and did not exonerate Trump.
Ha!!! This is a must!! President Trump took one back when the Democrats said he wasn’t fit!! Well Okd Joe you ain’t fit. You are a Puppet in a Liberal Socialist Marxist run party
America is trying. Maybe you shld get the virus to believe it’s real. People are afraid and trump doing nothing to build trust. You either.
If you are black and Hispanic or of any other origin. Don't fool yourself they don't care about you either. And if you walk and stand with Donald Trump you're a fool.
Biden should most definitely debate trump. Even if it was a video zoom type event. If Biden says no, trump will run with that.
It also isn’t another opportunity for you to get the most you can for yourself and Trump‼️‼️‼️ Especially at the cost of people who are truly suffering‼️‼️‼️ Try to find the last remaining piece of your heart...if it’s still there‼️‼️‼️ #KeepFighting

If trump got COVID-19 and was in the hospital on a ventilator what would be your response?
In today's news, Fuck Joe Biden.
Let me guess, one of Trump's cabinet members has a son or daughter on the SEC?  I'm just spit balling.
Christine, it’s unfortunate that Trump learned so much from Clinton and Biden, but if what you say about Trump is true, then they taught him well. He would have learned from the best.
He sounds more coherent than Trump.  Low bar, I agree.  You do do know he stammers, right?  So it's not surprising he stumbled over 'fitness' and if you're trying to make him look bad on that basis you have sunk pretty low.  No surprise, there.
My border collie is literally smarter than the Trump supporters who believe this crap. I’d rather see her vote count 🤣
The easter bunny used the power of their minds to tell me that a culprit is being sought after a smelly trump lingered in the last cabinet meeting #HasToBeHunt
Funny how a lot of y’all be talkin shit about trump but y’all riding with FBG Duck lmao he was tellin blacks to get together and start killing Mexicans but that’s some y’all forgot🥴🥴
Mr. President Trump you need to restate that fake news is the enemy of all people
Politically estranged Catholic here. If God was punishing us during Obama, as evangelists said, then why isn't He showering us with rainbows &amp; unicorns under Trump? There's a big difference between faith and stupidity.
Since when did Jabba the Trump care about the law, any law?
No problem. Jabba the Trump has a way of scrambling anyone's brains. You did a superior job in that interview.
Not sure why Trump is so interested in this unless he is expecting to lose in November. Mail in ballots and absentee ballots are the same thing and are not subject to computer hacking.
This is pure fucking ignorance right here. Apparently I’m a racist for supporting Trump. Go ahead and believe what you want with that pea sized brain of yours. Just remember the Dems don’t give a shit about you and are using all of you as pawns
An entire group of mental health professionals came out early on to claim he was unfit! Where did you learn professional ethics? Trump U?
As the election nears, we can expect all of Trump’s “Greatest Hits” to appear: the emails, Obama, name calling. Just yawn and ignore.
Don’t try and argue with these clowns. If you don’t like what they like then your a racist. If you support Trump your a racist. People will continue to play that race card to force their agenda down tour throat
Trump has always shown what a rotten, selfish jerk he is. All it took was a 24x7, dedicated propaganda system (right-wing media), millions upon millions of dollars from donors, and an incredibly gullible republican base to prop him up. Kind of a high maintenance guy, very needy.
Jeremy asked journalists to investigate his Russian-hacked trade documents to see whether there was any truth in his absurd conspiracy that the Tories want to sell the NHS to Trump. We did investigate, and the documents said nothing of the sort
I don't believe kids have a magic genome that protects them from the virus. I do believe we isolated and protected them. I do believe reopening the schools prematurely will  cause many of our children to die. I do believe Trump knows that &amp; doesn't care. Your child or your party?
I’m in the same boat so I very much feel you.❤️ Been fighting Stage 4 bowel cancer for 7.5 years. I really want to be here to see trump lose hugely and do my bit by voting for Joe. I’m sending you all my love and healing consciousness.  I’m here if you ever need someone to listen
The self-sabotaged avian flu scenario in parks and rec was run better than trump’s response to covid-19
its trump fiddling with the charts that sent me hahahah
lmaooooooo i am so so sorry but as soon as trump starts talking i just laugh because he just clearly cannot put together sentences i—
He called trump a bloviated ignoramus
The Netflix series "Immigration Nation" is a must watch for every adult American.  It should cause each one of us to feel shame and endeavor to right the wrongs against immigrants committed by the Trump administration.
Trump believes testing simply uncovered more cases and wanted to suppress it.  We don’t have any nationally orchestrated testing program.  Details on progress on this front would be appreciated at press briefings.
I’m actually not a Trump supporter.
“Manuals, what manuals? “Books, what books?”   Omg. Best Trump interview ever.
When trump becomes a Muslim everyone will finally shut the fuck up
That trump is worse than I could have imagined!
When are you going to address the Trump attack on our country?
"Donald Trump is part of a secret conspiracy to destroy the Republican Party for the next decade" is a lot more plausible that the Q nonsense.
I think Trump has had such a bad year that it'd take a Kamala Harris tier pick to blow it for Biden.
remembering how Joe Kennedy, an adult, claimed he “accidentally” voted yes on a bill that gave Trump access to more nuclear weapons. 🙄  (p.s. this was when he began painting himself as a progressive to try &amp; unseat Sen. Markey, who is truly leftist. Joe’s opposed to cannabis.)
Oh happy day. The trump Kiss of defeat
I was calling Trump “a twit”.  My mistake.
I have no idea how they can argue on behalf of Trump, especially after last night's interview. They are rather special.
Give Trump time. He's still trying to figure out how to spell Lebanon.
You'll believe anything if you think Dems are trying to make Trump look bad. Trump does that all by himself. We just call him out on his nonsense while you turn a blind eye.
#ImmigrationNation watch this show before pussy Trump removes it from Netflix
This fucking guy ... Trump needs to just have a speaker with him at all times the shit coming out his mouth sometimes ...
So, you wouldn’t invite Senator Bennett to the bill signing of the Great American Outdoor’s Act he co-sponsored?  Both of you are such punks, and will be one termers come November.   will take you out Cory.   you Trump.
Reporters that want to be respected and interview high ranking officials should be courteous and call people by their title is what he's saying. That is just how all jobs are. It's just respect no matter the position or job. Trump doesn't earn that though.
It makes me happy to see that they are expressing themselves.   There are bigger things for you to be worrying about Mr Trump then those players.
Shouldn’t a Jedi mind trick work on Trump???  He’s so Weak Minded!!No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn’t call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you’re despicable.
Trump says. "It is what it is." Haha Not funny!
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‘s the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn’t cared if you died fr so
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.
Trump will leave a shart stain.

Anyone that supports traitor Trump is a traitor to the nation. Your racism isn't patriotism, it's just simple evil.
Any doubts Trump is a racist?  Watch this...
Thanks  for doing what had never been done before that Trump is now taking credit for!!! 🤬🤬
Trump’s campaign isn’t even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.
Its Classic #Trump...taking credit for somebody else's work...and thinking nobody would notice...#Trump is still in Grade school.
An STD will be named for Trump.
Day 149: . shared on the air earlier today that 1,000 Americans per day are dying from #COVID19! What is the US President doing? Banning a social media app.    Globally:  Total cases:19,378,036 Deaths:721,324  US: Total cases: 4,941,755  Deaths:161,356
Golfing and lying. What else is new with trump?
Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year’s race.
Who is trump kidding? He is suing against ACA which protects people with preexisting medical conditions in our courts right now. WTF?
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he’s gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal 😉
Trump is planning to issue an executive order to mandate something that is already mandated by law... There I fixed your headline
Baby, if you think Trump gives a shit about you, well, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
Not remotely close.  We are all suffering from Trump induced anxiety and depression.  Exhausted.
Don't you get it people??? This is exactly what #Trump wants...People protest, No Masks, people get sick and die...Then whats Left are #Trumps anti-Christ White supremacy foot soldiers to do his bidding...#Trump wants to be a dictator so bad, he licks his Own Butt!!!
My #Covid-19 inebriated reality has become intertwined with our normal reality...but today's reality has become Surreal.... a  normal inebriated surreal reality??? Thanks #Trump Damn!!! I need a Drink!
#Trump failed at his job, blaming somebody else... I think I am going to sue #Trump for my vote back...I want to be able to vote twice in November...#Trump false advertised himself...
Griffin’s anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with “go back to Africa” comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he’s not a racist.
Exactly! You can’t make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn’t stink as much as Trumps; but it’s still smelly shit 💩
If you’re wondering, it’s probably conceivable. For me it doesn’t come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife “I hope the Russians didn’t have anything to do with this.”
Don’t let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I sat static at approximately 300 followers for a couple of years and it wasn't until this year between the Covid19 and the #BLM Movement that I felt I needed to unify with others against Trump, so I started picking up followers at that point.
Trump be like “I’m gonna repeal Obamacare but ensure they do all the same things and call it Trumpcare”
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun
how can u say this is not a good president?  unemployment thru the new year  #TennesseeValleyAuthority CEo was getting 8 million a year, laid off everyone, made them train they (cheaper, foreign) replacements- trump was like, “hell no”   . 🌩️LoveU Sir
All you supporters talk as if #Trump likes you or something...#Trump only cares about #Trump not even the people he swore to protect..everything he does is for show...If its about the country #Trump could care less about it...That's it...
Did he say "I don't listen to anybody"?  He really believes he is smart and everyone else is dumb, blind and stupid. It is written that satan can't cast out satan, so let's be sure Nov 3 is cast out day.  I'm serious.  I'm exhausted.  No More trump.
A standard #Trump progression: I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it, but I could do it. I did do it, so what? I did do it, and it was right to do it.
#UncleMikeClassic "Hey Margie, you voted for #Trump"??? "Yes dear, I certainly did" "Hey Margie..."?? "Yes Dear..."? "Go Phuck yourself..."!!!
Why is Matt Struck using this account to constantly harass journalists?   Why did the founder of Cowboys for Trump have to return taxpayer funds to Otero County after he took a trip to Washington DC?
Like the King in Greek mythology, Tantalus, who was banished to Hades and forced to stand in water that receded every time he tried to take a drink, I Try to understand #Trump's intricate web of deception only to have its elucidation prevaricate the very existence of it’s ruse…
#Trump Presidential Library
We all voted for #Trump. Hey, what could possibly go wrong???
"Twenty-three postal executives were reassigned or displaced...Analysts say the structure centralizes power around DeJoy, a former logistics executive and major ally of President Trump, and de-emphasizes decades of institutional postal knowledge."
Tweedledee and TweedledDumb #Trump
Judge: "Mr. X you are being charged with Grand Theft larceny and having sex with a goat, how do you plead?" Defendant: Your honor I plead the #Trump defense, I didn't do it" Judge: "Very well sir, you are free to go"
#TrumpaPhites are for a lying cheating self serving psychopath that puts his own interests before the country he swore to protect??? Get Real.. Its not Just Democrats, its All #Americans...I voted for #Trump...and I want him gone...!! What A National Disaster Trump has become!!
Trump is far from a saint!!
Yup, about right...Go ahead and follow #Trump
I get that Trump helped him out so he had to return the favor but I don’t know anybody that orders Pad Thigh or has visited Thighland.
So it feels like this sums up twitter in a nutshell.  I could be wrong. Still new and not fully certain how to use it.  But for those of us who are generally moderate (honestly these days that's anti-Trump) and avoid extremism/inflexible aka unempathic stuff + non-celebs
Your Typical #trump follower!!!
#Trump??? Need we say More???
We in the Military fight for All #Americans...Not for #Trump!!!
Famed apprentice star Donald Trump?
We asked this nice young lady if she was going to vote for #Trump, Her immediate reply was...Hell NO!!!...but we think there's an "F" in there somewhere...Sorry #Trump
Have your life improved in the last 3 years for you to vote for trump?
You voted for #Trump...That makes me HOWLING MAD!!!
This dog voted for #trump in 2016...Now look at him...Don't vote for #Trump

Daily Tribute to #Trump...
Did they get the instant covid 19 test? They better.  I think trump* is a super spreader. Why doesn't he ever catch it with so many around him with the virus.  OR is it covid that's made him a crazy ass fool and no one is telling?
GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
Meadows is leading Trump around by the nose.
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Because Kanye is being used by trump to try to sway the election towards him. We’ll never get out of this mess we’re in if trump gets re-elected.
We could be at or near a point like this right now.  People continue to obsess over someone that is gone from politics, and who was investigated before they left.this is happening in part because the message "lock her up" was such a passionately successful one for trump that 4/5
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
Are they protesting Trump's environmental policies that harm unborn babies?
Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we’re in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What’s there to debate?
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.
Can’t face palm hard enough. Jeez   To a white, *almost* middle aged man suburbanite in the “heartland” the Trump years have been...enlightening in some respects
I'm in Denver. I see 4 Trump signs for every 1 Biden sign
And fucking trump can? You obviously haven’t been watching trump speak!
Trump~instead of making us great, he’s made us ineffable
I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
I’ve had two people tell me that Beyoncé stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
The Dems will exploit the Chinese Virus for political purposes until November 3 when President Trump wins the election. Afterward, they’ll move on to the next fantasy designed to remove a President who can’t be bought, which is what the Dems, RINOs and Deep State hate about him.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don’t.  I love you to death man but don’t fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.

Certainly Obama's is bigger than Trump's.
While Trump has his press conference about an “Executive Order” on pre -existing conditions, he moves on the Post Office and decapitates it’s management.    WE ARE THIRTY DAYS PLUS OR MINUS BEFORE BALLOTS GO OUT.

I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.

The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.
Breaking News: Trump just announced his Health Care Plan.
Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. 😊
Foreign powers meddling in our elections yet again. Cue radio silence from trump
Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn’t accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.
If tell them to fuck off! That’s what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!
Trump enterprise and crime family.. emoluments, stealing from kids cancer charity, the Hatch Act.. shall I go on?
Trump loves the illiterate.
Has anyone considered Trump telling his negotiators not to reach a a deal on unemployment, etc. so that he can be the one that “saved the day” with an executive order and then blame Dems for not being able to reach a deal?

Trump wins in court about as often as the Knicks.   last win was March 11.
Just saw this tinder bio   “Pretty girls like Trump”  Me when I see a pretty girl
Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
Looks like Trump’s border wall
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.
So Trump issued an executive order today that puts a stop to...himself?  #TrumpLandslide2020 my ass.
If it wasn’t seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn’t Trump’s defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?

In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
He can’t breathe in a mask bc he’s exhausted from kissing Trump’s butt
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden

“Fake president trump”
Interesting...it doesn’t look like Trump is wearing a lifejacket in these rising waters 🤷🏼‍♀️
I say this as a former Republican, it’s not enough to get rid of Trump but all those that laid the groundwork that led to him. That happened over a long period of time and getting the GOP or something new to replace it isn’t going to happen overnight because Trump is gone.
Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.
So trump is pro ACA, right?

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let’s make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
Yo Jason. You’re a smart guy. It’s already the law. I have no idea what Trump thinks he is doing as he is simultaneously in federal court trying to eradicate Obamacare which covers pre-existing conditions. You are lunatics operating in some fringe reality. #TrumpHasNoPlan

If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
President Trump is suspending student loans for now, tricking you, just to get your vote! Only two terms for POTUS. Don't fall for it! You students will still be in depth, with interest! Be wise, He is not on your side! Go with the forgiveness, Democrat! More possible.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he’s going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.
Trump has abdicated millions of acres of public lands to private entities. He must be stopped.

Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
The only threat we have to the American ppl is Trump's America and the republicans view for America. This is all happening under the republicans watch. Not Democrats. Dems have no choice but to fight back to keep civil peace and democracy right.
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump’s best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Hey Mr Biden. We can’t let trump do ANYTHING else. I’ve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It’s imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn’t expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.

Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
No doubt they are planning the next set of dirty tricks, can't be too many left.  Nah, Trump is the master of cheating.  That is if someone draws the pictures for him to look at.  Love the census ploy, thanks for the info on that one.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.

Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit

Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn’t seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.

Contradicting the intelligence community’s assessment, the president said, “The last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.”  Pressed on the matter, he said: “I don’t care what anybody says”
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn’t make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!

Thank you so much for not giving air time to Trump in his fake press conference this evening! I'm proud of you for not giving in to his need for attention.
This is where she got her 'talking' points, off a trump video.
what's up with Trump using your version of Live and let sure at his recent Ohio tomfoolery ?
Hilarious transcript from an upcoming Trump-Biden debate:
Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.
I've got to believe if you called Merkel, Macron,  Trudeau, and nealy any of our allies, they'd all like to see Trump's fat ass out of the Oval Office.
He’s been on a rant about how Trump intentionally pronounced it that way because that’s how people in other countries pronounce it and he’s more cultured than the rest of us 🥴
3/3 preferred that Mr. Trump be defeated in November and was weighing whether to take more aggressive actions in the election.
2/3 and Security Center, cited efforts coming out of pro-Russia forces in Ukraine to damage Mr. Biden and Kremlin-linked figures who “are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.” At the same time, the officials said China (cont)
1/3 ~ Russia continues to meddle in the election to aid President Trump, using a range of measures to denigrate Joe Biden, intelligence officials said. In the first public assessment of the 2020 campaign, William Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence (cont.)
Trump=Evil
Trump doesn't have anything to apologise for don't you get that?
Trump taking credit for insurance companies covering preexisting conditions is LITERALLY TAKING CREDIT FOR A PART OF THE ACA.
It is the soldier who is killed for a Russian bounty which doesn’t bother trump at all apparently
interesting the stuff trump has done is ok but this is where Liberty “ university” draws the line
in Trump University 😂 stable genius indeed.🥴
for someone that thinks they're so smart you really have no idea how business works do you? I don't have any knowledge of business but even I understand that Trump provided a name, a product and some funding.. and that was probably the extent of his involvement.
You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?🤔. Wanna clarify that?
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.
Mary Trump  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
I blocked her. When she pulled the race religion card, I knew exactly who she was. A racist bigot. To think someone like trump is smart, a man who has done everything to bring the KKK back tells me exactly who she really is. #RidinWithBiden2020
Then, a little closer to home, there is Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, Steve Miller, Mitch McConnel, William Barr, and didn't I just see Steve Bannon ducking around the corner?
I heard an awful story that a BLM protester got life in prison from some tRUMP supporting judge. It's something about him pouring red paint on a bld. Only in tRUMP's America can something  like this happen - if it's true.
The "bailout / stimulus" should help the common working people... NOT CORPORATIONS !!!! NOT A WEST WING REMODEL !!! NOT A ROSE GARDEN MAKEOVER !! NOT A FBI BUILDING REMODEL !!!      (next to your Trump Hotel) NOT YOUR HIGH-DOLLAR BUDDIES!! TAKE CARE OF THE AMERICAN WORKER !!!
Trump has cleaned out the treasury and is about to slash SS and Medicare. He's billed the public for over $3,000,000 in golf rentals and fees against the Secret Service budget. You're laughable.
The asshole Trump is depending on to wreck the Postal Service doubles down and then some
LMAO  finally realizing and admitting how #antifa is a literal domestic terrorist group. All after defending them for months and allowing them to freely roam and terrorize his city while condemning Trump for it. These are your politicians folks.
Here we go. Here's how Trump sandbags the election. "Analysts say the structure centralizes power around DeJoy, a former logistics executive and major ally of President Trump, and de-emphasizes decades’ worth of institutional postal knowledge." #copolitics
You haven't been citing facts, you have not answered anyone with regards to the rape of a 13 year old girl by Trump. Geezus, lady me calling you sweetie is name calling? I called you dense because your harping on multiple lies and being a bigot.
LIVE: IMPOTUS Trump continues to be an embarrassment.
Who else is weary of BOTH sides of the aisle jumping up and down screaming "Trump can't do THIS or do THAT" while Komrade Trumpski does whatever the flip he wants.  Usually without any REAL repercussions, thus  encouraging him to keep up what WORKS for him personally.  C'mon!
Sooo Trump just decided to do some rails and throw a press conference? What is he up there for?!
#PostalService worked, Trump broke it by putting in buddies, like so many other divisions.

If you're tired of trump racially calling coV-19 the "Chinese virus'" you should report his tweets in hopes they delete his account.
Right, just like Trump likes them 😂
If you’re willing to look away from this and turn a blind eye just because you dislike Trump you may want to ask yourself if it would  have been ok if the administration before Obama did this to him. Whether you like Trump or not, is not what is being questioned here.
I have never liked Trump from the 1970's on. You really are an exceptionally blind individual. You don't like the 2 party system? Then why didn't Bernie run a 3rd party?
Americans die while Trump golfs. Somewhat like let them eat cake?
Libertarians are more or less wild card conservatives and also responsible for the tea party. There's a large number of them involved in QAnon as well, so I'm more or less comfortable with my knowledge of this matter. Including the local libertarian party's support of Trump.
I agree that Trump certainly seems to and it runs in his family.
I guess I meant some people try to make a case for Biden, though I think they are wrong. Bad word choice on my end.   My point is that the Church tells us to vote our consciences, and we have a responsibility to make sure those are well-formed. It doesn't say: Vote Trump or else.
#BREAKING: President Donald Trump has called a last-minute news conference this evening as negotiations on a stimulus package fell apart on Friday.   WATCH LIVE:
Better than the Les Habitantes
Where the fuck is the FBI? Where is NSA? Where is the oversight when they’re in Trump’s pocket too? Including AG Barr. A fair Election is in serious jeopardy and so is democracy.
If Congress doesn’t get it done, what does President Trump do?
When Trump is gone, if Positions are left unfilled because Congress has not confirmed the president’s candidates for over sixty days, the house should be able to fill the spots without interference from the President.
President Trump, our non profit organization is based in Beirut and is well-connected across the Arab world. We can help make sure the donations from the United States are well managed and reach their destination.
It’s shit like this that makes me very nervous about the election. If Trump wins it’ll be because he cheated and this time not only Russia helped, but members of the GOP. I’m disgusted by all of it.
Is Trump banning TikTok so that Mark has a built in audience for a new platform?
Does literally ANYONE believe that Trump said "Thighland" because he's just too fluent in any Indian language? He can barely garble out American English. Let's be real here.

I’m sick of “winning.”   Can we get rid of Trump* now?
President Trump, “one who is anti-Trump hates religion”? ANTIFA terrorists love God? Soros and his Luciferians lure the young to world peace? What do you sense is happening? I was a 60s radical. Those trying to kill Trump and leave the US in ashes are deep cover crisis actors.
I make fun of California as much as the next Coloradan. And I’d gladly move there if it becomes its own country should Trump steal another election.
Of course  has pulled out ALL the stops...America as we know it is ALL but dead if Vladimir Putin's plan is fulfilled. Trump owes his soul to Vlad. Are Americans too lazy or too stupid to care? 160,000 can't vote

That's great in theory. But the reality is that we have trump because trumplicans have been gestating in echo chambers for years. They just emerged from their cocoons in 2016. They don't hear logic. They don't see reason. They don't accept facts.  You cannot reason with them.
You talk a big game. But that really you in the bernie shirt isnt it?   Im sure tou teach your grandchildren well. If their parents were smart they would be kept far from you. But im sure the shithead dosent fall from the tree.  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump

When you find out your dad is a Trump supporter...
The only thing I agree with, is that you 2 are a couple of idiots! Trying to force kids to school during a pandemic which the tRump administration did NOTHING to try to dimish.#TrumpHasNoPlan #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Really hard to make a case for a third party...(a formed conscience need be followed though). "sin of omission" is an interesting analogy for this...as no case can be logically made for Biden, and strong cases can be made for Trump...the 3rd party option close to a throw away
Those tend to be low-info voters who don't care about VP as much as the base, but understand your concern, it could turn out that way, I suppose. Always a cost/benefit and for me the benefits far outweigh potential costs. Agree to disagree on this, as long as Trump is out!
I hear you with regards to Biden constantly undermining himself and I STILL have my Bernie sticker on my car BUT Trump has to lose overwhelmingly (or he and his supporters will try to pull a violent coup) and THEN we push, push, push Biden in the direction we need him to go.
Ummm, are you unaware that this was a joke based upon Trump’s comments that Biden would “hurt god.”
We need Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, etc to help derail Trump too🙏

Reality Winner's Mom Says Daughter Got COVID-19 As Convicted Trump Aides Went Free | HuffPost
This is going to be so interesting.  Trump cannot put a whole sentence together.  He’s a cheerleader but not a leader.  There is a difference.
All I know is this.. any of you who have signed onto team Trump and have not changed your party affiliation to Republican.. you might want to get on that.. because if anything happens to President Trump, or if the election being stolen becomes a reality, Democrat voter rolls
How has he done with the tRump virus? The families of the dead are waiting to know!
Oh good. A Trump “news conference” at 7pm on a Friday. What could possibly go wrong?
The media reports that US Intel has information that Russia is spreading disinformation on Joe Biden. Pardon me, but sounds like a continuation of the 2016 assertion by US Intell that Russia was trying to help Trump win which proved blatantly false.
I presume the  wants to win, and  can energise younger voters to come out and vote. Kasich backing Biden will play like sour grapes to Republicans. I don't think anyone is on the fence in this election, Trump has failed spectacularly, Kasich won't change any minds!
You seem invested in changing the subject. Do you want to just admit that they aren't a terror group and we can move on?  You said something far more interesting than this discussion when you heard "Trump is bad" when I said he was a terrorist.   Do you think terrorism is bad?
Banning TikTok is just a political ploy by Trump Administration. Once you start unraveling the clusterfuck of digital ad business, you realize it does not matter who owns these digital platforms.
I don’t support trump but umm... why mock something like this? Do you not want people to help Lebanon?
But Mr. Prensident what about the Ottawa Senators, remember that had that Tkachuk guy
Trump's ads are just...disgusting.
You’re a good person.  I enjoy reading your posts.  Don’t pay attention to those who attack you.  Trumpanzees are as bad as Trump and it will change in November. Keep doing what you are doing, we’re here for you!
Agreed. I'm as anti-establishment as they come, but I do not want to be fighting Trump anymore. My vote is clear, and then I'll spend the next 4 years tearing down the candidate I voted for.
The boneheads at the motorcycle gathering in Sturges will be getting the virus and bring it back to all the places they came from. We thought trump is stupid. These morons just do not care. Way to go Harley Davidson and company.
Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
God I wish Trump would magically go away.
Not when it's obvious people were in a flurry to create fakes to prop up Trump's argument. Or the fact all early videos with identifiable time stamps lack your apparent missile. If you want me to assume you were involved in those anon postings I can.
1 in 5 Coloradans currently can’t affford to pay rent/mortgage. 1 in 3 people can’t either in some parts of the US.   Meanwhile, big corporations, churches, and the top 1% are raking in billions in relief funds. Donald Trump does not care about the working class. He never did.
I think they jumped the gun on that one
It’s because the leader of the free world posts lies and garbage.  Twitter and Facebook is not the official Trump media outlet.  Fox is state TV and they do enough to relay Trumps lies.
When states start reclosing, and schools aren't re-opening, and Trump is admitting masks help, SHITS getting SERIOUS.
Donald Trump="president" mentally unstable
Trump's potential E.O. gives him and #GOP a way out of their failures, will allow for trump to look like he is doing something right-likely providing gains in polls,  and was probably their plan and motivation to not agree with dems

Wait?  I thought it was fake news?  That’s what the dictator said.  No merit to the allegations.  Didn’t come across his desk.  That’s what he said.  Trump is so weak!
Why name a VP choice when Trump is swimming in a river of bad news? And make all these stories old baloney before anyone is picked. Because they are going to these and other baggage discussed.
These guys like to play the victim. I wonder how long it’ll take before trump says Falwell is a very good person who is being treated unfairly. And that he wishes him well. trump won’t think the picture is bad - he’ll be jealous it wasn’t him.
And China doesn’t want Trump....head of countries have a preference every presidential cycle
So when Trump smashes a cheeseburger on his head and pours Diet Coke on his lap, do the rest of his WH enablers at the table smoosh their scalps with fettucine and douse their crotches with Chianti to show that there is nothing wrong with Cheeto-Face's behavior?

Their leader and President Trump have cut their budget because they want to privatize it and stop mail-in voting. #notkidding. Staff has been cut.

If you want to be impressed, look at the stock market when Obama took over until the presidency was stolen from Hilary!  Trump was just riding the wave of Obama’s successes.  All Trump did was give away the farm with Tax credits for the rich and doubled our debt!
And let’s not get it twisted. China is still out to help Trump. Don’t fall for false narratives.
Now trump is abandoning American cities, just like he abandoned our Soldiers when Russia put a bounty on them. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
No, Obama was also a piece of shit and a terrorist. See, unlike you, I am consistent. You are all about details and nuance with Trump but are willing to use the term "terrorist" for your enemies regardless of facts.   Why are you so inconsistent and emotional?
I'm really exhausted at how obvious the lying coming out of QAnon, Trump's Campaign, and his supporters, is, lately.   If I could sign my vote in blood at this point, I will. These people are enemies of the United States.
In case you missed it, here’s the REAL reason Trump is pushing so hard for a payroll tax cut.  Hint: It helps Big Business‼️

She did tell us she is a Trump Democrat
That is distinctly different than BLM being a terror organization. Do you think that the lawyer that represented the Boston bomber is an Islamic terrorist?   And no, Trump is a terrorist. None of what you said changes that one bit.
Because Trump is terrified of Putin. Simple as that.
Don’t forget Trump was told what he should do. Did he do it. No. If a dumb electrician knew it was coming, why didn’t he?  Shutting down borders to China was good and a little late. But hey, let’s let it come over from Europe. Sneak in the back door. I did well on spy puts then!
You'd have to ask trump.  He keeps thinking of a new way to hurt God every single day, starting with putting newborns, toddlers, children and teenagers in cages.
If you vote for trump, you are a traitor to this country, simple.

There was a flurry of activity on QAnon forums and various trump-support outlets to create fake videos of the Beirut blast to support trumps assert that there was a missile. Earlier videos do not have this element. I believe (1/2)
I think things would be different... not sure if better is the right word but different lol. Covid is the one thing I think would be better without a doubt. She was the worst candidate the Dems could have put up in 2016 imo. Hatred of her is a big reason Trump got elected.

The China virus became the trump virus in March when you failed to do anything meaningful to contain it. Mentioning China at this point completes the cycle of taking no responsibility. Resign or be embarrassed.
Trump is sincere. He believes he's been Chosen. His references are open hints to the Divine to help him out.  I think that's how his followers see it, too.

That's easy to answer.  IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

Well, teachers are indirectly responsible for the situation we are in. 60 million people voted for Trump. Obviously, teachers failed with them, not teaching criticak thinking skills or civic education. Teachers need to take responsibilty for this.

The really stupid thing is that there's no way for the postal service to know which ballots are Republican ballots and which are Democratic ballots.  Trump didn't think this through to the end -- AGAIN!

That's true and I would love to see an unchained Kamala Harris in AG role where she could go after all the crooks in the trump administration, all the corrupt republicans in the states stealing votes and suppressing votes.  So I have to agree. I LOVE KAMALA HARRIS THO.
Hello out the  how long til you do your job and defend the Constitution and our citizens. You have kept your mouth shut  and head low for to long.  Quit defending trump and defend the Country coward.

Trump's militarized policing of Portland has no place in the US (opinion)
Trump. Is. Corrupt. Period.
How Trump Is Helping Tycoons Exploit the Pandemic “[The Labor Dept] wouldn’t hold [employers] responsible if they failed to follow the C.D.C.’s health guidelines...Meat and poultry workers had to keep working and risk infection—or lose their jobs.”
Difference is that Biden admitted he was wrong and made a mistake. When was the last time Trump ever did that ?
Those aren't facts.  It's the way you twisted to make it seem like it was Democratic governors.  Who had the intel and the heads up that this virus was out there?  Who, even today, refuses to tell the truth about the virus?  WHO DO AMERICANS BLAME -- TRUMP!
How about liberals take take the Bill Gates vaccine and Trump supporters take Hydroxychloroquine???
Biden may struggle debating Trump, but only because Trump will belch forth such a vomitous stream of lies that no human on earth could really keep up with it.
Biden Married a doctor. Son join our armed forces.  Goes to church.    Trump 3rd marriage is to a person who sold her body for money.  Trump bone spurs. Windmills cause cancer.
Wonder why you don’t announce these visits ahead of time, almost like you don’t want YOUR constituents to have a voice. You do realize you also represent those who disagree with you right? Time for trump’s shadow to go, we need
You’re an absolute terrible person. Like literally what is wrong with you? Still supporting trump after he said “look over there, my African-American” so how do you defend that? Idiot
Maybe that Biden actually goes to church?  And trump has said he doesn’t need to ask god for forgiveness..  the list can go on.
Which will ultimately lead to a Trump win. This is making me sick. He’s got to be in bed with Trump. I don’t know what to think about any of this honestly... 😰😡
Well, you and trump are the opposite of truth, that I know for sure.
Michelle Obama’s depression has about as much to do with Trump and Planned Parenthood has to do with parenthood.
Trump has infected Every. Part. Of. Our. Government.
Trump out smarted us all...he said he was going to build a wall. Little did we know it was a wall of dead bodies. And it’s not Mexico he’s keeping out, it’s the entire world!
So  called out  for treating the “Black Vote” like a monolith by then treating them like a monolith.   Thank goodness Trump is there to gatekeep for black people... what could go wrong??
How's the neurosyphilis going?  Did you catch it when you were nose deep or neck deep in Trump's ass begging for a pardon?
This is part of their plan to make you dismiss Kanye more and more as he continues his plotted run for president to draw away votes from the actual election  Do not fall for these. Nobody took Trump seriously, don't dismiss Kanye. This is full on agenda, every move.
That's it right there. The value of the Trump name &amp; organization is all an illusion. They have spent decades building a brand based off misrepresentations, fraud, corruption &amp; greed. People see value in the Trump name. Unfortunately, they eventually see there's no value there.
Is your argument that Trump is Australian or that he merely speaks *like* Australian on occasion?  Hey Dinesh, How do they pronounce "sycophant" and "toady" in London?
Trump ruined orange for me. Thanks for restoring order.
Yes, it’s actually masterful “tweet snark” from Seth referencing multiple Trump nincompoopery that Maga-Land tries to gaslight everyone into believing so that Trump is never wrong.   (We just need a reference to Sharpiegate to make 💯 )
And this time around, they don’t even need to be coy about it. The number of Americans who are ride-or-die for Trump, and ready for Russian citizenship, is not zero. #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBiden2020

It’ll probably take Joe a while to get the Trump economy back on track too.
We can't have Trump in the WH for another 4 years. Chip in to elect Joe Biden. This election is too important for everyone's sake.
Lol. Trump truly does sound like a 4 year old struggling with a limited vocabulary and reaching for phrases from super hero cartoons to express his fear.
The wheels of justice turn too slowly. How is it a law if it cannot be enforced on a timely basis? trump has used the courts to delay justice and that is a crime unto itself.
Just a friendly reminder that Joe Biden was given $17M after leaving the VP spot by political “benefactors”, huge speaking fees and a crazy advance for a book that sells for $6 on Amazon, but, sure, Trump is the crook?
Trump never called a black interviewer a crack head like Biden did.
Going out on a limb. Trump may drop out of the race by rnc 24-27 aug.

No chance in hell we should trust FLA not to vote Chump. They still think that Socialism = fascism when in reality Trump is the most shining example of it we've ever had.
I love the term soyboy used by someone who adores and follows one of the biggest bitches I’ve ever seen in public office. Trump cries at any criticism and y’all act like he’s super fly TNT 😆😆😆. And Q Anon is lunacy, pure lunacy. The deep state boogeyman got all you guys quakin
Yes he will he will have trouble getting a word in. Trump will interrupt, go over his time, scream, lie. If I were Joe...i would just stand there
She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
And let’s be clear, Trump is highly accurate that his returns have been scrutinised by the IRS, no serious person believes there are illegalities here. This is 100% a political witch-hunt banking that most Americans would not understand a return of a developer, so,easy to twist.
Save our Postal Service!
He's just priming the pump for Kanye to step in and steal those votes.  It's the only way Trump can win - stealing and cheating.
Are you sure this is “handling the pandemic” are you sure this isn’t nothing  Peter Griffin (aka Trump): oh yeah that was it
Apologies, replying to the Trump haters and their new found love for Commmuist China
Thought Trump pitched himself as a master negotiator; a key to his “success” as a business man. Where are those skills now? 🤔
BUT HER EMAILS all over again. Trump declared a National Emergency over Tik Tok but still doesn't have a national testing strategy but OKAY. "Both sides" the shit out of this election and we won't have a standing republic left.
100%. The party is a mutilated corpse of what it used to be. I'm not even sure what they stand for anymore. They aren't for fiscal responsibility (look at the budgetunder Trump), and are fine with government over reach (military deployed against americans). What happened?
This the blame for this death lies squarely on the shoulders of Donald J Trump:
Kind’ve a “duh”. Unfortunately Trump &amp; Co don’t get it.
Maybe Trump 48-45 in TX  But like you’ve said: lock down the states Obama won twice before going for AZ, GA, NC, &amp; TX
Like the Trump Foundation, the NRA leaders will be held accountable for the corruption &amp; grift that has taken advantage of your members. And we're okay seeing the money from your cold, (metaphorically) dead hands.  Buh-bye.
If he’s beating Trump’s ass while eating hot pockets and playing Skyrim why would he leave?
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine “I wish her well” doesn't bother you?
Hillary sucks... like a lot. That said even as someone who identified as Republican until recently, I can admit she would have at least taken covid seriously. I can't stand her, but even she is more competent than Trump, and so is Biden.
Omg if this concerns you; you'll be alarmed to know there is an entire group of "intellectuals" that think this is cool.  I am realizing that they are the "All or Nothing" crowd.  If a candidate doesn't check EVERY single black issue box then they are unworthy.  Trump gonna win🙄
Trump
I agree this virus is worse than anything we have dealt with, and the Trump can't be blamed for ALL the deaths and economic impacts... that said Trump Virus is accurate at this point because his inaction is the main reason we don't have it under control like other countries do.
Only in the Trump administration would 10.2% unemployment be considered a success.
Kinda looks like trump is fucking him.
Seeing Trump as ‘unpredictable,’ China would prefer he not win reelection, intelligence official says   Well someone has to say it lol
Why not? You looked the other way for Trump and Kavanaugh. All of a sudden, the GOP has standards? It doesn't work that way. Falwell is one of your good old boys doing what you all do. He is who you are.
It’s official. The new superpowers are now fighting over the scraps of our nation.
You may want to lose the Trump lite persona, Douglas. Turns out in a global pandemic people want science, not your political theater.
Sorry Rick. I have to disagree. Trump really had no clue, no National Plan. The only thing he did was try to blame others.
Does he think most of Trump’s supporters have left their home state?
If Trump forgives student loans I'll still vote Biden but I'll tweet "He did it, he made America great again" on 1/20/21 as Trump leaves the white house
Sounds just like what Trump would do. Get challenged and then just start trying to make fun of people when you can’t beat em. I’d say that you reflect your idol to a T but you don’t seem like an asshole. Don’t listen to that POS. Take a critical look at Trumps historical record.
The Chinese government bans the use of Facebook and Instagram. Doesn’t Trump banning TikTok make him communist? #sheep They also claim it’s to protect their people.
The difference is Schumer wants to open them when it’s safe.  Economy be damned.  Trump wants to open them at all costs.  Life be damned.  Which side do you fall on Ted?
Trump 2020!
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Seriously hoping that Trump's war on  results in a strong motivation for young people to vote this motherf’r out of office.
But it's seems tp hurting trump more
GOP may have misjudged Kanye appeal, it appears he will take votes from Trump
This is just another way tRump is eroding America:   The belief that it's better to silence whistleblowers than it is to correct the problem is spread by Trump and used by his moronic cultists all throughout the country.
Wow.  I never new he had the same middle name as Trump.
Trump's dad drove his son Donald to the Wharton School only he took the wrong turn and ended up dropping him off in Wharton State Forest NJ where he's since been lost in the woods for decades.
The one thing Russia can't do is bring 160,000 people back from the dead!  Trump will always have botched the pandemic, and he will continue to try to ignore it, only addressing it in terms of PR for his re-election!

you are so conned - do you ever wonder how many abortions Trump’s paid for?
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.
The Russians are intent on helping Trump. Again. And again the GOP are silent.🤬
Do you agree with Trump giving a pay roll tax cut or Palosi's stupid multi trillion dollar spending bill to give an incentive to stay at home and make more. Unbelievable. I came back to work with a pay cut so can everyone else. Just saying.
the only reason they embrace him is because he is not Trump. the sad hard reality here is that the left would be ready to embrace Hitler himself over the reality of trump.. it's purely disgusting. they could not give a shit less about this country or its people.
If anyone still supports Trump, they are definitely racist. You can't justify supporting a man who is a devout racist, by saying things like, 'well I don't like him as a person, but I like what he's doing for this country'. You support who he is &amp; what he stands for. Everything.
This is because the #Coronavirus didn't make him believe that 1 million people were going to be coming to his #OklahomaRally. Tik Tok teens did this.  Trump's war on  is nothing more than the latest manifestation of mentally ill vengeance, and gross impotence.

seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
Yesterday, I was wondering to myself “why is my mail never home by the time I'm off work," and then I realized that it's likely because tRump appointed that trashbag as Postmaster General.   This president is SCREWING this country, its citizens, our environment, and everything
i think most are fake vegan accounts set up by tRump and the Gang of Predators to spread lies, disinformation, and troll vegans. a few may be real, but if they believe that shit, yes, they are not vegan. facebook is horrible with them. i don't believe they are real accounts
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
So much for reliability of the China Virus test on which the Dems are basing their vendetta against schools that are opening and businesses that refuse to close for a second time. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Stop the madness created by the Marxist Democrats.

I'm over the "please" bullshit, which is more than  *EVER* got from the    Get tough and get rid of the political threat that is  If not, the  will share in the blame for another 4 years of tRump.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.
Me too!  Dems are capable of doing anything to win.  Trump will win if it’s fair.
Trump supporters will call it a hoax

Because Kanye is being used by trump to try to sway the election towards him. We’ll never get out of this mess we’re in if trump gets re-elected.
Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we’re in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What’s there to debate?
And fucking trump can? You obviously haven’t been watching trump speak!
I’ve had two people tell me that Beyoncé stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don’t.  I love you to death man but don’t fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.

Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. 😊
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn’t accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.

Odd how trump sounds like an imbecile in BOTH cases.
I don’t know about have left, but I have had some leftist stereotypes express thoughts of voting for Trump strictly on the basis of the democrat party being incoherent and dangerous. Though they aren’t really aware of how wrong and evil Dems are, so it’s encouraging.
Amen to that fact  Trump can’t be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They’ve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.

How is Trump our only hope?  He’s hurt this country in so many ways.  Deregulation of food manufacturing standards led to the largest amount of food recalls we’ve seen.  China tariffs left American farmers hurting more than they have since the Great Depression.

You mean the ones from Trump that say Catholics don’t believe in God?
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
Dear God, what on earth have we let happen?   Republican Voters Against Trump Ad Uses Reagan’s Words | NowThis  via
We’re going off of Kim Kardashians diagnosis/synopsis of Kanye’s mental problems. None of us know what’s wrong with him. He could be just another trump cult follower. They all act like him.
Trump is getting desperate with his off the wall statements. The man is in melt down. More than when he heard of covid-19.
Here’s a cute video of my puppy to break up all the CAPITAL LETTERS on my feed. Still though, fuck Trump. #MAGA2020 #Trump2020Landslide #myfuckingass #bluewavebitches
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump
Hopefully more than Trump haha
It seems we were lucky to have past presidents who had the integrity not to abuse the office this way but Trump, who has no integrity, uses the office for personal political gain. We need a replacement of Hatch Act w/POTUS and VP not be exempt.
FB won’t let us post ANY new ads for up to 90 days.   This is they one that Trump retweeted and is the one FB is using to justify their ban.
Is there anything more deranged than going on Twitter several times per day complaining about Trump?
How long before a photo op of Trump praying?
Wont matter if OSHA doesn't actually do anything about infractions. Trump has hollowed OSHA out like every other agency
I could write a letter to the editor too and tell them all the things you’ve done in the last 3 1/2 years that were working against what your constituents want. Too little too late. And being with Trump “100%” is not bipartisan!
It’s known as the Trump Virus in the USA!  Trump left the door open for the virus to come into the USA and spread at will!
How is the NRA going to donate Russian money to Trump now?
nah i’d rather be a fan of trump than you because at least i can’t comprehend what he’s saying
You tell me how Trump killed anyone. What do you want us shut down forever? Some of us have to work.
I think that you and I are old enough to remember when Rivera was the rebellious voice of the young... his work with exposing Willowbrook was extraordinary! I don't know when he switched to be the leading apologist for pigs like Trump.
Per some new data points from Infinera, it looks like Trump is beating Huawei --
A message I got from trump today. This is what he emails everyone everyday
I think CJ was referring to trump’s campaign.
He’ll be taking votes away from Trump. If you’re stupid enough to vote for Kanye, then you’d probably be voting for Trump anyway.
Easy! America does not want Trump at all! We hear Trump speak everyday! He’s proven he has nothing to add!  #ItIsWhatItIsDumpTrump
"Slowing" and "decreasing" are two completely different concepts.   This is pretty basic.  Your argument is lot like trump bragging about the unemployment numbers going down the past month after rising to historic levels due to his inept handling of this crisis.
Jesus...if Trump did nothing during this pandemic it would be better then what he has done.  He has let us down.  160,000 dead.
CNN has not reported news for years.  Nothing but a bunch of angry, far-left, Trump hating commentators.
Yeah, the one who killed Epstein for Trump.
Couldn't agree more. Does anyone really care if Trump is watching or not? I know I don't.  Lol.
Maybe you should convince your buddies at the Trump campaign to stop being a public health menace.
We all knew this was coming! An article in WaPo a couple of days ago went into great depth regarding the terrible danger of a deceptive Trump operation like this. I believe it was
trump is that desperate he needs another person on the ballot to take votes away from Biden, and even that will not help him get destroyed on Nov 3rd, 89 days from today!
that is so NOT true, the members of his party are ONLY pretending to pull the chain to make themselves look good for votes, because they know the war will soon be over for them. They do not care about what trump does, and proven it time and again. They are desperate.
another lie that is using to gain votes and give americans false hope - well I mean trump supporters, they are NOT Americans, they are trumpains, and  allows it
Nope! What scares me is the mental stability of tRump!  What scares me is his total lack of empathy, his non-handling  of COVID19, tRump wanting to postpone the election, his blatant racism and white supremacist views, his love for Putin, to name a few! Learn to critically think!
How many times has Trump violated the Emoluments clause by booking government officials in his hotels.  I was under the impression an acting president was supposed to cut ties with their private sector businesses before entering office.
A must read article about yesterday’s Yates  hearing. illustrates the absurdity and danger of this Trump, Barr and GOP disinformation-distraction operation, at a time when our country is in free fall. This is actually a Putin disinformation op and they’re all  on board!
Yeah, why can't he be more humble, like Trump.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder why they rejected it? Could it be Biden isn’t capable of a debate with a two year old. Even when he was coherent no way could he debate Trump. This will be priceless!
I’ll be voting for Trump in Colorado!
A Must read article for all Americans seeking the truth and not caught up in the Trump, GOP, Barr conspiracy theories about Russia‘s 2016  subversion of our democracy and presidential election. Their twisted conspiracy theory is a Putin disinformation operation. Let that sink in.
Omfg What the hell is going on with people these days? The amount of hate that Trump has brought out is unbelievable, over a mask? It's ridiculous
I think there’s a lot of back channel money flowing into the trump org as well. not To mention PPP. He’s flush.
Ahhh ha ha ha If you think you can believe anything Donald Trump or his campaign says you’re a complete fool. This is a man who edits out original photos who thousands of times has lied without shame to the public. #VoteHimOut
Bye bye then. You were great and I'll miss you but I haven't heard that from the Holy Spirit and until I do I'm sticking with Trump because there's no question he's God's man. If you no longer believe that, you've been deceived by a devil, Pal.
Officials in the Trump administration have been rightly referring to the government in China as "The Chinese Communist Party" or CCP, not just as "Chinese government." This is apt. A communist is always a communist, and that must never be forgotten.
All she has done as AG is investigate Trump, meanwhile NY has become a crime ridden third world country.
The died in the wool Republican governors need to wake up and realize trump is not there for you. Stop being stupid and smell the roses. The man will turn on you what ever you do. Get smart.
Nothing in Trump's actions or speaches says competence or ability. The man is so out of his league or ability. If America needs to vent, do so on this fricking moron.
Alas, you're a faux president, so it all works out. Though I would sooner trust Jim Acosta on reporting the news than Donald Trump on leading this Nation.
A "friend" of mine feels that he is "protecting his children" by sending them to school. He believes that the media is creating fear that it's going to cost more lives than the virus, that masks don't work and of course he is a Trump supporter. Choices have consequences
Biden wants to re engage with Iran. This is against Trump policy. His surrogate, John Kerry has been meeting them privately. They are our sworn enemy. If Biden wins and one of his transition team reaches out to Iran informing of a new policy direction should this be Logan Act ?
These are the people where you don't feel sad when they get sick and suffer and die alone. In a way you hope they do. Choices have consequences. You just can't fix stupid, I mean Trump supporters
I don’t see color. I’m telling anyone that will listen that if you want to vote for trump then vote for kayne because it’s the same thing. If you want to vote for democrats then vote for Biden. Really really really extremely simple. #biden2020 #kayneismentallyill #trumpvirus

Michele Obama is biggest hypocrite in the history First Ladies, as she broadcasts her anti-Trump rhetoric from her seaside mansion on Cape Cod. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Impeach Obama for his role in the attempts at a coup d’etat to unseat President Trump before Nov.
Letivia James announced in a viral video a few years that she was going to go after Trump.   Here’s the deal. You people are so fundamentally dishonest.  Just a few hours ago your squad was on MSNBC lamenting the Durham Investigation as election year politicization.
GOP is using kayne like a puppet to steal black voters from Biden. Keep your eyes open. If you want trump again then vote for kayne as kayne cannot win.
Kayne west is doing what Ralph Nader did which is split the vote and steal votes from democrats. Kayne is there simply to steal the black vote from Biden to help out trump. If you are a trump supporter then vote for kayne or trump. If you support democrats then Biden
Is this sham of a hearing that R’s are directing trying to prove Obama spied on Trump? I’m sure most of you know the answer to this question, but I literally cannot keep up with this shit show.
Watch "The Five Wildest Moments From Donald Trump's Interview with Axios" on YouTube
Isn’t it Letitia James who announced that she was going to take Trump down a few years ago in a video that went viral?   Why is it that you only see political prosecutors one way?
Guessing you trust the Chinese more than Trump. Crystal clear.
I hope, on Nov. 3rd, we flush your Orange turd ass down the fucking drain!  You pompous ass!  🖕🤬 fuck you, Donald J. Trump!
Americans threating health officials are just ignorant and are not responsible and just complaining up the wrong tree. Need to be going to the root of the problem, Trump. Not doing anything to remedy the situation.
I hate to say this, but the more the Republicans screw these things up, the more I hope it hurts all those Trump supporters and people who vote for them like McConnell. And those who continue to vote for them you deserve what you get, and I hope it sucks bad
If you think Trump is that smart, you are delusional.No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
Trump says. "It is what it is." Haha Not funny!
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‘s the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn’t cared if you died fr so
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.

Any doubts Trump is a racist?  Watch this...
Thanks  for doing what had never been done before that Trump is now taking credit for!!! 🤬🤬
Trump’s campaign isn’t even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.
Its Classic #Trump...taking credit for somebody else's work...and thinking nobody would notice...#Trump is still in Grade school.
An STD will be named for Trump.
Day 149: . shared on the air earlier today that 1,000 Americans per day are dying from #COVID19! What is the US President doing? Banning a social media app.    Globally:  Total cases:19,378,036 Deaths:721,324  US: Total cases: 4,941,755  Deaths:161,356
Golfing and lying. What else is new with trump?
Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year’s race.
Who is trump kidding? He is suing against ACA which protects people with preexisting medical conditions in our courts right now. WTF?
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he’s gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal 😉
Baby, if you think Trump gives a shit about you, well, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
Not remotely close.  We are all suffering from Trump induced anxiety and depression.  Exhausted.
Don't you get it people??? This is exactly what #Trump wants...People protest, No Masks, people get sick and die...Then whats Left are #Trumps anti-Christ White supremacy foot soldiers to do his bidding...#Trump wants to be a dictator so bad, he licks his Own Butt!!!

Griffin’s anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with “go back to Africa” comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he’s not a racist.
Exactly! You can’t make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn’t stink as much as Trumps; but it’s still smelly shit 💩
If you’re wondering, it’s probably conceivable. For me it doesn’t come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife “I hope the Russians didn’t have anything to do with this.”
Don’t let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I sat static at approximately 300 followers for a couple of years and it wasn't until this year between the Covid19 and the #BLM Movement that I felt I needed to unify with others against Trump, so I started picking up followers at that point.
Trump be like “I’m gonna repeal Obamacare but ensure they do all the same things and call it Trumpcare”
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun
how can u say this is not a good president?  unemployment thru the new year  #TennesseeValleyAuthority CEo was getting 8 million a year, laid off everyone, made them train they (cheaper, foreign) replacements- trump was like, “hell no”   . 🌩️LoveU Sir
All you supporters talk as if #Trump likes you or something...#Trump only cares about #Trump not even the people he swore to protect..everything he does is for show...If its about the country #Trump could care less about it...That's it...
Did he say "I don't listen to anybody"?  He really believes he is smart and everyone else is dumb, blind and stupid. It is written that satan can't cast out satan, so let's be sure Nov 3 is cast out day.  I'm serious.  I'm exhausted.  No More trump.
A standard #Trump progression: I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it, but I could do it. I did do it, so what? I did do it, and it was right to do it.

New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Because Kanye is being used by trump to try to sway the election towards him. We’ll never get out of this mess we’re in if trump gets re-elected.
We could be at or near a point like this right now.  People continue to obsess over someone that is gone from politics, and who was investigated before they left.this is happening in part because the message "lock her up" was such a passionately successful one for trump that 4/5
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
Are they protesting Trump's environmental policies that harm unborn babies?
Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we’re in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What’s there to debate?
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.

And fucking trump can? You obviously haven’t been watching trump speak!

A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
I’ve had two people tell me that Beyoncé stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don’t.  I love you to death man but don’t fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.

It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
Bullshit. You republicans just can’t quit with the lying. Following trump’s example.
I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.

Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn’t accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go

So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.
So Trump issued an executive order today that puts a stop to...himself?  #TrumpLandslide2020 my ass.
If it wasn’t seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn’t Trump’s defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?
Donald Trump’s Donors Receive Ominous Warning About Becoming 'Don's Next Con' | HuffPost
In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
He can’t breathe in a mask bc he’s exhausted from kissing Trump’s butt
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden
Trump is doing what he does to win the election  Lie Cheat Corrupt  Lie Putin Corrupt Lie Intelligence NOT! More bronzer Lie PUTIN
“Fake president trump”
Interesting...it doesn’t look like Trump is wearing a lifejacket in these rising waters 🤷🏼‍♀️
I say this as a former Republican, it’s not enough to get rid of Trump but all those that laid the groundwork that led to him. That happened over a long period of time and getting the GOP or something new to replace it isn’t going to happen overnight because Trump is gone.
Lindsey, we know better. It's about money for F-35's, the federal building across from the Trump hotel &amp; White House renovations, and no unemployment benefits for the poor guys that need it. Ya fkn piker.
So trump is pro ACA, right?
My favorite drinking game is “Trump campaign video or trailer for an A24 movie about the apocalypse?”

My bad. Thought the dumpster fire re: elections would occur closer to the Nov. date. But as we witness the new Postmaster Gen's sweeping changes to slow mail delivery...impacting everyone...I am certain the spark has already started in the Trump dumpster. This will get very nasty
Trump 2020!
Trump 2020!

The hot shots in your town who got an “early edge" are the ones everybody hates because of it. Big houses, fancy cars, pull with the local authorities... Yet the same haters shill for Trump bc... why? Why is he any different than the rich and famous in your town?
None of you people know what you’re talking about. Talk about low information voters. I love Trump but some of his supporters are lost in a cornfield 🤣.

I'm a christian and did not vote for Trump morals, integrity and common sense are valuable to me. He doesn't hold any of the values of Christianity and is not humble or a believer in God, Jesus, repentance or the bible.
Was wondering where Trump’s African American had been hiding. He might be Security, not sure

A reporter just asked President Trump why many people in the room at his press conference in Bedminstsr, NJ aren’t wearing masks.  “It’s a peaceful protest,” Trump says in jest, to cheers from the crowd.😅
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

This is good advice from
Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
So did Trump, tool.
So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.
Trump speaks the truth.  You should try it.
So kind of you to refer to a fellow citizen as a moran. But I'm guessing you believe Trump has caused so much division. See the irony?
Lmao. Imagine being this fucking stupid. 😹😹😹 #Trump
How old is this Denish guy....I would guess same mental age as Trump....toddler stage.  All the silly immature comments...just embarrassing for them.
It’s worked for Trump so far
Maybe.  We already know that Trump cannot pronounce Yosemite and Thailand correctly.  He set the geography/reading bar pretty low.

Just like Trump, schools are not even pretending to try.👹
Just like Trump has no plan to stop COVID19. We are officially the country with no plan. It is a common theme!👹

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
President Trump is suspending student loans for now, tricking you, just to get your vote! Only two terms for POTUS. Don't fall for it! You students will still be in depth, with interest! Be wise, He is not on your side! Go with the forgiveness, Democrat! More possible.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he’s going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.
An inside look at the legal battles that lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are facing during the Trump administration.  Watch THE FIGHT:
I’ll only use Reels if trump threatens to ban it
Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
The only threat we have to the American ppl is Trump's America and the republicans view for America. This is all happening under the republicans watch. Not Democrats. Dems have no choice but to fight back to keep civil peace and democracy right.
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump’s best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Hey Mr Biden. We can’t let trump do ANYTHING else. I’ve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It’s imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn’t expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Maybe that should be: It's August 7th, and President Trump still doesn’t WANT❗️an adequate national testing strategy.
. did it first and better. It’s called the Affordable Care Act - the law that Trump is fighting to overturn via the Supreme Court.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.
Wait til you hear how President Trump treated his holy union with all three of his wives. It's a doozy.

Our suffering for Trump’s failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives — and it has been squandered by one man’s incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Yeah you missed the point.  Exercise isn't about being cool it's about self improvement. Trump is allergic , maybe partially because he can see no reason or possibility for improvement.  The guys doesnt read books for goodness sake.
No doubt they are planning the next set of dirty tricks, can't be too many left.  Nah, Trump is the master of cheating.  That is if someone draws the pictures for him to look at.  Love the census ploy, thanks for the info on that one.
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn’t seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
Would it make a difference if he only dodged it once?  Then later said McCain's not a hero cause he was caught? The point is he's a coward.. Anyway, draft dodging's part of the public record.
If you’re serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don’t think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I’m not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community’s assessment, the president said, “The last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.”  Pressed on the matter, he said: “I don’t care what anybody says”
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn’t make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!
Trump’s brilliant new healthcare plan is...Obamacare?! 🤣🤣🤣 #copolitics #ThanksObama
TRUMP smoked that reporter...lol
160,000 Americans are dead, there's record unemployment, Trump is sandbagging the postal service, relief talks have collapsed, &amp; Combover Caligula is preening in front of a bunch of rich assholes at a golf club he profits from *while President*. #sorrynotsorry about the cursing.
Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.
Wow, President Trump attempting to provide real relief to people while Democrats continue to try and destroy everything in their path.
If you  believe fox news and their lies then you are an uninformed person.  Fox News wants to get trump re-elected so they will say anything.  Fox just sows misinformation.    Trump is desperate because he is losing in the polls

Shawn do you really think this is a posting contest between Biden and trump? If so...I'll have to straighten you out that trumps accusers fate back to the 80s and Biden had only one.  Post contest done.  Let's go back to ideas...trump has none, doesnt believe in reading.

Trump is the only President in my life time that when he says he is going to do something he gets it done. Biden has no chance.

for someone that thinks they're so smart you really have no idea how business works do you? I don't have any knowledge of business but even I understand that Trump provided a name, a product and some funding.. and that was probably the extent of his involvement.
You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?🤔. Wanna clarify that?

I heard an awful story that a BLM protester got life in prison from some tRUMP supporting judge. It's something about him pouring red paint on a bld. Only in tRUMP's America can something  like this happen - if it's true.

If you’re willing to look away from this and turn a blind eye just because you dislike Trump you may want to ask yourself if it would  have been ok if the administration before Obama did this to him. Whether you like Trump or not, is not what is being questioned here.
I have never liked Trump from the 1970's on. You really are an exceptionally blind individual. You don't like the 2 party system? Then why didn't Bernie run a 3rd party?
Americans die while Trump golfs. Somewhat like let them eat cake?
Libertarians are more or less wild card conservatives and also responsible for the tea party. There's a large number of them involved in QAnon as well, so I'm more or less comfortable with my knowledge of this matter. Including the local libertarian party's support of Trump.
I guess I meant some people try to make a case for Biden, though I think they are wrong. Bad word choice on my end.   My point is that the Church tells us to vote our consciences, and we have a responsibility to make sure those are well-formed. It doesn't say: Vote Trump or else.

Where the fuck is the FBI? Where is NSA? Where is the oversight when they’re in Trump’s pocket too? Including AG Barr. A fair Election is in serious jeopardy and so is democracy.
If Congress doesn’t get it done, what does President Trump do?
When Trump is gone, if Positions are left unfilled because Congress has not confirmed the president’s candidates for over sixty days, the house should be able to fill the spots without interference from the President.
President Trump, our non profit organization is based in Beirut and is well-connected across the Arab world. We can help make sure the donations from the United States are well managed and reach their destination.
It’s shit like this that makes me very nervous about the election. If Trump wins it’ll be because he cheated and this time not only Russia helped, but members of the GOP. I’m disgusted by all of it.
Is Trump banning TikTok so that Mark has a built in audience for a new platform?
Does literally ANYONE believe that Trump said "Thighland" because he's just too fluent in any Indian language? He can barely garble out American English. Let's be real here.
Isn't there website that Trump admin set up to send things like this too?  We all should send what is happing to it.

#tech #advice Daily Crunch: Trump bans transactions with ByteDance and Tencent
Feels like a game they are playing so Trump can do something unilaterally without Congress to claim some victory. At this point I believe they will do anything if they think it will help with election chances.
President Trump Holds a News Conference  via
No disrespect sir, but you need to announce your VP and get into play ASAP. Trump’s behind needs to be kicked daily, and you need to be doing it. We’re counting on you to get elected and  take control of the COVID-19 situation to resolve it.
Finally him and trump have something in common.
Oops.

What does Trump have a degree in? Oh right, he never even took the SATs.
"My faith teaches me to welcome the stranger, while President Trump tears families apart. My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op.” -  #RidenWithBiden #BelieversForBiden

IKR..... their secretaries are like “Donald Trump is on line 2 for you“ and they’re probably like “Jesus Christ do I really need to talk to this clown“ while rolling their eyes and taking a swig of bourbon to muster up enough stamina to try to keep up with his blithering  🤣😂
I’m sick of “winning.”   Can we get rid of Trump* now?
Of course  has pulled out ALL the stops...America as we know it is ALL but dead if Vladimir Putin's plan is fulfilled. Trump owes his soul to Vlad. Are Americans too lazy or too stupid to care? 160,000 can't vote
Is anyone else having refreshments a bit early prior to Trump Presser?
Jewish advocacy groups slam Trump's pick for German ambassador for bigoted comments
yet less than 10 ebola deaths under Obama and Trump/GOP were calling for his resignation.  Unbelievable.
Take HCQ if you want, it's been proven ineffective against covid. I can link you papers if interested.
That's great in theory. But the reality is that we have trump because trumplicans have been gestating in echo chambers for years. They just emerged from their cocoons in 2016. They don't hear logic. They don't see reason. They don't accept facts.  You cannot reason with them.
You talk a big game. But that really you in the bernie shirt isnt it?   Im sure tou teach your grandchildren well. If their parents were smart they would be kept far from you. But im sure the shithead dosent fall from the tree.  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
For all of Mr. D'Souza's nonsenseposting over the past ~48 hours, it seems he still hasn't realized that Trump pronounced the word both ways in the same sentence.

The only defense from anyone has do use different words to explain why Trump said Thigh land
When you find out your dad is a Trump supporter...
The only thing I agree with, is that you 2 are a couple of idiots! Trying to force kids to school during a pandemic which the tRump administration did NOTHING to try to dimish.#TrumpHasNoPlan #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Really hard to make a case for a third party...(a formed conscience need be followed though). "sin of omission" is an interesting analogy for this...as no case can be logically made for Biden, and strong cases can be made for Trump...the 3rd party option close to a throw away
Those tend to be low-info voters who don't care about VP as much as the base, but understand your concern, it could turn out that way, I suppose. Always a cost/benefit and for me the benefits far outweigh potential costs. Agree to disagree on this, as long as Trump is out!
I hear you with regards to Biden constantly undermining himself and I STILL have my Bernie sticker on my car BUT Trump has to lose overwhelmingly (or he and his supporters will try to pull a violent coup) and THEN we push, push, push Biden in the direction we need him to go.
Ummm, are you unaware that this was a joke based upon Trump’s comments that Biden would “hurt god.”
We need Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, etc to help derail Trump too🙏

Reality Winner's Mom Says Daughter Got COVID-19 As Convicted Trump Aides Went Free | HuffPost
This is going to be so interesting.  Trump cannot put a whole sentence together.  He’s a cheerleader but not a leader.  There is a difference.
All I know is this.. any of you who have signed onto team Trump and have not changed your party affiliation to Republican.. you might want to get on that.. because if anything happens to President Trump, or if the election being stolen becomes a reality, Democrat voter rolls
Oh good. A Trump “news conference” at 7pm on a Friday. What could possibly go wrong?
The media reports that US Intel has information that Russia is spreading disinformation on Joe Biden. Pardon me, but sounds like a continuation of the 2016 assertion by US Intell that Russia was trying to help Trump win which proved blatantly false.
I presume the  wants to win, and  can energise younger voters to come out and vote. Kasich backing Biden will play like sour grapes to Republicans. I don't think anyone is on the fence in this election, Trump has failed spectacularly, Kasich won't change any minds!
You seem invested in changing the subject. Do you want to just admit that they aren't a terror group and we can move on?  You said something far more interesting than this discussion when you heard "Trump is bad" when I said he was a terrorist.   Do you think terrorism is bad?
Banning TikTok is just a political ploy by Trump Administration. Once you start unraveling the clusterfuck of digital ad business, you realize it does not matter who owns these digital platforms.
I don’t support trump but umm... why mock something like this? Do you not want people to help Lebanon?
But Mr. Prensident what about the Ottawa Senators, remember that had that Tkachuk guy
Trump's ads are just...disgusting.
You’re a good person.  I enjoy reading your posts.  Don’t pay attention to those who attack you.  Trumpanzees are as bad as Trump and it will change in November. Keep doing what you are doing, we’re here for you!
Agreed. I'm as anti-establishment as they come, but I do not want to be fighting Trump anymore. My vote is clear, and then I'll spend the next 4 years tearing down the candidate I voted for.
The boneheads at the motorcycle gathering in Sturges will be getting the virus and bring it back to all the places they came from. We thought trump is stupid. These morons just do not care. Way to go Harley Davidson and company.
Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
God I wish Trump would magically go away.
Not when it's obvious people were in a flurry to create fakes to prop up Trump's argument. Or the fact all early videos with identifiable time stamps lack your apparent missile. If you want me to assume you were involved in those anon postings I can.
I think they jumped the gun on that one
It’s because the leader of the free world posts lies and garbage.  Twitter and Facebook is not the official Trump media outlet.  Fox is state TV and they do enough to relay Trumps lies.
When states start reclosing, and schools aren't re-opening, and Trump is admitting masks help, SHITS getting SERIOUS.
Donald Trump="president" mentally unstable
Trump's potential E.O. gives him and #GOP a way out of their failures, will allow for trump to look like he is doing something right-likely providing gains in polls,  and was probably their plan and motivation to not agree with dems
Trump’s smelly brown stuff is what it is.
Vote. Get trump out.
I figured as much.  Thanks for reporting this.  I’m not watching the Trump Covid Briefings as they seem to be everything but useful pandemic information.
Trump Tower must be close to approval...
definitely Trump all the way!!!  100%
So agreed. Trump is more dangerous.
We're so screwed if Republicans continue to demolish the USPS.  via
Hey  -- there seems to be a lot of things happening at once: 1) NRA being dissolved 2) Announcing Russian (and more) interference 3) Rich's brother's Fox News suit 4) Trump's tax returns finally closing in  Any coordinated effort? Or coincidence?
Wait?  I thought it was fake news?  That’s what the dictator said.  No merit to the allegations.  Didn’t come across his desk.  That’s what he said.  Trump is so weak!
Why name a VP choice when Trump is swimming in a river of bad news? And make all these stories old baloney before anyone is picked. Because they are going to these and other baggage discussed.
These guys like to play the victim. I wonder how long it’ll take before trump says Falwell is a very good person who is being treated unfairly. And that he wishes him well. trump won’t think the picture is bad - he’ll be jealous it wasn’t him.
And China doesn’t want Trump....head of countries have a preference every presidential cycle
So when Trump smashes a cheeseburger on his head and pours Diet Coke on his lap, do the rest of his WH enablers at the table smoosh their scalps with fettucine and douse their crotches with Chianti to show that there is nothing wrong with Cheeto-Face's behavior?

The Dems asked for $20B to help USPS recover in the current stalled COVID relief bill and the R's cut that amount down.
This guy west loves the attention he gets from just being weird, it makes him feel significant, he's like his buddy tRUMP - they both can suck all the air out of a moment that's not theirs.
Their leader and President Trump have cut their budget because they want to privatize it and stop mail-in voting. #notkidding. Staff has been cut.
I guess I was mistaken. I blamed it on China. Is it Trump's fault in all the other countries, too?
Trump lies about Democrats negotiating position — while on vacation at one of his golf clubs -
If you want to be impressed, look at the stock market when Obama took over until the presidency was stolen from Hilary!  Trump was just riding the wave of Obama’s successes.  All Trump did was give away the farm with Tax credits for the rich and doubled our debt!
And let’s not get it twisted. China is still out to help Trump. Don’t fall for false narratives.
Now trump is abandoning American cities, just like he abandoned our Soldiers when Russia put a bounty on them. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
No, Obama was also a piece of shit and a terrorist. See, unlike you, I am consistent. You are all about details and nuance with Trump but are willing to use the term "terrorist" for your enemies regardless of facts.   Why are you so inconsistent and emotional?
I'm really exhausted at how obvious the lying coming out of QAnon, Trump's Campaign, and his supporters, is, lately.   If I could sign my vote in blood at this point, I will. These people are enemies of the United States.
In case you missed it, here’s the REAL reason Trump is pushing so hard for a payroll tax cut.  Hint: It helps Big Business‼️

She did tell us she is a Trump Democrat
That is distinctly different than BLM being a terror organization. Do you think that the lawyer that represented the Boston bomber is an Islamic terrorist?   And no, Trump is a terrorist. None of what you said changes that one bit.
Because Trump is terrified of Putin. Simple as that.
Don’t forget Trump was told what he should do. Did he do it. No. If a dumb electrician knew it was coming, why didn’t he?  Shutting down borders to China was good and a little late. But hey, let’s let it come over from Europe. Sneak in the back door. I did well on spy puts then!
You'd have to ask trump.  He keeps thinking of a new way to hurt God every single day, starting with putting newborns, toddlers, children and teenagers in cages.
If you vote for trump, you are a traitor to this country, simple.
Your master trump is being sued by  for raping her. The judge just said they can pursue getting Trumps DNA to match up to the semen stains he left during the department store rape.
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.
But you'll believe a habitual lying trump?!
State and local governments are doing the heavy lifting for COVID19 bc Trump &amp; the GOP have TOLD them they’re in their own. Just keep playing golf and dabbing the dribble, Lindz
If he thinks #WAP is bad he should check out trump's wife's videos they're so filthy MTV can't show them at all.
Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!
There was a flurry of activity on QAnon forums and various trump-support outlets to create fake videos of the Beirut blast to support trumps assert that there was a missile. Earlier videos do not have this element. I believe (1/2)
I think things would be different... not sure if better is the right word but different lol. Covid is the one thing I think would be better without a doubt. She was the worst candidate the Dems could have put up in 2016 imo. Hatred of her is a big reason Trump got elected.
Could we do the same with trump? 🤔

The whole spiel is full of absolute bullshit, anti semitic remarks, anti-trump, and fuckking flat earth, never before have i encountered such a turd parfait of lies and half truths, sad to see.
The China virus became the trump virus in March when you failed to do anything meaningful to contain it. Mentioning China at this point completes the cycle of taking no responsibility. Resign or be embarrassed.
Trump is sincere. He believes he's been Chosen. His references are open hints to the Divine to help him out.  I think that's how his followers see it, too.
Well they can use the flag for the country of Thighland and Trump can be their president.
You are just gaslighting just like trump.
Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S. How is this legal?
No wonder Trump never worries about your anemic criticisms of Trump, we just leaned from our intelligence agencies you are working for Putin ....  You are a traitor  ...
Nope and nope. Deaths, unemployment and we are pitied by the world. Bounties on our troops. “President” who has lied over 20,000 times. Our economy was going up, unemployment was going down. tRump was determined to destroy everything Obama did, and looks like he was successful.
That's easy to answer.  IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
&amp; the GOP really don't give a damn abt our ppl, our lives, our jobs, our children, our elections...none of it! They've been playing games for months b/c they want to give this to Trump so he can look good by doing something via an Exec Order! It's dirty politics.
I blame President Trump for failing us and not having a federal strategic plan on how to deal with this ongoing pandemic, Debbie.
What  The  Hell  Kanye, why? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ This goes beyond mental illness. He’s hired convicted fraudsters...
So you're the reason the CO Senate GOP has so little to say about Trump's 20,000 lies, Russian bounties on US soldiers, Elijah McClain, payouts to porn stars, Roger Stone, 160,000 dead from a disastrous federal response to COVID-19 etc.   Good to know. See ya around.
Now we know why Trump wears overly long red ties. He telegraphs all his motives to us. You just have to read between the lines.
Especially when our economy is the worst it’s been under Trump since the Depression.

a blank check doesn’t have a number, you can’t have a $2.5 Trillion blank check... While you suck Trump’s teet, millions of Americans are struggling to pay bills because this  hasn’t contained a Virus the rest of the world managed to contain in April!
If successful, that will make Trump's ratings soar. It will make all in Congress look bad, even though the House passed a bill which did all that and more months ago. The American people don't / can't focus on the details.
Well, teachers are indirectly responsible for the situation we are in. 60 million people voted for Trump. Obviously, teachers failed with them, not teaching criticak thinking skills or civic education. Teachers need to take responsibilty for this.
Trump is doing WAY more than that for Russia‼️
TRUMP 2.0.
The really stupid thing is that there's no way for the postal service to know which ballots are Republican ballots and which are Democratic ballots.  Trump didn't think this through to the end -- AGAIN!
I back the blue. I support Donald Trump. I love our country. I love GOD. I protect and love my family.

So if Trump banned any transactions with tencent. Does that mean no more microtransactions or Riot events in NA?
Now do Sturgis...I am sure 250,000 riders from across the country w./ no mask mandate should really help things....whose fault is it that there is no national plan, mask mandate? You hitched your wagon to Trump &amp; have never criticized him. Shameful
I was raised in the Catholic faith, I even lived in a Catholic orphanage----there is not anything I can see in Trump that reflects the morals of Christianity.

Does anyone else remember trump saying “you all have no idea what’s coming” before the outbreak?
Lol. Trump said Obama was responsible for every SARS and Ebola death but he refused to take responsibility for anything bad that happens under his administration.

That's true and I would love to see an unchained Kamala Harris in AG role where she could go after all the crooks in the trump administration, all the corrupt republicans in the states stealing votes and suppressing votes.  So I have to agree. I LOVE KAMALA HARRIS THO.

Difference is that Biden admitted he was wrong and made a mistake. When was the last time Trump ever did that ?
Those aren't facts.  It's the way you twisted to make it seem like it was Democratic governors.  Who had the intel and the heads up that this virus was out there?  Who, even today, refuses to tell the truth about the virus?  WHO DO AMERICANS BLAME -- TRUMP!
How about liberals take take the Bill Gates vaccine and Trump supporters take Hydroxychloroquine???
Biden may struggle debating Trump, but only because Trump will belch forth such a vomitous stream of lies that no human on earth could really keep up with it.
Biden Married a doctor. Son join our armed forces.  Goes to church.    Trump 3rd marriage is to a person who sold her body for money.  Trump bone spurs. Windmills cause cancer.
Wonder why you don’t announce these visits ahead of time, almost like you don’t want YOUR constituents to have a voice. You do realize you also represent those who disagree with you right? Time for trump’s shadow to go, we need
You’re an absolute terrible person. Like literally what is wrong with you? Still supporting trump after he said “look over there, my African-American” so how do you defend that? Idiot
Maybe that Biden actually goes to church?  And trump has said he doesn’t need to ask god for forgiveness..  the list can go on.
Which will ultimately lead to a Trump win. This is making me sick. He’s got to be in bed with Trump. I don’t know what to think about any of this honestly... 😰😡

That's it right there. The value of the Trump name &amp; organization is all an illusion. They have spent decades building a brand based off misrepresentations, fraud, corruption &amp; greed. People see value in the Trump name. Unfortunately, they eventually see there's no value there.

Yes he will he will have trouble getting a word in. Trump will interrupt, go over his time, scream, lie. If I were Joe...i would just stand there
And let’s be clear, Trump is highly accurate that his returns have been scrutinised by the IRS, no serious person believes there are illegalities here. This is 100% a political witch-hunt banking that most Americans would not understand a return of a developer, so,easy to twist.
Save our Postal Service!

100%. The party is a mutilated corpse of what it used to be. I'm not even sure what they stand for anymore. They aren't for fiscal responsibility (look at the budgetunder Trump), and are fine with government over reach (military deployed against americans). What happened?

Hillary sucks... like a lot. That said even as someone who identified as Republican until recently, I can admit she would have at least taken covid seriously. I can't stand her, but even she is more competent than Trump, and so is Biden.
Omg if this concerns you; you'll be alarmed to know there is an entire group of "intellectuals" that think this is cool.  I am realizing that they are the "All or Nothing" crowd.  If a candidate doesn't check EVERY single black issue box then they are unworthy.  Trump gonna win🙄

I agree this virus is worse than anything we have dealt with, and the Trump can't be blamed for ALL the deaths and economic impacts... that said Trump Virus is accurate at this point because his inaction is the main reason we don't have it under control like other countries do.

I wouldn't touch your company with a 50ft pole, with Donald Trump's dick attached to the end of it, with Barack Obama heaving, and armed with a 55-gallon drum of industrial strength penicillin.
I mean I'll vote for Biden because Trump is not only terrible at every level, but I believe he is legitimately dangerous. I just wish Dems had picked any of the other much better options.
It's called Obamacare. trump just can't get President Obama out of his head.  Wonder why. 🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t know she’s giving airtime to Trump, thanks for the heads up.
You are looking for a reasonable logical explanation for Trump’s actions again. You should know better.
The DNC pulled some strings for him. They kept Warren to split, Bloomberg to toy around with an awful campaign strategy, and asked everyone to make way for Biden. I'm not saying they'd pick her but she could pull a Trump or potentially a Kanye lol
Trump cannot undo Tulsa. It was beautiful. All those empty seats.
The President should stop talking about Biden as he gets it all wrong....He will never stop.  Trump should tell us what he plans to do the next 4 years...He will never do that. A real candidate would.
That's rich coming from a president who won't defend our soldier's. Russia is paying bounties to Afghan militia's to kill American soldier's. trump has spoken to Putin 8 times since learning this and refuses to hold Russia accountable.

Trump says a lot of things thats arent true. like mexico will pay for the wall, nope the american military did that, and like oh my its my real hair LOL. YEAH okay sure it is, oh and there is the other one whats that, oh yeah we have 15 cases of covid and it's all under control !
Trump said he could shoot somebody on 5yh Ave. and nobody would care. He's killed tens of thousands of Americans with bungled virus response in plain sight and his supporters could care less.

Trump denied the problem and it got out of hand. To get a glimpse of how dumb of an idea it was to have him as president, next time you fly, see if the pilot asks someone with no experience to take over.
So, Trump was correct.....gonna say that?
dunce Trump logic.
You know this will never happen. And it's not even possible to do. But go ahead, keep gaslighting Trump's gullible base.
Trump leaves you unprepared.
There is one more option...he's full of shit and knows it but his ignorant followers will eat up what he says as long as it supports trump.

Trump said he's going to sign an executive order requiring health insurers to cover preexisting conditions. That's already the current law under Obamacare, which Trump has repeatedly tried to repeal.
Who would vote for a mentally ill man, Kanye West,  for president? Oh wait,  I answered my own question,  the same people that voted for Donald Trump. My bad
Thanks Obama for the person who actually gave us the lowest unemployment of all time, and then Trump gave us the largest.....Real numbers prove me right Trump cultist.....
I've made it my policy to mute any "but Trump is worse" centrists who try to treat any criticism of democratic royalty as Russian psyops/pro-Trump propaganda.  Judging from the responses this Kurt 🤡 is getting, I'm not missing much.
Yea, I really think this is another violation of the US Constitution, since ONLY congress can make law! Yes, those executive orders, oh the ones Trump promised he would not do, but has constantly done them.
Trump talks just like people at the country club. Totally out of touch. Audience of suck ups.
I’m down to only 83 followers. I am not sure what happened. It only shows me as following 236 people.  What the hell . I’m small potatoes. But I was close to 1000 followers. What a bunch of crap twitter has become. I can’t wait for Trump to knock these people down a peg or two.

My understanding is that you aren’t stupid  You know that Trump messed up with COVID-19 so bad that he can’t win. How could Trump have done worse? Endorse me. I’m liberal, but I’m for the Constitution. I’m the only smart candidate running for President.
No Brent- it’s not damned if you do damned if you don’t. It’s listen to science or people will get sick and die. Stick to dick pics buddy.
This is a lie, the economy is not improving, for we are still loosing 4 million jobs a month. Trump's numbers are not subtracting the jobs lost!

“Out smarted” ? He trashed the constitution,broke laws, rules &amp; procedures. His team have more investigations &amp; convicts. He’s a better criminal that will go down eventually.  You think again. MAGA doing what Trump wants, that’s why he said, “I love my poorly educated supporters”
I don’t deal w/this rag,but I couldn’t let this slide.He didn’t “Threaten” harm 2 any1.This is another whiny, weak action by a bunch of Trump puppets pushing courts 2 attack ppl he doesn’t like Group pushes complaint against Schumer for Kavanaugh comment.

odd how when obama was in office terrorist attacks on Americans and our military Trump was elected it all stopped if biden gets in are obama's sleepers going to start their attacks to weaken our military and country for a take over
when obama ran for office not one word how black people don't have the right to vote but Trump is up for reelection all of a sudden they don't have the right to vote and have to pass a special act something don't add up been that way since obama
That's so interesting. I wonder what it is she loves. Trump has his faults but most Trump supporters have valid reasons they love him.  I just can't diplomatically see anything good in Joe.
And do what biden shut the country down and destroy our economy and still have a virus spread like wildfire a virus the democrat's created with their allies China just to get Trump out of office because he's hurting your profits from China
Can't control a virus before covid Trump was bring back jobs that the democrat's created in China the democrat's are not for American's they need to blame Trump for their corruption and to get him out of office before he drains their profits

1.1 million people lost their jobs last week, 16.1 million still unemployed, -32.9% GDP.....Trump is destroying the economy!
100% a lie! No jobs were created, these are jobs being returned too which were already created. Two, it is solely because of Trump's incompetence, ignorance and stupidity the economy is in a depression.

Excellent read.Many traditional pro-life folks have let their fiscal conservativism trump their pro-life views by opposing government spending on the very things identified by pregnant women considering abortion. (Healthcare, jobs, affordable housing)There must be practical help.

He isn't worthy of any vote.  Common sense must prevail. Trump 2020.
If Trump said the same things about Whites, that Biden routinely says about Blacks, can you imagine the media coverage? Can you imagine the millions of voters he would lose?   Biden will get little negative media coverage, and will lose very few voters.   🤷‍♂️

Shouldn't you be about shutting down the Post Office? That is what Trump wants and Mitch is stopping Trump and you want to get closer to Trump.
What is Trump's cut?
Over half a million die annually from the FLU. Yet, Trump is blamed for the COVID deaths of the elderly, which would be the same people that the flu would likely kill.   We don't shut down the country for the flu or wear masks though. 🙄   Plus - I DO NOT trust the numbers.

Trump and Pence are failing in the federal response to COVID. Where is the promised website? Tests take far too long. Tracing is meagre. COME ON. YOU CAN DO BETTER.
Yes, it’s incredible. Trump’s lies are so outrageous and off the mark. He is losing his mind and ability to reason.
The President has lost touch with reality. His lies have become outrageous and unbelievable. He is delusional.  Trump should stop talking about Biden, as Trump gets it all wrong. Trump should tell us what he will do with 4 more years!

Now We just need to keep the democrat's from tampering with the election even more like using black Americans making false promises, misinformation about Trump democrat's are all lies as an American I've had enough time to vote them out
Due to the way the electoral college works, the president will either be Trump or Biden. A vote for neither is equivalent to not voting, which helps Trump. Do you really want 4 more years of Trump?
can you force Trump Campaign to pay for the entire event and the use of Air Force One because he did that? "At an official WH event, Trump is delivering a campaign speech, repeatedly attacking Biden. Many of the lines are right out of the rallies." -
At least Trump isn’t dumb enough to be an actual Christian.
Well that's one way to duck being photographed with Trump. Glad he is negative.
Not conspiracy, only easily checked factual events.  If the Democrat Party Press didn’t consistently cover for the Obama Administration these scandals would be evident to everyone.  President Obama had no reason to coordinate with the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign.
Wow, just enough time that even if it isn’t sold and never gets shut down, every 18-25 year old TikTok user will have already registered to vote or have voted early against Trump. For the next 45 days, you will see nothing but “vote Trump out” on TikTok. Not smart.
So, I think that someone needs to start making videos telling Trump fans to vote for Kayne, that he is a younger version of Trump and will make America greater than Trump! We need to flip this back on the GOP!

“During his seven years in Congress, he developed an unsurpassed reputation for blowing things up and making sure bills didn’t pass. But he has virtually no experience at getting things done.”

Um, actually, the best president of my lifetime Barack Obama already saw to that.  It's one of the major provisions in the Affordable Care Act, that trump and the GOP have worked every day to destroy.  Perhaps you've heard of it.  🖕🖕🖕
BREAKING: Trump announces the law that has existed for ten years.  Amazing! Thanks Obama!
It gives conservatives who don’t want to vote for trump someone else to vote for other than Biden.
And by the country, you were referring to the Trump and Kushner families getting wealthier right?
My bachelor’s degree is in Economics, and this is a question I’ve been asking myself for months. I think the answer is this administration always favors corporate America over individual Americans. They know as long as Trump is President they’ll get theirs.
Trump endorses Obamacare!!!!!
Yes, please, I need to hear from Trump supporting Christians how they reconcile this man with not a moral, ethical, loving bone in his body.
tRump is a criminal who has done everything he can to corrupt the Rule of Law, e.g. pardoning criminals and appointing a fascist as AG.  He deserves 10x more harassment than he’s getting.
Kevin, I may be wrong, but I always thought the odds added up to more than 100 because THAT'S where Predictit takes its cut. For example, right now Biden is 58 cents and Trump is 44. I assumed that extra 2 percent was the vig.
I had never heard of that term until we moved from NY to CA 32 yrs ago. You know Trump got to all of the pastors before the election. In the church closest to me the pastor had 850 people down on their knees (Protestants don't kneel, y'all) "praying for the soul of the nation".
Y  R A douche!  trump can hardly handle getting his depends on so 1 crisis at a time is more than adequate for him and he does it badly!  trump listens to no one so he fails every time he opens his mouths. You should slither back into your sewer ur part of problem!
The group’s main takeaway? “President Trump is a historic failure.”
It will eradicate the trump virus.  That virus is more deadly the  COVID.  trump weaponized  COVID bec he wanted more people 2 die to help the stock market.  He even said so! Vote Blue is responsibly way to ending this one day.  trum continues 2 escalate it!
Trump administration is a criminal organization
It’s because Democrats have the political wind to their back right now, and won’t make concessions to republicans.  It’s a shit move for the American people, but it’s a win-win politically.  If shit doesn’t improve, blame will ultimately fall on trump and Republicans in power.
Trump’s lackeys are going to keep testing boundaries like this to hand him the election.  ⁦ when are you going to start issuing subpoenas to check this?

Trump is making relief negotiations impossible and forcing millions of Americans to get evicted.   In November, we have to fire the entire Republican Party for serving Russia and rich people instead of the poor and middle class.
Ugh disgusting especially given what this country has been going through with Nazi trump in the WH!  If they adhere to being Nazis then let them move elsewhere.
will do that.  He is a good man.  He is not a racist or a traitor.  He has not desire to exploit America 2 make himself richer.  He would NEVER allow contracts on our troops! If trump wins it is the end of our country as we know it.  And is will be irreversible!

Who is the real Senator Graham? The guy who was outspoken about what a Trump presidency would do to our country and our party or the guy who sends multiple ingratiating tweets to him every day? It is no wonder we all think politics is B.S. and the GOP has become a cult.

My point is, saying Warren is the prohibitive favorite like your pal did is just Trump-like bluster. In fact, she ISN'T. Not by a long shot.  Maybe she'll get it. But if so, it will be a massive upset. And word from the inside is that it's down to Harris and Rice.
Traitor trump and his gop cult keep spouting off about how unsafe voting by mail is but never explain how voting with ivanka’s machines is “safer”! Wonder why....?????
This is trump’s fault, moron.   I’m sorry that more people aren’t lining up to die at minimum wage jobs, but your dear leader wasted all these months when he should have been making our country safe so everyone COULD go back to work and school safely.
Trump has gone far beyond the 10 commandments and 7 deadly sins.  Read the full litany of horrors.
I always have. Never watched them, and hadn’t even heard of him until he visited Trump in the WH.
Wouldn't it help Biden in Michigan by taking votes from Trump? What Biden voter would actually switch to Kid Rock?

I lost contact with him years ago.  I couldn’t even if I wanted to.  But he was always a long haired hippie type guy who loved the Grateful Dead. So nobody was more surprised and disappointed than me when he went to work for Trump. Trust me on that.

He will lose what is left of his dignity, all for Trump. Why?
I didn't invent it. though over the years I've produced several similar slurs that symbolically transpose the two opposing ends of the human GI tract. I believe I actually got it from  when He was rebuking Trump directly early in his term (Trump's, not God's).

I won't insult the dumbest president we have ever had by naming him. But this lumpy sack of used diapers we call Donald Trump is the dumbest president we have ever had.
I believe the most glaring aspect of this election is the need to end Trump's autocracy, nepotism and purchasing of power.
While any good presidential race boils down to which man seems less senile and racist, the Trump campaign wants to make it about neurology even if that's a gamble, because Trump has zero policy ideas other than theft and dodging prison while expelling bullshit thru his face-anus.

Joe Biden Rips Trump’s ‘Decision Today to Profane God and Smear My Faith’ in Blistering Statement

And he never will be. In their eyes he's "better than Trump" and that's that. The part that's supposed to come after where we hold him and the dems accountable will never come.  Everything they say is empty. Void of all substance or morality.
Many Liberals hate Trump only because he embarrasses them.   They'll be happy to replace him with a warmongering, rapist, racist, who will deny Americans M4A and a Green New Deal.  But at least they won't feel embarrassed anymore, and that's what really counts.

Yes, saying Trump and Clinton are both bad in 2016 is why we are here. If we can’t see that Trump is so many times worse than either Clinton or Biden, then this country deserves the worst that will happen under another 4 years.
She’s correct.  She has made it very clear many times that she WON’T be voting for Trump, yet she’s also not saying who she intends to vote for.  There are always many choices on a ballot, so she will either vote for Biden or one of the other non-viable options.

Thank you for taking time to reply. That helped me understand better. Just for clarification - from this point of view, would Trump and Biden winning be equally horrid, one less horrid than the other, or it’s too messy to say?

Remember that trump is appointing people to throw sabots into the voting machinery. The GOP can’t win majority elections. So they have to find ways to suppress the vote.

Ok genius.  Prove to us how many times Trump has been to church.  “Incorrect” doesn’t cut it.  I’ll wait.
It's not that I believe he even thinks this; I'd bet my life Trump is an atheist, as, in his mind, no deity could be smarter or better than him.   It's that he thinks his Christopathic fans will rally behind it. Instead, it forces them to defend him with even dumber ideas.
Never have I heard even the most wild-eyed swamp-preacher complain that God was damaged, especially by a mortal, given that the very possibility ruins the entire scheme.   Yet fundies, shitsuckers all, will find goobered-up ways to explain Trump's whine as perfectly Christian.

The way I see it, there’s a higher chance of progressive legislation getting passed, progressive justices appointed, etc. under Biden than Trump. That could potentially lead to a better voting system being established in the future. (3/5)
Lmk if I need to shut up, but I feel inclined to say I would reinforce the 2 party system and vote for Biden because I’m scared to see the US with 4 more years of Trump. (1/5)

Yeah, so Trump also said he would sign new, comprehensive health care legislation into law.   Two &amp; 1/2 weeks ago, he promised Chris Wallace on  that his new plan would be signed in 2 weeks. Of course that was a lie.   So color me skeptical re: vaccine by Nov 3. 🤨
‘Kids are getting this disease’: Fox News host cuts off Kellyanne Conway over Trump ‘misinformation’
Dear  watchers and  supporters   Concessions Trump Repub admin forcing are reducing your unemployment benefits  Taking $$ your state, your local govt needs to fund police, schools etc  Repubs are tarting evictions against you  Not funding testing...
"He's against God."  Trump blew his campaign wad on that one. I mean, fuck... where can you go from there?
Two &amp; a half weeks ago, Trump promised  Chris Wallace he would sign a new, comprehensive health plan in two weeks. Of course that was another lie.   Why would anyone believe Trump about a vaccine? You have to be a complete fool to believe anything this man says.
It's almost as if it has to come from Trump's mouth to be true. Which is dangerous

Tinkerbell Trump spreading fake news again. Trump speaking from The Twilight Zone. How come he's not in Washington DC working on the stimulus package for the American people? Cuz he don't care. Instead he's at his golf course in New Jersey doing a photo op.

I wish Trump would go "a different way". Waaaay Awaaaay, from this country!
The only disappointment in this Administration is Mike lying ass pence and Donald Duck Trump. The coronavirus will not be extinguished until we get rid of Donald Duck Trump from our White House.
If Biden loses to Trump in the general, that will be absolutely pathetic. Trump's response to the pandemic has been Hoover-level bad. Unfortunately, the Dem establishment would take a Biden loss as, "well, if he couldn't have defeated Trump, no one could have!" We're screwed 🙃
We are living in a time of unrestrained selfishness, given permission to unleash our basest instincts from POTUS himself. President Trump has modeled &amp; encouraged the hatred, anger, &amp; corruption we’re overwhelmed with today. But it won’t end with him.

There are two candidates: trump or Biden. If your vote for Biden  is dependent upon his pick for VP you have shown yourself.  This is a privileged mindset.

He’s outside next to his wife really no one else besides a good friend who probably was tested really and that’s why he deserves death threats that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard! Next to Trump speaking!!!

Ok, that’s what I was thinking, but it still seems a stretch to say he’s doing it to benefit Trump. He’s so vague &amp; weird &amp; conspiratorial, it’s hard to know what he means.
What does he mean “walking to win”? Slow walking? I don’t get it. I thought he just said he was done with Trump. I must be missing something.

Trump just in case you wanna know  Biden and his wife regularly attend mass at Saint Joseph Church on the Bradywine in Greensville Delaware. Trump where do you attend church?
Trump last person to talk about God and a verse from the bible. A while back he was asked about a verse from bible and couldn’t give one. Does Trump even go to church on Sunday or just golf.
Biden don’t fall into Trump’s schemes he wants more debates. It doesn’t matter how many debates Trump has he will say he won them all like he did with Hillary. Just don’t let Trump follow you around the stage like he did with Hillary also. Trump up to no good.
Trump lying again. Must bring up Obama all the time.
Trump is campaigning in the midst of a PANDEMIC.  He is the worst.
50% racist or brain dead Americans would vote for Trump. cuz Trump don't give a fuk about nobody especially not our kids.

Weird how trump kept yelling lock her up when 4 died in benghazi and Clinton used a private email server. But when  uses a private server and causes 154,000 American deaths. He doesn't want to go to jail. He wants to implement more fascism via executive over reach
I wished trump would put this much effort into fighting the virus! #AmericaOrTrump #votetrumpout #DictatorTrump
All you tik tok fans, 18 and older, best get out and vote against Trump.  According to news sources he will be banning Tik Tok
BREAKING: President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday that he plans on banning popular social media application TikTok in the US.
I so agree! She needs an award! 🙌 She always nails it. I don’t think we realize how hard it is to nail every nuance like that. She’s a brave soul to spend that much time focusing on Trump’s nonsense!
Rat named tRump?
Trump politicized every speech he's given...
They're abandoning the Trump train this time Donny! That's why you've resorted to cheating! Like Obama said you're attacking the postal service? Shutting down polling places? You're trying to scare people out of voting because you're making it unsafe for people to vote!
let's see.............extreme fires, murder hornets, rigged primaries, boy scouts bankrupt, kobe &amp; daughter killed, trump impeached, sarah palin on masked singer, trump assassinates qasem soleimani, scientologist veep possibility...........what else?
I honestly think there are a lot of people who are racist that don't even realize they are. Trump has just brought their racism to the forefront.
Epstein and trump
What has Trump done for minorities. To hate black and brown people more.
Just like Trump is pushing no mail in ballots we need to do the same mail in your ballot.He is pushing it and even if he loses will say it’s a scam. He won’t leave office. Are we headed for civil war when Biden wins and Trump must be kicked out. What will republicans say then.
Just shows Biden would be in line with Trump.
Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the White House condemned Hong Kong's decision to delay its legislative council elections amid the coronavirus pandemic — a day after the president suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election.
Trump and Putin are bros. Putin's word is greater than Americans.
You say this like you don't know who trump is. How has he made it? How have his kids made it? Y'all are some clowns.
Trump has know begun his dictatorship.
Talking and trying to figure out this pandemic and the republicans, right of the bat, attack Fauci. The two trump supporters tell republicans what they want to hear. Gym jorden is a troubled little boy. They all act like children. Get these punks out of our house.
fun fact:  trump said ice didn't have to keep records anymore of detainees being sexually abused.  so they destroyed the records.  innocent establishments don't do that.
trump wants to destroy the usps simply to prevent people from using mail in ballots.  also the postmaster general has ties to companies frothing at the mouth to take over the usps.
This is nazi action. Trump must be stopped.
The hill seems to only advertise for Trump and his supporters. The hill us gone.
Watch this short movie on how Trump is killing us and know killing his supporters.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so - CNNPolitics   Trump about to call off the election and declare himself King? Call elections office now &amp; get absentee ballots sent to your home! Avoid long lines &amp; voters suppression!

One issue of disagreement is over unemployment supplements. Last week, millions of unemployed Americans received their last $600 a week addition to unemployment from a previous stimulus package.
Write the resignation!! Trump 2020
Trump has enough sycophants who will try to help him steal an election. #LastWord
Donald Trump should be in prison
Why is the new postmaster general being allowed to slow mail up. This is really shitty. Trump will stop at nothing to win
Sounds like Trump and reminds me of this:
#UPDATE  "Do I want to see a date change? No," Trump said at the White House hours after raising the idea of a delay in a tweet. "But I don't want to see a crooked election."
President Trump was provided w/ an expert plan on how to handle the pandemic by his own SIL, but instead, he lied about the virus, discouraged testing to protect his image, &amp; pit the states against each other in a fight for scarce resources.
Y'all need to report tRump tweet.
Donald Trump is not going to leave the White House willingly. He'll never accept losing an election because his corruption will be exposed! The statute of limitations from his crimes in NY will not run out unless he wins another by term. The worse crazy is yet to come?
Donald Trump should be charged with the 150,000 Dead Americans that died from the coronavirus because of his bulshit saying that it was a HOAX. Do nothing Trump Unfit as President and as a human being.
Get Donald Trump out of our White House. He's a menace to America's  Constitution, democracy along with making the Department of Justice the laughing stock of the world. He believes that the attorney general of the  United States is his legal lawyer. WRONG answer. 2020 elections.
The America that I fought for, that I lost my blood brother and many many more. Just to let somebody like Donald Trump walk all over our Constitution and Shit all over democracy and make a laughing stock DOJ. He is not our King he is unfit as such. Bone Spur Cadet Draft Dodger.No - the dems/msm will continue their assault on Trump for the next 4 yrs; however, he will have a majority in Senate &amp; House so he will MAGA. Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff - not re-elected.  Deep State In Jail. Replicn Govs. Life is good!
So!?  Did you think Trump wouldn’t call you out for what you are?  Trump could have said a lot worse about you &amp; we would have loved it. You deserve no respect - you’re despicable.
But you and Trump are Menace to America. Trump's (and therefore, your) crimes go far beyond partisanship.

Doesn’t matter. The Russians, the postmaster general and Bill Barr have got this covered for Trump.
News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
While Trump has his press conference about an “Executive Order” on pre -existing conditions, he moves on the Post Office and decapitates it’s management.    WE ARE THIRTY DAYS PLUS OR MINUS BEFORE BALLOTS GO OUT.

Trump’s tax cut was great for the middle class!  You didn’t write this tweet - you couldn’t even say it w/o floundering.  You’re looking more &amp; more ridiculous &amp; Trump is running circles around you. Where’s Hunter? Why isn’t Hunter campaigning for you?
It was Trump at his best!  He bitch slapped the enemy press &amp; the audience loved it!  Who needs rallies?  MAGA Landslide On The Way!
Same. And this is important to state aloud. We have never experienced deadlock like we have now. It has handed us Trump. The pandemic gives us an opportunity to reconfigure. We will be the Trump of reconfiguration if we cannot reform how to function together.
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.

Traitor trump and his gop cult keep spouting off about how unsafe voting by mail is but never explain how voting with ivanka’s machines is “safer”! Wonder why....?????
She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine “I wish her well” doesn't bother you?
So get trump elected, what am I missing?!?
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.

She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.

Interesting take.  And all along I had thought it was God's punishment for electing Trump.

So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
I love how the Trump boys always try to highlight Biden’s cognitive deficiencies. But Dad? Oh, he’s fine... 🤪
Remember that trump is appointing people to throw sabots into the voting machinery. The GOP can’t win majority elections. So they have to find ways to suppress the vote.
In a sane world, Trump's abuse of national emergencies, temporary appointments, etc would lead the next congress and presidency to dramatically pull back on the power of the presidency. I'm just really skeptical that Biden and the Dems will lift a finger to do so if they win.
Leave it to creative types to invent a world where Trump is “sweating” prosecution enough to retain the presidency for life. You people are insufferable...
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.

Trump loves this country so much.  I don’t believe anyone else could take the constant hate &amp; demonization he gets; criticized every time he opens his mouth.  It never stops &amp; he keeps going - he had a good life too.  I believe he will someday be revered-no one tougher.
At least he didn't vote in an attempt to REMOVE civil rights protections.  Meanwhile,  has done worse than just vote against civil rights....
I’m not that curious/interested in who your choice for VP is - you will never be elected. No one  on your List is capable of being president &amp; you definitely aren’t.  We’re in good hands w/Trump for 4 more yrs. No one cares who the dem VP nominee will be.

why isn’t it news when Republicans working for Trump are trying to exploit Kanye West’s mental illness?  Trying to put him on the Colorado ballot?   What is wrong with people?   Don’t you want to know?

Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.

So trump and his donor can single-handedly slow the workings of the post office, but clap-back Nancy can't figure out how to use the power of the purse, or other strategies, to counter these actions?
Sen Thune on idea of Trump acceptance speech from WH grounds: “Is that even legal? … I assume that’s not something that you could do. I assume there’s some Hatch Act issues or something......But I think anything you do on federal property would seem to be problematic.”No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
Trump says. "It is what it is." Haha Not funny!
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‘s the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.

Any doubts Trump is a racist?  Watch this...
Thanks  for doing what had never been done before that Trump is now taking credit for!!! 🤬🤬
Trump’s campaign isn’t even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.
Its Classic #Trump...taking credit for somebody else's work...and thinking nobody would notice...#Trump is still in Grade school.

Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year’s race.
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he’s gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal 😉
Trump is planning to issue an executive order to mandate something that is already mandated by law... There I fixed your headline

Griffin’s anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with “go back to Africa” comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he’s not a racist.
Exactly! You can’t make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn’t stink as much as Trumps; but it’s still smelly shit 💩
Don’t let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun

All you supporters talk as if #Trump likes you or something...#Trump only cares about #Trump not even the people he swore to protect..everything he does is for show...If its about the country #Trump could care less about it...That's it...

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.
Can’t face palm hard enough. Jeez   To a white, *almost* middle aged man suburbanite in the “heartland” the Trump years have been...enlightening in some respects
I'm in Denver. I see 4 Trump signs for every 1 Biden sign
Trump~instead of making us great, he’s made us ineffable
I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
Self trepanning.  Trump say it kills #COVID__19.  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
Certainly Obama's is bigger than Trump's.
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.
Breaking News: Trump just announced his Health Care Plan.
Foreign powers meddling in our elections yet again. Cue radio silence from trump
Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.
If tell them to fuck off! That’s what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!
Trump enterprise and crime family.. emoluments, stealing from kids cancer charity, the Hatch Act.. shall I go on?
Just saw this tinder bio   “Pretty girls like Trump”  Me when I see a pretty girl
Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.

If it wasn’t seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn’t Trump’s defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?
Donald Trump’s Donors Receive Ominous Warning About Becoming 'Don's Next Con' | HuffPost
In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden

I'm a christian and did not vote for Trump morals, integrity and common sense are valuable to me. He doesn't hold any of the values of Christianity and is not humble or a believer in God, Jesus, repentance or the bible.
Was wondering where Trump’s African American had been hiding. He might be Security, not sure
Is this a joke? We lost 40 million jobs under Trump.

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let’s make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
Yo Jason. You’re a smart guy. It’s already the law. I have no idea what Trump thinks he is doing as he is simultaneously in federal court trying to eradicate Obamacare which covers pre-existing conditions. You are lunatics operating in some fringe reality. #TrumpHasNoPlan

So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

Or call Jeff Bezos -- I bet he could gin up a postal system and burn Trump in the process, something that would be quite satisfying to him I imagine.
lrt: i am also not trump make me the dem nominee
Just like Trump, schools are not even pretending to try.👹
Just like Trump has no plan to stop COVID19. We are officially the country with no plan. It is a common theme!👹
Did Trump say we wouldn’t see him for a while?  Or is that just another disappointing lie?
#Hannity  I hope Trump wins the black vote
You just described a typical supporter of Trump.  😂
Also, huuuge Trump supporter
Yes, it's so major that Trump is trying to take credit for what Obama accomplished years ago  Are you actually that stupid or do you just think that voters are?
If it comes from a Trump , it’s not true ! Like father like son , TARITORS !
Mexican girl gets American citizenship while trump is in office (TRUMP2020)  via  #Anons #LatinosForTrump #hispanos #WWG1GWA
The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he’s going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.
An inside look at the legal battles that lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are facing during the Trump administration.  Watch THE FIGHT:
I’ll only use Reels if trump threatens to ban it
Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump’s best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn’t expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.
WTAF?...holy sh*t....the ship that caused the explosion in Beirut was Russian...and now a ship named after Trump has 3 times the explosives is pulling into Ukraine....JFC....
You're surprised?? Not me! Trump's helping him
Biden says a racism, goes on TV later and says that same racism again.  ABC News: Trump bad! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Trump and his administration also botched the nation’s testing rollout, played down the disease, offered false assurances and bogus remedies, discouraged mask wearing, pushed the economy to reopen prematurely, concealed data, and disparaged testing.
Donald J. Trump: Shut down pedofile organization, NAMBLA - Sign the Petition!  via
#Tucker  In a nutshell, the Dems will do anything to bring down Trump and regain power
Our suffering for Trump’s failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives — and it has been squandered by one man’s incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.
Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures
Living in Gotham does not make one cosmopolitan by default. For example, Donald Trump.

Lies, Lies, Lies!   Your obsession with Trump is pathetic, like calling yourself a father while being a known drug addict! Keep playing around and talking 💩 and I’ll show you my connections. Your OBSESSED! Poor little 🗑 heep! 🤣
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
I find the idea to be ridiculous...at this point in time....if you would vote for Kanye...you would vote for Trump....I think this will backfire and actually pull votes from Trump...
tRUMP's NEWEST PROPAGANDA AGENDA, JUST FLAT OUT LIE ! ! ! he SAYS PANDEMIC BRIEFING, REALLY JUST ANOTHER 📷 OP!!! THE BULLSHIT fake*president!#JustTapPicsPlease!!!
Just remembered I had crazy dreams last night! I dreamt  &amp; I had been assigned to review Trump's health records, &amp; we discovered a note that he'd had three heart attacks, &amp; another would be fatal, &amp; we weren't allowed to tell people! Crazy. Trump has no heart!
There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn’t seen it? All roads lead to Putin....
O i almost forgot the most famous trump quote about his supporters  "Like fish in a barrel" -Trump
I’m not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community’s assessment, the president said, “The last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.”  Pressed on the matter, he said: “I don’t care what anybody says”
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn’t make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!
Trump’s brilliant new healthcare plan is...Obamacare?! 🤣🤣🤣 #copolitics #ThanksObama
TRUMP smoked that reporter...lol
160,000 Americans are dead, there's record unemployment, Trump is sandbagging the postal service, relief talks have collapsed, &amp; Combover Caligula is preening in front of a bunch of rich assholes at a golf club he profits from *while President*. #sorrynotsorry about the cursing.
Anyone else feel that words like "beautiful" and "wonderful" and "biggest" and "best" (etc etc etc) are... "Trump" words? Like, I need to expand my vocabulary so I don't sound like that fuckwit.No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‘s the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.
Trump will leave a shart stain.

Any doubts Trump is a racist?  Watch this...
Thanks  for doing what had never been done before that Trump is now taking credit for!!! 🤬🤬
Trump’s campaign isn’t even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.

Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year’s race.
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he’s gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal 😉
Baby, if you think Trump gives a shit about you, well, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
Not remotely close.  We are all suffering from Trump induced anxiety and depression.  Exhausted.
Don't you get it people??? This is exactly what #Trump wants...People protest, No Masks, people get sick and die...Then whats Left are #Trumps anti-Christ White supremacy foot soldiers to do his bidding...#Trump wants to be a dictator so bad, he licks his Own Butt!!!

Griffin’s anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with “go back to Africa” comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he’s not a racist.
Exactly! You can’t make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn’t stink as much as Trumps; but it’s still smelly shit 💩
Don’t let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun
how can u say this is not a good president?  unemployment thru the new year  #TennesseeValleyAuthority CEo was getting 8 million a year, laid off everyone, made them train they (cheaper, foreign) replacements- trump was like, “hell no”   . 🌩️LoveU Sir
All you supporters talk as if #Trump likes you or something...#Trump only cares about #Trump not even the people he swore to protect..everything he does is for show...If its about the country #Trump could care less about it...That's it...

New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.

A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.

Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.

In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let’s make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

Trump is going to sign an executive order mandating that trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
So did Trump, tool.
So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.
Trump speaks the truth.  You should try it.
Lmao. Imagine being this fucking stupid. 😹😹😹 #Trump
It’s worked for Trump so far
Trump signs more executive orders in first three years than Obama despite calling them 'power grabs' | The Independent
Don’t trust him. ⁦  is a compulsive #Liar.  Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions | TheHillI thought you all hated elitists? Tell us how he craps in a gold toilet too.   Le sigh, his base will still cheer when Donald Trump tells them not to go to college or any higher education. No wonder they love him. They have no critical thinking skills.
I'm not being critical, but ever since 2017, when Trump took office, over &amp; over again, people say, "this cannot stand/happen/be moral/legal/real" &amp; while the moral/legal aspects are true, it DOES stand &amp; it IS real.  Words &amp; opinions are important but only action produces change
You blindly back Trump, big problem
If anyone is trying to figure out how to submit fake mail-in ballots, I suspect it’s the trump admin.
Ya, &amp; that's only 40% of the jobs lost during  Covid disaster &amp; ignorance of controlling it!  If you're going to just pick facts that suit you, you're as much a conman as Trump if not more!
Trump campaign officials clearly haven't watched the disastrous attempts by Trump to speak without a teleprompter. He'll be destroyed by Biden, then fact checkers!  Trump campaign says Michigan voters deserve presidential debate before early voting starts
And to think about how many people, families &amp; organizations that could benefit from that  $1 Billion. Trump has no chance to win. It disgusts me the money used in campaigns while kids are starving &amp; homelessness is dramatically increasing! Pathetic!
Trump is obviously a nut case and im counting down until he’s out of office. But banning TikTok was a good move because China’s forsure using that user data to exploit the US 🤷🏾‍♂️. Do ya research bih
Obamacare has done this for years. ALREADY EXISTS in Obamacare. Trump Justice Dept. will argue at Supreme Court this coming fall to ABOLISH Obamacare.
Trump would have rated Marie Antoinette a 6 at best.
You chose Trump. B bye
I'm a Democrat voting for Trump!! Thanks to      I'm ready to help educate my family when shtf. Sheep no more, #ww1wga
150,000 Americans dead is fantastic, trump.
If Pompeo talked to Russia about bounties, why didn't Trump?  via    I wonder. #Vote #BeAPollworker #volunteer
Like when trump denigrated gold star families? Or when he is talking about John McCain?   Being in the hospital for a month doesn’t say anything to you? And KAG is old. You wanna keep America with 50 million unemployed? A 34% drop in GDP? Even DJT changed it back to MAGA.
Successful entrepreneurs? Lmao! Trump has NEVER been successful! He’s a con man.
Why? The very second I read this title, I instantly thought of Trump running naked chasing mail-in votes in Nov. It's a sad state of affairs.
I sincerely doubt that, when the history of this debacle is written, it will be Dr. Birx who prevented the *Donald J. Trump* administration from mounting an effective response.
I actually agree. When you’re debating someone as factless as trump you can only hurt yourself. Trying to debunk people who you know aren’t playing by the rules is pointless
Pompeo believes the intel and Trump doesn't. Itll be interesting to see if Trump does anything about Pompeo's conversation.
She didn't write the article. The reporters who did write it point out that this is one of many examples where Trump's cabinet do things without Trump's knowledge or approval in order to get things done. Pompeo believes the bounty story. Trump does not.
NO TRUMP is GOLFING TODAY🏌🏿‍♂️  SURPRISE‼️😂
Trump reminds me of Elmer Gantry.
What do you mean? After his pardon, he’s suckled on the Trump teat.
Know that, but... When a person has chosen to not learn more, has CLOSED their mind to other information, they're lost causes.  Also, my impression afterwards, he's ashamed of choosing trump, and instead... Attacked me for asking if he is still supporting 45. Best part? Shame.
TRUMPS Smirk at the END of the   interview can only be interpreted as TRUMP thinks HE ACED IT‼️🤣  I have watched it 5 times &amp; I laugh harder EACH TIME‼️😂  What a TOTAL Jack ASS‼️  NOVEMBER 3rd...Hurry UP‼️✅
Actually, a retired physician in Vail told me he 'would vote for Kanye before he's ever vote for Biden'. That's a lost cause.  Ignorance, no matter how educated and worldly - is a choice.  Told me I have a hard case of 'trump derangement syndrome'. Turns out I do.
Swear to god, there could be a video released of Joe Biden getting head from a child and y’all will STILL be like “well, he’s not Trump, so he gets my vote🤷‍♂️”
I know it’s an early draft of the story and maybe the reporters will make that distinction as the story develops, but at least give readers a line that says something like “Trump’s support of Hong Kong protesters stands in stark contrast to his rhetoric against U.S. protesters.”
Joe Lockhart,  You sound just like Trump!
Seems odd to me that this story about Trump putting sanctions on China for cracking down on protesters fails to mention any of Trump’s own attempts to quash protesters in our country.
Imagine not only being okay with living in a fascist police state but supporting it by voting for Trump. Now keep that imaginary and not our reality and vote him out in November.
Finally a Trump campaign that I believe
We don't have any medical needs! As trump has said, many times, this is a fake virus.
And trump has been a huge disappointment to everyone.
trump is such a Christian. Even with all that adultery stuff.
As hard as you try to prove trump is right about 1 single thing, you fail.
Corruption and crime should be allowed to run rampant in the NRA. Maybe trump will bail them out.
No.  Do you know trump has 20,000 verifiable lies in 3.5 years?  Impressive.
I think there’s a part of Trump that also *likes* the authoritarian policies Xi can enact (e.g., censoring, punishing journalists he hates).  This situation is infuriating bc we could write policy protecting user data, regardless of company HQ location. But instead we punish
You're right Trump knows where he's at, La La Land.
Next thing you know, Trump is going to say he freed the slaves.
After 4 years I really don't care about the Obama administration, do you?I give a crap about what Trump has done. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
It's hard to believe a 70 plus your old man who runs an international company cannot pronounce Thailand. Time for Trump to go. #Thighland
If Kanye wants to help Trump, trumpsters need to send their votes to Kanye. They wouldn't know any better.
Trump is blasphemous
How long will trump and his cronies beat this dead horse?
With trump, I am surprised we are not number 1! Actually, I bet we are.
the masked kid in the back stretching out from 6’ while Senators Pelosi and Schumer are maskless in the #dangerzone talking #COVID19 relief   such a Trump move
I would have a heart for the president if he showed he had one.  All he ever shows is his extreme narcissism as everything he talks, tweets &amp; thinks about concerns one thing-Donald J. Trump.  As to being exhausted, maybe he should stay off Twitter &amp; the golf course, &amp; do his job!
Trump/Kennedy
Trump + Putin and Russia, so old news.  Yawn.
A cognitive offense is a poor choice for a Trump supporter.  Lots of examples of Trump's own cognition not meeting the "Be Best" criteria.
THERES LITERALLY PEOPLE DYING EVERY DAY. HOSPITAL ICU BEDS ARE FILLING UP AND DONALD TRUMP SAYS WAH WAH TIKTOK FUCK THIS DUDE FOR REAL
IS there any way to HOPE trump might be removed prior to election?  There's just got to be something that finally makes this nightmare end?  Thank you, all... Your response VERY appreciated 🙏🌊
The new executive order bans TikTok – and chat tool WeChat – under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.
Even they know they’re the baddies. (I genuinely believe this about Trump - he thinks that the Republicans are the baddies, even if most Republicans don’t.)
Evangelicals for Trump is the most head scratching shit I've ever heard. Can you be any more ignorant? Or are you literally stupid?
Leave it to CNN to spin this narrative.  I can't wait for the debates.  I could see them wanting to fight each other on stage.  Let's get ready to rumble!  Trump in round 2!  CNN's John King appears to defend Biden over former VP's 'diversity' remarks
Never said you were. Just making another observation about a group of people who support trump.
Trump just crapped his pants.
More lies. Trump has to fake support. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K
Well, Thighland ... the wrong pronounciation might affect something...  #trump #thailand #Thighland
Well, Trump already speaks in slurred tongues so it's only a matter of time.
.⁦ you hitched your wagon to the Trump train, you even predicted this would happen.
Kanye needs mental healthcare intervention. It's not funny. But, it's also not more important than saving the United States and democracy from the Trump crime syndicate m
Preferably on TV, at the white house, next to Trump and Bill Gates.  With an announcement of EUA &amp; massive funding
You can't be for real. You are not online pledging support for Donald Trump while calling the Democratic party "liars"! Are you? No, you can't be serious. There's no hidden cameras. No practical jokes? August fools prank? No, WOW! You've got some balls, lady!!!
I don't want these ppl touching another dime of taxpayer $ Not redecorating White House, Rose Garden, no more campaign rallies on our backs, no more gd travel for haircuts.  I'm done in SO many ways.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
So what you're saying is that you haven't seen the latest electoral college map? Um.... how do I say this?........ Trump,  you are 100% (or 1000% in your reality) SCREWED! You're not going to lose bad, you'll be destroyed! I for one can't wait! You deserve it!
Donald John Trump* and his Traitorous Trumpublican Thugs are out to overthrow the government that We the People built. They are a clear and present danger that all American Patriots must defend against. Put them to rest Election Day, Tuesday, November 3, 2020.

Apparently Biden said something bad but I can’t find it because of all the asinine things Trump keeps saying about Biden steal up all the search terms. If Biden manages to pull this out, this will be a big reason why.
would like all of America to understand GOD is a Republican, l am not sure if he is registered to vote or not? Trump is an idiot
No but never Trump means never conservative.   Republican means Democrat light.  John McCain was a republican NOT a Conservative.  With all due respect.
Ah yes. Let's do Trump statistics by comparing two different values a city vs a state. ¯\(°_o)/¯
Trump says Biden is going to beat up God. And the Bible.
We don't care, the goal is the complete removal, prosecution of the Trump crime syndicate.  Maybe, you just shhhhhh.  Anyone that believes Treason and child rape is acceptable, isn't a voice we want to hear from.  #ConsequencesForTrump
This guy. I'm a little old lady, and want to kick his deplorable ugly ass.  #TrumpKillsSeniors
Same! Don't make me think about it past "Not Trump." It all I can deal with right now. I can only handle 73458 disasters at at ime.
That's how far Trump has fallen... so far.
Everyone: *points out that Trump has a power complex and has no real regard for democracy* Trump:
yoo the day trump die imma turn the fuck up
I also want to know if anything I ever sent in made it to an issue... lots of pictures(comic drawings) and letters of expression. I can’t even find this magazine in stores anymore and that SUCKS! I want this subscription and a copy of MAD about Dump..I mean Trump.
His answer was direct and straight to the point Krrllyanne, something Trump never does!
Trump want inside them thighs  lol
No one taking your guns.  He's an idiot, liar.  They're taking down the ppl who fraudulently abused the system.  Stolen money from NRA, and NOT AGAINST CITIZENS. Focus on trump, the child rapist, racist, liar and sexual predator.  Oh, he's committed several acts of TREASON.
Trump wants to hold little girls down instead.
Somehow I don't think  thinks never Trump means getting rid of his enablers
That thing (45) using words that he himself is guilty of, let me point out - Donald J Trump is a child rapist and sexual predator with ties to sex trafficking. There's not a God that's okay with 45.  Racist &amp; godless POS.
Orgs that endorse Trump and are not investigated: Committee to Defend the President, Great America Committee, Great America PAC, Nat'l Right to Life Committee, Log Cabin Republicans, Republican Jewish Coalition, National Assoc of Police Orgs.
Again, this has nothing to do with them endorsing Trump. Stealing millions from a not-for- profit is illegal in all cases. I guess you could demand the NRA make sweeping changes asap to avoid being dissolved, but they don't appear to want to do that.
Other associations endorse Trump and are safe from prosecution. It's not hard to run an association legally. No one put a gun to Wayne's head and made him funnel millions of $$ to himself a few others.
I sure do hope Trump invites God to the WH for a couple of burgers.
There's Growing Panic That Trump Will Rush A Vaccine To Save His Presidency. That's Unlikely.  45 needs swift, immediate removal from any and all power. He's a sick, dangerous, wounded mentally unbalanced, unfit, incompetent ANGRY racist, narcissist. 🚫45🚫
Trump was impeached, his sycophants decided NOT to hold him accountable, but.. He's still impeached. Forever. We are saying, impeachment should prevent that person from any future elected office.  We're on the same side.  He's been let off, yet again. 162K dead. What # will it be
Still baffling that our choice is between an old white guy who chronically says wacky stuff and has been accused of sexual assault, and Trump
My 'like' was in a agreeing that an IMPEACHED person should not be allowed to run for Office.  I do agree with that.  I'm just unsure what  is saying.  Please, educate me?  I hate trump with the power of a supernova, and will do everything to save United States
Trump is the enemy because the people that voted for him,  &amp; support him now, wanted bad things for America &amp; he was the man to deliver-racism, misogyny, totalitarianism, ignorance, corruption, lack of respect for social norms &amp; institutions including the Constitution.
If by being an autocractic government w/ a capitalist economy &amp; zero interest in the Civil &amp; humanitarian rights of its citizenry, which is what China is, we're well on our way thanks to Trump &amp; his cronies.
we should test after meeting POTUS, perhaps Trump will understand corona virus and its impact once he has experienced first hand illness.
Fact check- Wuhan Virus came from fucking China, not Trump.
Everything he did was corrupt.  You listen to the media who protected him and never told of any of his acts.  Educate yourself.  Do not call me a racist.  Just because I support President Trump who also is not racist, does not make me one.  It is my pleasure to block you.
PEOPLE WORKING DON’T NEED a PAYROLL CUT—THEY ARE WORKING‼️💁🏼‍♀️ TRUMP just WANTS to CUT SOCIAL SECURITY‼️😳  WTF‼️😳
It’s not Pres Trump saying it. Biden is under investigation by Ukraine right now. Biden is named and quoted in fbi documents as participating in the unmasking and fake investigation of Gen Flynn and the Trump campaign. That’s just a couple of the things.
The prophet of the Trump presidency &amp; the absolute fuckery we're in. I follow her on multiple channels (Twitter and podcast) and she's so good. Everyone thought she was an alarmist and overly pessimistic but what she predicted (and more) came true.
4 year old girls are more rational than Trump &amp; they can even delineate their rationale better than he can.
Trump's first priority is to open schools and not your child's life.
Mr West is not well, he's being manipulated by trump admin and he needs mental health intervention. The Office for The President of the United States demands mental health, as well as a high degree of knowledge, we've discovered a lifelong grifter remains that, Ye needs help.
White House wants the 1200 Trump signed checks and endangered Senate Rs want to go home asap with something tangible as well. Nancy will get close to her number on unemployment with perhaps something more thrown in (post office?).
Colorado will go for Trump and Corey G.
Did you see trump f*ck up the HBO/Axios interview? Boy, that was an embarrassment.
Let's see. Who is the Chief misleader? Trump with 20,000 verifiable lies?
I would think that this lawsuit cannot get any traction. Voting by mail is perfectly legal &amp; Trump is fine w/ it in states he expects votes from people who would benefit from voting by mail in FL, AZ, etc.  &amp; the fact that it involves his vested interest in the election outcomes
Trump would get upset when some particularly curated fact he armed himself with was factually challenged &amp; disproven.  He would sulk &amp; say, "You can't do that!"like a spoiled toddler &amp; walk off stage if things weren't going his way.  Trump doesn't function well in the real world.
You are seriously bringing up Biden's inability to read prepared material? You need to be careful when you say things like this given the endless recordings of Trump stumbling over words, going off the cuff in the most disastrous ways &amp;/or reading everything in a stoned monotone.
It's wildly telling when all a Trump supporter has in his arsenal is Joe Biden whataboutism. If you can't genuinely defend the actual man &amp; his actions &amp; can only turn to casting untrue aspersions on his opponent, what does that reveal about your candidate &amp; your support of him?
We can hope the streak continues, but Trump's fundraising edge is disturbing.
Sorry you misspelled Donald Trump!
I spent 35 years carrying mail. And in my own not especially worried what the bosses thought way, I tried my damnedest to get it right for my customers. So to watch Trump and his suck-up postmaster general play games with it... fuck those fucking motherfuckers and etc. etc.
Although I’m an non believer I respect his beliefs. Unlike trump who only worships money and himself.
He appeals to the low brow, rural, under educated by playing on their fears and insecurities. It's the southern states that seem to appreciate Trump for some reason. I'm not knocking all southerners, but his supporters give them a bad name
Yeah, &amp; he said you can't do that. If we do it by population, there'll be more deaths shown &amp; he knows it. I love how Swan didn't back down to Trump. We need more like him
You wouldn't know science if you were snorting it up your nose. TRUMP 2020!!!
Quit watching Faux News!! Trump still doesn't have a national plan!!
That's true. I've been repeating  " Maybe Trump will go away" for years and it hasn't worked worth a damn.
That's true. I've been repeating  " Maybe Trump will go away" for years and it hasn't worked worth a damn.

"If life hands you a limo..." ~Slogan for the Trump kids
Seeing this after hearing for months that only Biden can beat Trump:
Countries across the globe run by Donald Trump are not only in shambles, but are the laughing stock of the world!-America
Does anyone know what a Spoonerism is? If so, this is for you. Donald Trump better known as Carey Hunt, thinks he's going to win in Nov. Chat fance!
I miss our President, First Lady - just ❤️ her honesty and sharing.  #UnitedNotDivided
Being that your busy lying about Covid, trying to destroy Postal Service, &amp; making up lies about President Biden, I wanted to make sure you saw this... oh, right. Have someone read it to you! Its important!
That's a very Trump-esque non answer. A lot of words to say 'yeah we talked about it and decided we're not going to do anything.'
Do trump supporters just choose to ignore the idiotic things he says or are they just that stupid too...
Ameri KA is F right now Trump!
Is there even the remotest chance Michelle Obama will be Joe Biden's VP? Trump would be apoplectic to lose to an Obama.
Apparently his new campaign manager hasn't yet had the chance to watch Trump in a live setting. Otherwise they wouldn't be pushing for an additional debate at the beginning of Sept. Anyone w/ any level of intelligence could forsee the nightmare that Trump live on TV is!!
Twitter Says Trump's WWE Tweet Attacking CNN Within the Rules  #curate
LOOK  HONG KONG is almost begging for a "Trump Tower Hong Kong", almost begging. Yes, its the shiny object you can't take your eyes off of. You should just resign &amp; start bidding this NOW, TODAY!
I honestly think that with the election coming up, Trump &amp; his allies can't claim victory about a border wall w/out replacing the $3.8 Billion Trump robbed from the Pentagon to pay for it. Tying it to the Covid relief pkg is abhorrent but believable with today's GOP! PATHETIC!
fuck donald trump
"Who thinks that seeing more of Donald Trump talking is going to help him politically?"-Nicolle Wallace (Priceless) If you're trying to get Trump on TV in front of more people speaking, you clearly haven't seen Trump on TV lately, or EVER!
hasn’t changed.
Did you hear we have a new national park Yo - semite.
GOP senator questions Trump giving RNC speech from the White House: 'Is that even legal?'  via    No. No it's not legal.
Canvassed thousands of doors in CO over many cycles. Most people do not open their doors. Can't believe any would this time. Lit drops on doorsteps often are thrown away. And I'm not sure I believe the numbers Trump campaigns claims.
Think of Bill Barrs summation of the Russia investigation.... Now think about a de-classified version of these reports coming out of this admin! I think we're honestly better NOT knowing! (or not letting this admin paint it in the light that serves Trump above all else)
I knew a guy who liked Trump in 2002. I wonder if he still does.
Every time you see a negative ad against Trump paid for by Republicans, you have to ask yourself why his own party has turned against him so blatently &amp; loudly! B/c he's the best "president" in history? Um.....NO!
Makes sense. Voting rights are not vital in Trump's America.
To me, this was one of the nuttier things Trump said this week, yet it's getting little press. It's basically one step away from a mob shakedown. "It would be a shame if something would happen to your lovely business here."
Also interesting to compare this week's numbers with a year ago. In August 2019, 15% of voters said they would vote 3rd party or not vote, but that was only 10% in August 2020. That 5% went to Trump and the Democrat lost 1% to him as Trump votes went 67% ➡️ 73% over that year.
Here's the same thing charted by number of producers that voted. Although support for Trump was the highest in the Feb. poll at 79%, you can also see that there were the fewest voters.  I think the trend in number of voters is interesting. Fewer votes today than a year ago.
🇺🇸U.S. farmers' support for Donald Trump in the upcoming Presidential Election is unwavering as 73% this week said they will vote for him.  Joe Biden captured slightly more interest this time than he did 3 months ago.  Here are the full results from all 6 quarterly "elections":
Apparently, Fred Trump's abuse of his boys included a sad neglect of cartoons.
Another complete and total embarrassment for trump.
trump is the largest loser.

Dr. Uncle trump said it. Someone believes him.
Exactly like Bush's economy in 2008, the Democrats will have to bail out trump's economy that he bankrupted. Again.
Just another bankruptcy in trump's disastrous life.
Nope, nope!  Dr. Uncle trump has determined that face masks are not appropriate. Do not wear masks.
Did you know:  president trump has 26 lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault and he paid off a porn star.  I wonder why fauxnews is so silent about this?  🤔
Unlike trump, President Biden doesn't need too.
Why do church goers worship trump the adulterer? Do church goers admire this quality?
"And the ones that come out will kill one in ten, but we need to get the economy going."*  *Loser trump.
"The Art of the Deal", "The Art of the Comeback"... Trump's great literary works... He forgot to complete the trilogy in the series... The Art of the Bankruptcy...
As a Kansas escapee, I'm astonished... in a good way. Kobach is a nightmare, Trump v2.
The Democrats have zero interest in helping the American people or their kids in this pandemic. That is obvious by their actions. The only thing they are focused on is bringing Trump down at any cost. They could care less about the folks.
So he can try and avoid questions by pulling out all of his ridiculous statistics that really mean absolutely nothing. Appreciate this video bc I don’t normally see many people challenge trump over and over like that.
The question is, will democrats continue screaming like idiots and ruining this country for another 4 yrs when Pres Trump is re-elected? Or finally work together to make things better?
“Trump views #China's China Communist Party as a threat. Young Chinese see it as a ticket to a better future”  Headline   Presumably the headline refers to those young Chinese who are not secretly imprisoned without trial ~ James Freeman

Donald Trump has such a sense of humor that his entire presidency has been a joke. 🤡
Love y'all.  Hate him way more. .. Until he's out of power, think all my energy goes towards his reckoning.  I like Mary Trump
Who on Trump’s team thought it was a good idea to let Jonathan Swan interview Donald Trump?
Progress!
Progress: Donald Trump doles out $765M loan to Kodak to make drug ingredients - Washington Times
That's funny trump. You are a comedian.
So the factual data about school children &amp; teachers isn't effected by Trumps wishes, or dreams! The fact is that states decide whether they open or not, THANK GOD! Trump can act like he's in charge all he wants to, from DC! Hands off my kids safety you LOSER!!  (in my opinion)
So hard to tell what is satire and and what is a genuine trump fan. 🤔
Key words: "president" thinks he has more support than ever!  That actually made me laugh today!  As if Trump would think his support is non-existant, or that his support is lacking b/c of his ignorance &amp; lies! Oh my, come on Fox, really?
OR... for the 68% of Americans that DO NOT TRUST TRUMP about Covid, visit the  website &amp; inform yourselves there! Where the actual medical professionals are, NOT Trump thinking he's smarter than the medical professionals!! Too important to fake!
if anyone needs a final reason NOT to vote for trump because he’s an idiot, here is your reason
I like trump don’t get me wrong, but I also can call our when some dumb shit is said, And this in fact, is some dumb shit. If we open the schools, not only will our kids have a major increase of chance to get infected, and yes while they are young it may not effect them
Florida. Let’s do Florida. Trump and mar a lago, included.
This could only be accomplished by Trump? Alright, I'm willing to concede that point.

Shh . . . Don't tell Trump that.
Anyone else want to hear Donald Trump pronounce all the names of America's parks?
I don't care anymore, fuck you Donald Trump. Get the hell out of our government
Naked Trump
Trump had NO PLAN other than #ItIsWhatItIs #RemoveTrumpNow #Invoke25
If Trump supports it, its 1000% because of is floundering approval ratings.
dude what are you even talking about? he’s saying that in proportion to population, the united states has a far higher death toll and trump says no you can’t you do that you have to follow the charts. did you even watch the video?😂
The Pandemic Is Damaging the GOP Brand Everywhere  Pretty sure if Trump wasnt a racist rapist POS, we wouldn't be here now.  Can't blame pandemic on the blatant ugliness, divisiveness and hatred he's encouraged. #WearADamnMask #RemoveTrumpNow #WeWantJoe
Lolwat - Vince drinking that Trump koolaid I see
Looks like trump will be selling off our National Parks in exchange for some develop-able land for his company.
And we are all very familiar with trump's mental state.
Please amplify the point: Trump vehimantly complains about US case count being higher than every other country due to testing, then uses that comparitvely high case count to incorrectly contend that US has low fatality per case!  Isn't that illogically/not consistent?

Translation: If you want a leader who's honest w/ you, cares about you, and works daily for you instead of for himself, vote Biden. If you're good with mental illness, fraud, corruption &amp; impeached as "president" vote Trump. No don't!
Watching the Trump interview stoned. One star on Yelp. Not recommended.
It’s absolutely mind-blowing to me that it’s taken this long for Trump interviewers not to stoop to his level and pander to his childishness. I guess that’s one positive takeaway from these past couple of interviews...? Maybe?
The Trump interview on Epstein maybe being murdered, and on Ghislaine Maxwell has been all over twitter. But it occurs to me that pronouncing her name jze-laine avoids putting jizz in her name, thus preventing problems with the thirteen year old boys in the audience. (and me)
Likely. What comes out of the Trump Campaign that isn't?
Not to quibble, but when Jonathan Swan tells Trump mail-in voting goes back to the Civil War, I'm thinking - the First Civil War. (Pot can make you a touch paranoid.)
Blocked!  I cleaned up my entire Following list yesterday, and only UN-F those that didn't follow me, and I lost 25 ppl!  What the heck?  I spend more time it's than anyone.  (thought that in trump's whine) I'll FB soon as allowed! #Resist #UnitedNotDivided
Trump 2020...
Trump in the interview: "I've done things no other president's done..."  Okay, I will concede that point.
Listening to the Trump interview while stoned:  Trump: The world is a very angry place...I see twenty two soldiers killed in India..." Me: How do these ants know where to go next?  I think my research is going to be inconclusive.
Whiner Trump.
Trump's interview stoned - Most of the weird stuff is already out on twitter, but now he's Trumpsplaining to Swan "Just so you understand, Russia used to be the Soviet Union, until they went bankrupt..." And my god does Trump talk fast when he's nervous.
They will keep it up nonstop to distract from the damage that Biden is doing to the country - and of course blaming everything that happens on Trump.
Watching Trump's interview stoned - Ratings? Christ, what a double colossal asshole.
Five minutes into watching Trump's interview stoned. Normally I'd be thinking - Christ, what an asshole.  Stoned it seems more like -  Christ, what a colossal asshole.
Can someone make a compilation of Jonathon Swan's face each time Trump says some bullshit?
Can Trump ever actually answer a question without getting distracted?  "what do you think of this couch?"  "I think many things. Some people say I'm the best at thinking things. Some things - the big things - they need the right thinking. And we're doing great."  "...what?"
The numbers don't lie, so Trump lies about the numbers, but he's so flummoxed trying to do it he's not even coherent.  #covid19 #coronavirus #election2020 #resist
Nice of Trump to really deliver on content for
Yep we the people r speaki!!!! TRUMP 2020!!!!
Post a photo or we just consider this another trump family lie. Have fun in prison!
Exactly. He’s totally comfortable but also knows exactly when to give the doses of sympathy Trump requires to stay in the room.
He is letting trump campaign on his behalf, and trump is actually doing a great job for a change.
I thought trump was king? Second coming of Jesus?
The best expression from a reporter interviewing Trump I’ve seen thus far!! The looks says it all 👏👏👏
I really like that interviewer. He seems to have a different level of relationship with Trump than most. Still made for a brutally embarrassing pile of shit from Trump. But good interview.
Anyone that watched either of those interviews and thought “he’s got it under control” needs to checked by a doctor. Trump looked shaken, disorientated, and was lying to get himself out of lies that he had just lied. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
ALL YOU STUPID ASS DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHY ARE YOU LETTING A BAD UGLY DISGUSTING RACIST PERSON TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS AND DEPORT INNCOCENT PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOME. POOR BABIES ARE DYING AND YOU STUPID DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE SUPPORTING HIM #AbolishICE
TRUMPS base doesn’t CARE...   is a MOUTHPIECE for TRUMP NARRATIVE—Totally Unbelievable   PATHETIC &amp; RIDICULOUS‼️😳  Every Platform can Locate USERS🤣...REALLY⁉️😂
#volunteer, if you can, to help before at early-drop boxes, polling places on #Election2020 Nov 3 &amp; especially to COUNT BALLOTS. The more people counting, the faster results will be known, lessening time for tension &amp; Trump to build in the country. #Vote #BLM #PollWorker #service
When Trump croaks, no one respectable will speak at his funeral, and I bet Congress refuses to let him lie in state at the Capitol.
If I were a Trump supporter I would be so pissed.
And the alternative given the state of our country and the current isn’t changing right now then what do you suggest.  Yes we know Biden not good, but trump i would literally rather have my dogs shit as prez than trump.  So vote Biden and let’s fix our shit after we remove psycho
Just so you know, every Trump/GOP ad you see online costs them money per click...
You’re a liar. Can’t believe anything a trump says.
Im not saying that Trump is guilty of anything but if we’re using this logic then Trump is screwed my association 🤷‍♂️
You do know that Epstein’s sex trafficking was not limited to his island, right? You do know that Trump stated In a 2002 statement in New York Magazine, Trump said “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy . . .”
That’s it, I’m saying it now. I will not vote for Biden if he doesn’t debate Trump. I won’t help elect someone who can’t hold their ground against Trump. If Biden can’t now, how can he face China and Russia as tensions escalate?
They want to believe the world is as simple as Trump's mind and that they can understand it.
Don't understand why everyone is getting so worked up over a big hoax. The #FakeNews will stop reporting about this when #Trump is reelected and it will all go away
DISTURBED? NO! Not until I clicked on the picture to see what was so disturbing!, now YES! VERY! WTF? I keep saying that it's not hard to point out Trump supporters, I rest my case.
Or call it Fraud. Or let's imagine Trump in handcuffs, January 2021.
Oh look, a bunch of fraud investigations for the Trump companies!   "We had no clue!"*  *nobody
I think you have it backwards, since he gave this speech during the Trump presidency &amp; referenced the difficult times &amp; quoted a poem about finding truth.  Additionally, the presidential character he played in the West Wing was a Democrat as is Sheen himself, a liberal activist.
Eric, you lost me at claiming you have a friend. For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
Eric, you lost me at claiming you have a friend. For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
Zero to my knowledge. Also, voter fraud in America is statistically insignificant &amp; the same is true in states w/ widespread voting by mail. The last very public example of voter fraud was from Rep. Steve Watkins of KS, a Trump supporter &amp; he was caught:
Eric, you lost me at "from a friend". For a Trump, you can't lie worth shit.
All my friends who voted for Trump last time are voting for Biden this time! Vote
(donates it to a Trump shell charity)
Stone publicly the Trump administration and exile them to another country.  I never liked Turkey.
I'm sorry. Trump is to blame for the crisis and deaths. More, many many more to follow.  I'm so sorry.
It’s been an attack on consciousness, an attack on the heart of the universe, on humanity  We think life is ‘normal’ and that’s part of the deep conditioning  Ye knows this because he got to the top and looked around only to find soullessness  Probably the same deal with trump
What Trump Doesn’t Understand About the Suburbs  20 years as a professional Realtor ®, this goes against our Ethics, and, there is a beautiful diversity in the very best communities. #LetMeBeYourAgent #HomeSmartMatchmaker #WearADamnMask
Dear NYT: or we could restructure the debates to force DIALECTIC--the very thing D. Trump is yearning for: a reasoned, drawn out discussion of facts and ideology. :-)
Twitter has become my release valve, had to deactivate Facebook, someone I work with occasionally told my BF he needs, 'to reign her in, she can't make everyone hate trump'. Dagnabbit, I was TRYING!  My Twitter friends are just smarter.    Together, #UnitedNotDivided
TRUMP...King 👑 of MEMES‼️💁🏼‍♀️  Is that a GOOD THING⁉️💁🏼‍♀️
Wow! An American "president" that apparently wants to work for Nielsen instead of America! Good news Trump in exactly 170 days you'll be able to. Well, until you're indicted of course!
We are in CO and my husband will not let me wear my Trump hat for this reason.   I know all this state are not libs but you have to be careful.  God bless this man.
It's amazing how easily you can point out Trump supporters! It's almost like they wear a sign on their foreheads. "MAGA-MORON"
There is no swaying the Trump base.
TRUMP - A FAKE PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.    You are sad.
WOW!! TRUMP IS A FAKE PRESIDENT AND ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. FAILED GAME SHOW HOST, ADULTERER, AND DIM-WITTED!!!  Pandemic killing more people in the U.S. thanks to Trump’s no-handling!Sad...
Trump has the better constitutional argument in excluding illegal aliens from the #Census. If illegal aliens are ex­cluded CA, AZ, TX &amp; FL will likely loose seats in Congress. While IN, MI, PA &amp; OH will likely gain seats ~
Nobody likes voting by mail anyway. I would rather spend hours in a voting line with a bunch of virus filled strangers. Go trump.
Remember the middle class tax cut trump announced on election eve, 2018? His healthcare plan will be promised election eve, 2020. Except nobody will buy it.
Always comparing himself to President Obama, because Obama was a great president, Trump, loser.
Nobody is working overtime to make trump look bad.
Trump will kill everyone.  President Biden will remove the 1% tax cut donald gave out.
Right... Democrats manufacture chaos for 4 years and blame Trump. We can't have this for 4 more years! Everyone sees it. Even the few normal liberals.
And the trump healthcare plan is............................................................................................??
The New York Times: Trump Forecasts His Own Fraud.
🤮 Being a Coloradoan was the only thing I had left, that Trump hadn't shit all over. #coloradodoesntlikeyou #TrumpIsALaughingStock
They are scared to death of the thought of Biden toe to toe with Trump. Terrified
The Trump Virus gang
Said the one deceived by Fuhrer Trump. You are a piece of work, Little Marco.
Your a vast disappointment to Colorado voters. Your silence about the Russian bounties on our service members in Afghanistan is as disgraceful as trump’s support of it.
who is a trump supporter so u know my identity is politically incongruent with her. Oh and either way, she is wanting to put up our cat Nemo for adoption, which genuinely breaks my heart. So I’m having to become An Adult very quickly which is horrifying!!!
Well I may not go that far but I will crawl on broken glass to pull that leaver for President Donald Trump who is the best President in my lifetime.  God bless.
Lol We are literally in an unprecedented time with regards to the pandemic, and Howard will always speak his mind...  and yes Trump has done a piss poor job and people are dying.  Whats more relevant than that?
Started watching Hamilton last night. Man, they did all that singing and dancing and two hundred forty  years later we still got Trump.
Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.
Administration is leading the way in empowering women and girls. ~The Hill  Yeah, heard all about Trump and the girls.  More than enough actually.
If Trump or his super PACs have to buy advertising in Texas, it's a win for Biden.
Want to bet trump's name is also on there, or was removed? 26+ sexual assault allegations against trump, one against Biden. trump wins again!!! He is such a fine adulterer.
Getting rid of trump will be a return to normalcy, except for the fact the republican party will be completely displaced.
But trump wants to be a dictator! You could have your supreme leader in charge all the time! Wouldn't it be lovely?
trump has invested a wall into the Latino communities. They love him.
Yes, Latinos are voting for trump, because, you know. Wall.
SHE SHOULD MOVE TO CUBA IF SHE LIKE'S IT SO MUCH WHY ARE WE TRAINING EDUCATING COMMUNIST. TRUMP SHOULD SHUT THIS DOWN.
It is sad that Trump has to incite violence in America
Yep, blame trump for all things the left has caused.
Neither you nor your supporters have any class. Also, this is a direct example of how the way that you carry yourself transfers down through to your supporters. Trump, his administration, and his supporters are an absolute threat to our society.
Trump went golfing again today...we're up to 8,600 dead Americans per hole.   Hope he had a nice round.
So this is when Trump and his administration want to start worrying about the coronavirus… I’m confused though how are we sending children back into school if they can’t even hold a convention without fears of Covid?

I am agnostic and even I find it disgusting. My parents are very devout Christians and they HATE they way Trump uses Jesus as an excuse.
IF BIDEN MAKES YOU THE VP TRUMP WILL DEFINITLEY WIN.
DEM'S WANT TO CHEAT THERE WAY INTO THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE DONNA BRAZIL CHEATED FOR HILLARY TO THE DEM NOMINATION IN 2016. IF YOU CAN'T WIN CHEAT YOUR WAY IN THA'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BEAT TRUMP!
Birx on Trump live camera quote:  "He's been so attentive to the scientific literature . . . ".  Come on,  David.  And she sat there silent during the bleach quote.  There is more.
So true
It seems that Trump is really bad at making deals.
Endorsed by Trump and Qanon? Maybe get Alex Jones and make it a trifecta.
Endorsed by Trump and Qanon? Maybe get Alex Jones and make it a trifecta.
Opposite of what  said. The chaos IS the DNC campaign strategy. It will end after Pres Trump’s re-election. If Biden wins by fraud, the newly emboldened communist wannabes will not stop until democrats are taken out too. You see, anyone can throw out a statement.
I'm convinced that "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; LAW &amp; ORDER" are secret codes for Putin. Trump tweets them &amp; it covertly signals Putin to turn on a sat phone, or to call Trump, something. He tweets these at the most random times &amp; almost always alone. Its suspicious.
Sean Hannity is NOT A JOURNALIST! He is nothing but an OPINION commentator who's been given a right-wing cheerleader in Trump. He's been given a soapbox by Trump, &amp; people think he's reporting news rather than expressing his opinion &amp; ONLY his opinion! Inform yourselves!
Republicans are just now figuring out that maybe trump isn't so great for the Party as they all originally thought.
Who put you in masks?  Who shut down your state?  Who has opened states?  Republicans!  Who still has their people in masks and in lockdown?  Democrats!  So much corruption in the Democrat party and they want President Trump out because he is exposing them.
When the revenue dries up from the Secret Service, I bet trump goes bankrupt. Again.
The republican party too much of an embarrassment for Buck? trump has permanently doomed the republican party.
Dr. uncle trump is much smarter than Dr. Fauci.
Of course they will! They accepted aid from Ukraine! Azzhole trump was impeached forever because of this.
Look at those people blaming trump for all of this disaster. It was someone else.
trump stands for adultery, crime, lying 20,000 times in 3.5 years, death, misery, complete destroyed the economy like his other 6 businesses, moron, have to pay people to take his SAT's, racist, white power supporter.
Not buying it. Trump knows the only way for him to stay out of prison is to win re-election -- however unlikely that looks now.
What? You wrote a book? Crazy! I honestly thought that none of you guys could read! I was assuming that you couldn't possibly defend/support Trump if you could read about the things he does &amp; says, or be able to read his tweets. Well, Im sure its shit anyways. (in my opinion)
Have you asked yourself what it is about Trump that creates so much ire and hostility? Has any President every voiced such disdain and hatred towards any group of Americans? I’m sorry supporting a racist, ill mannered, negligent and dishonest person is a burden on you.
Is it possible Trump's administration will end with DT giving a full and complete pardon to HIMSELF?
THAT'S SUCH A COINCIDENCE! Trump no longer has a base either. He used to, while folks decided whether or not he was a trustworthy leader, but they now know what an incompetent sociopath he is! President Biden will actually start get rid of the corruption Trump was!
Thank God Fox News has no integrity, or journalistic professionalism otherwise they wouldn't purposely misinform America! If you see this &amp; actually want factual data, Google ANY poll you want besides Foxs'. Then you'll get the info you need, NOT what Trump wants you to have.
Don't believe Fox News &amp; right wing media telling you  has any chance in Nov. You can tell he knows it as well by saying mail-in ballots fraudulent &amp; saying the election should be postponed. Trying to scare us into voting Trump. NOT GOING TO WORK!
Okay, okay I see what your doing! This IS a blame my opponent for what I do. B/C no one has any fear of  having nuclear codes, but the fear of a desperate man w/ mental illness &amp; is addicted to the power he currently has, Trump is a clear &amp; present danger to America!
You think Trump is going to debate bro? He is trying to make the election not even happen!
Are you kidding?!?! Obama wore a tan suit once and Trump committed treason and continues to defraud America with his 3 day golf trips every 4 days. Nevermind all trump’s racist policies or destructive relationship management with our NATO partners.Why does Trump think people care about him watching sports or not lol   Like a lot of people wouldn’t cared if you died fr so
Golfing and lying. What else is new with trump?
Who is trump kidding? He is suing against ACA which protects people with preexisting medical conditions in our courts right now. WTF?
If you’re wondering, it’s probably conceivable. For me it doesn’t come instantaneously, but for example: the night trump was elected, I said to my wife “I hope the Russians didn’t have anything to do with this.”
Trump be like “I’m gonna repeal Obamacare but ensure they do all the same things and call it Trumpcare”
"Twenty-three postal executives were reassigned or displaced...Analysts say the structure centralizes power around DeJoy, a former logistics executive and major ally of President Trump, and de-emphasizes decades of institutional postal knowledge."
Because Kanye is being used by trump to try to sway the election towards him. We’ll never get out of this mess we’re in if trump gets re-elected.
Delusional! Biden is working on plans to bring us out of this depression we’re in. Trump is whining like a little bitch because no one likes him. What’s there to debate?
And fucking trump can? You obviously haven’t been watching trump speak!
I’ve had two people tell me that Beyoncé stans are like Trump supporters and that is so WILDLY disrespectful
The Dems will exploit the Chinese Virus for political purposes until November 3 when President Trump wins the election. Afterward, they’ll move on to the next fantasy designed to remove a President who can’t be bought, which is what the Dems, RINOs and Deep State hate about him.
Wow wtf is this guy? He is starting to show symptoms. Of Trump syndrome. Where is the vaccine for this?
You are WRONG.  People who pay cash (i.e. no other coverage) pay the most. The ACA established protection for pre-existing conditions. Trump and his congressional followers have tried repeatedly to repeal these protections. McCain put country over party.
Big Joe!  No, you actually don’t.  I love you to death man but don’t fall victim to the Trump Tweeting.  Please just let the man sink himself.
Bullshit. You republicans just can’t quit with the lying. Following trump’s example.
Wishful thinking Dave, Trump supporters are more jazzed up than ever to vote and support this President, save the physco-babble for the classroom. 😊
The great divider is the orange clown sitting in the White House right now. What caused division while Obama was in office is white people who couldn’t accept &amp; resented the fact that a black man was elected president. One of those people was the birther trump. No surprise there.
Trump loves the illiterate.
He can’t breathe in a mask bc he’s exhausted from kissing Trump’s butt
Let’s let the MAGA crowd know they have to vote for Kanye and Trump this year...President and Vice President....

"It's a Peaceful Protest" - President Trump Gives Perfect Answer to Reporter Asking Why His Guests Aren't Social Distancing (VIDEO) 😂
Trump 2020!   Sleepy Joe, you don’t have a chance! Give up now .
A reporter just asked President Trump why many people in the room at his press conference in Bedminstsr, NJ aren’t wearing masks.  “It’s a peaceful protest,” Trump says in jest, to cheers from the crowd.😅
So kind of you to refer to a fellow citizen as a moran. But I'm guessing you believe Trump has caused so much division. See the irony?
How old is this Denish guy....I would guess same mental age as Trump....toddler stage.  All the silly immature comments...just embarrassing for them.
Maybe.  We already know that Trump cannot pronounce Yosemite and Thailand correctly.  He set the geography/reading bar pretty low.

The only threat we have to the American ppl is Trump's America and the republicans view for America. This is all happening under the republicans watch. Not Democrats. Dems have no choice but to fight back to keep civil peace and democracy right.
Hey Mr Biden. We can’t let trump do ANYTHING else. I’ve contributed to your campaign tonight so you can overturn all the horrendous, inane policies like this one and so many others. It’s imperative you persevere! #BlueWave2020
Wait til you hear how President Trump treated his holy union with all three of his wives. It's a doozy.

Yes I would do to a rally GO TRUMP would you go to Bidens basement 😂
If you’re serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don’t think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.
i will say it here and now and ive made this prediction before in the last several months..our President  Donald J Trump will be assassinated in the next few  months..sad to say but i have no doubt there is so much hatred for his PRO AMERICAN policies..GOD  save and protect him🙏

You're a racist Joe's social media manager. Thanks for coming out for racist Joe to try and defend him. I heard that if you vote for Trump over Biden you aren't black?🤔. Wanna clarify that?
If you're tired of trump racially calling coV-19 the "Chinese virus'" you should report his tweets in hopes they delete his account.
President Trump, our non profit organization is based in Beirut and is well-connected across the Arab world. We can help make sure the donations from the United States are well managed and reach their destination.

Banning TikTok is just a political ploy by Trump Administration. Once you start unraveling the clusterfuck of digital ad business, you realize it does not matter who owns these digital platforms.
The boneheads at the motorcycle gathering in Sturges will be getting the virus and bring it back to all the places they came from. We thought trump is stupid. These morons just do not care. Way to go Harley Davidson and company.
Man. Dinesh really picks weird hills to die on. I'd bet 99.9% of the time, Trump pronounced it "Tie-land" like everyone else. That might be why he immediately corrected himself. Now what? Dinesh is gonna tell us that the 99.9% of the time is the time Trump is a dumbshit?
definitely Trump all the way!!!  100%
So when Trump smashes a cheeseburger on his head and pours Diet Coke on his lap, do the rest of his WH enablers at the table smoosh their scalps with fettucine and douse their crotches with Chianti to show that there is nothing wrong with Cheeto-Face's behavior?
This administration is pretty damn transparent with their vindictive retribution.....you think we buy this?  China wants Trump to lose the election.
Oddly the Chinese want Trump to lose, and Russian is doing their damnest to see that Trump wins....so, your post his is VERY suspicious!
I blame President Trump for failing us and not having a federal strategic plan on how to deal with this ongoing pandemic, Debbie.
Well, teachers are indirectly responsible for the situation we are in. 60 million people voted for Trump. Obviously, teachers failed with them, not teaching criticak thinking skills or civic education. Teachers need to take responsibilty for this.
I used to respect you and your perspectives. Now all I do is shake my head and wonder when you started to drink the trump koolaid.  Shame on you.
So obvious... Trump, fatigue. Biden, dementia.
I’m afraid Schumer and the Dems are going to perpetuate the lie when schools open up and post a bunch of fake numbers about how many kids are infected and then turn it right back around on Trump. I put nothing past these slime balls
It’ll probably take Joe a while to get the Trump economy back on track too.
Trump never called a black interviewer a crack head like Biden did.
Trump raises Babbling Idiot to a new standard

The Portland Mayor is powerless in the face of Antifa and BLM terrorists, especially after he defunded the police and refused to call in the National Guard to restore law and order. Welcome to Biden’s version of America should he ever win the Presidency. Vote Trump &amp; Republican.
So much for reliability of the China Virus test on which the Dems are basing their vendetta against schools that are opening and businesses that refuse to close for a second time. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Stop the madness created by the Marxist Democrats.

You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.

Antifa commits assault and battery and gets away with it in Portland. No law and order exists. This what the Marxist Democrats will bring to all American cities, if they’re elected to the Presidency and to Congress. Clear the decks. Vote Trump and Republican in November.

How is Trump our only hope?  He’s hurt this country in so many ways.  Deregulation of food manufacturing standards led to the largest amount of food recalls we’ve seen.  China tariffs left American farmers hurting more than they have since the Great Depression.
This clan has the time and the money to monitor him every day. I’m disappointed that they aren’t doing more given the political damage this guy is leaving in his wake, unless they see themselves as the the next trump family. Then it all makes sense.
Biden for President ads are truly despicable. That crying lady blaming her grandma’s death on President! President Trump initiated the travel ban within 10 days of the first case while every other leader shamed him.
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He’s a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.

And the Obama’s accumulated this wealth by feeding at the public trough for decades. Unbelievable level of hypocrisy by a President who orchestrated an attempted coup d’etat. Vote Trump and Republican in November.

“The legacy of Never Trump so far is stopping progress, rather than saving democracy.” 😠😤😡🤬🤯
Trump hammers China over virus as U.S. health secretary heads to Taiwan  hammer all you want trump. Bottom line you failed to act and still are not doing enough to eradicate the virus. This one is on you, you pathetic excuse for human.
The right move at the right time once again by President Trump. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists that the Democrats have become.
Iran Envoy Brian Hook, a ‘Survivor’ on Trump’s Team, to Quit  How many firings and resignations does that make? 100? 200? I lost count. Jumping ship is the answer with this bogus Administration. Jump ship to safe your dignity and life.

Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  Again, trump is making false statements. The man is just disgusting and can not be believed about anything. How does he live with himself? lonely for sure.
Dear God in Heaven, please protect our leader, your servant, Donald J Trump. Thank you for blessing us with him.
Trump is pulling at straws to kick start his failed attempt at getting some approval. Not happening. The man is a lost cause and is in panic mode.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  trump wishes Biden said something bad. Trump is so desperate he is now making up stories that disparage Biden. Good luck with that idea. Trump is so bad at his statements.
I know, right? Now that the NRA has been shut down, you know gun sales are going to skyrocket. The trump supporting, assault rifle touting cultists’ &amp; racists’ new plan has just begun. Diesel trucks and confederate flags will be flying off the shelves
A creative demonstration of the hypocrisy of the Democrat’s attempt to control group worship using the China Virus scam as a weapon against Christians. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic that guarantees freedom of religion and worship.
Chris Wallace’s analyses about President Trump are so colored by his anti-Trump attitudes that the credibility of his assessments are zero and below. Send Wallace to CNN. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the Marxist Democrats.
When the Republicans return -if ever-To the original values then maybe. But it will be a long time before I vote republican again. These senate and governor republicans are just kissing up to Trump. Won’t one for any of them
"The R party has completely cowtowed to Trump and has no cajones to stand up like men and women and do anything which might make him mad. Therefore we will get nothing done." Fixed it.
Well, put an idiot in charge and you’ll get pure idiocy. Trump never disappoints on that front.
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
You mean the ones from Trump that say Catholics don’t believe in God?
Ridiculous. TRUST the man. Trump is destroying our democracy. Thanks heavens thinking like yours is limited to media wanting a attention.
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
Trump to afraid to release his taxes?.
What view do they see the success...up through Trump's colon?
Should Joe Biden fail to debate President Trump at least three times, it amounts to an admission that he is unable to carry out the duties of President.

Perhaps you should stand in solidarity with your American friends against Trump’s rampant racism? That could actually be helpful.
Trump has gotten 160,000+ of us killed.
We’re going off of Kim Kardashians diagnosis/synopsis of Kanye’s mental problems. None of us know what’s wrong with him. He could be just another trump cult follower. They all act like him.
Uhmm, are you accusing Obama or Biden or the NBA of murder? You do realize this has happened under a Trump presidency?
One issue voters are only interested in removing trump. All of the pontificating in the world will not make any VP running mate more impactful on the presidential race than the last.
Trump is getting desperate with his off the wall statements. The man is in melt down. More than when he heard of covid-19.
Television news organizations fearful of excoriating trump for his relentless machinations and lies, have a tendency to overcompensate by playing news clips of trump repetitively, hoping to salvage ratings. All it does is piss off people who find him abhorrent, and there are many
The only ones  that stupid to believe this is Trump's fault are Democrats
Everyone knows we get to pretend that Republicans and Trump don't exist.
He is letting Trump use him. Why?

Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump
News flash:  it’s Trump
Hopefully more than Trump haha
It seems we were lucky to have past presidents who had the integrity not to abuse the office this way but Trump, who has no integrity, uses the office for personal political gain. We need a replacement of Hatch Act w/POTUS and VP not be exempt.
FB won’t let us post ANY new ads for up to 90 days.   This is they one that Trump retweeted and is the one FB is using to justify their ban.
Biden does not need Kentucky, Trump does.
So you are done with Democrat lies so you support Trump 🤔 and the GOP.  Sounds like you stand for whatever will get you GOP funds and RDT retweets
A gaffe is an unintentional remark ... so you are suggesting Trump unintentionally said this even though his base is made up of devout Christians?
Not for Trump actually. lol
Is there anything more deranged than going on Twitter several times per day complaining about Trump?
How long before a photo op of Trump praying?
Wont matter if OSHA doesn't actually do anything about infractions. Trump has hollowed OSHA out like every other agency
I could write a letter to the editor too and tell them all the things you’ve done in the last 3 1/2 years that were working against what your constituents want. Too little too late. And being with Trump “100%” is not bipartisan!
It’s known as the Trump Virus in the USA!  Trump left the door open for the virus to come into the USA and spread at will!
How is the NRA going to donate Russian money to Trump now?
nah i’d rather be a fan of trump than you because at least i can’t comprehend what he’s saying
You tell me how Trump killed anyone. What do you want us shut down forever? Some of us have to work.
I think that you and I are old enough to remember when Rivera was the rebellious voice of the young... his work with exposing Willowbrook was extraordinary! I don't know when he switched to be the leading apologist for pigs like Trump.
Per some new data points from Infinera, it looks like Trump is beating Huawei --
A message I got from trump today. This is what he emails everyone everyday
I think CJ was referring to trump’s campaign.
He’ll be taking votes away from Trump. If you’re stupid enough to vote for Kanye, then you’d probably be voting for Trump anyway.
Spare us with the prelude to the 25th Amendment. All this Trump is confused talk! Complete Bullshit.
Easy! America does not want Trump at all! We hear Trump speak everyday! He’s proven he has nothing to add!  #ItIsWhatItIsDumpTrump
"Slowing" and "decreasing" are two completely different concepts.   This is pretty basic.  Your argument is lot like trump bragging about the unemployment numbers going down the past month after rising to historic levels due to his inept handling of this crisis.
Jesus...if Trump did nothing during this pandemic it would be better then what he has done.  He has let us down.  160,000 dead.
CNN has not reported news for years.  Nothing but a bunch of angry, far-left, Trump hating commentators.
Yeah, the one who killed Epstein for Trump.
Couldn't agree more. Does anyone really care if Trump is watching or not? I know I don't.  Lol.
tRump loves Morning Joe
Yes climate change and Covid 19 relief. Perfect harmony.... you all don’t make sense. Hillary’s  money is back you so I am sure Biden will pick you. But you all have not earned the vote. Trump is just losing them
artwork owned and displayed by Bill &amp; Hill's right hand man John Podesta Do YOUR friends have pictures like this up in their homes? Pizzagate &amp; Adrenochrome trafficking is real.Trump is stopping it You wouldn't even KNOW about it if he didnt get into office Its global😴😴
We all knew this was coming! An article in WaPo a couple of days ago went into great depth regarding the terrible danger of a deceptive Trump operation like this. I believe it was
He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.
How would you know...you are so OUT OF TOUCH with reality and hiding behind Trump corrupt rear end that you don't see the sunlight for the colon!
trump is that desperate he needs another person on the ballot to take votes away from Biden, and even that will not help him get destroyed on Nov 3rd, 89 days from today!
that is so NOT true, the members of his party are ONLY pretending to pull the chain to make themselves look good for votes, because they know the war will soon be over for them. They do not care about what trump does, and proven it time and again. They are desperate.
Many many instances where money does not buy the election. Trump's messages are blatant lies and not worthy of a fake reality personality.
another lie that is using to gain votes and give americans false hope - well I mean trump supporters, they are NOT Americans, they are trumpains, and  allows it
Nope! What scares me is the mental stability of tRump!  What scares me is his total lack of empathy, his non-handling  of COVID19, tRump wanting to postpone the election, his blatant racism and white supremacist views, his love for Putin, to name a few! Learn to critically think!
How many times has Trump violated the Emoluments clause by booking government officials in his hotels.  I was under the impression an acting president was supposed to cut ties with their private sector businesses before entering office.
Why do people need to be excited to get Trump all the way out the paint?  Geezuz!
A must read article about yesterday’s Yates  hearing. illustrates the absurdity and danger of this Trump, Barr and GOP disinformation-distraction operation, at a time when our country is in free fall. This is actually a Putin disinformation op and they’re all  on board!
Yeah, why can't he be more humble, like Trump.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder why they rejected it? Could it be Biden isn’t capable of a debate with a two year old. Even when he was coherent no way could he debate Trump. This will be priceless!
I’ll be voting for Trump in Colorado!
A Must read article for all Americans seeking the truth and not caught up in the Trump, GOP, Barr conspiracy theories about Russia‘s 2016  subversion of our democracy and presidential election. Their twisted conspiracy theory is a Putin disinformation operation. Let that sink in.
Omfg What the hell is going on with people these days? The amount of hate that Trump has brought out is unbelievable, over a mask? It's ridiculous
I think there’s a lot of back channel money flowing into the trump org as well. not To mention PPP. He’s flush.

Bye bye then. You were great and I'll miss you but I haven't heard that from the Holy Spirit and until I do I'm sticking with Trump because there's no question he's God's man. If you no longer believe that, you've been deceived by a devil, Pal.
Joe Biden will not show up in person to stand 6+ feet away from Trump and debate him for 90 minutes. He’s not capable of pulling it off, and everyone knows it. Excuses will be made, he’ll blame Trump, the media will comply, etc., but he won’t do it.
Our Country is in Shambles because of Donald Trump!
Officials in the Trump administration have been rightly referring to the government in China as "The Chinese Communist Party" or CCP, not just as "Chinese government." This is apt. A communist is always a communist, and that must never be forgotten.
All she has done as AG is investigate Trump, meanwhile NY has become a crime ridden third world country.
Facebook has NO scientific expertise to dispute any thing President Trump says. There is absolutely no settled science on the coronavirus virus. It may be years before we have scientific data that the scientists agree upon.
The died in the wool Republican governors need to wake up and realize trump is not there for you. Stop being stupid and smell the roses. The man will turn on you what ever you do. Get smart.
Nothing in Trump's actions or speaches says competence or ability. The man is so out of his league or ability. If America needs to vent, do so on this fricking moron.
Alas, you're a faux president, so it all works out. Though I would sooner trust Jim Acosta on reporting the news than Donald Trump on leading this Nation.
A "friend" of mine feels that he is "protecting his children" by sending them to school. He believes that the media is creating fear that it's going to cost more lives than the virus, that masks don't work and of course he is a Trump supporter. Choices have consequences
Biden wants to re engage with Iran. This is against Trump policy. His surrogate, John Kerry has been meeting them privately. They are our sworn enemy. If Biden wins and one of his transition team reaches out to Iran informing of a new policy direction should this be Logan Act ?
These are the people where you don't feel sad when they get sick and suffer and die alone. In a way you hope they do. Choices have consequences. You just can't fix stupid, I mean Trump supporters
I don’t see color. I’m telling anyone that will listen that if you want to vote for trump then vote for kayne because it’s the same thing. If you want to vote for democrats then vote for Biden. Really really really extremely simple. #biden2020 #kayneismentallyill #trumpvirus

Michele Obama is biggest hypocrite in the history First Ladies, as she broadcasts her anti-Trump rhetoric from her seaside mansion on Cape Cod. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Impeach Obama for his role in the attempts at a coup d’etat to unseat President Trump before Nov.
Letivia James announced in a viral video a few years that she was going to go after Trump.   Here’s the deal. You people are so fundamentally dishonest.  Just a few hours ago your squad was on MSNBC lamenting the Durham Investigation as election year politicization.
I wish Facebook would have gone one step farther and removed Trump
GOP is using kayne like a puppet to steal black voters from Biden. Keep your eyes open. If you want trump again then vote for kayne as kayne cannot win.
Kayne west is doing what Ralph Nader did which is split the vote and steal votes from democrats. Kayne is there simply to steal the black vote from Biden to help out trump. If you are a trump supporter then vote for kayne or trump. If you support democrats then Biden
Is this sham of a hearing that R’s are directing trying to prove Obama spied on Trump? I’m sure most of you know the answer to this question, but I literally cannot keep up with this shit show.
Watch "The Five Wildest Moments From Donald Trump's Interview with Axios" on YouTube
Sounds more to me like the response to President Obama’s speech from trump is an “angry” one.
Isn’t it Letitia James who announced that she was going to take Trump down a few years ago in a video that went viral?   Why is it that you only see political prosecutors one way?
Probably expressing latency in her own sexuality. She’s a perfect match for trump. Melania better watch her back
Guessing you trust the Chinese more than Trump. Crystal clear.
is a nack ass fake ass nigga...to even think he would ever have a chance to be president is idiodic and all he is doing is stealing the black votes from biden so trump can win again. dont fall for it
I hope, on Nov. 3rd, we flush your Orange turd ass down the fucking drain!  You pompous ass!  🖕🤬 fuck you, Donald J. Trump!
Americans threating health officials are just ignorant and are not responsible and just complaining up the wrong tree. Need to be going to the root of the problem, Trump. Not doing anything to remedy the situation.
I hate to say this, but the more the Republicans screw these things up, the more I hope it hurts all those Trump supporters and people who vote for them like McConnell. And those who continue to vote for them you deserve what you get, and I hope it sucks bad

Both sides said the future of the talks is uncertain. President Donald Trump is considering executive orders to address evictions and unemployment insurance, but they appear unlikely to have much impact.

You're a consummate politician, intelligent, person so we have to ask. Do you really give a damn about our country? Are you so arrogant that you think you're above patriotism? If Trump is re-elected he may keep us from ever recovering. The GOP is self-destructing

You, Biden, said racism is "baked into" Trump's campaign.... And class warfare is baked into yours and that's inextricably linked to the very same racism. It's why we hate you too, Biden, sir.
Do you have any video of that?  What he said about blacks and Hispanics was not near as  racist as what Trump says.

How can you ignore Trump who's obviously deteriorating physically/mentally and a huge danger to the country. We have zero leadership at a time when we need it the most. A MajLdr historically has more power than a president but you've traded that for personal gain.
All you can talk about is the Outdoors Act, Yes, it's nice, but without health/economy what difference does it make. 59 co-sponsors, so you're not the only one. At the same time you ignore Trump who's obviously deteriorating physically/mentally and a huge danger to the country.

Oh I get it just fine. Been debating with Republicans all my life. But Trump. He's soiled the party beyond recognition. All they have left is greed and lust for power. It's sad really. But we def don't have to agree. ✌🏽
GTFOH. There are plenty of center media sources, but Trump's war on the press has pushed things even farther apart. I use media bias sites as well as respected sources from the military, business, healthcare &amp; world news. I'm not grabbing confirmation bias opinion pieces.
President Donald Trump loves the USA!!!
More. And this one is in December before the pandemic hit big.
More.
The majority DOESN'T like him.
🤣🤣🤣 Not to mention, all Trump does is take credit for shit. Even when it wasn't his to take. His malignant narcissism won't let him NOT brag.
When will you debate President of the United States Donald Trump? #potas45
And Trump calling hit a attack makes him look to be more of a fool
I have another theory. DeVos wants her agenda realised.  She wants schools privitized and she has a way of profiting from it.  Trump pushes it because she has something on him.
gave an interview that deserves a Pulitzer and Gave other reporters a blueprint on how to interview Trump because everyone has been doing it wrong
Trump needs to be kicked out of office &amp; forced to live in China.. And fning country but ours!!!
This makes it even more important to re-elect President Trump
Never been possible huh without trump my ass.
The US is blocking China's ability to nominate a judge for the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea. It's the right after China's actions in the South China Sea, but Trump's lack of prior involvement could cripple his ability to hold fast on this.

Because it’s true. Trump is a white supremacist
With the sacking of the Chairman of the TVA and his sights aimed now at its CEO, Trump is out for some more headlines to show he is tough on hiring of illegal immigrants.
If he picks Elizabeth Warren initially many black voters will be upset. Then they’ll realize they forfeited their influence on who Biden should pick for his VP, by promising to vote for Biden regardless of who he picks because of their fear of Trump.

Remember when you wanted to meet the Pope and Trump took you to meet h---  Oh fuck, that's right he didn't...  Let us all know when you grow a spine.
Anyone involved with trump is corrupt and pathetic.
But it’s backfiring on them!! They are showing their true colors. They are being exposed!! They aren’t fooling us. Vote Trump!!
The best part is, they are exposing the truth for all to see!!! It’s pushing more people every day to vote Trump!!
Tammie considering who U R defending I admire your courage to type that out where people can see it in black &amp; white. It's not my self respect U should be worried about. You call Trump a liar but all of you are lying to each other if you believe Trump's the biggest liar of all.
Joe Lockhart they might be able to see &amp; hear what you call Trump's lies but they can also see &amp; hear Joe Biden is in the advanced stages of dementia. I think you are much more afraid of that than you are of any Trump lie.
We are three months away from Election Day! We have to keep fighting to re-elect President Trump! The future of the country is at stake and we can’t let up
Fuck if trump thinks we’re going to commit voter fraud with the mail-in ballots, might as well do it, right?  I call Benjamin Dover and Seymore Asses

I have not read this yet, but I’ve been thinking about very question! Joe was such an icon for all those years, but the Trump was elected, no Republicans I spoke with cared at all Arpaio was gone. They seemed ready to move on

Trump may not get to postpone his elections using the pandemic as an excuse to beat the opposition party, but Hong Kong apparently heard his idea and liked it.
Enough about the Outdoors Act. It's no good if we're homeless, starving or dead. Peter Navarro's on TV lying for the president. Stand up to him and Trump and pass the damn Cares Act bill and we'll be impressed! Protect the USPS so it can do it's work. Stop dodging

"Among Black voters, 51% said they approve of Trump – topping the president’s 47% approval among Whites. Sixty percent (60%) of voters of all other races said they approve of Trump’s job performance."
So Trump had the best un-employment rate in the last 100 years. Along comes the pandemic. Democratic Governors shut diwn the economy, force unemployment. They are still squawking about its to soon to open up. Then they blame Trump, sheeples like you Lao that crap up. Smh

This is why the Right R blithering idiots if they let the Left (&amp; a lying POS like Pelosi) have the Cannabis "issue". The Left loves 2 tax &amp; regulate Cannabis. The Right could/should totally trump the Left by calling for the TOTAL deregulation of Cannabis.
Here’s the actual problem. If you hate trump, fine, so do most of us, but you don’t just hate Trump, you all hate me. Most of us are great people who treat people right, but everywhere we turn we are being called morally inferior by people who don’t even know us.
Debating trump is a waste of time and effort. Debating a rock will get you better actual debate.
Screw Wolfe!!  How dare he think differently than us!!!!  It’s this type of shit why people support Trump. I hate the douche, but I’ll vote for him again because there is nothing worse than a group of people constantly letting everybody know they are morally superior.
This is unbelievable!! Talk about a double standard!! I thought the police union supported Trump!!  I feel bad for the cops. I bet there caught between their superiors telling them what to do, knowing it’s not right.
I couldn’t watch the whole video. They are calling Trump a liar, while they are lying about everything!!
WTF!!! The UN cab suck it.  This is our country, they can get the he’ll out of it.  In fact why are they still here?  If Trump can ban Tik Tok, then tell them to move their crap out of our country!
You mean by paying people more than they were making while working in a country already 24,000,000,000,000 in debt to buy votes. Spending 4 years trying to ruin Trump and not caring how it affects your country. Not putting your country first. What do you know of character.

No he needs to go to another Country &amp; leave us the Hell alone! F Trump!!!
Already crashed, already disappeared, can't get worse unless Trump gets another term. Vote Biden.
So trump looks better for doing nothing over the public unifying during a pandemic to protest systematic racism... I wonder who this fucker is voting for?
I have an honest question for you Mason. David Duke supports Trump publicly. Do you think he does that on purpose to scare black people from voting for Trump? Do you think he knows planned parenthood is killing mostly black people so he is helping to drive them into their arms.
"New Disclosures Confirm: Trump Himself Was the Target of Obama Administration’s Russia Probe "
I'm sure that you realize that by not acting on the aid package, and lying, blaming the Democrats, you're assuring that the economy cannot possibly recover and that child going to school will an absolute disaster. Trump is still saying that COVID is a hoax.

Cronyism and corruption the hallmark of Trump
If I met trump I’d challenge him to a duel.
Okay hear me out. Trump wants to ban tiktok after a bunch of tiktokers trolled His rally by ordering all the tickets and inflating the numbers.   He isn’t doing it for security. He’s doing it because tiktokers Fucking embarrassed him. He’s trying to silence it.
"Unnamed senior Republican officials close to McConnell told CNN that the Kentucky Republican has made this clear to vulnerable candidates as Trump stirs controversy with his response to the coronavirus pandemic ..."
What I’m getting at is that it’s not a Trump-specific thing I’m talking about. It’s people who hate on someone they don’t like for any reason they can, regardless of validity or reason. It’s not a difficult concept. Or maybe I’m just to unintelligent for you to converse with. Smh

#TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks #TrumpLiesPeopleDie  TRUMP LIES!!!
I think most of them don't care.   As long as Trump is "owning the Libs", they're happy, they parrot what he says.   He changes his tune, they change theirs.  It's just words.
I've been thinking the same thing ... go ahead and piss off the postal workers trump and all the people that rely on the postal service and all the people, republicans included, that enjoy voting by mail. Go ahead and piss all these people off trump.
I agree...Trump forever!!!!!
Don’t you mean the Trump Virus?
Mnuchin, Meadows recommend Trump take executive action as coronavirus relief talks stall - NBC News- imo this is all bs. They are refusing to work w Democrats so Scump can try to appear to be a hero w any aid he offers. #Biden
Actually, China's lean toward Biden is a bit surprising.   Trump, though a total pain to China, is incompetent and isolationist.   Both those make America a smaller rival on the global stage.
And Trump still had to pay someone else to take it. 🤔
I have great affection of Ann Coulter -although for some reason she may be souring on Trump - but her take .. down of the NYT's Nick Kristoff should be in the Journalist Hall of Fame. ...
I’ve never stated I was for Biden lmao! I agree he’s a racist, pedo with dementia. But so is trump. Trump can’t even put together full sentences.
Trump didn’t allow black people to rent from him. He was federally charged for it, but they settled out of court.
What I say to black folks that are against BLM and for trump, I call them stupid. I’m not redefining racism, but I can understand how you would think so, with your poor education. I don’t think anyone has ever confronted you about your racist ideals before.
Oh good grief, are you really that out of touch? These are jobs people are returning to. millions still unemployed and now without a safety net because of the incompetence of Trump and his administration.  People are on the verge of losing their homes now.   Save your happy crap
Trump, your boy, wants one too, even though he never served. 🙄
Nope.
Such a great discussion, thank you   I’m curious about the NDA’s that Donald has used over the years - wouldn’t basically ALL of the Trump NDA’s have relied on false origins, since his entire life is a lie, and thereby be nullified?

All these horrid people who do nothing to serve us, whose job it is to babysit a drug addled insecure Trump, only have 5 more months to lie to us.
Donald Trump has more than any leader we have had in decades. America, and those who love America thank him, pray for him and though I didn’t vote last election..this one I am for
You supporting trump and being against BLM is proof enough of your racism. There are tones of posts on your profile that state “oh well he was intoxicated, or they resisted” insinuating that they deserved to be brutalized or killed.
It’s wild when you know people voting for trump who are supposedly your “friend” despite the Muslim ban... and watching you have the worst 11 days of your life when you’re mom is dying in the hospital alone because trump screwed us w/ the virus... it’s like “actually you’re NOT”.

If Biden wins, the post-Trump corruption purge will have to be epic - #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
And where in the F is trump denouncing this?
We wouldn’t have needed to if Trump had an early coordinated federal response to Covid. None of this had to happen. Fact is Trump is as dumb and dishonest as they come, coupled with the fact republicans cannot govern.
Norah O’Donnell makes a lot of sense. I doubt she’d be hard on Trump, certainly not harder on him then she’d be on Biden. Watching the impeachment coverage via CBSN (she led the main panel discussion) was a bit disorienting in how she tried to make Trump’s defense sound rational.
When you say vote down ballet, that means "keep Trump in office" Right??

Good choice,Joe! So YOU'LL be voting for TRUMP, then?
Why again is Michael Flynn being let of the hook by Trump and Barr?🤔
I did not like Ted when he was battling Trump and others in 2015-16. I have gained way more respect for him this last few months.   He’s finally standing up for the right things in public.
Hmm and Trump is the asshole?
I don’t know what you posted (or who you are 😂) but this happens regularly for me on fb, ever since Trump won. At least one friend was fired in 2016 b/c she was seen as pro-Clinton after she voted 3rd party. Many who are fearful work for Christian schools or churches. It is sad.
I have a complaint with the Republician party. I was planning to vote straight Republician but I'm becoming aware of Republicians voting for Biden. I think it's your responsibility to make all of aware of these traitors. Trump 2020
someone needs to tell Trump it won’t go away until there is some leadership in the White House.  1300 people died yesterday.  is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths that never had to happen.
1300 people died yesterday because Trump couldn’t be bothered.
Either of them been accused of rape or sexual assault by over 40 women? Trump has been credibly accused of raping a 13 year old girl. I’ll be voting for someone who doesn’t rape.
My god how have I not seen this before!? “Dennis Hof, notorious pimp and Republican candidate , died hours after a 72nd birthday party/campaign rally attended by GOP tax fighter Grover Norquist, recent Trump pardon recipient Sheriff Joe Arpaio and porn movie legend Ron Jeremy.”
The treasonous nazi already politicized it.
I think this guy has some issues, what do you think? And all he can do is call people names. He says he is not a trumpy but he can't stay on point without calling people names. He must look up to trump and how he deals with an opposing thought!!!
You have the intelligence of trump, can only call people names!!!
Trump sucks so much , Joe doesn’t have to do a thing
Trump Administration gives $35 million to aid human trafficking victims. (That's nice)
Just like the 1 million in attendance at the Trump superspreader event in Tulsa?
Trump reminds me of the governor in the movie Blazing Saddles played by Mel Brooks.
“It is what it is” - Donald J Trump.
One of Trump’s favorites.
I read she had an agreement in 2016, but by Trump winning, she had to wait. I also read she had no plans to ever move to the White House, she was forced to.  Can’t remember where I read it, so I can’t vouch for the contents. If it’s true, she’ll be divorced in 2021.
With almost 1000 deaths a day Trump says IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!!   remove him, help put a national plan in place. Late a January is too late for tens of thousands...
#impeach Trump
But hey,  let’s keep hearing how Biden can’t read or talk. Biden has a stutter, something millions have, what’s Trump’s excuse?
Yes  Trump
I don’t understand why   and  aren’t doing anything about it. Trump looks weaker and sicker everyday. His right side definitely looks like he had a stroke.   If it were my dad, I’d step in.
B.F.D. !!!! The party formerly known as democrats have retaliated against EVERYTHING  Trump attempts and accomplishes! All members of the Radical Islamic Jihad/Sharia Law supporting  Socialist party. Formerly known as "democrats" And all TOO IGNORANT to care about TRUTH!
You mean Yo-semite. Like trump says
Yes, of course. Everything else has failed to remove Trump, this a last ditch effort.
Lets just be honest here, John Lewis was a not a saint, he did not like President Trump. To pretend that he (Lewis) was above reproach is both hypocritical and dishonest. He was human, and while his cause was noble, he, himself was not without fault.
#DumpTrump and Trump is a dump!

Destroying the Postal Service: Is that Trump's best shot at stealing the election? -
If trump truly had a 'genius' IQ from being tested, he would brag about that by posting the results of that test just like he did w/the cognitive test he took. He bragged how he got a perfect score, which proves how stupid he really is.
I don’t care if Biden never answers another question. Biden isn’t petty - let blue states die - or stupid, Trump is stupid.   Biden hasn’t been accused of rape several times including the rape of a 13 year old.
Even when Swan tried to concede whatever stupid ass point Trump was making to move on with ...logic?🤷‍♂️Trump got confused and bailed out anyways😅😪😥

The consequence is it doesn’t matter what happens. Today will never be the time for reform and the next ghoul will always be the worst ever. And frankly, trump hasn’t come close to the damage done by GWB and we’ve apparently already decided he was good, actually.
Welfare state was slashed by Clinton. Bush tax cuts were made permanent by Obama. Interpretation of the patriot act remained unchanged under Obama. The republicans do awful shit, the democrats normalize it. That’s how we got trump
I think all local Waste Facilities should be renamed as Trump Dumps
Please don’t call tRump ‘presidential’ today.
I’m 46 yrs old and have never voted before . Trump is a stain on our Democracy, Treasonous, Racist Coward, Cov19 deaths are without question, killing hundreds of thousands of American. 2016 - 2020 will be a period of time that will live in infamy.
Our country has been like this, trump just gave them permission to come out of the closet and act on their hate!
My first time voting for president and my two choices are Biden and Trump?!? This is the biggest letdown since finding out life only gets harder after high school
Please don’t call tRump ‘presidential’ today.
Retweet to defeat trump and put him and his family in prison
One of the reasons the Dems want to keep Biden from debating Trump is the questions it will raise about Joe. Like who will actually be running the government? Certainly not this guy... Does he even know what year it is?
Then again, Bush isn't Trump.
Another in a long line of Trump’s mob-boss responses. Trump doesn’t see himself as king as much as “Capo”...”
Dear god, if you’re really up there please make it so trump goes to prison along with his family.
I'm an anxiety riddled mess, but even I'd be better than Trump 🤣
If This Poll Is Accurate, Trump Will Be Reelected Easily ....
I am so sick of this trump bullshit, religious bullshit and outright fascist bullshit we are all Americans and we must fucking vote this motherfucker out in 2020  I wAnt my country back!  We have all fought for freedoms and we all deserve them #fucktrump
Yeah...and FB sells people's data, which to Trump is ok since they're making a profit off of it. Ugh.

Let’s have a lawsuit. In discovery, I want Nevada to demand to see the evidence Trump is using to support evidence of mail fraud. He has none.
We *think Trump is crazy, but we can’t know until he’s ordered to get a psychiatric exam. And that won’t happen until he’s out of office.
What crap was that? I got a letter from trump taking credit for the check...perhaps your anger should be directed at that dude?
After careful analysis, I believe Trump will verbalize the sentiment that "Whites under attack" soon.
Typical trump supporter. Spout off at the mouth and hope you’re not wrong. Then blast vindication the second you’re able!!
You seem delightful! So I’m sure you’re just this mad at throwing $180 million in PPP loans to Chinese firms — or was that ok because trump allowed it to happen on his watch?
Do you really think we would risk our children's health to make you look bad? Only a real narcissist  or a deranged idiot would think that! "Trump blasted Democrats for keeping schools closed, saying they were trying to hurt him politically..."
Trump's doc may be nuts, but this may very well be true, "... she has said that the government is run in part not by humans but by “reptilians” and other aliens."
Yep, Trump will change it back to the way it was instead of going down your suicidal socialism path, Mr. Biden.

Fortunately, Trump realized this a long time ago.  Glad you are just figuring it out.  Now do what’s right for the people and not the progressive movement.  Show us that you are what you claim to be.  A leader.  That which does not exist in the Democratic Party.
If Trump has any backdoor creeper pervert shit with Epstein why wouldn’t he of just covered it up like the last several Presidents did?
Didn’t give a shit about politics until Trump exposed these fools now im a political junkie who wants honest people running the country and dishonest thief’s held accountable! So whatever that is called....
Nonsense! As an evangelical Christian that is the last thing we need. We need somebody that actually practices the teachings of Jesus, fully, not somebody that uses the Bible as a prop. We don't need Trump, LOL, we need God, because He has the rest!
A past president of the United States has been linked to possibly the largest child sex trafficking ring to date and all libs do is point out Trump has family pictures of his own child sitting on his lap! Wtf is wrong with these people!
Where is that healthcare law Trump is signing today or tomorrow? Trump promised it would be, and I quote, “ full and robust”.
i cant tell weather i can tolerate trump supporters or biden supporters. none of them have common sense
I agree. I wouldn’t watch it anyway. I can’t stand trump and his childish behavior
Imagine being so desperate to appease Trump you make claims that are not true. No doctor has said HCL should be "banned", only that it does not help.
We are 1,370 days into Trump’s 1st term and Chuck Schumer still thinks getting rid of Trump at any cost is more important than doing the People’s work.   Chuck has held the People’s Work hostage.  He has dumbed down the Senate with constant politics and very little compromise.
i hate trump... 😌😌😌
Would probably label him ( Trump) right up there with all the voters he,  refers to as "SELFISH BASTARDS"!
Exersize? Trump thought you meant extra-fries.
Trump is always talking about how great America “used to be” so your whole party is riding off of 70 years ago, But hey, at least taxes were fair and just then.
Whatever Obama wrote, we know Trump didn’t read it.
Whoopsie! Resign! "Donald Trump fails to draw a crowd as he lands in Florida"  ￼
God how slow are you? I have been talking about individual and corporate taxes. You know the taxes that effect our million and billionaires, our biggest corporations. You’re allowing trump to control your narrative for personal gain after presidency
Thank you , President Trump, we now have more testing, more folks will be diagnosed, insuring they will get help, Good job, Sir! KAG TRUMP 2020!
Thank you President Trump! Lower drugs, we have been waiting DECADES!

This tells me two things: 1. Obama administration started the economic growth, 2. Trump failed to do anything to stabilize and “build” it. He rode the wave, and it failed because of his inaction. He should get no credit for the economy whatsoever. Am I wrong?
As a health care provider, I think efforts to save the life of Rep. Steve Scalese would have been better spent to save someone else.  He is now working against all health care providers by defending Trump’s handling of COVID and contributing nothing to solving the crisis.

This is absolutely true. You and trump are hurting many small businesses.
Trump and the  plan is that there is no plan.   All of you deserve to lose your jobs.
Trump and the  are failures. None of what you all have ruined could be called a success.   You have no conscience.
Trump didn't win with most votes. Only reason he won was our archaic EC. If EVERY vote counted, he would've lost badly.
153,000 dead Americans with a possible 200,000 dead by Labor Day is NOT a success for Trump.   Why do you continue to think it is?   There were americans in China as part of Obama’s pandemic team.Trump and Bolton dismantled that office! Why do U keep hiding that?
Trump’s plan is non existent!!!! Look at what a huge failure. 150,000 dead!!  We’re you dropped on your head?? Are you living in the same country as the rest of us??? There is no plan and Trump is a failure, not a success.

Using Trump as a way to advocate for this topic seems as bad to me as pro-lifers using Kanye when he is in the middle of psychological crisis. Ultimately it will probably backfire and not help to achieve the goals you are seeking to advance.
Fewer Trump voters, I guess.
Trump will have to have irrefutable evidence. Secretaries of states are easily offended by charges of voter fraud in their yards.
40 percent of the country will vote Trump no matter what. Those people don’t blame Trump. If they didn’t think Trump was incompetent before they won’t think it now.   Also America is a federal system. People here are arguing about whether it’s Trumps fault or the governors.
I wonder who Trump will force to give him an award now.🙄🤔
This could be catastrophic for so many.People who still get their SS checks in the mail, people who get their meds by mail due to disabilities and not being able to get to a pharmacy!! trump and this administration is dangerous for this country! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I’m worried about this as well. I also believe Trump will win the election.
If human's brains have evolved why do we have trump?
all because of Trump’s ego. No other reason. Prove me wrong.
I understood literally nothing from your tweet. Must be another fine Trump University graduate.
Oh now it’s trump who?  Your party is killing Americans even American soldiers by Putin. The  has screwed everything up since 2016. Your time is up. Start packing up your offices. You’re all fired
so that means trump shouldn’t try and delay it either right
That’s why I’m convinced trump will win again. We are all doomed.
They spewed their lies, reclaiming time without letting Barr retaliate, so time would expire and they could then say "Barr refused to deny ANY of our POINTS brought out during his "HEARING"! DISGUSTING WASTE OF TAXPAYER TIME AND MONEY!   Trump

If you are not voting for Biden you are voting for Trump.
Not for nothing, but  was told repeatedly holding his rally was a bad idea.   Hardly anyone showed up and Herman Cain caught Covid 19 and passed away.   Trump just doesn’t listen, and he is not that swift. No wonder we are where we are.
AND healthcare is EXTREMELY important. Not medicare for all. Trump is doing everything in his power to get rid of healthcare!
If you get trump you lose all healthcare. So choose your poison. We are losing our Democracy under trump right now. It will be gone if he wins. Welcome to living under a Dictator. You didn't burst my bubble. Single payer is what we should be pushing!
Yep. I want healthcare too. I know it is an issue. But those that won't for Biden because he won't back Medicare for all, well Trump wins. Then you get nothing. He will dismantle ACA. So you are willing to put trump in office for 4 more years (or more) for one issue?
Trump does not have the authority to delay the election. It’s not his call. He’s distracting from other bad news for him - GDP, COVID. Don’t take the bait.
Was trump invited ?
Big news day. Epstein documents released. Every former President except trump will be at John Lewis funeral, Obama to deliver eulogy. Worse GDP ever.   Trump moving election a distraction. He needs the attention.it’s a fair trade for sure, other countries just flat out banned tiktok, you don’t seem to have a problem with that, but when tiktok steals americans’ data and trump threatens to ban them unless they sell, you flip a cow. that’s a silver lining if i’ve seen one.
What a load of BS. Got a lot of Trump in ya. Learn this word - may help
Obama did this years ago and trump has been trying to end it for his entire term in office. This is a total and complete scam They are already covered
There is a mechanism at large that put the Trump at helm. It wants to leave no stranded asset like oil underground. It doesn't accept the fact that Nature Large keeps Earth. Well the fact is Earth Biosphere acts as Zeroth Law third. Between brilliance of the Sun and Earth sky OK.
said people needed to put their Christian principles aside in order to vote trump.  Obviously he sets his aside for many occasions including sleazy yacht parties.  Finally some accountability!

Never Trump means a cabinet full of wacky liberals, open abortions, left wing judges, weakened military. Stay the course. Must vote for Trump.
Seems like he’ll say anything to win — Biden is a life long Catholic. Certainly more religious that Pres Trump. And more cautious gun regulation is not the same as taking your guns away. This feels like he’s getting desperate and over exaggerating to stoke fear.
Aw, Donald Trump and all (yes, all!) Republicans will surely kill more kids and teachers this fall than the NRA ever dreamed was possible!
Obviously Trump believes Biden is stronger than God. Strange for such a religious man.
O yes it does. To anyone with an ounce of integrity. The GOP have done nothing but enable trump, keep him in power, and refuse the oath and responsibilities of their office. I left the GOP in 2010 but didn't vote straight Blue until 2018 (Did not vote trump in 16) Never Again GOP

Nope.  Obama, who was absolutely horrible towards undocumented people migrants used the cages for kids wor arrived *unaccompanied*.  And only for short periods.  This is still horrible and wrong, but it is nothing like what trump is doing.  Not at all.

If Trump resigns he doesn’t “lose”. Then Pence can pardon him as Ford did for Nixon. Win-win.  Pence gets to say he was Prez for a few months before Biden takes office.

fun facts about the boat trump bought from the saudi arms dealer who was the uncle of murdered journalist #jamalkhashoggi
You're a liar, Kevin. You wanted to drastically cut unemployment stimulus and use the money for remodeling the West Wing, to increase military spending on non virus related items, and help trump's hotel business along with more perks for the wealthy
I'd love to see the transcript. I can't stand listening to trump speak and I don't have HBO
Good point.  If we're going to given the Ayatollah enough rope to hang himself, we should think about doing the same favor for Trump et al.  Shouldn't need too much more rope at this point...
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Obama is a strong man with so much integrity. tRump is a weak cry baby who never takes responsibility for ANYTHING.
To be fair, Trump is currently the leader of the free world though. As much as I despise the man, if he’s not guilty, then good for him. But if he is, he should be prosecuted as well as Bill.
the one thing i promise i’ll never get tired of from this whole trump nightmare is this picture. if my musk brand neuro-control implant allows it, will be posting it from my nursing home
and he then set the feds on protesters. so criminal, just not “war”
The problem with this commonly-used defense is that it means Trump is not accountable for anything he says.
Sad that COVID took his life.  Maybe the Oklahoma rally shouldn't have taken place!  Sorry we lost a patriot among the other 150,000 who have been lost.  DUMP TRUMP 2020!

VA reporting 2088 deaths due to COVID but you've done nothing but kiss trump's ass. Not once have you called out his pathetic and deliberate mishandling of this crisis. You don't care about vets. You just use them for votes when you can

Trump is the most dangerous man in America. He has 150,000 plus deaths in his hands. He needs to go!!!
Crossings are down because no one wants to catch the trump virus
Genuinely asking: what kind of legislative solution is there? Even if by some miracle they could get something past the senate, wouldn't it die on Trump's desk? I'm all for holding Dems accountable but it seems to me their hands are tied.
Trump-Treason can't let go of control.

A lot of people seem to act like Obama and Biden are perfect.   Yeah Trump is really fucking bad, but Obama and Joe have their flaws.
Well well well... What do you say  Zuck???
Only trump could make GWB look like a statesman. Bush should really thank him, then work to ensure he is soundly and decidedly defeated in November 🇺🇸
You are the party that put for MILLIONS in spending for military jets, a new building to help trump's property values and business, and redecorating the WH as part of the COVID aid package that is supposed to help PEOPLE.  Pack. Your. Bags
Not true. The Constitution says that Congress will decide so they would just have to chose someone besides Pelosi.  No matter what trump would not be President
who thought trump could have killed with such a weak set?
. Living in Colorado, mail-in voting has been great! Overall voting is up in both parties, voter fraud is LESS likely to occur in mail-in ballots, and many people make use of drop-off stations instead of USPS to return. #WeWillVote
Trump was for it so the Left was immediately against it
We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party’s Soul Long Ago   &lt; How many has the party lost when ~40% of voters still support Trump? Yet my entire family of Republican voters for 35+ years are now Independents because of the party's moral failures.
He is black.  Trump is probably celebrating by playing another one bites the dust.
Trump clearly has 24 hour or less Covid-19 testing available for himself and those surrounding him.
Haven't they heard that Herman Cain died from the virus that he contracted at a tRump rally in Tulsa? You really can't fix stupid!
Yes Trump and Republicans have shown a lot of integrity, dignity, and principle.
Strange. I've seen plenty of MAGA "fuck your feelings" apparel. Just strange to see a Trump supporter with hurt feelings is all.
if they still have a doughnut in their user name, that says volumes about their priorities, and no, “defeating trump” isn’t one of them

I mean, all three (trump, kavenaugh, and gorsuch) all suck...but, the are legitimate.  Sadly.
I would agree with you during a "normal" administration. Trump's agenda has so often been wrong (at least to me) that I think 67.5% is pretty damning. My view as a Never Trumper.
First clue is that Project Veritas is an agitprop right wing trash group that slandered Acorn back in 2008... so, at first, I was like, they're trying to get us to share this, so they can then claim we shared doctored video of their Lord and Savior Trump. LOL! Funny AF though! 😁
Putin. Federal Security Service tells Trump what it wants.News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
If tell them to fuck off! That’s what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!
Trump enterprise and crime family.. emoluments, stealing from kids cancer charity, the Hatch Act.. shall I go on?
Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.
Guessing you have stock in companies *other* than Tesla/SpaceX and want the contracts to go to those investments. What have you done for Colorado while licking Trump's boots the last few years? Buh-bye in November, Cory.

#PostalService worked, Trump broke it by putting in buddies, like so many other divisions.

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
How has he done with the tRump virus? The families of the dead are waiting to know!
In case you missed it, here’s the REAL reason Trump is pushing so hard for a payroll tax cut.  Hint: It helps Big Business‼️
“Good faith negotiations”⁉️ Does anyone else think this is Trump and the Rs behind the scenes⁉️
Trump is doing WAY more than that for Russia‼️
The really stupid thing is that there's no way for the postal service to know which ballots are Republican ballots and which are Democratic ballots.  Trump didn't think this through to the end -- AGAIN!
Trump. Is. Corrupt. Period.
Those aren't facts.  It's the way you twisted to make it seem like it was Democratic governors.  Who had the intel and the heads up that this virus was out there?  Who, even today, refuses to tell the truth about the virus?  WHO DO AMERICANS BLAME -- TRUMP!
She has to repay $10K while Trump is fined $25M and $2M for his university and charity.  Looks like about 3 orders of magnitude difference.  Given that, why are you focused on Tlaib instead of Trump?
Like the Trump Foundation, the NRA leaders will be held accountable for the corruption &amp; grift that has taken advantage of your members. And we're okay seeing the money from your cold, (metaphorically) dead hands.  Buh-bye.
And Trump's removing all oversight, firing IGs, installing Barr as AG, suing to prevent tax/DNA release, pardoning convicted felons like Stone, telling Ghislaine “I wish her well” doesn't bother you?
The one thing Russia can't do is bring 160,000 people back from the dead!  Trump will always have botched the pandemic, and he will continue to try to ignore it, only addressing it in terms of PR for his re-election!
Like Kushner thinking we didn't need to respond to the virus since it was mainly affecting blue states.  Like trumpie governors in red states having to close down again because of CV spikes in RED states.  That's when Trump finally started wearing a mask.
Anyone dumb and arrogant enough to have a huge pool party during a pandemic is possibly dumb enough to support Trump.  My assumption is based on logic.  Funny how you assume rioters are protestors.
She said that before anyone knew anything about the virus. You know this yet you continue this narrative. After we learned more, Trump and his benighted followers still refused to wear masks, still had big pool parties, still went to rallies, Daytona, etc.
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Dude, the poorer, less educated, home bound people are Trump's BASE! Only they believe he's a cosmopolitan, educated billionaire.  60% of us know he won't prove it by releasing his transcripts &amp; taxes. We know he's a mobster who lies &amp; bullies to get his way.  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Trump continues to flout social distancing guidelines even as he urges others to follow them
Trump hates y’all so much he had to create help create jobs fir y’all
Interesting take.  And all along I had thought it was God's punishment for electing Trump.
This is the whole reason for seperation between Church &amp; State. So no candidate can claim to be "Gods chosen candidate". Trump is trying to anoint himself as such because you may dislike him, but a vote for him is a vote for God...
You can't be happy if you worship money and power above all.  Just look at Trump; a picture of misery.
This might help:
Trump's religious when it comes to his little, tiny eternity and his minuscule immortal soul.  He'll accept Jesus if that means he can get into Heaven.  He's terrified of Hell.  Other than that he doesn't have much use for religion.
Force of nature? What BS. Trump is more like a force against nature.  It'll be interesting to watch #FoxNews be buried in news cycles after the #BidenLandslide because we won't care what they say since it's all #FakeNews.
He can't. State charges do not operate under same guidelines as the DOJ. They CAN indict a sitting president and there is no commutation or pardon under these laws. Buh bye Jabba the Trump!
Trump should stop what Clinton started and Obama grew in enforcement.

You are pathetic. Trump lies with every word he speaks and want look for any misspoken words to distract from the real issue. We need a president who doesn't lie to us. A president who takes action to save Americans not kill us.
As Trump pull the US out of international deals, agreements and organizations, do you know who fills the void?  You know who signs the deals and becomes a partner? China!  Trump is making this China's century. Just so you can understand, C-H-III-N-A.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.
More GOP #propaganda (aka bull shit). You, Senator, refused to address the extension of benefits for more than two months and, now, you want to blame Democrats for your failure. We see Trump do this shit daily, so we know your claim isn't true.  #GOPBetrayedAmerica #BlueWave2020

At least Trump does it on purpose...
I dreamt last night that it was November and Trump lost the election. I felt a physical weight lifted off my shoulders. I can’t wait for November. Let’s get back on track!
Leave it to creative types to invent a world where Trump is “sweating” prosecution enough to retain the presidency for life. You people are insufferable...
Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?
It's just a bonus that I get to skip 2020 but if Trump gets re-elected please just let me keep sleeping. 🙃
BOOOM!!! TRUMP MAGA 2020 VOTE RED SAVE AMERICA!!!
I am as much of a bot as Trump is a billionaire. It's all about the money for Trump - it's why Trump got his Ambassador to Britain to try to get the British Open moved to his Turnberry resort.
Yes, as He pushes Trump out the White House door!
When Trump loses in November, will that mean that God is mad at Trump?
In Trump's America? Probably. 😂
He’ll do fine! Much better than trump!
It means never Republican to me until I can see some GOP principals I can support. It is not only Trump pushing Kayne West as a candidate to upset the election. I will never vote Republican again when Republicans are up to this kind of ridiculous games.
Who you kiddin, we both know Trump don’t run nowhere. Lol
Congress is pathetic for letting this happen. "Trump is imposing a new 10 per cent tariff on Canadian aluminum imports":
Stupidest thing I’ve read all day, and that’s tough to accomplish in Trump America... congrats!
The big tech companies don't define truth but they can sure tell when Trump &amp; his sycophants (like YOU) are lying. Stop lying and spreading misinformation, and you'll have no issues with social media.
Unlike Melaria who would like to thank her speech writers copy and paste or tRump who doesn’t have a coherent thought!
Unlike tRump who just gets mad and walks away!
Mitch McConnell is evil, he don't care about American middle class, actually all Republicans, but president Trump is a great president.
What's funny here is the fact that Trump is oblivious too: God is omnipotent, and therefore unable to be hurt.
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
Trump can't even read tbh
This is without question the most asinine thing you’ve ever articulated. Do you not see it just suggests that you’re looking for an excuse to vote for Trump? What the hell, SE?
Any #MSM covering these events should cut away as soon as he finishes reading from the notes he's obviously never read before. STOP GIVING TRUMP FREE AIR TIME!!!
If his VP pick is the sticking point, you really need to look at yourself in the mirror and wonder why you think Trump is even an option.
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
Trump was more interested in protecting Confederate statues than protecting Americans from COVID-19.
It does as long as a Trump enabling sycophant is left in office. At this point I'm so disgusted with the  that I'll never #vote Republican again. They, along with #Trump have failed America.
This is the strongest argument for showing that Trump is manipulating weak-minded religious people for support. The Bible itself says that we should be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Boy do they have that backwards.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.
Trump is losing it.
You know, the NRA is like Trump Charities. I can care about kids with cancer without funneling money through your family.
"Pro-life" would be a lol if it wasn't such a hypocritical label for an ideology that is anything but. 162,000 and counting very preventable American deaths from COVID-19. Guess that's on you  Mike Pence, since Trump doesn't take responsibility and you were on the task force.

Agree.  I do think there is a preponderance of evidence.   Nothing has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to my knowledge, but with so many allegations of sexual assault against Trump, a preponderance requires a 50% chance any is true.  I think that condition is met.

For all I know, Putin developed COVID-19, introduced it to China and the world to destroy us, and told Trump to ignore it. Why else would Trump say “it will go away someday”? Why would he tout ineffective treatments? Why would Trump call Putin so many times in March and April?

This guy looks in the mirror, slathers on orange and says "All better." If it wasn't for the fact that Mary Trump describes Donnie's mother coming to America as a 1940's version of Melanie, I would swear his mother and father were siblings. The hubris of this man to be cocky.
do you consider these people who would vote for Trump racist?
Trump. Promise?😂😂😂😂😂
Fox News, "My view is that schools should be open," Trump said. “If you look at children, children are almost — and I would almost say definitely — but almost immune from this disease.” He added that children have "much stronger immune systems" and "just don't have a problem."
I heard that demon semen is the reason for women getting ovaries. I don’t know if it’s true, but Donald Trump Jr promoted the doctor that claims this so I doubt it’s false.
I agree with you Jocelyn trump is the biggest racist prejudice hypocrite hitler wannabe president this country has. Cause of him the coronavirus has gotten worse that retarded piece of shit. Is so goddamn stupid. I am surprised no one has taken him out yet. He deserves prison
I agree with you 100%. Trump is the biggest racist hypocrite bastard. That dumb shit can’t put a sentence together without it being a lie. This country has hitler as president. That retarded asshole needs to be locked up for the rest of his life. Cause him the virus is everywhere
There goes President Trump trying to kill Americans again.  So how much do you think he owes Putin?
Hi Wayne. Is Jonathan of Trump interview fame any relation?
Trump's account is locked until he deletes a BS tweet about kids being immune to COVID.   It's about fucking time.
Right? When I see anything in support of Trump, the first thing I think is that person is an idiot!
People a few houses down just put a Trump/Pence sign in their front yard.  They also belong to a biker club called BARI (Bikers against radical Islam), so we're pretty sure they're racists!
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
He should say, "I haven't had a doctor recommend that test for dementia to me!"    Trump thinks it's an IQ test!
They honestly think that POC will just vote for Kanye because of the color of his skin!  They're not dumb, like Trump supporters!
You state all of the reasons why people should vote for Trump.  Great work Michael
To my Twitter friends who might STILL be Trump loyalists... we luv ya, guys, but SERIOUSLY, can you STILL vote for this man? Consider his total DISREGARD for the safety of you &amp; your LOVED ONES?  This DOLT only wants to enrich himself.  Screw our kids?
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
We must all register to get our mail-in ballot, then do our best to turn it in personally to an official &amp; well guarded drop-box. That’s the only way to not stand in line for hours and secure that our votes count. We have absolute power to counter all of Trump’s I’ll intentions
The easiest way to counter Trump is to hold a mirror to his comments because they are always about projection, especially when they are lies.
Cults always have great enthusiasm for their dear leader. Unfortunately for trump, his cult is shrinking.
I've been referring to attendees of Trump rallies, and now school children, as weaponized w/ the #COVID19 virus to infect family &amp; friends. This will create more chaos going into the election, which Putin wants.
Will NEVER vote republican again due to Trump and the Republican Party turning their back on decency and our constitution. Only voted for the D's in the 2016 election. Will do the same in 2020. They make me ill to see what they stand for now. #notarepublicananymore
I agree. No need for any debates.  has all the leverage. With Trump requesting conservative moderators and still no tax returns, Joe can demand tax returns and moderators he wants. Otherwise, no debates to show Trump  slinging lies and bull shit all over the stage.
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
He’s sane, he’s smart, he’ll trust experts and be inclusive. It won’t be trump family crookery. I can’t wait.
All Republicans leaders know how to do is project their own miserable failings onto Democrats. Who politicized COVID-19? Trump. Who politicized wearing masks? Trump. Who doesn't care if Americans die? Trump. Who supports Trump at every lying turn? Republicans.

I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
Love these fellow veterans speaking out against trump. We know how to identify an enemy, whether it’s foreign or domestic.
I don’t care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.

We have been ever since Trump was installed in office. It’s been a clown show and Putin’s been pulling the strings. Can’t blame China for trying, Russia makes it look easy. Problem is, Biden isn’t an easy mark like Trump, so all this does is hurt the validity of a win.

Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don’t. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.
What part isn’t true? If reversed, what part wouldn’t Trump blame on the president at the time of this? Candidate Trump ran on getting rid of NAFTA, how’s that going?
They aren't trying to manipulate the election. They have a rule about spreading misinformation about the pandemic. Trump lies about the pandemic constantly.
Poor Jim can’t handle the truth AMERICA LOVES TRUMP ....it’s going to be another log four more years got you !!!! Blahaha
Why is Kelly Anne married to him? Makes one wonder is he a basically unattractive guy very much a subversive guy! I don’t get it. I am troubled why she stays . So if my husband was him, I worked for Pres Trump . I would have big conflict living with HIM !!
Yes, it does. Republicans have become the party of Trump. They became that when they lacked the spine to remove him or even run another candidate in the primary against him. Your father would be ashamed.
Truth is,I still voted for and will probably vote again for the same centrist dems that i'm critiquing. My broader point is that I refuse to allow myself to be deluded or driven into a maniac state re: Trump.Remove all his touting&amp;selling, his policies are boilerplate R-doctrine
I'm not defending Trump&amp;his grifty track record at all. I'm simply saying that we must be honest about facts--Trump has not done anywhere near the damage to minorities, middle and working class ppl that the expert moderates did. I didn't vote for Trump. But, im not delusional.
Thanks 🙏. Part of the problem is that I actually experienced 1st hand how disastrous the consequences were from all of these bad decisions made by the moderate elites. I was in college in Tallahassee and I remember how horrifying Bush's handling of Katrina was. Now, he's &gt;Trump?
Biden also voted for the War in Iraq. How many rural whites, poor blks &amp; brown folks young men were killed in that unnecessary war that eroded all of our civil liberties and is bankrupting our country to this day? Trump and his tacky RE properties had no real power over blks.
The Trump campaign's latest contest is a scam. Here's proof.  by
Everyone acknowledges that the war on drugs was a failed experiment and big stain on the our country. We threw millions of ppl in a cage for max time, for non violent crimes. Biden, however, still thinks it was the right thing to do. What has Trump done thats equivalent to that?
How can Democrat’s support Biden? Simple question can someone give to me a real response? If your response is never Trump. I say back pathetic to not care what happens to OUR COUNTRY !!🇺🇸
| they cover it here.I’m not saying that Trump isn’t a dumpster 🔥, but I’m personally tired of my vote being held hostage by the dem establishment every presidential cycle. You put up Mr. Mass Incarceration and the AG in CA that locked up truant parents?
Doctoring images is the epitome of "fake news"  Trump is such a hypocrite!
You do realize that 4 more years of Trump is the alternative, right!?!  Biden could choose a warm egg salad as his running mate and he wouldn't lose my vote.
Their brains lack nuance and they're fueled by hatred. If you don't like Trump, you must like the Clintons. They don't understand that a person can dislike Trump and Clinton. Plus, they think you are like them and will blindly follow your "leader."  Short version: they're stupid.
We're really not far from the point where Trump says he speaks to God.
Wrong COME ON BOARD THE BRST PRESIDENT EVER !!!!! TRUMP 2020
Bring as many troops home and close as many bases as I can, do executive orders that get us as close to M4A and Green New Deal as possible. Might seem way out of character for him, but "Trump" could make the case that the pandemic and desperate times call for desperate measures
But, how will we cheat to beat Trump then?? 😫
Would it help if the word ‘Sam’ came after it? Maybe then it would be recognizable for Trump. As for those you work with, I second all of the previously asked questions- are these people able to pass the same cognitive test Trump brags about, at the very least?
Do you have proof the CDC falsified numbers? Or is it possible that the Trump admin is not sharing accurate info? Or could it be that the numbers are inaccurate because they required all hospitals nationwide to change systems within 2 days and they’re still adjusting?
I really really learned and enjoyed Pres Trump’s press conference . My hat is off to Arizona’s gov doing such a terrific  job under duress . I am a bit disturbed at the monies being given by our govt.  necessary I get just the $$$ I basically thought Pres Trump did very well 👍
I can do it in 2: Fuck Trump
Drain the Swamp!
If mail-in voting is so unsafe then we better see Trump cast his vote at a polling station
And the difference is, the United States will do better with Trump’s policies than Biden’s.
Great, now Trump’s going to get a light saber
Every day he conditions us to accept more crazy - ENOUGH.  NO NETWORK SHOULD RUN THIS. EVERY NETWORK THAT DOES SHOULD BE PROSECUTED under the law along with Trump and all his enablers.
Who cares what Trump says anymore. He is leaving - HE HAS TO GO.
Trump hates anything Obama does for no other reason than Obama is Black.
Den voters aren't asking "Can we?" or "Can we not?", they're just doing it.  Trump likely knows this.
Hmm I can’t even begin to imagine you doing sh.. Just my honest feeling. I do think Our Country was faced with the virus from China WHO either enabled w/China or basically dropped the ball. Biggest health crisis in history. Trump did a job worthy of respect
There is still some good in the world after all. Targeting seniors - that's like Trump level cruel.
Democrats are laying the groundwork to once again de-legitimize an election of Donald Trump.
Check your grammar and spelling before calling someone dumb, troll.  BTW, Trump can't sit and chew gum at the same time.
Only a dishonest Democrat would say such a thing considering during the Trump administration the unemployment rate for African Americans had been the lowest it had ever been until the pandemic.
I guess I have to repeat myself. I have no idea. But I haven’t read any reports that he’s demanding that Microsoft take a percentage. Microsoft is in talks to buy the company. Perhaps Trump thinks that will solve the national security threat.
You were wanting a national mandate concerning the pandemic. You’re just engaging in deflection because you don’t like Trump. Give me an example of Trump actually doing something that was an abuse of executive power. I can give you examples for Obama.
Google Biden’s response to Trump’s China travel restrictions in January 2020.
Why did Biden complain that Trump’s China travel restrictions were xenophobic and then later changed his mind? People say dumb stuff.
Why does Trump have to call on Congress? Where’s the groundswell in the Democrat controlled House of Representatives for a national mandate regarding anything about the response? It doesn’t exist. Go back to school. Learn about American government. Read the Constitution.
Convictions unrelated to activities of Trump as president and impeachment was a scam.
No one is offering a clear, sober, competent and accurate response to the virus. Why should Trump be any different?
If there is so much evidence of crimes committed by the Trump family, why hasn’t anyone been indicted?
The thing that bothers people the most about Trump is his form. Not the substance so much. It’s the form. But his form doesn’t have any impact on anyone’s lives. Funny how people focus on the more trivial at the expense of the substantive.
Truth. TRUMP 2020 Baby!
Everyone please watch. It’s incredible how he deflects every question by citing his own incompetence as achievement.
Thank you President Trump !!
We have deployed refrigerated corpse trucks in America because of Donald Trump's complete failure to act.
This woman is VERY much against Trump!!!
So not Pres Trump
I think the reporting has not been accurate. E.g. a patient terminal with Cancer contracts Covid and dies is listed as Covid. Same with other deaths like car crashes . Many more examples as well.. inflated , why Hysteria driven.. also Dems want to say Trump isn’t handlingPandemic
Record job losses and crashing GDP under Trump, what a ducking shocker
Trump goes postal by
Trump is trying to shake down Microsoft.
If Biden weasels out of the debates. Trump's approval rating keeps going up (it's at 51% now) it won't matter. Trump will win in a landslide.
I'll go Answer A Jeff: Donald Trump?
Yeah, it's literally what I've been saying, but you couldn't hear over your shouts of "HOW DARE YOU BLAME TRUMP!!"
Here’s hoping it’s enough to them all, including Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr, and Eric, in jail with Criminal in Chief.   NY prosecutors say Trump investigation extends beyond hush money payments
He just wants to be on the Trump train, God love him.  I do think he was smart enough to recognize what Wallace was doing, which is why he went full WHATABOUT SHADY DOSSIERS, HUH? 😆
Did Trump beat Obama?
I don't think anyone is above reproach, but Trump throwing a pick-six on our first possession put us permanently behind.  Now we're stupidly burning a candle at both ends trying recover from both the virus and the economy at the same time.
What's most important is the response of each country.  Our response was spectacularly bad.  Trump is gonna be the scapegoat every bit as much as he was the shining hero for the bullet train of an economy.
Why is this a problem? I interpreted your initial tweet that you were implying that they made their money due to Trump being president.
If trump would have stuck do doing nothing he'd make millions without suspicion. He went for president and might go to jail. Ego greed and envy bitch.
That’s the beauty of the debates. President Trump all by himself can put the questions to Biden.
I always thought Pete Buttiegeg had the best shot at beating Trump.
Gosh!  Trump's just one o' the good guys, settin' things straight 'round here, doin' things legally and whatnot.
Yet you say nothing about Trump and Navarro doing exactly that to Dr. Fauci.
Trump speaks on his behalf.
Trump Care and fixed. Now go back to the Salt Mines, and don't slip. (Past experience)
"How old is Trump?"  "He's...gross and fat"
Congrats on becoming a LEGAL US CITIZEN !!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Glad you will be voting for President Trump ❤️
“Sleepy Eyes” Trump! #POTUS
So for all of you who are mad at Trump for banning TikTok, there is nothing wrong with the app itself it’s just the Chinese government is collecting our personal data so we can’t protect ourselves in war #tiktokban
Therefore you'd vote for anyone who's not Trump. If Stalin or Hitler or Pol Pot ran against Trump you'd vote for them.
OK, birther. What happened when President Obama wore a tan suit?  Trump deserves more than he gets. He lies with every breath he can muster. He intentionally divides the country for his own benefit. He is a deadly cocktail of stupidity and hubris.
trump what’s good
679,439 humans have lost their life to COVID-19, with 156,621 of them being Americans. Or better put, 23% of all deaths to #COVID19 are Americans, yet Americans only account for less than 3% of the world's population. #Winning #Trump
A plagiarizer, creepy, segregationist supporter, liar, with declining mental faculties, deathly afraid of being asked hard questions about spying on the Trump campaign and running for president while hiding in his basement. Has abandoned most of his life long principles.
This too
I'm trying to imagine someone trying to explain this infinitely complex infrastructure to Trump and I'm barely able to contain my maniacal laughter.
You are in denial. Trump's rally speeches are mostly off the cuff as he ad libs a lot. He has had many press conferences taking questions from a hostile press. Biden is hiding in his basement as his handlers say "no" to going on shows like Fox Sunday hosted by Chris Wallace.
No one can any longer say Trump supporters aren’t racist. Every action, policy, WH staff is there for a reason. They believe in white supremacy. Climb out from under the rock.
Part if it is Trump being advised to throw out whatever trial balloons he has to see what captures (hijacks) the narrative, and part of it is just pure capitalism.  But I'm also aware that the people who "care" most about security want complete, unabated control of it.
You're the only one blathering on about the CDC.  I never mentioned them.  You want to crown Trump a shining hero, then be my guest.  But he should have quickly realized this could be a political nuke, and saved himself from his Titanic 2nd term bid.  There's no reversing this.
What's really funny is believing Trump cares about any of that, or even knows what any of it means.
Here we have a live shot of the Trump train.
Thousands of rioters and protesters not wearing masks is safe but attending a Trump rally isn't. Going to a well  attended funeral for a heroic Democrat is fine but going to a friend's funeral isn't. Your side's hypocrisy has created the distrust over the response.
In 2016 the Democrats lost an election they were sure they were going to win. Ever since then they’ve claimed the election was rigged by Trump and the Russians. It’s been a horrible lie perpetrated by ugly people like you.
Richard, can you distinguish between expressing an idea and implementing it? Trump talked about delaying an election while the Chinese delayed one. You continue to pander to your Democrat donors while misleading Americans.
Biden was right. I was wrong. I underestimated the depth of Trump's depravity. He will, in fact, try anything to retain power.  Fixed it for you.
Greatest economic expansion in American history.  20 million Americans with health insurance. Protecting America’s reputation in the world.  Lots more. Trump: 33% reduction in GDP.  45 million unemployed.  Kids in cages. More dumb ass medical recommendations in US history.
Don’t comment on US economics if you don’t know anything.  Trump inherited the largest economic expansion in American history (fact) gave a trillion dollars of debt to Corporations and the 1% then his policies drove our economy into the ground.  33% reduction in GDP in Q2. STFU
By getting rid of Donald Trump
Welcome to Trump’s 2nd term
Every Trump "deal" ever has been a failure, every business that produces a product or delivers a service. Only two "illusions", branding &amp; reality TV, haven't failed. You are the one with serious mental deterioration, not VP Biden.  But I don't feel sorry for you.
Not a big fan of semantics, but the media plays themselves better than Trump ever could.
This was yesterday when Trump went to Texas to talk about fracking
Why is Trump considering moving the election date. To be like Venezuela?
Funny teaching moment of the day. Little boy in my class asked our closer if they liked Donald Trump. Complete silence followed in the classroom as all 3 teachers tried to find a way to answer without creating a political debate. Oh, and I teach Pre-K.
Americans Still Want to Know Why Donald Trump Is Letting Us Die | Thom Hartmann
Straight ticket for democracy. No Trump, no racist, authoritarian swamp rat enablers who think truth doesn't matter.
My aunt's defending the witch doctor lady, on the same day Trump is asking to postpone the election, and that Herman Cain died of covid after attending the Tulsa rally with no protection. No wonder I'm messed up. Adults are fucking idiots.
It’s not even close, Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy. For the pandemic he’s tried to display calm but this appears to be panic over his failing reelection chances.
Slow your role, #DictatorTrump ... only Congress has that power
Responsibility for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis is primarily a state and local responsibility. Federal government provides expertise and resources. Trump didn’t blunder like Cuomo and cause literally thousands of unnecessary COVID-19 deaths.
Shocking. A trump buddy who lies.
Colorado  and yes voting for Trump ( in person at the polls)
Hi Ken, What are you doing about Trump not confronting Putin on Russian bounties on US troops in Afghanistan? Thanks, AT2(AW) OrtonThat's funny because Russian disinformation was used &amp; spread by Democrats &amp; NeverTrumpers to spy on the Trump campaign, undermine his Presidency, &amp; is still uses as the basis for the 'Russia is working for Trump' theory. HELLO!! Russian disinformation was used to HURT TRUMP.
No, he didn't apologize, he doubled down. Trump doesn't need to apologize as it is, because he's not racist. Joe Biden actually believes these racist things -- because he's always having to apologise for them, ie: admission of guilt.
Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban TikTok Before Trump Does!  via
Hillary won the popular vote by 2/3.5 million votes. It‘s the electoral college that chooses. And they came out saying they can choose anyone they want regardless. Which is how Trump won.
This shit right here should be illegal, I don't listen to his music and if I did I would stop after this. It's a damn shame the Trump campaign would use a person that suffers with mental health issues to help win their election, but I'm not shocked.
Trump has a habit of destroying something, then rebuilding it and expecting to get praised for doing so.
If you want to really learn about corruption in politics I have two words for you. Trump's inauguration.
I find it ironic that Fox pushes stories about CNBC ignoring Bill Clinton's (a FORMER SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties but ignores Trump's (a CURRENT SCUMBAG PRESIDENT) ties.
Trump will leave a shart stain.

Anyone that supports traitor Trump is a traitor to the nation. Your racism isn't patriotism, it's just simple evil.
Any doubts Trump is a racist?  Watch this...
Thanks  for doing what had never been done before that Trump is now taking credit for!!! 🤬🤬
Trump’s campaign isn’t even trying to hide it or lie about it this time.
Its Classic #Trump...taking credit for somebody else's work...and thinking nobody would notice...#Trump is still in Grade school.
Day 149: . shared on the air earlier today that 1,000 Americans per day are dying from #COVID19! What is the US President doing? Banning a social media app.    Globally:  Total cases:19,378,036 Deaths:721,324  US: Total cases: 4,941,755  Deaths:161,356
Trump is gaining ground on defeating our ability to Vote by Mail in November.  DeJoy has got to go!
Allan Lichtman has predicted every winner of every presidential election since 1984 - including Donald Trump's victory in 2016.   With the 2020 presidential election now less than three months away, he has weighed in on this year’s race.
Sorry lass but when I think of this country and the strain another four years of Trump will put it under, yeah he’s gotta go. But kudos to you for the emotional appeal 😉
Baby, if you think Trump gives a shit about you, well, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
Not remotely close.  We are all suffering from Trump induced anxiety and depression.  Exhausted.
Don't you get it people??? This is exactly what #Trump wants...People protest, No Masks, people get sick and die...Then whats Left are #Trumps anti-Christ White supremacy foot soldiers to do his bidding...#Trump wants to be a dictator so bad, he licks his Own Butt!!!
My #Covid-19 inebriated reality has become intertwined with our normal reality...but today's reality has become Surreal.... a  normal inebriated surreal reality??? Thanks #Trump Damn!!! I need a Drink!
#Trump failed at his job, blaming somebody else... I think I am going to sue #Trump for my vote back...I want to be able to vote twice in November...#Trump false advertised himself...
Griffin’s anti-mask efforts and social media postings have also prompted a judge in family court to take action against him just this past week.
Couy Griffin made national news recently after he made a video with “go back to Africa” comments while complaining about NFL players kneeling. He claims he’s not a racist.
Exactly! You can’t make me miss that administration, even by comparing them to Trump. Maybe their shit didn’t stink as much as Trumps; but it’s still smelly shit 💩
Don’t let it depend on his Veep pick. We have to defeat trump. Vote Biden and whomever he picks.
I'm not saying #JoeBiden is the answer, but anybody is infinitely better than #Trump...in fact I would vote for this Big Steaming Pile of Shit before EVER voting for #Trump again!!!...I'm Not Joking!!!
Trump is the leader of a cult. Where is the koolaid?
Trump has been caught lying 15000 times. Kinda like the 160k people he killed cause he lied about the virus. Do you like clean water? Would you like air like China? Good old trump has already begun
how can u say this is not a good president?  unemployment thru the new year  #TennesseeValleyAuthority CEo was getting 8 million a year, laid off everyone, made them train they (cheaper, foreign) replacements- trump was like, “hell no”   . 🌩️LoveU Sir
All you supporters talk as if #Trump likes you or something...#Trump only cares about #Trump not even the people he swore to protect..everything he does is for show...If its about the country #Trump could care less about it...That's it...
A standard #Trump progression: I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it, but I could do it. I did do it, so what? I did do it, and it was right to do it.
#UncleMikeClassic "Hey Margie, you voted for #Trump"??? "Yes dear, I certainly did" "Hey Margie..."?? "Yes Dear..."? "Go Phuck yourself..."!!!
Why is Matt Struck using this account to constantly harass journalists?   Why did the founder of Cowboys for Trump have to return taxpayer funds to Otero County after he took a trip to Washington DC?

Yup, about right...Go ahead and follow #Trump
I get that Trump helped him out so he had to return the favor but I don’t know anybody that orders Pad Thigh or has visited Thighland.
So it feels like this sums up twitter in a nutshell.  I could be wrong. Still new and not fully certain how to use it.  But for those of us who are generally moderate (honestly these days that's anti-Trump) and avoid extremism/inflexible aka unempathic stuff + non-celebs

GOP women warn of eroding support among female voters amid a ‘gender chasm’
New Trump Exec Order allowing women to vote. He is the greatest president of all time. Now if he could only end prohibition.
I don't understand why all these men refuse to speak up? What and who are they so afraid of?  Losing their jobs? You would think DeSantis and Trump were Mafia godfathers. "No position to balk the governor?" They are in exactly the RIGHT position to tell the truth!
Right? I mean, these Trump rally’s are out of control!
I still think every Trump/Putin phone call is about trump tower Moscow. Putin just gets him on the phone and is like “I really think we’re close to doing this deal this time, I really do” like he has for 30yrs and that’s all trump cares about so that’s all they talk about
Trump wants to shut down TikTok because the users claim they banded together and gobbled up all the tickets to his rally in Tulsa that almost nobody showed up for. He wants to stufle anybody that disagrees with him he wants to shut up....like twitter, Facebook, CNN &amp; Fox News.
You guys never stop with your bullshit.  It won’t work. Joe has my vote ! I also saw Joe shake Trump’s hand, I’m not holding that against him either.
you guys do not choose Susan Rice, you'll hear nothing but Bengazi and her son is a Trump supporter! Kick yourself in the chin why don't you.
Has to be all the H1-B visa holders lashing out because Trump is going to get their asses canned.
Repubs have always wanted to gut our "entitlement programs". Trump is their useful idiot. Make it seem like it's a win buy telling people you'll have more money in your pockets never saying a thing how it will negatively impact seniors &amp; is of no benefit to people who have no job
I actually heard Republicans that are going to vote Biden say if Whitmere is VP they'll go back to trump.
If you choose to not vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump. Don't ever call yourself a never Trumper either. People like you are why we are in this mess. Think of the people who are being harmed by Trump’s policies &amp; actions. Think of the seniors who rely on SS &amp; Medicare.
Vermin of Walmart for tRump
I'm shocked to there any parents left who aren't outraged at Trump and the federal government for fucking up the COVID response and ruining the Fall Semester for millions of children.
Can’t face palm hard enough. Jeez   To a white, *almost* middle aged man suburbanite in the “heartland” the Trump years have been...enlightening in some respects
I'm in Denver. I see 4 Trump signs for every 1 Biden sign
Trump~instead of making us great, he’s made us ineffable
I hate Trump. He is a compulsive liar
A lot of funny observations tonight about trump &amp; ACA.   Stay focused. They’re a bunch of traitorous thieves waving a shiny object while they rip you off.
Schumer now gives his blessing that schools should open? Trump has been saying this for MONTHS! Now who is wrong As Always? Vote these bastards out! PERIOD!
Narcissists are going love other Narcissists like Trump. He is the only one that doesnt make them realize their dysfunction.
I don’t throw this word around, and I really don’t like saying it, but I HATE Trump with every fibre of my being. Every. Single. One.
President Trump signing a major executive order, for health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions! Why didn’t President Obama think of that? Oh wait, it’s already in the affordable care act!
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wow...1984 a bit late: just in time for 2024? Police state rising unless we can dislodge Trump et al from the WH!!😡😡😡
trump tells you what to think, say, and do. And like all cult members you do exactly what he wants.
News flash. That’s already covered under the affordable care act. As usual, Obama got there before Trump.
Trump makes promise to unilaterally: -Implement payroll tax holiday until end of the year -Defer student loan payments indefinitely -Extend unemployment benefits until of the year.  -Extend moratorium on evictions  But no specifics &amp; unlikely he can do all this legally.
This time next year Donald Trump could be sitting in jail
That’s also not a law, but an executive order, so he can rescind it at any time... Related: payroll tax cuts will be later used as a pretext to cut SS and Medicare benefits. Oh - and Kanye has sold out to Trump...
That’s a pretty old clipping you’ve got there. Do you really want to go tit for tat between Biden and Trump? Why didn’t Trump attention the memorial for John Lewis? Why does Trump inspire nazis to march in the streets with torches?
Obamacare was a scam. They made it with Blackfoot deals with big pharmaceutical and insurance lobbyists. Trump’s making sure the good part is kept, something they could have done without the scam but didn’t.
Trump Is Not Well #TrumpIsNotWell
Are you dumb axios or do you not realize Obamacare is a failure, leaving more still uninsured than it covers while jacking up costs? It needs to be repealed but Trump is keeping one of the only good things from it.
Anti-maskers explain themselves #antimaskers  via
It's hard to believe that even Trump's most fervent base could believe the avalanche of unfulfilled promises that have come from this man's speeches.
I’m not even a Trump fan, but Jesus Christ. Has it occurred to anyone that not all plans cover pre-existing conditions and the media claims he wants to take what coverage there is away 24/7? Of course not. Maybe he felt the need to put an end to that lie.
The way to protect Obama’s policy gains was always to get Trump to think he created them, and the plan is working perfectly.
How many lost due to your mishandling of the tRump virus???
I love that Trump called out the Dems especially Nervous Nancy on the relief package. It is amazing that these Liberats are starting to go a little right cause they know they are in deep trouble come Nov. Where is Hunter? Just saying. We will not see any debates, or a VP pick.
The framers were unanimous that Congress, as the representatives of the people, should be in control of public funds—not the President or executive branch agencies.  IM SCREAMING THAT TRUMP MIGHT USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PASS STIMULUS FUNDS. AND NO ONE IS TELLING HIM ITS ILLEGAL
Republicans and Trump's administration are always asking for bailouts for corporations and what can help line their pockets, instead of making actuals incentives for the normal people.
Prove it. (Kinda like you CLAIMED you had proof on Trump Russia “collusion”) You are a liar and a disgrace. #resign
Your daily reminder that the polls are wrong because his supposed naysayers aren’t being truthful and will flinch and vote Trump on Election Day.  #mediawhore
I attribute to my having grown up in Alabama the fact that I believe what your friend asserts. Trump's supporters believe he hates who they hate. They can count on him to treat badly those whom they hate. If I am butting in here, I apologize for my rudeness; sorry.
Breaking News: Trump just announced his Health Care Plan.
Foreign powers meddling in our elections yet again. Cue radio silence from trump
Typical trump, create a crisis that only HE can solve
I also appreciate the juxtaposition of actual footage of migrants forced back into Mexico to wait to ask for asylum under the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") and Trump's lies about how they are bad people who look like they should be in the UFC.
I don’t agree with everything. Guns should be illegal and God has no place in politics. But it’s anyone but Trump. Voting any different will only help Trump.
Because trump says they’re immune!!
Trump is a bot
I can’t wait to see what authority Trump thinks he has that would let him unilaterally order insurance companies to cover preexistig conditions. You know, if Congress hadn’t already done it a decade ago.
Trump says Asians 'understand exactly' why he uses racist terms for coronavirus
It’s all we have. He sucks, but he’s not Trump. Hence the “anyone but Trump!” movement.
Joe Arpaio, who also ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, not long after President Trump pardoned his criminal conviction for disobeying a judge’s order, has been narrowly defeated in his bid to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix.
Because god loves liars, cheaters, corrupt criminals, rascist, creeps like Donald Trump. Horrible
Thank God     are NOT the elite. Trump came INTO office rich, the others LEAVE office rich. Stop being divided by media. Remember CNN said it would kill you until they DIDN’T.
If tell them to fuck off! That’s what the spineless republicans and Trump did. Who gives a shit!!!

Pre-existing conditions are CURRENTLY covered. Trump is suing to END pre-existing conditions. But you know that - you’re just counting on Trump’s base to be ignorant of that fact.
Now onto refugees, and it's painful to hear their stories and to know what the Trump administration has done to refugee resettlement and the asylum process.  This is one of the major examples of why "'both parties are equally bad" is just such bs.
#BreakingNews Trump planning to sign executive order to requiring employers and employees to pay into a retirement fund for retirees, he is going to call it "social security"
Trump is sneaky with his words...”covering pre-existing conditions” is not the same thing as “affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions”.   Lets see if that EO states limits on how much more insurance companies can raise premiums for pre-existing condition coverage.
Welcome to Nazi America a la Trump!👹
I feel their pain if they feel bad about voting for tRUMP in 2016. We have one chance to make it right again in November. We can do it if we flood the gates. tRUMP must go
Trump taking credit for what Obama already did years ago. He's done that his whole life. Taking credit for other people's work. You people are pathetic.
Are you saying trump is involved too?
So what you are admitting is the Donald Trump does not know what the current law is.  At least you admit it.
If he grows a crap beard, you just know he's been sleeping over at Trump Tower more than is probably appropriate.
Breathe deep.... calm down... now say it....Trump 2020!!!
no, Trump cares only about himself.
What are you doing Joe? Are you waiting till Nov 3rd and say whew I dodged a bullet, now I can retire lol. Move over red rover and let Trump take over. throw the white flag already. How many weeks does it take to pick a running mate. What are the DNC waiting for? Just saying.
Growing up queer in South Carolina, but more recently my partner was attacked by a Trump supporter over an innocent Maltese dog
It's called the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and it's been the law for ten years. Six weeks ago the Trump Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court trying to strip Americans of pre-existing protections under Obamacare. This. is. lying.
Literally trump has been saying they should open, the Republicans have been saying that, too. The democrats just said it TODAY after mocking the republicans.
my dream, lady liberty in poor shape trying to protect the people and Trump ripping her clothing to cover the Covid victims to play golf on top. I am going to need PTSD therapy after he is is gone. Illustrators anyone?
Also, if Biden wins (regardless of Trump actually leaving or not, and hopefully he does), we owe a big thanks to... who?  BLACK WOMEN - the most consistent bloc of voters the Dems have. Now's our chance to do right by them.
In #Colorado Kayne West is to be on the ballot for president. The #Republicans fought for this!  Fuck Trump!  He must go we can’t have another 4 yrs of this shit.
So Trump issued an executive order today that puts a stop to...himself?  #TrumpLandslide2020 my ass.
If it wasn’t seeing kids in cages or seeking bribes from a foreign gov, was it the repeated suggestion that the coronavirus would take care of itself? If it wasn’t Trump’s defense of white nationalists in Charlottesville, was it when he suggested we postpone election in a tweet?

In other words Trump just lied as usual.
Anyone w/even minimal intelligence can see that everything Trump says is really a projection of what he himself says or does. His brain is so small he can't come up with anything else plus it's all he knows. #PeaBrain #TrumpVirus
I agree with that whole heartedly. Appointing people to run the government is the most important job the president does. Even that job Trump has corrupted by surrounding himself with unqualified synchophants.
If only the poor ppl of this country knew how the system works against them when a Republican like tRUMP is in the W.H., he wouldn't be President right now. A lot of them voted against their own interests in 2016.
Ooh. I'm crushed. Your eloquent defense of Trump and your witty takedown of my comments is brilliant. Just brilliant. I shall change my mind immediately.  Feeling a bit triggered, there, snowflake?
No. I think Russia, China, and the Saudis and Trump against Biden

I'm a christian and did not vote for Trump morals, integrity and common sense are valuable to me. He doesn't hold any of the values of Christianity and is not humble or a believer in God, Jesus, repentance or the bible.

Trump and McConnell. They both need to go. McConnell has been in office since 84! Let’s make a change.
But people have known for years he's been skimming.  Why is it suddenly an issue. This could backfire. Trump needs something to spark his base. They've always been afraid we're after their guns. This might be the thing they need to get ignited.
It directly tracks my own thinking on this.

So did Trump, tool.
So who pays for security?  ? Trump campaign? US taxpayers?
If Biden wins then don't cry to me about what used to be America cause I will not listen. All our rights and history would be removed and I will be better off moving out of the country. But of course that won't happen. Trump landslide and we can breathe a lot easier.
This has never been done before *checks notes* unless you count ACA, while Trump has been supporting the GOP push to repeal this for the last 3.5 years.
Hating trump is easy. Admitting you contributed to genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan is hard. Most new allies fail that second test.

The difference between Trump &amp; Jose (since apparently Joe is now part Latino), is that Jose takes a knee &amp; Trump stands tall.  Taking a knee is a slave mentality.  The men who liberated the slaves never took a knee.  Kneel for God, but not any man.  Biden is an awkward skintag.
But it makes him look like he cares (which he doesn't). Mnuchin and Meadows set this up, they didn't negotiate in good faith. This was planned all along to make Trump look good.. Who is going to sue to stop this, which members of Congress won't vote to fund this? Good PR for DJT.
The WHPC is neutered and all they care about is access and a future book deal about "my time in the WHPC during the Trump presidency."
On July 19th, Trump promised a health care plan would be released in two weeks.  Today, 5 days late, he announces he’s going to issue an executive order that does something that Congress already did 10 years ago, and that his lawyers are in court tying to dismantle.  Idiocracy.

Why didn't the press walk out on Trump's obviously orchestrated "press conference?" Why are they sitting there allowing them to be humiliated with cameras rolling? Is there a purpose to this? Are we going to learn anything that we don't already know about Trump?
So the unemployed will get a check from a trump executive order, but us Americans who have either took a pay cut or changed jobs to a lower salary won't get help. On top of that we're still getting taxed...you Democrats have no soul and you just lost the election with this.
The huckster can't lose.... if Dems don't sign he blames them,if they do sign,  its a win for Trump. This thing is fixed 6 ways to hell.
Trump’s best day ever.
Is this the new plan? Trump is gonna issue EOs for things that have already happened, then try to take credit?   Easier than work, I guess.
Ya Obamacare already covers preexisting conditions, Libs are jumping all over this. BUT, when was the last time a Republican President Extended/wanted to expand, healthcare in this country? Maybe Trump'll see he needs to go further. Biden wont consider anything beyond statusquo.
Wait I have questions: can Trump do all this via executive order? If so, how sad is it that  can't get this done?
There is no exception for political activity and peaceful protest, and Trump is a fucking fascist fluffing his ego in front of the only people he thinks matter.
You missed the point!  I wasn’t expecting a Trump rally and some of us need answers about our lives when it comes to unemployment extension.  Another sleepless night while the media gets stuck with their dicks in their hands again.
Then why did Trump correct himself the second time he said it?
JUST IN: President Donald Trump said during a last-minute news conference Friday that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Trump was really my first major awareness of wealthy white trailer trash and his deplorables have just amplified its existence.  Money doesn't buy class.
Trump taking credit for something someone else did. Again.
While the POTUS goes golfing, &amp; is attempting to ban TikTok, the US once again recorded 2000 deaths in a single day. The most since May. Trump &amp; Republicans have royally screwed the pooch on this pandemic and their response (or lack there of). Fuck them &amp; their pro-life bullshit.

Our suffering for Trump’s failures is just beginning. We have sacrificed half a year, $3 trillion of our treasure and 157,000 lives — and it has been squandered by one man’s incompetence.
Every message Biden makes, which are few, is followed up by some kind of explanation or apology. Trash what Trump says all you want, but at least he backs his words with actions and not apologies.   Same can't be said for Biden who only backs everything he says with excuses.

Trump, who calls people is African American, should shut up. He has shoved America deep into violent asnd troubling racism. The news needs to still focus on that. Call Joe out and let answer. We all know he is a good man, older generation. For God's sake, alternative is Trump.

There are just SO many MORE IMPORTANT THINGS in the world today; if that's what their bitch is, they deserve another four years of Trump!
Trump is claiming that he is going to require coverage of pre-existing conditions.   Which is a basic tenet of the ACA.  IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IT IS CURRENTLY THE LAW.  He's just taking credit for something Obama did, again. That is really pathetic.
When Trump speaks people listen, when Biden speaks, I go what did he just say? I would call my wife in to watch cause she speaks 5 different languages. I ask her to interpret this. She has no idea what Biden said. LOL. Just saying.
Can he play RW with Krejci? Because there are no living people who can figure it out.
Just once, I wish I could observe the world thru Trump's rose-colored glasses. Oh, wait: That's the problem! He can't see crap because he's not wearing any!
PRESIDENT DONALD FUCKING TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Biden would face the same lack of acceptance Trump did. He will cry or quit
That already exists, under the ACA. Which, so far, is still in force despite Trump's attempts to get rid of it and replace it with...nothing.  Just another thing that Trump the Failure is trying to take credit for. IT ALREADY EXISTS.
Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED.
Trump said this immediately after being a jerk to a reporter out for not mentioning Iran-in the SAME REPORT. But for *this* question he hasn’t seen it? All roads lead to Putin....

I’m not sure if Trump understands ethics or constitutional law in its fullest
Contradicting the intelligence community’s assessment, the president said, “The last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump.”  Pressed on the matter, he said: “I don’t care what anybody says”
Never mind Trump increased the defense budget by 10% and they still want more borrowed money!
You can repeat this daily but that doesn’t make it true. 64 million tests performed, 32K% increase in testing since 3/12, and never before seen progress in vaccines. Sorry but your campaign strategy to destroy Trump by lying about COVID is WEAK!!!

Having failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump will now create Obamacare by executive order.
It is the Trump virus here in the US.This is it in a nutshell and it’s shameful!
I feel like this is needed because Trump seems to think that he can make promises and decisions without Congress
So, you are saying that Trump is everything his base despises? That he's a part of the costal elite that MAGATs blame for every bad thing in America?
So, in other words you are saying Trump is one of the costal elites that his base has blamed for everything wrong in their lives?
The reality is the only reason the “Never Trump Republicans” are a thing is because they are soft and don’t like his rhetoric.

Maybe Trump can just stream it from his Spotify account.  Then he owns the rights to the use.
I voted the first time in 1984, when I turned 18. I was so proud to be an adult and get to do that, and I've voted in every election since. I'm not sure it's generational; I think some people are just cynical or lazy, and not voting is some sort of rebellion. Trump is the result.
I think JB will do better than most are probably expecting (mainly because the bar is so low). For all the talk about Trump eating him alive, the reality is that in a moderator-controlled debate, it doesn't really work that way. Very little direct dialogue between the candidates.

The problem is that (contrary to popular opinion) there's really only one way to even begin to put a dent in the debt, and that's entitlement reform (which is very politically unpopular). The Dems have fought it for years, and the GOP stopped trying when Trump was elected.
This really is annoying. Republicans (rightly) assailed Obama and the Dems on debt-spending for 8 long years. Then, the second Trump won, they abandoned the issue and actually outpaced Obama's spending. 4 years of silence, and now they suddenly care about the debt again? Please.

There are no massive, or even noticeable, problems with mail-in voting. None. Several dates have been doing it for years, and even trump votes by mail. Stop spouting nonsense.
Selling out for Trump is a lucrative venture, which includes solidifying your position at a place like Fox.
Funny stuff. Melissa has proven time after time that she'll say practicality anything to run interference for Trump, which is disappointing because she was once a voice of reason.
Right after Trump and the Republican party.
are Trump supporters. That leaves a pretty large remainder. Also, given that Trump support is negatively correlated with education, you also eliminate a lot of dumb people by excluding Trump supporters. So it’s a pretty good litmus test.
Let’s do the math. Roughly 26% of registered voters voted for Trump. About 2/3 of that 26% were men, so we’ll say approximately 17% of registered male voters voted for him. Assuming political preference is fairly constant through the populace, that means that 17% of American men

Secret Trump Voter licks boots and kicks puppies????  Phrased as a question, it's completely valid.
I think every God fearing, red white and blue blooded, Trump supporter should boycott the election and refuse to vote until December.  Own the libs! Stay out of the election.  Besides, there's extra 5g near those voting sites....
Quick: someone tell Mike Donald Trump once said, “Nice game, Mike” as he walked off the court at the Garden. 😏
We need to vote Trump out. Affordable housing is too important, and he just undermined that effort in a pathetic attempt to win suburban votes.
Lmfao, have you not seen Biden touching multiple children inappropriately??
Biden and Harris can’t hide forever!!
Thanks to Biden and Obama
Wisconsin is an important swing state that has shown recent support for Biden in the polls. Not surprising at all...

Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!

Can’t wait to see you on January 20th, 2021. Looking forward to seeing you get forced out of the White House to make room for President Biden and Vice President Harris!
I think this ad makes Biden look even better. He’s actually working for the American people. You’re probably on the train with Stormy Daniels while America dies from COVID.
Look, Biden has already addressed his issues with inappropriate touching, so let's not start in with the whole "thigh land" thing again...  Yes, he didn't apologize or DO anything remotely like ACTUALLY addressing it, but... I mean, there were fragments of... he didn't...  *sigh*
Need I even bring up that Trump supporters are more likely than Biden or Bernie supporters to have dropped out of highschool or not have a college degree??? No?? Ok😌
If we settle for Biden and get justice for the POC lives lost to police brutality - get this - the riots would end😃
Your solution to Biden's VP problem would have been Tulsi. Literally the only area where her thoughts vary from Trump's is that she'd nationalise every business with more than 35 employees. Her foreign policy would, if anything, be MORE isolationist.

Joe Biden was introduced to Harris by his son Hunter what does that tell you 😳
Probably not unemployed. I'd put money on it she won't give up her Senate seat unless Biden wins.
They don’t mind Trump’s ethics at all. Biden makes them liars and hypocrites on every single point they’ve criticized Trump on.  They object to the aesthetics of Covfve. The bits where they talk about ethics are pretexts that disguise that.
The Steffan Tubbs Show is at News/Talk 710KNUS. Aurora ·  After careful debate (none) we've decided it'll be known as the "Harris/Biden" ticket on the program..
Voting for Biden and stumping for him on Twitter *is* being a Biden Bro. That bit where you’re saying “Oh, but in my HEART I’m doing this WITH RESERVATIONS”?  Doesn’t matter, because it has no effect on the wotld around you. It’s just a way to blame your own cowardice on others.
I oppose fracking as well. So, good news! Thanks for making sure that I vote against you, while voting for Biden/Kamala.
Definitely possible. The other explanation is that Tobin feels that Biden shouldn't just BE excommunicated (likely for being pro-choice), but actually already IS.
Woot woot!!! So excited for this Biden/ Harris ticket. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #RidinWithBiden
They're still convinced that Biden will forestall armed revolution while the thought of Trump running the country for at least four more years will force it before 20 Jan. They don't take into account the Trumpstapo can ALREADY stymie all armed revolution, just like in Germany.
I will remind you again that I am a woman who lives in the suburbs and I am voting for Biden /Harris. I welcome affordable housing. #BidenHarris2020
The comical thing is that they are running with the attack that Biden and Harris are “far left liberals” (which is how they would have attacked any ticket).  If they truly think Biden is “far left” (which they don’t...just scare tactics) - whooo boy.
Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!
And yet he endorses a candidate who’s made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren’t deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?
But hey, way to once again avoid saying anything positive at all about Biden.   I mean, since there’s literally nothing good to say about him, you go straight for sneering at what you think my “real motivations are.”  True to form for Biden Bros: go straight gor the ad hominem.
Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they’ve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he’s substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That’s an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.
Biden/Harris 2020!! I love it!!!!
Welp, no surprise on the Biden front today. The entirety of his policy positions for fifty years has been MORE COPS.
Biden sniffed.....sorry,  I meant picked, Harris for Running Mate.  Excuse the expression.
I swear to god Joe Biden is gonna drop dead from being a wrinkly old fuck within 3 months of being inaugurated, and then we'll be stuck with the cop nobody wanted to begin with
Is Biden too sleepy to do it?
how I'm sleeping knowing that Biden lost my vote for picking Harris as VP
kamala harris is a cop and joe biden is a pedophile. but do you really want the homophobic and the racist rapist in office instead? no. vote blue.
People really think Biden boutta win the election
Shortly after the news broke, President Trump posted a video ad on Twitter attacking Harris as a "phony" and Biden as "not that smart" for picking her.
Musing:  An interesting choice!  She's young which could take some of the load off of Biden because she could do travels and political things he may not have the energy to do!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP. Are you as surprised as him when he found out? Kamala Harris 'identifies' as African American and considers her experience to be American even tho her mother is from India, and her father is from Jamaica.
Representative - did you hear one of her (Kamala Harris) accounts had unfollowed the Bidens' campaign account yesterday?  Plus to some young people if she was chosen, Biden may not get their support bc Kamala has done some questionable actions while an attorney in Cali.
You have to vote against Trump.   This is not about getting Biden elected it is about getting Trump out.  Foolish emotional responses are not necessary
Biden is a puppet for Clinton and Obama
By October 1 latest, Biden should announce his entire cabinet and the next 100 high-level appointments (major ambassadors, 2nd-level cabinet, etc.) as well as provide his detailed plan to clean out Trump's mess: ID and remove appointments, reverse EOs, and rebuild ally relations.
If you really care about the environment and sustainability and green energy you should vote for Biden. Anything else is a vote for trump. I suspect you know this and are an attention seeker.
I am Biden all the way, even if he picks an ear of corn ❤️
But NO.  Its wrong. Its not about who's doing it, its about the unprecedented and dangerous expansion of executive  power that it represents. I hope that Biden doesn't do the same thing, regardless of whether I'd agree with the outcome.
I mean, Biden Bros couldn’t debunk their way out of a creationist science fest, but there you have it.
Read something other than what CNN feeds you... Trump has done more for the black community than Obama/Biden even considered. How is Trump killing all these people? Specific examples please.
Sup? Shes my pick for VP. There’s nobody better to tackle the current race relations and criminal justice reform. I like that she pushed back on Biden in the debates but supports him when she agrees. Trying not to get my hopes up too much though.
Which is why a bunch of elderly, comparatively rich people would rather shove  down your throat like Joe Biden accidentally left alone with an intern then they would actually fight for the values that The Democrats used to pretend they stand for.
I really don’t understand their point of view. They want more socialist policies but don’t realize the Biden is a lot closer than Trump in this direction. I feel like they don’t realize what they want and how to dissect a political agenda.
Also, don’t get me wrong, your tweet a week or so ago about Biden’s ‘94 crime law resonated with me. When it comes to race relations they both have an abysmal record. I believe Biden is a step in the right direction but also don’t blame you if you disagree.
It was difficult for me to go to grad school because I was already in too much debt. Trump wants to eliminate subsidized loans and public service debt forgiveness making it harder on undergrad. The 15k from Biden would go a long way for undergrad, if it goes through.
I think Biden is a step in the right direction. His plan helps the middle class students more than Trump. I think his platform on education will make it easier for another politician along the lines of Bernie to take it even further.
If you’re serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don’t think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.

Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
🙄  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion “one president at a time.” Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You’re irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT

I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low

By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.

International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

#BidenHarrisLandslide2020    tweet 2 4) a VP who is left of the progressive squad (AOC, Omar, etc) which means she is w Bernie Sanders, green new deal, socialism/marxism 4) a VP who called Biden a racist at the Dem primary debates yet magically has decided he's now ok No thanks!
A lot of Biden signs nearby. #RidenWithBiden
Unless joe Biden becomes president, than everything goes back to normal within 24 hours....wack
This photo is such a simple yet profound demonstration of the difference between Trump and Biden.  Trump talk goes no where and just fills the air with BS. Biden supports his words with measurable actions.
Biden: I'm going to beat Joe Biden 🤣😂  via
The man has golfed 132 times since taking office...he has lied  every day he has been in office. His lack of understanding of anything is staggering.I am truly sorry you cannot see that.  Biden will be the easiest vote I have ever made. He will restore on place on the world stage
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
He is like a gnat swarming ...  Biden will just wave him away.
Thinly veiled attempt to drag Biden down to Trump’s level.  Not gonna chase that ball...
Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That’s the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.
This is Trumps America.  He should resign and leave the clean up to Biden and Harris.  They are adults.
Im so proud of Joe Biden’s  choice of  Kamala Harris for Vp
More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.
...that's a list of polls showing Biden competitive in Iowa.
They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.
Unless Biden offers something big and international, I would rather stay in El Paso and not relocate my family.
I’m with China!    There So smart!  They use Big Words!     Go Biden.         Winning
Does anyone see a problem with the United States post office backing Biden???
Nicely done!  Loved when you pointed out she's on Joe Biden's ticket, not Bernie Sanders!!
No matter what the lying  comes up with from now to November, vote Biden/Harris. Just remember, Trump is a liar and a con man. That is all you need to remember! 🇺🇸
My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.
"They seem to be able to supercharge him [Biden] for 30 to 60 seconds at a time." -  Dark Journalist
That’s why I won’t vote for Biden!!
Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.
Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.
Whats the Biden Bungle? Please explain?
cringe !   DNC so powerful &amp; corrupt BIDEN molests girls on VIDEO!  ON video BRAGS &amp; LAUGHS about his corrupt extortion of UKRAINE forced firing of Ukraine offical for (investigating JOE BIDEN) with taxpayers money!  DNC always above laws we must jump to daily &amp; pay for
Did you read the OP... Biden explicitly said "that all governors should mandate wearing masks." So where are you getting this Federalism bit?
Kamala Harris joined Joe Biden’s ticket.  I slept well two nights following that announcement.
should SUE BLM DNC ACTION to repair rebuild 170 cities got billions in extortion checks from corporations forced to pay mob extortion so DNC BLM FASCISTS would not burn loot murder! dont use taxpayer money to rebuild like BIDEN BUILD BACK BETTER! DNC BLM facists must pay billions
...trump is 74, no spring chicken. biden is 77.   biden looked pretty locked on the other night, unlike the latest ramblings from 45.
Well, I’m talking about both Dems as the party leadership, and also those who voted for Biden in the primary.  I said during the Primary that if Biden were nominated I would vote for him (unless he supported key policies, which he continues to oppose).
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.
I want intelligence back in Washington.  Replace dumb and stupid with Biden and Harris!
And that’s why I’m not going to debate why I won’t vote for Biden/Harris with DuVernay.  Now YOU are another matter…
I prefer "President Elect Joe Biden".
Just watched you with Peebles.  Why are you subtly trying to question Biden’s mental competence?  So unfair without doing the same with Trump.  Please be more fair.  Geez.  Do you seriously want 4 more years of this ? Don’t be selflsh.  Be honest !
Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻
For each question you ask Biden, you get ask Trump one. That’s it.
Yeah yeah if I did anything that anything like the Biden’s, they would throw me into a hole
Biden will win. Hope you get better
You throw mud at Trump to seeehat sticks. Problem? Biden is all mud
So you are attacking Biden after you recently tweeted that they only attack you if you are winning. So which one is it?

The MOMENT anyone tells me I have to vote for Biden/Harris is the MOMENT I stop listening to them. AOC, Angela Davis, Noam Chomsjy—This is the MOMENT when I turn away from you and listen to more principled voices.
Biden isn't accused of 'groping' anyone.  Trump supporters decided that the 25 allegations of sexual assault, racism, incompetence, and worst economic disaster in history isn't a deal breaker.
My guess is that Biden will get approximately 600,000 votes from Postal workers. I bet Trump didn’t think about that.... #TrumpEvictions #PostmasterGeneral #PostalWorkers #SupportUSPS #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
They had to allow bloomberg to run, so it would make biden seem more reasonable.
The 1st comedy movie in theaters after the plandemic should be all the Liberal hype and tears leading up to the election: 2016 tears, faux outrage over Stormy Daniels and gushing over Avanatti, Kavanaugh win, impeachment failure, Biden gaffes (edited for time), 2020 Liberal tears
I don’t know how to say this but your late to the party, we already know this but I’m ready to see Trump in an orange jumpsuit. And ready to push Biden hard. We need to keep up the energy and direct it to the Democratic Party once we flip this shit.
How about Vice President Biden?
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.
Trump trying to interfere in voting and Biden told us the truth
Demonstrated #medialiteracy proficiency must be required to graduate high school and be admitted to college and the military.
Yes - let’s all ‘account’ Trump the hell out of office so we can get back to the business of being the greatest country to ever have existed. On Nov 3, the Trump train gets derailed by the Biden Bulldozers.

Problem is, they are just questions he doesn’t like. And he’s not obligated. Just like Biden. However, they both should just answer the question.
Retreated to the high mountains for four days of internet-free solitude. Returned to Colorado wildfires, something awful re the USPS, and Chrissy Teigen’s baby bump. But news of Biden’s VP pic? Elusive. Had literally to sift through Google results for any sort of hope.🤷🏽‍♀️
This is why you want Biden/Harris elected, you will (imo) get a DOJ who will actually focus on Police brutality and reform instead of “racism” against white/Asians at Yale. I just cannot believe DOJ wasted two year of tax payer dollars on this
I would take and will vote for Biden/Harris over this corruption that you &amp; your cheater in chief have brought with killing all of the people, hate, evil &amp; who knows how many more of us you are going to kill! You have blood on your hands too Marco all republicans are.
This may seem shocking pilgrims but in many matters of foreign policy, being against Trump is not always in your best interest for you nor would it be for a Biden administration.
He echoes Jared Kushner, calling the deal a “historic step” 4 peace in the Mideast. He praises the "bravery" &amp; "statesmanship” of the Arab despot.   Welcome to Biden’s Middle East Policy which will look similar to Trump's policy in 2 critical areas that plague the region...
Biden has called Trump, America’s first racist president.   When this racist US president, orchestrates a deal between a neo-fascist Israeli leader &amp; an Arab despot (that ignores basic Palestinians rights) – how does Biden respond? ....
To be fair, I turned off my Biden texts for that same reason Anand says: asking only for donations on a daily basis isn’t what I want. Give me stories, talking points, action items too.
Joe Biden would be a fool to reject a continuation of an arms embargo against the rat like Iranian regime.
I don't see how he can debate. The Biden team will surely think of some confrontations that are new and unexpected.
Why not move on to being pissed off about Biden's VP pick? The sociopath who laughs about locking up children over homework? The one who never went after billionaires Now takes $$$ from Israel? How many liberals are going to vote for her? Trump might win a 2nd term w/ cheating
Reason # I lost count, to not vote for Biden
I’m not sure why you feel that way.  Biden has moved left since winning the nomination, endorsing the Green New Deal, for one.
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
We will know. It will be Joe Biden
You don't know about Harris' record in California? Locking up poor POC and never going after billionaires?  Biden/Harris won't be any better than Trump. On the contrary, it will put sociopath Harris in power for 8-12 years.
Biden (to black interviewer): “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black!”  Biden (re busing): “unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle...”  There’s plenty more

They're loosing early this year because the know Biden can't win.
They aren't excited to vote for Biden, they're excited to vote against Trump
To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump

Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it’ll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden’s sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I buy that there’s an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don’t think it’s unique to Utah. It’s entirely possible that after Alaska, there’s a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Actually Biden would need a 30 pt lead in polls
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I’m “crimson and clover “
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.

We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
Did you endorse biden yet?
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden 😆
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let’s see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.

While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!

If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴

Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmaoBiden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
Same goes for Biden.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!
For #2, just go to Biden War Room. It has complete voting info for every state.
Biden isn’t a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
Does  pivot and start yelling about deficits the minute Joe Biden is sworn in?
President a Trump loves our country &amp; this is one example.  Joe Biden in 47 yrs made himself &amp; his family wealthy by ripping off the country.  The choice to lead the country is obvious.
I am still not a fan, but will vote for Biden no matter what.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband’s is... #twocents
Yeah yeah if I did anything that anything like the Biden’s, they would throw me into a hole
You throw mud at Trump to seeehat sticks. Problem? Biden is all mud
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!

They’re just Biden time
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
Biden is a pedophile
If Joe Biden was a Republican he would have been selling insurance by 1975.  This is presidential material??
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
Nope.  Trumpism must be crushed, destroyed.  I am excited about Harris. I have confidence in Biden but it means nothing of Trump and his ilk are defeated in a devastating way
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
Joe Biden if his debates are good
The context in which Biden uses the N-Word twice can’t be denied - it’s very degrading.  Curious if Obama ever saw this.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
I enjoy that Presidential campaigns are turning into meme offs. Biden needs to step it up.
I’m writing Biden/Harris postcards this weekend.  Will they make it?    Or will they end up in the dead letter office?    The Post Office Is Deactivating Mail Sorting Machines Ahead of the Election - VICE
I’m already sick of Harris. She lies more than Biden &amp; Pelosi.
The Biden/Harris federal mandate to wear a mask, sounds a lot like the dictator from Bananas: Everyone must now wear their underwear, on the OUTSIDE!
Wait, so Biden working hard to make progress while Trump just sits and does nothing? I thought he was "Sleepy Joe?" I'm confused.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
Listen to this guy and that man in the White House and then listen to Biden/Harris. Ridiculous points and name calling vs policies, details, and intelligent talking points. Also, complete coherent sentences.
Trump doesn't seem to understand that Biden is a private citizen and has no authority to do anything about the virus. This is what Trump does - projects his own failures onto other people.
Actually that seems like reverse thinking. Both of these men, when playing off the script and carried live, remind the other side how bad they are. At any given moment, it looks like Biden is about to have a stroke
What if the governors all started listening to Biden now? Acting like he's president...
You &amp; Biden will stop a recovering economy with raising taxes &amp; regulatory enhancements, Universal Healthcare &amp; all the other spending you want. We are energy independent finally &amp; you’ll destroy oil/gas industry. ObamaBiden  had the slowest economic recivery in history🥵
I love opening the Fox News app and seeing a nice story about Biden above any story about trump!!  #BidenHarris2020  #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpVirusDeathToll167K #TrumpVirus
Donald Trump is playing political games with the postal service: deliberately slowing down mail service for prescriptions, small businesses, and to interfere with voting. We must end these attacks on the USPS and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
I hope the next Democrat after Biden (don't have much faith that guy is going to do much of anything) that gets in takes the Trump playbook, where you just try to do whatever you want, is put into effect...
Biden Leftist is the new Military Intelligence
Maybe making you rething the prespective you're incessently shouting and walking away from when someone hits a nerve?  Biden's not a help, he's an enabler.
Who Biden? Maybe it’s trump
You’re calling out CatholicVote, so you support Biden? A fake Catholic?  Really?
So you are saying you support Biden ? Please speak up, do you consider Biden, who says he is Catholic, even a good Catholic?  Answer please? Trump is no saint, but Biden ?
What the literal crazy?
And this Sunday Biden will go to church while Trump will be off on a golf course somewhere. His true religion
Bullshit!!! Obama/Biden added 11M jobs, you’ve lost 11M+ jobs!!!
Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
Definitely will be worried about my civil rights &amp; basic dignity if Biden/Harris should be elected.  You’re The Swamp &amp; will be exposed for your corruption if there’s any justice.  You talk about Beau a lot ~ where’s Hunter?
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
Just looked at your page. Having fun baiting people in stupid discussions? Your page has Biden/Harris on it. Either you recently, as in past few hours, changed to the dark side or you are bored and having fun baiting people into the discussion. Yes, I responded but not to did. 👋
After Trump decimates Biden in one debate, let Trump debate Harris!  He’ll take them both down!  He’s been working his arse off 4 years &amp; I guarantee Trump knows all the answers.  Biden&amp; Harris have been on the sidelines demonizing him... and have no idea what’s going on.
Dementia Biden &gt; Insane Trump  Any day of the week, comrade
It wouldn’t be Biden, that’s for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you’re saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That’s how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn’t be that Trump will clean Biden’s clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don’t buy it. Trump by a landslide.
And what's your qualifications to determine that?  Why should I listen to you over actual doctors that have given Biden physicals?
I think I figured it out. You don't know who this guy is. That's why you don't care he is in very public neurological decline. He's your father. You should care that he can't read any longer. At least as much as you do about Joe Biden. #TrumpIsUnwell
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate 😏
suburban ☑️  voting for Biden/Harris ☑️
I’d like to report a threat to a protectee.   A television personality is saying that Joseph R. Biden will not live to stand for election.  Her name is Jeannine Pirro and there is video evidence.
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
You Trump Haters would love to continue hiding Biden by not having debates.  What are you Trump Haters so afraid of??
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
To quote our next POTUS, "Time to get to work."  Get out there and vote, people.  Support Biden-Harris!
Notice Biden/Harris didn’t tout any of Biden’s accomplishments or successes during his 48 political career.  It’s bc he had none.  Although he &amp; his family did enrich themselves bc of his corruption.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
Biden haters and Russian troll bots are even mad about Biden playing Curtis Mayfield. Snowflakes! They hate positivity.  #BidenHarris2020
So I'll believe the actual medical doctors who say that Joe Biden doesn't have dementia over some random person on the internet who isn't a doctor.
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
Do we comment on Biden’s outfit too? Please?
So excited for Biden's VIP pick! #BidenHarris2020
Biden will suffer a “stroke” at the 11th hour and kamala will assume the nomination and pick a “safer” VP pick who is more like able
I mean you do know that Joe Biden deals with sluttering, right? It's a speech disorder which involves frequent and significant problems with normal fluency and flow of speech.  And it has been diagnosed as such by actual doctors, not Twitter moms. It doesn't mean he has dementia.
People whining about Biden when they had no problems with kind of insanity for the last four years, simply hilarious
I’m voting Biden-Harris.   Let’s do this.  2020💙
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
May every single one of our nasty women tribe vote for Biden-Harris 2020!
This is what strikes me the most. Biden/Harris want to lead, and honestly, would any of us want this job next? The nightmare situation they will inherit is unprecedented.
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
. Tired of fake progressives. Don’t tell me, a brown male to vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala. Idc if Trump is evil. I know that. I ain’t voting for him either. I’m a revolutionary. We’re built different, tear the whole system down. Stop being complacent with oppression.
This suburban housewife is voting for Biden. #resign #TrumpVirus #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Well Biden is basically a conservative so....
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn’t that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Biden can’t even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You’ve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
In this dystopian world, Kamala Harris sails above the presidential bar
Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary of Education. 🛎
Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She’s an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
#Biden chose the person who was the most critical of him, which shows that he has qualities of a leader instead of propensities of a dictator.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don’t think people will believe you on Joe Biden.
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
these ads are already up? obviously they were afraid of #Kamala for some time now #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris #Biden #BidenVP
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn’t really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.
I’m in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
Again, criticism of Biden/Harris isn't an endorsement of Trump/Pence. It is part of demanding better - for those who think for themselves and don't tow a party line blindly, it is something that should be encouraged. We can be better than this.
I gues you have more trust in the D's and Biden than I do - I consider it almost meaningless. The dirty laundry goes way beyond her DA experience. Regardless, ignoring it, or condemning those who refuse to ignore, it is making politics worse.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
will eat your lunch  you have no clue what’s coming your way. Your out of your league on this one. Take a nap now while you can. #Biden #Kamala #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #VPHarris
Joe Biden just have a big fuck you to the people involved in the BLM movement. Why would he pick a person who put so many people of color behind bars?!
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
I'm not sure she can walk this back. Again, either she was lying then, or she's lying now... either way, it is unacceptable. And by pointing to Trump as a refutation, and setting the bar that low to justify this, isn't helping.
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
So she calls Biden a racist and believes his rape accusers. And  runs with him and you back all this? Woow
1) the argument is how she intentionally represented the issue, and her implications.  2) I know what Biden said, I agreed with him - this is about her, again straw manning Joe &amp; lying about the situation.  1/3
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I don't think there was ever a question for Biden that his Vice President pick would be #KamalaHarrisForVP. I think when he said his pick would be a woman, he knew exactly who. He held everyone in suspense to create some excitement. I'm excited!  #BidenHarris2020
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
The implications of racsim by working with desegrationists, forced bussing, and using herself (as a child) as an example. A terrible and shameless line of attack, but she did it. I recommend you look at what, and how, she said them.   Also, this:
Biden/Harris!! We deserve this! Let's make it happen, America!!!
You didn’t pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we’ve ever seen.  Where’s Hunter?
Biden, competent? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden’s running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
I can't stand her, but will vote for Biden no matter what.
Oh crap. Really? After that stunt she pulled to discredit him? Damn. Oh well. #Biden/Anybody2020.
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris’s constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because “WE THE PEOPLE” for Biden don’t need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
I’m voting Biden/Harris no matter what &amp; you should too.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden’s running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want her😔
Y'all supporting Biden the pedophile? I thought we were saving our children?
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Does this mean if I don’t vote for Trump I’m voting Biden?
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards — Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Congrats to our first woman Vice President! There is no way Biden/Harris can lose! 2020 and beyond!
#Breaking: Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
I doubt you "know" much of anything. Its a legitimate question - you say "no" without any proof, and then resort to lame &amp; intellectually shallow name calling.   Also, does she still believe him to be a sexual deviant?
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
Get on with it, Biden! Just tell us what strong female will be doing your heavy lifting! #tuesdaymood
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
Click the video to see Wednesday/Thursday. Harris is the last person right before Biden.
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they’re eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
Biden has always been a Liar.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden’s VP. Lmao!! 🤣 I’m really rooting for this 🤣😉
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
MI has issues.  If it makes you feel better,  3 of my family members in MI who voted for no one for Pres and 2 who voted for Trump in 2016 are committed to vote for Biden.  There is hope.
Perhaps, but it is conceivable that no vice presidential pick has ever been as important, given the general perception that Biden will not even complete his first term
Trump can make a big deal out of cutting a tax related to payroll that sounds really good to his followers, and say Biden will put it back, which he’ll have to or it’ll be on his watch that Social Security and Medicare fail. No win situation for Biden.
Well said.  Trump is the best President we’ve ever had bc he truly cares about the country &amp; ALL Americans!  He gets no respect from the msm or Left but works tirelessly for us &amp; will defeat the hapless Biden in Nov. Biden would widen the swamp that Trump is draining.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!
TELL   ALL    TO  VOTE   FOR    BIDEN  TKS   !!!
Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
Nancy Biden
I don’t know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I’m just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
Biden couldn’t interview a sock.
There is no way biden gets on the same stage as trump! No way!
#Biden talk about your mancunian candidate!
I remember how ineffective Kaine was/is.  If she chose him for that reason she did well. But the democrat field is so weak, i.e., the 2020 dem candidates - Biden/Harris are the best they got? 😨
Biden/Doocy 2020
Biden/Doocey 2020
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Come on, Man!  You know Biden has no plan - he doesn’t have a clue what’s going on.  Trump is handling the country great &amp; will defeat you &amp; Joe in a landslide. You, President?  That’s almost as big a joke as Biden being president!
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
He's got some good songs but never bought a album id vote kanye way before i voted for that scumbag biden!
Joe biden isnt worthy of any vote period if ur to blind to see that u probably shouldn't be allowed to vote the guys senile he sexually assaulted tara reade he has pedophile tendencies!
Agree, I think it's possible Biden in such bad shape mentally that Cuomo could be shoed in at DNC and if so its about what gives him more votes.  Parents of children win out over unions.
Voting for Biden as soon as I land #biden #Biden2020  #BidenHarris2020  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica  #CountryOverParty  #EvictTrump  #FourMoreYears
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I’m sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden’s AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
🙄  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion “one president at a time.” Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You’re irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden’s a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low
Joe Biden. Chinese operative. Selling out America for 40+ years.
Biden is the coup, and Harris is the de gras. Jumping Joe Biden will open the door and do his four, preparing Harris to do eight more.

LMFAO!
Speaking of Q,  Now you guys are retreating conspiracy theories too? That's what trump did, you've got no leg to stand on to criticize Joe Biden as long as you support that disgusting pig.
Biden:  Put me in office and then let's talk about what we can do together  C'mon jack I know to get the money first.
I am voting early against Trump and for Biden/Harris. As soon as I receive my mail in ballot, I’m completing it and hand delivering it to the election commission office.  America deserves better than this BS Trump administration.
Anyone in the GOP does not get to talk about this.  Your grift and greed, accompanied by lies and cheats make me sick.  Shall we do an honest comparison of Biden’s plans vs Trumps?  Stop whining about being victims, and do your fucking job.

By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.

Were we under Chinese rule under Obama/Biden? I long for the days of no drama Obama/Biden. Democracy! Growth! Sanity! This trump chaos is nauseating.
Don’t tell me I’m not pro life simply because I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a man as atrocious as Trump. He’s using evangelicals like myself, like you. He’s no more pro life than Biden; the difference is, he needs conservative Christians to win.
Joe Biden does not know who Donald Trump is.
We cant go to canada or Mexico. So...GO TO WASHINGYON DC
International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Biden isn’t a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Win this election, John! We have to flip the Senate! I have sent money and will send more! In October, when I get my ballot, I will vote for you and Biden/Harris immediately within a day and place it in the local drop-off box! I am advising everyone to do the same!
Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?

I definitely think it is, that’s why I’m voting for Biden over Trump.
Joe Biden could pass away and no one would give a fuck because he’s average and not worthy of anything who in their right mind would want a bitch like Kamala Harris for President. Get the fuck outta here bitch I am voting for Trump (again!) #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
Now that's funny. China knows that Lying Don is an easily manipulated fool and Biden isn't.
Very true, so Biden should not get elected then.  Appreciate the optimism.
Yeah youre even better than Biden at dodging and deflecting questions while cherry picking facts.
This guy goes to full retard levels in this article... 😂🤣😅🙄🤦
Fuck Joe Biden nigga #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.
Does  pivot and start yelling about deficits the minute Joe Biden is sworn in?

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
If you want to see nepotism and conflict of interest, take a look into the Trump administration. Hunter Biden....been there done that. Clean your own back yard.
Amen. And, Biden should not interfere. No pardons. No deals.
I wonder how many set of knee pads she needed to get a VP spot with the Biden team. 🍆💦
Heard you missed us we're back! For the time being..   Hear us break down Biden picking Kamala Harris, how masks and lockdowns are still a partisan thing, because stupid, and advice on how to overcome the USPS sabotage operation.
I just read another tweet about Biden went to the NetRoots conference to beg left progressive to help him to win the campaign. That says a lot. I bet he would have to surrender half of the platform to them. Even to get them onboard.

Acosta, have you ever asked Biden a question? You are not a journalist. You hate Conservatives with a passion. You are not a Cuban American but a Fidelito ass kisser.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.

Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That’s the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.
This is Trumps America.  He should resign and leave the clean up to Biden and Harris.  They are adults.

Yes. I’m a Republican committed to my faith and the Constitution. That’s why I’m going to swallow the bile and vote for Biden this November. Not because I oppose Republican ideals but because I want my party and my country back. #principlesb4party #compassionateconservative
More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.

They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.

My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.

Well, I’m talking about both Dems as the party leadership, and also those who voted for Biden in the primary.  I said during the Primary that if Biden were nominated I would vote for him (unless he supported key policies, which he continues to oppose).
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻

Biden isn't accused of 'groping' anyone.  Trump supporters decided that the 25 allegations of sexual assault, racism, incompetence, and worst economic disaster in history isn't a deal breaker.
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.

I don’t know how to say this but your late to the party, we already know this but I’m ready to see Trump in an orange jumpsuit. And ready to push Biden hard. We need to keep up the energy and direct it to the Democratic Party once we flip this shit.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
How about Vice President Biden?
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

This may seem shocking pilgrims but in many matters of foreign policy, being against Trump is not always in your best interest for you nor would it be for a Biden administration.
He echoes Jared Kushner, calling the deal a “historic step” 4 peace in the Mideast. He praises the "bravery" &amp; "statesmanship” of the Arab despot.   Welcome to Biden’s Middle East Policy which will look similar to Trump's policy in 2 critical areas that plague the region...
Biden has called Trump, America’s first racist president.   When this racist US president, orchestrates a deal between a neo-fascist Israeli leader &amp; an Arab despot (that ignores basic Palestinians rights) – how does Biden respond? ....
To be fair, I turned off my Biden texts for that same reason Anand says: asking only for donations on a daily basis isn’t what I want. Give me stories, talking points, action items too.

Sadly it didn't take you. Why are you worried about covid-19? To Chinese did it. Not Trump not Biden and not you. Let it go
Plagiarism is Biden’s style since he has no ideas of his own. Biden been plagiarizing for decades as a part of the Washington, DC Swamp. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy from the militant socialist mob.
I’m not sure why you feel that way.  Biden has moved left since winning the nomination, endorsing the Green New Deal, for one.
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
We will know. It will be Joe Biden
You don't know about Harris' record in California? Locking up poor POC and never going after billionaires?  Biden/Harris won't be any better than Trump. On the contrary, it will put sociopath Harris in power for 8-12 years.
Biden (to black interviewer): “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black!”  Biden (re busing): “unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle...”  There’s plenty more
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!
Great news about silent majority: Daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers.She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse.She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said Trump
What is our world coming to? Why do people think Joe Biden is racist when he was vice president for obama, a black man?  If you were point out sexism that might make more sense.
2024: Haley doesn’t make it to IA caucuses. Several staffers blame Gray though there were other factors. R nominee is Cotton-Crenshaw, they lose badly to Biden-Harris that includes TX flipping
I fear for my family,country, beliefs and safety due to the current situation in our country. May God protect and bless you,V.P. Biden. My family  will vote for you and Senator Harris.
Asked why they support Biden, 56% of his voters gave a simple answer: “He’s not Trump.  #copolitics
maybe we should just call the election for biden now so that it's harder to dispute down the line
Throughout 2021 Continues writing how awful the Biden admin is, despite decent approvals of policies passed  Pelosi announces she is not running for re-election in 22. BJG tweets “ding dong the wicked witch is dead”, she is ratioed, &amp; retweeted by Don Jr
As I have heard. We must choose the better of two evils. Biden would be the lesser.
Jan 2021: Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in, Briahna Joy Gray writes in Current Affairs a list of demands they have to do to earn her vote
Oct 2020: tweets photo of her voting Green, ends up the fastest ratio in Political Twitter history  Nov 2020: Biden wins, she locks her account down
They're loosing early this year because the know Biden can't win.
They aren't excited to vote for Biden, they're excited to vote against Trump
To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump
Biden Explains Why He Picked Kamala Harris As VP!  via
Hey  you think Biden is a moderate, I’ve got a bridge to sell you
Thanks, I was just about to say I’m SURE that’s how Biden says her name, even said it that way IN FRONT OF HER and she didn’t flinch or correct him!
Oh! Also, did you forget the part where Tulsi endorsed Biden?   Does that sting a lil bit? To know that the person you're lauding is supporting the better ticket?
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
And who do the rioters, looters, arsonists, vandals, and murderers get to blame for their actions? Biden? BLM? 🤔 Lets credit Pelosi, Schumer, and all of the weak, complicit, Democrat mayors and governors who refused to do their jobs and protect the citizens.
"It was a warning that America chose to ignore,"
Khizr Khan: 'Trump may damage American democracy permanently'
Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it’ll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden’s sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I buy that there’s an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don’t think it’s unique to Utah. It’s entirely possible that after Alaska, there’s a fairly strict cutoff line.
Trump’s been running the country very well in spite of the deep state obstructionists for 4 years. Worry about Biden - he has obvious dementia .
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Actually Biden would need a 30 pt lead in polls
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I’m “crimson and clover “
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Soros &amp; the deep State already own Biden/Harris.
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.
Kamala Harris goes from accusing Joe Biden of being a rapist and racist to excitedly accepting to work for him. Which one is it? #Hypocrite
Great thread Molly. I have a question that didn’t really come up at the mandamus hearing. Could Sullivan question scope of dismissal motion? Ex: FARA dropped as part of plea deal which Gen Flynn sought to withdraw. Could a Biden DOJ try to prosecute or is FARA off the table too?
Biden staff herds compliant press away from candidate  via
So much easier to claim Biden has no policies
We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
Did you endorse biden yet?
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden 😆
Funny. Biden answers no questions.
Vote for Biden.
Maybe I'm a bit retarded here, but biden was?
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let’s see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
“Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden’s true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Yeah. This part ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻? TRump’s head would literally explode. In a cloud of partially chewed Big-Macs and KFC. Never👏🏻Gonna👏🏻Happen👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻...until Biden can give this speech😏
Vote like Biden is 10pts down. Don’t be complacent.
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
They’re just Biden time
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Progressives for Biden Convention Watch Party” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I’m missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he’s not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don’t like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymore🤦‍♂️
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don’t think anybody is worried California won’t go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
And so has the country apparently. Biden’s lead has moved into double digits.
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
and... we're supposed to trust #MailInBallots??? WTH?  Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.

Don’t say that, you will hurts his feelings, especially as Biden’s lead moved into double digits across multiple polls today...
Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Look at this headline. Biden isn't supposed to be president for very long. Soros is trying to put communist Kamala in the Oval Office. NO thank you!

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. 🤣🤣
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
The Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. 🤣🤣
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
“Ballot Handlers Endorse Biden”  This is fine.
Biden is a pedophile
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It’s already over. We didn’t believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
So now Biden is anti-windows and anti-steak knives?
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses

Biden/Harris could’ve been a GOP ticket 12 years ago, fuck the
“It’s not about your rights.”  Joe Biden, speaking to Americans, 8/13/20.
If Joe Biden was a Republican he would have been selling insurance by 1975.  This is presidential material??
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.
The American people respect all the hard work you are doing for our great nation!  Well done President Biden!

For those people who say they’re still refusing to vote Biden/Harris, but don’t want Trump, what do you propose should be done?  This is a very genuine question that I am looking for an answer to. It’s not meant to be snarky, I would just like to know your thoughts.

Pence went on to say that he would beat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, shouting "I'm going to beat their ..." before being led offstage by a handmaiden.
People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

We aren’t going to do what? OMG Biden/Harris has those fools all discombobulated 😂 #BidenHarris2020
We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.

Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.
The healthcare expansion debate is more nuanced and incapable of tweeting about. I am just not spooked by the idea Biden is a closet leftist. Doesn’t match the reality I see. Doesn’t match how actual leftists feel about him.

their venn diagrams are a circle, cuz that’s the point - not that obama was worse than romney, that he was the fucking same. same goes for biden/trump. you need to work on your reading comprehension
I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Appears to show? I hope Biden/Harris are working on police reform right now.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense

Everybody who hates the Corporate Democrats? You know, the over powerful Clintons, Obamas, Pelosi, Schumer?   This is the same attitude that got Trump into the WH 4 years ago.   I hate Harris so much, I don't care if Trump wins this time, too.  I won't vote for him or Biden.

Wait till he goes full Putin and arrests Biden.
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
That being said, I will continue to drag biden &amp; the dnc for not supporting #MedicareForAll. We are in the middle of a pandemic, people are losing their jobs &amp; insurance. Private insurance makes NO FUCKING SENSE.
biden - do you mean equalize pay for women of ALL races?
My absolute favorite the other day was a friend shared a post calling out Biden and Trump and I commented about voting third party. And another friend was like “hOw Do YoU kNoW sHe’S nOt gUiLtY EiThEr” like shut the fuck up. Where’s your proof?
He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
Commissar Biden’s latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It’s totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
Awesome article with good quotes contrasting styles between the two. Fascinating study in leadership, relationships and frayed bonds.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.
#Kamala and #Biden don’t want to take your guns, they want to take guns from you all!
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.
What do these people have in common?  1968 Hubert Humphrey 1972 George McGovern 1984 Walter Mondale 1988 Michael Dukakis 2000 Al Gore 2004 John Kerry 2016 Hillary Clinton 2020 Joe Biden  #CenteristDemocratsLose #GreenParty2020 #PeoplesParty2024 #GeneralStrike2020
Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
If Donald Trump supports UBI and Medicaid until the rest of the year he will destroy Biden and his neo-con agenda.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
I'm unfollowing anybody who supports Biden/Harris or Trump.
They are smarter than that Seattle will still vote Biden, might even get some people to give up houses.  Homeless group moved into a vacant house in 2010, had a for rent sign, city wouldn't allow eviction.
■Instead of sending pallets of US cash at night like Obama/Biden, this Prez shows some guts to the violent, oppressive mullahs ●US confiscates Iranian fuel from four tankers, official says  #FoxNews
Should there be a national mask mandate? Joe Biden has shown his support for this, while President Trump believes it should be up to state governments and individual people. What do you think? Vote now on our live poll 👇
Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.Joe Biden. Ask hard questions.
I don't Biden's accusers but I DO believe you're a Trump Drone who's trying to hide himself amongst a group of political moderates
President Biden delivers!
Biden and Democrat gonna WIN Big League in November!!
Thinly veiled attempt to drag Biden down to Trump’s level.  Not gonna chase that ball...
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Hmmm
Oh, but it’s ok for the USPS to support Biden????????????
To be fair, I turned off my Biden texts for that same reason Anand says: asking only for donations on a daily basis isn’t what I want. Give me stories, talking points, action items too.
Great news about silent majority: Daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers.She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse.She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said Trump
maybe we should just call the election for biden now so that it's harder to dispute down the line
Funny. Biden answers no questions.
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
Biden who?
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
and... we're supposed to trust #MailInBallots??? WTH?  Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.

Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.
The American people respect all the hard work you are doing for our great nation!  Well done President Biden!
The sane Americans stand proudly with President Biden!!
It’s the Putin active measures disinformation operation, drug deal, that he, Trump, Graham, Durham, Grassley, Johnson and Giuliani are cooking up to hurt Biden. WE THE PEOPLE AREN’T BUYING THEIR SNAKE OIL‼️We are flying 35K ft.  above this insidious operation and see it clearly‼️

Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption
After all the comments on my OMG tweet about golden showers I know one thing for sure; Biden is going to need a new mattress in the White House #Bidenwillneedanewmmattressinthewh
You know Obama/Biden built the cages and put kids in them prior to Trump
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this
Is this same guy going to ask Biden and Kamala that, that’s all they have done the last two days.
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions

Good 4 Biden
So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccine🙃
So proud of President Biden and his outstanding leadership!
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that’s how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That’s nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he’s an old guy with Dementia or because he’s a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can’t pronounce it correctly it really shouldn’t matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. 🤡🤡 Has Don Lemon’s sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‘s name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
buddy really took biden quotes and used them against trump😳😳 shiii he got him
This is what a Biden administration will bring to the country.
Why Sarah Palin Is Trending Ahead of Biden's VP Pick Announcement
I'm sure Biden and Harris will lean real hard into the Bernie wing.
48 of Biden vs 4 years of Trump, I would take Trump all day long.
When Biden does it:  “Oh no.” When Tucker does it:  “Racist!”
prior to having kamala as biden’s vp pick, i was still apprehensive about biden. now, i will actually be excited to vote #bidenharris this november.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. 🤡🤡
So "Judge" Jeanine Pirro, what is going to happen to Biden? You must have pulled out a crystal ball from your briefcase.
Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
“Nothing will fundamentally change” under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.
I’m no economist...and neither is Trump.  It’s like he’s trying to sell us a timeshare...every fucking day!  Biden/Harris!  Can’t wait!
4yrs + 8yrs = Biden + Harris = 12 yrs BLUE!!!
I couldn't be happier that  is Biden's VP running mate.  The fact that she is from my home state of California makes it even sweeter that she's going to be on the ballot this November.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #BlueWaveTsunami2020
When is Biden going to take questions or is that all on Harris now?
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Everyone needs to report Jeanine Piro for threatening Joe Biden. This woman is psycho and dangerous!
Hoping Mary Trump does a virtual rally for Biden / Harris🤣🤣🤣
Go after Biden  Ignore his attack VP.
Hey a$$hole, this is my taxpayer money, it’s not a gift from you! Can’t wait for the big Biden/Harris win in November!
Biden just mispronounced her name, lol
Is anyone tracking how many hours (minutes really) a week Joe Biden is spending in front of cameras or in public in general??

I live in the suburbs and will be voting Biden / Harris
Uhh…I don't recall JOE BIDEN being in office during #Ukraingate   I always thought it was DONALD TRUMP who made that phone call that lead to the #ImpeachmentHearings   I guess THE INTERNET must be fake news too (In which you might want to get off. You might've been exposed to…
Ah, you’re right! Must’ve missed that part.
Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y’all think Biden picked her for any other reason?😂
I follow   and  here on Twitter.  I find it curious that Biden is always in my timeline at the very top and Trump is never in my timeline.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business
I wonder how it feels to be selected only because of your gender and color of your skin...Biden riding with the times.
You seem a little worried today, Donnie.  #nastywoman  #wednesdaymorning  #nastywoman  #Biden
Joe Biden that’s who!
Joe Biden is “radical”?!?!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
It’s time to get some sleep, and I’ll be sleeping much better when Biden/Harris are winning!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Guess my follow-up question would be...if not Biden/Harris, who? Because my honest feeling is that we can’t survive another 4 years of *this*...
We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

I bought a T-shirt on the Biden victory page
I was with Rice but the announcement of Harris feels really good today and I’m excited for this Biden/Harris ticket. This is Joe Bidens choice and I support it.
Pretty sure that’s what you said about Obama and Biden. Amazing thing - there’s still a second amendment!
Statement from  Chairman  on Joe Biden's announcement of extremist Kamala Harris as his V.P. #copolitics
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: ’She Was My Number One Draft Pick’ — Trump Launches Immediate Attacks On Kamala Harris After Biden Names Her As VP
I am so inspired with the Biden/Harris ticket
There is a sweet spot in the Biden cabinet for  😀
Turn off angry, sensationalized cable news and get your election coverage at The Neutral (⁦⁦ No fatigue, bickering, or bias. Just facts and balanced perspective. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she’s a woman she can’t be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.
Where can I get a Biden/Harris sign in the Denver area?
Day two, Biden appoints Harris anti-corruption tsar.
Day two, Biden appoints Harris anti-corruption tsar.
So sorry I'm going to miss it. Going to work on my Biden / Harris yard signs
I like Bernie &amp; would have voted for him. I meant nothing derogatory against anyone. The fact is I'm well aware we NEED  Bernie's supporters. It's just so many are refusing to vote for Biden, so i thought maybe if they listen to him speak at the DNC we could change their minds.
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn’t comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!
Never heard of Joe Biden until yesterday, I’m guessing.
Biden/Harris 2020! Perfect Vision!
#Biden picks #KamalaHarrisForVP the one candidate that couldn't make it thru Iowa Primary. Knowing Joe is unlikely to finish 4 yr term  you're voting for #kamala for president. Didn't play well in #Iowa won't play well in the country.
Why is Biden saying she’s going to lead the country in January 2021 if he is elected? Who’s going to be her VP?
Is this the first time you’ve heard of Biden?
please just give me one time where biden calls her michelle by accident
All you've been doing on Twitter is complaining  and whining about Biden and how you hate having to vote for him, and now you're complaining about Harris. I'm sorry, but when democracy is on the line with an opponent like Trump, I'll happily take an honest, caring man like Biden.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!! Time to take out the trash!!!!
is a transformational leader. She is a fighter. She is a uniter, and has always been of, and for, the people. I’d walk through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden/Harris this election #KHive
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate   #SmartNews
Congratulations to  Joe Biden, and most of all the American people! Sen. Harris will be an extraordinary Vice President.
Political news: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
I'm old enough to remember when Kamala Harris sold this shirt claiming Biden was a racist.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
Harris to be Biden’s choice as VP!  I’m so excited!!!!!
Meanwhile, if you're a Biden supporter, SURE you'd like to see schools open on time BUT you'd ALSO like to see them open IN A SAFE MANNER   In the meantime, EVERYONE would like to see Trump PROVE he's MORE than A MONEY HUNGRY ZOMBIE with a knack for business by SHOWING he CAN beGreat! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I’m sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden’s AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
🙄  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion “one president at a time.” Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You’re irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden’s a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low
Joe Biden. Chinese operative. Selling out America for 40+ years.
Biden is the coup, and Harris is the de gras. Jumping Joe Biden will open the door and do his four, preparing Harris to do eight more.
#JudgeJeanine this is the Harris-Biden campaign, not the Biden-Harris campaign
LMFAO!
Speaking of Q,  Now you guys are retreating conspiracy theories too? That's what trump did, you've got no leg to stand on to criticize Joe Biden as long as you support that disgusting pig.
Biden:  Put me in office and then let's talk about what we can do together  C'mon jack I know to get the money first.
I am voting early against Trump and for Biden/Harris. As soon as I receive my mail in ballot, I’m completing it and hand delivering it to the election commission office.  America deserves better than this BS Trump administration.
Anyone in the GOP does not get to talk about this.  Your grift and greed, accompanied by lies and cheats make me sick.  Shall we do an honest comparison of Biden’s plans vs Trumps?  Stop whining about being victims, and do your fucking job.

By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.
LOOOOLLLLLLLL Biden thinks they’re taking personal mailboxes. What a jackass.
#Biden  Kamala Harris really thinks allot of today's young adults the 18 to 24 year olds
What? Biden and his prison bill and Harris the laughing cop? We're on the verge of having even more than 25% of the world's prisoners -- with those 2 sociopaths, we'll soon have 50%. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
the ass-kissing continues unabated. this is why Biden was brilliant to pick her. still, you could maybe do some journalism at some point.
Don’t tell me I’m not pro life simply because I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a man as atrocious as Trump. He’s using evangelicals like myself, like you. He’s no more pro life than Biden; the difference is, he needs conservative Christians to win.
Joe Biden does not know who Donald Trump is.
We cant go to canada or Mexico. So...GO TO WASHINGYON DC
International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Biden isn’t a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Win this election, John! We have to flip the Senate! I have sent money and will send more! In October, when I get my ballot, I will vote for you and Biden/Harris immediately within a day and place it in the local drop-off box! I am advising everyone to do the same!
Lmfao, have you not seen Biden touching multiple children inappropriately??
Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

I definitely think it is, that’s why I’m voting for Biden over Trump.
Joe Biden could pass away and no one would give a fuck because he’s average and not worthy of anything who in their right mind would want a bitch like Kamala Harris for President. Get the fuck outta here bitch I am voting for Trump (again!) #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
Biden and Harris can’t hide forever!!
Now that's funny. China knows that Lying Don is an easily manipulated fool and Biden isn't.
Very true, so Biden should not get elected then.  Appreciate the optimism.
Yeah youre even better than Biden at dodging and deflecting questions while cherry picking facts.
This guy goes to full retard levels in this article... 😂🤣😅🙄🤦
Fuck Joe Biden nigga #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.
Does  pivot and start yelling about deficits the minute Joe Biden is sworn in?

Do you, like I do, think that Biden picked a black woman in part because he knew that trump would lose his friggin mind?
Is she going to investigate the #Biden rape allegations? She called him a rapist and a segregationist sewwww......   #Election2020
Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
If you want to see nepotism and conflict of interest, take a look into the Trump administration. Hunter Biden....been there done that. Clean your own back yard.
Amen. And, Biden should not interfere. No pardons. No deals.
I wonder how many set of knee pads she needed to get a VP spot with the Biden team. 🍆💦
Heard you missed us we're back! For the time being..   Hear us break down Biden picking Kamala Harris, how masks and lockdowns are still a partisan thing, because stupid, and advice on how to overcome the USPS sabotage operation.
I just read another tweet about Biden went to the NetRoots conference to beg left progressive to help him to win the campaign. That says a lot. I bet he would have to surrender half of the platform to them. Even to get them onboard.

Acosta, have you ever asked Biden a question? You are not a journalist. You hate Conservatives with a passion. You are not a Cuban American but a Fidelito ass kisser.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.

Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That’s the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.
This is Trumps America.  He should resign and leave the clean up to Biden and Harris.  They are adults.

Yes. I’m a Republican committed to my faith and the Constitution. That’s why I’m going to swallow the bile and vote for Biden this November. Not because I oppose Republican ideals but because I want my party and my country back. #principlesb4party #compassionateconservative
More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.

They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.

No matter what the lying  comes up with from now to November, vote Biden/Harris. Just remember, Trump is a liar and a con man. That is all you need to remember! 🇺🇸
My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.

Well, I’m talking about both Dems as the party leadership, and also those who voted for Biden in the primary.  I said during the Primary that if Biden were nominated I would vote for him (unless he supported key policies, which he continues to oppose).
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.

Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻

Biden isn't accused of 'groping' anyone.  Trump supporters decided that the 25 allegations of sexual assault, racism, incompetence, and worst economic disaster in history isn't a deal breaker.

I don’t know how to say this but your late to the party, we already know this but I’m ready to see Trump in an orange jumpsuit. And ready to push Biden hard. We need to keep up the energy and direct it to the Democratic Party once we flip this shit.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
How about Vice President Biden?
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

This may seem shocking pilgrims but in many matters of foreign policy, being against Trump is not always in your best interest for you nor would it be for a Biden administration.
He echoes Jared Kushner, calling the deal a “historic step” 4 peace in the Mideast. He praises the "bravery" &amp; "statesmanship” of the Arab despot.   Welcome to Biden’s Middle East Policy which will look similar to Trump's policy in 2 critical areas that plague the region...
Biden has called Trump, America’s first racist president.   When this racist US president, orchestrates a deal between a neo-fascist Israeli leader &amp; an Arab despot (that ignores basic Palestinians rights) – how does Biden respond? ....

To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump
Biden Explains Why He Picked Kamala Harris As VP!  via
Hey  you think Biden is a moderate, I’ve got a bridge to sell you
Thanks, I was just about to say I’m SURE that’s how Biden says her name, even said it that way IN FRONT OF HER and she didn’t flinch or correct him!
Oh! Also, did you forget the part where Tulsi endorsed Biden?   Does that sting a lil bit? To know that the person you're lauding is supporting the better ticket?
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
And who do the rioters, looters, arsonists, vandals, and murderers get to blame for their actions? Biden? BLM? 🤔 Lets credit Pelosi, Schumer, and all of the weak, complicit, Democrat mayors and governors who refused to do their jobs and protect the citizens.
"It was a warning that America chose to ignore,"
Khizr Khan: 'Trump may damage American democracy permanently'
Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it’ll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden’s sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I buy that there’s an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don’t think it’s unique to Utah. It’s entirely possible that after Alaska, there’s a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I’m “crimson and clover “
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.
Kamala Harris goes from accusing Joe Biden of being a rapist and racist to excitedly accepting to work for him. Which one is it? #Hypocrite
Great thread Molly. I have a question that didn’t really come up at the mandamus hearing. Could Sullivan question scope of dismissal motion? Ex: FARA dropped as part of plea deal which Gen Flynn sought to withdraw. Could a Biden DOJ try to prosecute or is FARA off the table too?
Biden staff herds compliant press away from candidate  via
So much easier to claim Biden has no policies
We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
Did you endorse biden yet?
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden 😆
Funny. Biden answers no questions.
Vote for Biden.
Maybe I'm a bit retarded here, but biden was?
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let’s see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
“Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden’s true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Vote like Biden is 10pts down. Don’t be complacent.
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
Want me to spell it out? I'm MtF, autistic and with an encroaching physical disability in my spine. If you accelerationists keep Biden out, I die either in the streets or in a prison camp.
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Progressives for Biden Convention Watch Party” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I’m missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he’s not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don’t like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymore🤦‍♂️
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don’t think anybody is worried California won’t go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.

Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Look at this headline. Biden isn't supposed to be president for very long. Soros is trying to put communist Kamala in the Oval Office. NO thank you!

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"

If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
WATCH: Biden's Handlers Kick Reporters Out Of Press Briefing After They Start Asking Questions
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
“Ballot Handlers Endorse Biden”  This is fine.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It’s already over. We didn’t believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020

The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.

Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.

For those people who say they’re still refusing to vote Biden/Harris, but don’t want Trump, what do you propose should be done?  This is a very genuine question that I am looking for an answer to. It’s not meant to be snarky, I would just like to know your thoughts.

And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump

I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.

That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.
The healthcare expansion debate is more nuanced and incapable of tweeting about. I am just not spooked by the idea Biden is a closet leftist. Doesn’t match the reality I see. Doesn’t match how actual leftists feel about him.

Well Crackercat, Wanting is not always as good as having. Sometimes having makes one wish they didnt have after all. So Biden will soon realize his predicament. Much too late in 2020! TRUMP-2020! Because anyone one else is just a fool.
Not a very intellectual being. Whats the chances biden picks his perfect match. Both tell you straight up they lie in the name of politics
The GOP and the ring wing media mostly ignored this despicable post by their affiliate  in regards to the deceased Iraq war veteran Beau Biden. Donald Trump is not a victim.

The virus where 175,000 people have died, the economy, where 44 million are out of work, with a -32 % GDP...yep, makes perfect sense to vote for Joe Biden!
There's been one notable difference in this election between Trump &amp; Biden.  talks to the press more than any President has in my lifetime, and #Biden won't even answer a handful of questions with the media. I prefer the little pressers over zoom calls.
It's arguments like this that got us here in the first place both parties are awful but nothing will change if we don't vote for candidates with good policy. If Biden wins whatever but if Trump wins I'm fully prepared to fight for the removal of the least popular president ever.
Agree 100%, man. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have probably put more black Americans in jail through crime bills than anybody else in America's history... The irony is incredible. The media is lying and covering for them anyway they can.

METHINKS 🤔LIZY IS STILL DIZZY! BIDEN WINNING THE PRESIDENCY IS ABOUT AS BELIEVABLE AS ELIZABETH WARREN HAVING A NANOGRAM OF INDIAN BLOOD IN HER VEINS! 😂😂😂😂
GEE, #1 THOSE REMARKS WERE MADE HOW LONG AGO... WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING THEN,  #2. REALLY, WHERE ARE ALL THE PROMISES  "Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!"  via
do you realize biden made the aca that taxes the shit out of all hard working people who just can’t afford healthcare every month. basically be super poor so the government gives it to you, or be rich enough to pay for it, otherwise i’ll punish you🤬how does that make sense.
No what you say is true based on the latest reporting. And if true I’ll concede it’s a Trump play. But do you really believe the post office has the ability right now to handle mail in voting? I would trust online voting more than the USPS. Also the USPS is backing Biden
I don't like because I don't support Biden.
Nice job beginning the Tweet with Biden then taking a hard left turn to wrap it up with Obama. Very skilled “whataboutism.”
you’re the one jumping behind biden likes he’s the best thing to happen to the country. not me i also completely disappointed in the vp pick with all the options and that’s the one the dnc picks for him.🤬🤯 they so could have gotten vote if they’d have done that right.
Do you really think if the Post Office got 850 billion dollar tomorrow they could fix all there issues in 80 days? No way. Post Office shouldn’t handle my vote any more than Trump or Biden
you do realize biden has already been there once nothing got better. we gave you the chance to pick better you still fucked that up. your blindness is not my fault. i’m stacking the houses against anyone you put in 45 or biden neither one will be happy with the houses i give them
She is getting as bad as Biden!! She is old
You have to be a #Trump2020 person with this image of a 'Black Fist' pumping up and down through the name 'Biden'; it has many negative connotations...  Right? You know that? Either you're saying Kamala is a puppet-master, or something much worse for Biden, or both really.
Biden/Harris the New DNC Moral Relativism at its finest!
Fauci LIKE BIDEN HAS BEEN ON THE GOVERNMENT DOLE A LOOOONG TIME! ACCOMPLISHMENTS???? THIS PANDEMIC OCCURRED ON HIS WATCH! WHERE WAS HE?? TIME TO GO Fauci!!
Do you even know what a Radical Liberal is? Biden and Harris are Centrists on a liberal day.
Awesome 👏 as always  Meme idea for you: biden in his bunker, surrounded by his computer (zoom) with the caption ‘ I have no idea what I’m doing  LOL 😂😂😂😂
here’s how voting works 1+1=2  1+0=1 not voting for biden is NOT a 45 vote not matter how you want to shame someone into thinking it is and yes what you just said is a shameful way to pressure people into a biden vote because basically you know he doesn’t have the support to win.
Any Rep voting for Biden are of course welcome also.
Any Rep voting for Biden are welcome also of course.
Any Dems voting for Biden in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that need a ride, I will be available. Thinking about renting a van.
I'm not safe in Trump's America. I'll take my chances with Biden.
Hey, any Republicans that want to further their career, this is a good time to jump ship, vote for Biden, and become the next REAL Republican trying to defeat Biden in 2024.
Biden takes the pyramid approach, thinking like most lifelong DC politicians do, that the Federal Government should mandate everything, run control and spend money from the top down. Biden's mandating masks for everyone is top down. In truth this doesn't make it better.
ABSOLUTELY! BIDEN IS THE PERFECT DEFINITION OF "ALL HAT AND NO CATTLE!" ACCOMPLISHMENTS???? NONE!!!
These things become the news, spun as if Biden said them first or even had an original idea about how to deal with the multidimensional aspects of #COVID19. Who gets the most press wins the game, with the table being set again the next day. Don't be fooled. Any President with...
Nearly everything Biden has said about the pandemic tracked what  had already said. This has been going on for months with help from puppets in #Media who won't cover Trump so no one knows much about what came first. Looks like a plot, hmm.
If  can't be honest as an Indian- American who is "identifying" as an African American how can she be trusted about anything else?  #Biden
And Obama and Biden are right in the middle of this!!! This was no doubt a failed Coup d’état attempt on a duly elected President
Only one direction. I am willing to wager a week's salary Biden will not win by the current polling margin over Trump. No one will take me up on this wager because they know the current polls are nonsense.
OBSERVATION: THIS IDIOT IS GRABBING BOOKS BY THE HAND-FULL. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S BUYING??? WE TRUMP SUPPORTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE BUYING AND IT AIN'T BIDEN!!
Do we see what trump and his little GOP klan members are working on. All talk is about Biden and Harris. We have a group of white rich old ass men trying to take this world to a dictatorship. It’s not going away, he will cheat and steal and win. The shiny box is Trump.
Ok lol you think Dems would be mad about that? Joe Biden can quit the day after Inauguration Day. What’s your point exactly?
If Trump can have his acceptance speech on WH grounds, couldn’t Biden?! It’s our house!
Biden sent a letter laying out a strategy in January.  It was the same as the rest of the industrialized countries on the globe. You know, the one's we aren't allowed into because we are the world's plague rats
Remember when pro union was pro America?  Joe Biden and the Democratic Party do.   Strong unions support strong families!
Not only that, when Trump defeats Biden/Harris they can cry that America is systematically racist and promote further violence and division.
see it was bought and paid for bs to keep you from paying attention to the real winner bernie the one who should be president again obama did it hillary did it now biden and harris did it. open your eyes. #NeverBidenNeverKamala
The first of Obama's FBI spying agents is going to plead guilty.  He'll be singing like a canary. Many more indictments to come Obama/Biden spied on the Trump campaign and launched the biggest hoax perpetrated on America. #RussiaHoaxExposed
&gt;BLM &gt;Support Biden/Harris   Pick one
I would kind of like to see the debates and what happens over the next few months. So far Biden has done next to no campaigning. What does he stand for?
AWESOME! LOVE IT! WE GOTTA RE-ELECT THIS GREAT PRESIDENT! JOE BIDEN COULDN'T MANAGE A LEMONADE STAND AND KAMALA IS LIKE A CHAMELEON ;IN THAT SHE CHANGES HER POLITICAL COLORS TO ENHANCE HER POLITICAL POSITION!
Hmmm...riddle me this Lee...why is there no reporting on the murder of Cannon Hinnant?  Is it because it doesn't fit your narrative?  I'll let you continue on with your tantrum about how "orange man bad!" while overlooking the same issues Biden is guilty of. #LiberalHypocrisy
Wait you voted for the worst dem candidate maybe ever but think Trump is the lesser of two evils then Biden. I speak on behalf of all Dems, never vote Dem again lol.
Is there any chance you could talk to Joe Biden about implementing a nationwide ban on the dangerous, damaging practice of conversion therapy?
No worries, they would call you out either way. Smh
I look at what Biden and Harris prep to do to the Supreme Court, and yes, this is a fight for the soul of the country.  The fight's been going on and we're only part way through.
I cannot fathom the mess that a Biden and Trump debate would be. Neither can be concise and both ramble. Ugh.
I don’t think anyone’s telling you not to push for meaningful change. They’re just telling you to vote for Joe Biden with your right hand and push for meaningful change with your left.
We need to stop flights to the US. Are leader which is not our dictator is a serial killer. I bet Biden can do something about that in November.
Asking for a mess of a situation. This will be a nightmare for Biden and Trump alike. Probably not getting final results till far later than what they are thinking with the results also being questioned by both parties. If you dont want to believe me, that's fine. Just wait &amp; see
The irony is the same stupidity that she refers to about Trump supporters is the same stupidity prevalent in Biden supporters.
Vote for VP Biden. Think of it as an act of atonement.
He knows people make fun of him...he simply doesn't care what people think of him.  Can't help but to notice the HUGE amounts of #LiberalHypocrisy bubbling up with the Biden/Harris ticket.
when I began 2020 I wanted Kamala Harris as Persident, then I had to switch to Elizabeth Warren, then I had to switch to Joe Biden bc I know that is the path forward. Our war is with the GOP and their blatant disregard for life. they want to retain power. they knew where he was
Joe Biden can’t think for himself everybody knows that. I say again if Joe Biden or Democrats were in the office right now we would have 1 million lives lost to the virus.
I keep seeing these unsubstantiated claims against Biden. On the other hand, does it not at least worry you a little bit that Trump has several pictures taken with Epstein and Maxwell over several years and that he wished Maxwell "well." ?
Biden’s desired mask rule. He does get mask use outdoors, yet wants to set this as part of a national mandate.
Headlines in every newspaper in  America on 4 November:  Biden Wins,  Masks no longer necessary, Teachers say it’s safe to go back to School.   The political virus has taken away our freedom and removed objectivity from our lives.
So, in short, you have no defense for trump, just the same old BS rhetoric toward Biden. GTFOH!
Pence: we built 50 thousand more house than Obama/Biden did.... of course we burnt them down first.
I think you are a bit mixed up here.  Look at who's in charge now and how this would all go away, "Like a miracle." That or just like the #LiarInChief you think if you slander Biden with the shit speed by trump, you will win?
&gt;Man, can't believe Bernie would rather side with Biden/TERF  Fixed that for you.
I finally stopped laughing ... You actual said Biden was ignoring the science. You are so full of covfefe!  You said Biden is politicizing the pandemic. That is richer than you are, dumbass.
&gt;Somewhere in that empty brain of yours, you think Biden is equal to Trump  Its easy to beat up an argument that you made up.  At no point in this conversation did I say biden=trump.  I did however say TERF = Christian Conservatives.  That I'll stand by, wanna argue on that hill?
Distinciton witout a difference.  What do YOU think is going to happen when a TERF has the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win?
&gt;The fact that Kamala is a terf doesn’t inherently mean that any policy will be implemented.  Yes it does, she will have the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win.  If you think for a moment that doesn't carry weight, then you are deluded.
Hmmmm. I'm wouldn't call it historic as much as I would call it hysterical.  How could Biden pick out someone almost as unlikable as HRC?
Biden will get lost on his way there. Probably end up at the US Senate and wonder why no ones letting him in.
&gt;trans issues aren't literally the only issues in the world  Didn't say it was, but since I'm not getting shit out of Biden in the way of socialism, the next best thing is Trans stuff.  Which I won't get either because Harris is a TERF.
&gt;Why are you deflecting?  I'm not, I'm specifically answering this:  &gt;Infinitely more possible it happens under a dem  &gt;Unless you genuinely think trump and Biden are identical.  When it comes to trans rights? Yeah absolutely.
Do you not see the irony in this response?  “Why doesn’t Biden answer questions?”  “Ask him that.” 🤣🤣🤣
LOL right, because Biden and Harris have absolutely sterling reputations when it comes to transgender people. 😂😂😂
Dont trust Biden,  Biden is asshoe.
The late Arizona congressman “Mo” Udall used to say, “The only cure for presidential fever is embalming fluid.”  #FoxNews
Even more validation that the Biden-Harris ticket is pro-Israel and not a radical leftist nightmare as Trump would have you believe.
Priority #1, get Biden elected  Priority #2, get Trump physically out of the White House  Priority #3, Hold them all accountable for everything they did
Somebody check on   and see if she ok. All the campaigning she did and Biden didn’t pick her. 😂😂. She loses at everything. Maybe she should work with trump if she want to win.
biden talks a lot about justice and support for women so why isn't his female victims getting justice for his sexual assault and misconduct why isn't the kids getting justice for his sexual misconduct why are women even considering voting for a sex offender
From a friend of mine, An interesting take on Biden's perverse nature.
The amount of hypocrisy. Look at some Kamel and Joe Biden history real quick.... Oh thats right the history only matters if you dont like them right?
I just don’t get how people don’t understand that a literal toad would be better than Donald trump.   No Biden is not ideal, but I'd be quick to elect a tree branch over Trump.
Biden will fragged with in her first week.

Then some leftists waffling at me that we are going to win at some point in the undetermined future *if only I vote for Biden and Harris*  I find the entire concept laughable.
Where are you?  Join up with Meidas brothers or Lincoln Project. I know, Lincoln guys hx, but visible unifying of parties behind Biden is so much needed.
I think that trend, if you want to call it that, is vastly overstated. Neoliberalism won, handedly. You even have Biden flagrantly telling progressives, much less socialists, to not vote for him.  Now I'm given the choice of a rapist and a transphobe vs. a rapist and a transphobe

How about Trump show some leadership with the virus. It is killing Americans.  Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‘Stop playing politics with the virus’.   via
The DNC is the party of rapists (Clinton), child molesters (Biden), and setting rapists free (Hilary, Kamala and just about every Dem governor). Let's not forget easily killing rapist's babies at Planned Parenthood. How does anyone proudly be a part of this party?
Doesn't Joe believe science over facts? Oh wait, he believes in truth over facts. That's right.   I believe in competence over a Biden presidency. #Trump2020
I have not donated to politics since TV ads drive me up a wall. BUT I am now sending money to Biden since the GOP screwing around the USPS has really made me mad.

Biden and his team vetted her. They don’t make huge glaring mistakes like Team Cheeto.
The problem for the dems is they have to make it look like the aliens are pro Biden and anti trump.
I rarely have given money to candidates since they buy tv ads, I don't enjoy. BUT after hearing Trump stopping money to the USPS in order to skew the vote, I am furious and will send $$ to Biden now The USPS deliver our meds but if I didn't pick up my mail he would notify the law
Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.   Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote.  I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now. I think Trump would sell his kids to get re-elected.
Trump thinks he can bully us, by hurting our post office.  Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.  Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote. I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now
I doubt  is jealous of people disguised as journalists who are rather a mouthpiece for the Democrats and the Dems pick Biden! They go hand in hand, Media and Biden! They all are asleep at the wheel!
The truth comes out...Biden will leave office just after taking office and Harris will be President of Dems win!
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Call Joe Biden 'A Racist And A Rapist'
Joe Biden asking people to wear a mask to save lives in not tyranny! What is TYRANNY is Trump dismantling the United States Postal Service to “try” and Winn the election
Second topic during official press conference is actually a campaign attack on Biden. Abuse of office and the bully pulpit.  #ETTD traditions and respect for norms
I hope that the Secret Service for Joe Biden checked the closets in his basement for little girls.
The real question should be who will be Kamala Harris VP? You know Biden gonna resign like two weeks in
Trump thought Biden would pick Karen Bass because she wouldn't 'outshine' him  We all know any woman Biden would have picked would "outshine him!"
Until now, Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Unlike Biden, who capitulated to the Iranian regime,  has done what no other Administration has been able to do, begin the process of peace in the Middle East

It’s interesting that you can replace the name Joe Biden with Donald Trump in that sentence and it’s pretty accurate.
Trump might be bad but he's no where near as bad as Biden. Biden is more racist and has written bills that has put countless blacks in jail
You guys, what 3rd party candidate are you gonna write in? Maybe that way the Democratic Party listens to you. If you don’t want to vote for Biden or Trump, I get it. But explain to me how being silent during the only time you get to be heard is going to help us?
The more important part there is how you don't plan on actively resisting the Biden admin's agenda once he's in office, you'll become complacent instead. If you did then I would forgive you for making what -would be- a reasonable, pragmatic lesser evil choice in voting for Biden.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Yes. Because you know that he is likely to be on a two month temper tantrum and there is absolutely no telling what he will do to make things more difficult for Biden and to get revenge for losing. Maybe they should limit presidential powers after an election loss.🤫
Did you actively #Resist and protest when Obama bombed Libya back into the stone age? No? And of course you're not going to do anything like that when Biden or Harris start a new war, either, because brown people's lives don't matter when a 🟦 president is the one bombing them.
that we need to shot biden with 45 and keep firing till we have a progressive potus 🧐🤔. JS
they didn’t leave us to be honest biden did straight up say if we didn’t like his policies don’t vote for him right there on camera for the world to see. even said to poc if he’s not giving them what they wanted he’s not their choice either don’t vote for him, great 👍 way to win
I am no so desperate to get rid of Trump as to vote for Biden.  I am not so desperate to avoid Biden as to vote for Trump.  My only hope is in the sovereignty of God and that one day Jesus Christ will set all things right and rule in perfect righteousness.
I'm sorry, I just cant vote for Joe Biden because of the KHive and how toxic Joe supporters are. All they do is insult everyone else around them. Frankly, if that's the kind of folks Joe attracts, then why the hell would I want to vote for a toxic person?
Without talking about Trump, why should Joe Biden become POTUS? What are his policies that will actually help poor Americans? Whats his stance on the Military Police force and Mass incarceration? Whats his stance on Deportations? Is he still 4 them?

A vote for Ye is a vote for trump..not saying Biden is any better but we need Chester cheeta out!!
fyi she’s in public office i can judge wtf ever i want, don’t want judged stay out of office. just like the potus. and kiddy diddler biden. or shitty obama. and craps clinton.
she mainly put poc behind bars for pot crimes then admits she was smoking weed in college. also marred a white boy. she’s asian/black. susan rice was a better choice and if a black women was what we needed for change the dnc picked wrong. or was that as close as racist biden can

nope democrats will still blame the far far leftist like us. anyone who admits to not voting for biden they’re going scream and rant it’s our fault he lost. just like 16 all over again. i already know it. i can feel the hate brewing already. they know how to deflect.
Ok, now I know you don't know what it is you're talking about. I guess expecting someone like you to have read books was too much of an ask. Biden is VERY center left, but I guess from your point of view everyone left of McCarthy is a commie.

Think the democrat's were bad when they were the confederacy wait till biden gets in this country will see another Stalin and a rebellion like this world has never seen before
President has been talking for over an hour on Maria Bartiromo's show. In a normal election year, the democrat candidate would be demanding equal time. I doubt Biden could last 5 minutes let alone an hour having an unscripted discussion like that.
Only 5% of all donations goes to the actual cause the rest goes in pockets wonder how much money went in biden's pocket
Biden will bypass congress just like obama and pass pelosi's gun law which takes away your rights to protect yourself teach your kids to do the same and survival skills, ask yourselves why the democrat's want to do this, We can't let biden do this
Let's hear about black people who hate and commit hate crimes no all hate crime are committed by white people but that's all we hear about that door swings both ways biden
Dumb and Deceitful... Biden and Harris... The short bus candidates from the Delesional Democrats who are short on capability but long on hype and unrealistic expections.  Prediction:. Historic landslide victory by  Pokoredicted.
This all feels so poorly timed. He should (not really) be saying that he'll definitely push for schools to be open for the Spring of '21, so whether he loses or wins, he's got an option. If he wins, he can walk out back, if he loses, he can set a time bomb for Biden. Strategy.
Attack Trump but you dont say anything about Biden. Why is that? You guys arent news you are talking heads!
You think he “forgot” that president Trump denounced the white suprematism before finishing or he is just this much a POS? I can answer that. He raised Hunter Biden and touches small children. #4MoreYears
U like Harris... as a black man... knowing she locked up countless young black males for truancy...really these kids now have no future! Just because you might hate Trump you side by her... really 😳 either you think you’re White or some shit or you list your marbles like Biden..
His entire point is that his problem with Biden’s plan to rezone suburbs to stop single family houses and force low-income housing is not fair to those who work hard to live a suburban life. His mention of minorities is to say they too are neg. affected.
Voting for Biden is ancient Israel voluntarily surrendering to the Babylonians.  Voting for Trump is ancient Israel going to Egypt for aid against the Babylonians.  Both choices are immoral.
Indeed.  Both Biden and Trump are reprehensible choices and should both be refused support.  Very simple.
Why would anyone? Who knows man. But voting for a third party or not voting for Biden is a vote for him which is against what progressives want. So why are you even considering Biden/Harris a bad vote lol
But how is voting for Trump taking more of a step toward towards that’s goal then voting for Biden? We all know Kamala will take over in 2 years.
I'm looking forward to President Biden tackling a pile of OE's to cancel all of trumps OE's.
The trump train blasts thru town with no regard for citizens safety and Biden shows he has the strength to pump a railroad hand car.
Views on things like the economy but Trump has no morals, no ability to see things two sides, no remorse for people, and honestly cares more for the unborn than the living, he’s not what we need right now we need hope, for me it’s more byedon than Biden!!!  #lincolnvoter

at least there’s a CHANCE Biden surrounds himself with people who will actually improve the state of our nation.
So since you all went after sticker Carlson last night for not saying Kamalaha name right are you going after Biden since he said the wrong name today. Doubtful!!! why you all suck balls
i genuinely don’t understand the people who are like “well i’m not voting cause biden isn’t any better than trump” okay but like??? you do realize trump is still AWFUL. he surrounds himself with maniacs.
You know who was a big threat to Latinx? The Deporter in Chief Obama. Biden and Obama were sued by the ACLU in 2015 for family separation but please go on about how Joe will be some great savior of America when it's working as he intended it to work with his laws
Under Obama/Biden, I lost 2 different construction jobs. Both times the Owners closed their business because of Obamacare. Under President Trump &amp; Mike Pence I had MANY opportunities to choose from. They say they will create more jobs- LIERS. Will destroy us.
Also, just because I am critical about Joe and his faults does not mean I support the Red Racist Rapist over the Blue Racist Rapist. Look at what Joe's done. Look at who was in charge right before Trump, Obama and Biden. What will Biden do that he didn't do in 8 years?
Do you mean when Biden lied about Trump actually said in Charlottesville.
You’re advancing the narrative to allow Harris to debate Trump instead of Biden. Be careful what you say.
And you’re gonna vote for Biden aren’t you 😕 please don’t break my heart
Biden is not afraid of a strong very intelligent woman, while Trump attacks the women he fears the most as "nasty."  It's Trump's tell.
Two proven public service leaders who will work on behalf of all Americans
Not two days BEFORE Biden announced Harris as his running mate,  was quoted as saying she'd make a "fine choice".  Trump's split personality is rearing its head again.

Both of you do is lie to everybody. If Joe Biden was president right now we would lose 1 million lives to the pandemic.
They were not going to choose anyone else. Needed to be a woman and not white since Biden is about as white bread as you can get
Love this 💯  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Love the Union workers response to biden wanting to fight one of their own for asking a gun question that biden denies ever happen even though he's on video, on video for sniffing hair he denies that are you seeing a pattern yet
#KamalaHarris seems like a woman that would be fun to have on a Girl's Night Out on the town. But her positions have shifted so I'm not sure what she believes. Has she ever said anything on foreign policy? So many of Biden's positions over decades have been wrong.
Biden wants our children to be taught the Islamic religion in American schools. Our children have been told they don’t dare pray in school.. yet he wants this. Take that RED PILL before it’s too late
The Biden/Harris ticket is by no means ideal. But it’s much better than what we have and I’m confident it will be an administration we can work with. Plus Kamala will help pave the way to the White House for so many women of color to follow her
The Biden/Harris ticket has now raised over 10.8 million dollars...
Joe Biden will never be President. Repost if you agree.
Prediction: Biden out at the last minute due to cognitive or “stroke.” Hillary in. Doomed, we are.
My dog got his and is voting for Biden/Harris2020 lol
Incremental change like how Obama bombed more weddings than Bush? How Biden caused more black people to be jailed than Reagan? Not sure the change is going in the right direction there, random bearded white centrist.
Trump has absolutely been sedated for this Biden/Harris Q&amp;A presser.
It only takes a moment to realize that 2020 is not about Trump v Biden. That is the subject of today's 10 minute episode.
Just another HIDIN BIDEN
I would think Biden has many cream of the crop candidates. I am sure they want this nightmare to end as much as we do.
There's a part of me that's glad Biden picked #KamalaForVP because at least she has a law background and has worked to enforce it. BUT when the first thing I saw yesterday was that BLM spokeswoman from Chicago saying looting was fine &amp; claimed they were...
As we all know, if Donald Trump isn't reelected, Joe Biden will get rid of all toilets! That's priority number 2, as soon as he murders God, his number 1 priority.
A good start would for Joe Biden to make Sally Yates his AG &amp; undo the damage done to the Justice Department by Barr!
The confederacy is just trying to save face by picking kamala but all I heard was biden playing the blame game as always and lies will not support a sex offender or corruption
I can see us having 3 months of hella laughs with the Biden/Harris Dem ticket  As long as we bring it on Nov 3rd t Don't take this election lightly, never ever The left is desperate!
So vote for the person who created the camps and the police state, that will fix it right good! We are in this mess because of Biden. They might as well say to America, sit down, shut up, and obey because both sides will lock you up for it. Crime Bill/Cop 2020 FTW!
eight years of obama he didn't help the poor, the disabled, our vets, social security, and black people but he did help hos rich friends and China you can expect the same from biden after all obama endorses corruption criminals stick together
Joe Biden is BEYOND DISGRACEFUL!
Fact democrat's like polis raised Our unemployment rate because he kept small businesses from opening up while corporations stayed open that's the democrat's helping Us more like helping their rich friends Trump has no control over democrat's like that grow up biden
Great speech biden it's all Trump's fault us democrat's have no part in this country falling apart even though eight years of obama is proof of his boosting China's economy not Ours
Oops, Biden mispronounced Kamala’s name, but quickly corrected himself
Biden has the nerve to say, "I will create jobs where President Trump has failed." WHAT A JOKE !!
So one thing I did notice is that MSNBC did not carry that trump announcement of how schools can go back to in person learning. Instead they showed the empty stage at Biden’s event. 👍🏻
Biden's AG is going to be very busy. Lock them all up!
I met Joe Biden 35 years ago and he is the kindest, most gracious and thoughtful man I have met except my husband. Remember he came forward supporting gay marriage on Meet the Press long before Obama. And I adore Obama too. Then there is Jill- more to come.
Why wold progressives say ANYTHING to discredit Biden/Harris? Anytime anywhare Bernie is not the nominee. When you study dialectic world view you know prigress is made when a synthesis is achieved. Black and white merely alternates which isn’t efficacious
&gt;You made the claim that Biden isn’t harm reduction.  Yeah, in the context of Transgender people. My chief complaint against Harris.  Remember?
why would you make a statement like that if you weren't afraid of what Biden brings to the table? You showed your cards about Biden's VP pick being the "Actual" President choice for the Dems and Trump Haters like yourself! You are all terrified "Biden being Alone"
Seems like Antifa solider is inter-changable with Biden supporter.
#JoeBidenISAntifa So! antifa.c0m now redirects to joebiden.c0m Does this mean Joe Biden owns the  domain name? Did he register it? Does he maintain it? Does he fund it? The Antifa page before Kamala update.
Just for a laughs I have to see the Joe &amp; Kamala meetup I hope Biden speaks with the media
What’s happening now in America is Trumps fault not Biden’s 🙄 is Biden the president??? Nope Trump is! He failed at leadership
You've not demonstrated that Biden and Harris record is irrelevant and will be better for trans people. Harris is a fucking TERF, so you've got a big fucking hill to climb.
Tell me, how is Biden/Harris going to be better for transgender people when their records do not fucking reflect it?
Shake me all you want, you cannot devide Biden or Harris from their records. I don't know why a lot of you seem to think their histories are irrelevant. I'm 38, I've seen this song and dance before.
. and  is hours late today. I bet #Biden won't come back out of the basement.  #Trump2020
I just have to laugh when on the Biden Harris page They're crediting Sleepy Joe with his leadership during covid19 Just how do you lead from your basement?
Come on Kalief. What is the problem with Biden/Harris?
I’m not saying “don’t vote for Biden.” In fact I’m actively hoping for Biden’s success. Part of that success is going to involve reaching out to groups he has historically ignored or left behind. Why don’t you try to help out?
Not on your life. Wouldn’t miss the debate! I want to know how bad is Biden is diminishing. GOT MY POPCORN READY🤣🤣🤣
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Said She Believed Women Who Said They Felt 'Uncomfortable' By Biden Touching -- NOT 'Rape Accusers'
Trump is a socialst president who wants to push vaccines on us at warpspeed just as much as biden. But trump is against China so ill vote for him. What china is doing to its ppl and nearby neighbors is appalling and despicable human rights abuse
y'all underestimate how much people will stop paying attention if biden gets elected  nothing will fundamentally change but so long as bad orange man isn't on the news all the liberals will be off to brunch and business as usual, thinking their summer blm ig stories saved america
"I can see Russia from my window, and they're scared of Joe Biden!"
You're a HACK and a FAKE, your word means nothing. Your a LOSER and showed it running against Biden .
Joe Biden Courts Islam, not Muslims
Realistically it should be Trump debating Harris. Biden is a non-factor.
This is the important Biden/Harris coverage right here:
from this story by    “Black women don’t just need one spot. We need representation at all levels of government, business, education — everywhere,”  said. “...I think (Harris and Biden) can make that happen, too.”
Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick sets a match-up between the California senator and Vice President Mike Pence on the debate stage in October.
I did!! You can, too! Chip in to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other Democrats on the ballot
How Joe Biden's #Climate Plan Could Be Transformative - Rolling Stone #ClimateAction #ClimateActionNow #Vote
I murder the left all time. But normy conservatives are so tiresome too..constantly asking now if Kamala still thinks Biden is a racist/sex offender etc. Who tf cares? It’s clear that she has precisely 0 political principles/morals....
liar Tobin, Biden is devout practicing Catholic.
Trump reacts to Biden, Kamala Harris ticket exclusively on 'Hannity' | P...  via   Oh boy #FoxNews  #Hannity must have gotten his knee pads out to get Chief  on.... Check it out.
So half the TL is telling me they dislike Biden/Kamala’s voting record more than they dislike what we’ve seen from a Trump led adminstration.   Hypothetically, what do you think Trumps voting record would be had he been a lifelong politician?
donald trump's greatest weakness is someone just saying 'oh for sure man' to him. in many ways, that makes joe biden, a guy who can only say stuff like, 'cmon man, what are you, smoking pcp? am i in an opium den right now??' the perfect opposition
Translation of  "I thought I fooled Biden by all my talk of her being a fine running mate and he'd look elsewhere. Now I'm shitting my pants because I'm going to get beat like a two dollar--well you know--those people I pay for sex."
I can find citations that say Biden/Harris2020 - We'll still kill your kids, just hide it better
N he just recently named her his running mate. She still fresh on that ticket while this matter has been about Biden v Trump.
I have called both trump and Harris evil so there for you know who I’m picking from the two of assumption? And I’m not a fan of Biden lol it’s not hard to see that the American people don’t have much to choose from and these are our options and you have every right to feel a way
I’d bet she’ll be part of Biden’s admin if they win. There’s still a ton of people who need to be brought on board.
My disagreement with her being a running mate to Biden has nothing to do with how i place my vote this election and second the vote is between Biden and Trump
I am going to be upfront, neither Biden nor Harris are my first picks. but I sure as shit am voting for them to get this russian infestation out of our leadership. Let's get our house in order, and make it our house again, then let's talk about other candidates.
Very interesting.   via
Yes, yes please. Biden and/ or Harris should do this daily. Bring in guests. When no ones watching the Cheeto Rambling Rally maybe they’ll stop the s**t show.
So we have a senile rascist segregationist in #Biden and a leftist who's father admitted that their family was one of the largest slave holders in Jamaica in #KamalaHarris for the #Democrats.
I'm not ecstatic about Harris, especially not now. But I think this election may decide *whether* we still have the ability to vote in future elections.   So, I hope the country elects Biden and then continually turns up the heat under the entire Democratic party.
Really looking forward to Biden's sad excuse for debate...
Already talking of #Biden 's step down. That was quick.
How about cheating, stealing or lying? Trump has probably had something to do with abortion in some way or form. Your group needs to re-evaluate it’s spin on Biden/Harris stop preaching and start teaching...
One example that will support my case is literally last year, Kamala Harris endorsed several women that claimed Joe Biden touched them in sexually aggressive ways. And now she’s going to work with him in the White House ? Yeah ok.
That isn’t well-regulated capitalism &amp; it’s why you need democratic governments, to address these kind of externalities. Free market fundamentalists that support Trump want businesses to address these problems. Tell me how not voting for Biden is going to solve them.
It was really just probably the way I read the tweet when you said oh well fuck everyone else. I care about the election hence the reason why Im voting for Jo Jorgensen. Will that help our current president? Possibly but I see Kamala Harris and Biden as an equally horrible choice
New drinking game: take a shot every time Biden sniffs Harris. We gon' get turnt this election season!
I back America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸! Biden and Harris will make it great again!!! Let’s gooooo!!
Janet Reed a democrat activist arrested for election tampering on 400 ballots it's already started that's why biden is for mail in ballots only way he can win just like obama
Why would anyone in the great nation vote for Joe Biden knowing he’s just going to step down?
You scared? I bet you are  !  &amp; Biden are going to clean the floor with you and your side kick Pence (trump’s lil bitch)!
this is obamacare I have a endrinal dysfunction feels like I've been hit with 110 house electrical 24/7 dr says I'm not sick enough to help because I take a pain pill for my level 8 pain I'm in 24/7 if I stop taking it they will help me don't let biden get in office
Honestly when it comes to the two choices of Biden x Harris or the other bafoons in the White House, it’s kind of like you just have to pick the better evil. They all suck and don’t have any interest in the American people but to take their money.
Biden is going to crash and burn. Obama and Rice had the foresight to avoid going down with him.
Why would I want to give millionaires more money already stole enough from The People biden along with your son
Oh, I think Dodd really doesn't like Harris, but I was interested in why Biden didn't shut that shit down..
If I was  I'd do the following: - Put  next to unhinged    - Use #California's failures for what #BidenHarris want  - Play the video on loop where #KamalaHarris called #Biden a #rascist   -Address Harris as the real presidential candidate
Do you think Biden let Dodd savage Harris in the press, to see how she would handle it? Seeing as how Trump will be a total racist, sexist asshole..
She's hoping to be #1 soon after Biden comes out of the basement. 🤣🤣
Well Kamela Harris will not have to read a script when she goes ahead and implements amendment 26 shortly after Joe Biden as president
Anyone Voting for Joe Biden is putting our Country in a Dooms Day device.  #WeAreDoomed
2 years, then Biden will be declared mentaly unable. She will then be able to run for 2 more terms, if elected giving her 10 years! I can't even imagine!!!!
Biden is a moderate.  You seem to have problems grasping that.  Harris is also more moderate than one might think.  Now, I do realize your reactionary authoritarian wing of your party, but seriously?
Yes. 45 has always behaved like a child. Expect no less and vote Biden/Harris 2020.
Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
I already hated biden, but was going to vote for him.  Kamala? Peace the fuck out.   Voting for myself in November and voting progressives down the ticket.
The fact that  called Biden a racist and said that she believed the sexual misconduct issues with him but switched it up 180 now is fascinating
No we’re just excited for someone worthwhile like AOC to be president and not “Nothing will fundamentally change... no one’s standard of living will change under my administration” Biden
We can't, if he had selected a progressive VP? Maybe you could make an argument there. Instead he chose a cop who relished making all kinds of people's lives more difficult.  I won't vote for Biden/Harris for the same reasons I won't vote for Trump/Pence.
You've the right of it.  Both tickets (Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence) have a LONG history of making transgender people's lives unnecessarily difficult.   So I'll be voting 4 myself and voting progressives down the ticket. Liberals can kiss my commie ass. All of it. Every last inch
You keep talking about this as punishing Biden, I'm not defending his shitty record. I'm saying having him in the Executive seat will be significantly better than Trump in the seat in 2021. "Deserve" is the wrong word, what's best for marginalized communities? Trump?
It’s almost like no one is excited for the next administration and their entire platform of being “not Trump” and are looking forward to after Biden/Harris so we can do worthwhile things like M4A finally.
So will the democrats with their endless republican or pro-corporate policies.  I am pretty sure Biden will lead to an even worse Trump.  Much like Clinton led to Bush, and Obama led to Trump.    There is no spin on winning.  It's a lose/lose/lose situation, by design.
Biden sucks though. Sure Trump is worse but I've done this lesser of two evils since Bush/Gore.  U're smart you know a lot of shit and explain it in great detail but you're just wrong on this Biden shit. There is no real choice. U just haven't been disillusioned but give it time.
I’m gonna be voting for Biden/Kamala with one hand and scrawling“fuck the police” on the wall of the booth with the other hand.   Seriously though- both these problematic candidates respond to political pressure, and NOBODY is better at political pressure than BLM.
Well for the uneducated majority of America, people will see that she’s black and a woman and automatically vote for her+Biden. Sensible people know she’s horrible.
“Then enemy of my enemy, is my friend” Biden/Harris.....”Plan, plot and strategize, but bomb first” (Tupac).
Highlighting the differences between Biden and Harris, too spiteful to realize, it’s the exact reason she was chosen.  Strategized from the advisory of Obama.
Lol  doesn't comprehend how someone can be honest and tell someone when they are upset with them over an issue, then resolve it.   HIS ANSWER TO SOMEONE UPSET WITH HIM... FIRE THEM OR UNLEASH MILITARY FORCE UPON THEM. HE DOESN'T GET IT!
of course joe biden picks a cop. but also a black woman getting closer to the oval. but its still ACAB
Kamala Harris will be a good VP. But I am bit surprised that Biden didn’t pick me.
Strategically, Biden made the perfect pick. It wasn’t to hard using common sense either.
..and that's what our country needs right now.  you sold out completely to   So shut up altogether. #Biden/Harris2020
Pick your fighter:  8 years of Biden  or  4 more years of Trump, followed by 8 years of    Got damn, that’s a tough one
Fantastic!!
I can't imagine Trump, a man whose ego lives in a glass house, choosing anyone as strong as Sen Harris for a job in his admin.  Kudos to VP Biden for choosing someone who will make him a better president.
Of course not!! That's why I love looking for the earpieces they wear and listen the pause when they answer questions to listen to the person feeding them their lines via the earpieces! Nevertheless, Biden will gloriously go down in flames during the debate with Trump.
I’m a white guy who is very anxious to get my Colorado ballot in the mail and vote for Biden/Harris. I was torn during the D debates between Harris and Warren. After Harris dropped out I was happy to vote for Warren. But now I get to vote for Harris too!
I need a Biden/Harris coffee mug.
is so damn stupid and keeps changing the narrative.  Today he says that if Biden wins then Iran will own our country.  Yesterday he said if Biden wins then we’ll all be speaking Chinese because China will own our country.  Jesus Christ, can he make up his mind?
Only because I have 0 faith in any third party victory and Biden/Harris is an easier evil to deal with than another 4 years of the Fascistsaurus.
We already figured out that Biden is also a fascist since he said nothing would change under his presidency. So, back at you bud.
Does anyone else remember when Kamala Harris said she believed the women who accused Biden of touching them inappropriately, just last year? And now she's his....running mate? Just me? Cool ok bye 👋🏻
Trump is a fascist. Biden specifically said nothing will change. What does this make Biden?
Does Biden know who he picked?
I thought someone here said that they weren't voting for Biden, but whoever he picked for VP.  But yeah, that seems to be the thought now.
I really get sick and tired I'm hearing all of you Marxist a****** saying that Joe Biden this and Joe Biden that. Joe Biden is sitting in a corner drooling on himself.
She also called Biden a racist.
QUOTES LIKE THIS (AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM FROM HARRIS) NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN TRUMPS ADDS! BIDEN IS SO CLUELESS; HE DOESN'T RECALL ANY OF HARRIS RADICAL CHARGES IN THE  DEM DEBATES! THEIR CAMPAIGN  SINK LIKE THE TITANIC!
Fact Check: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT 'Confirm China Would Prefer Joe Biden'
She is against fracking. She favors $ benefits for illegals. She calls ICE the KKK. She believed Biden’s accuser. She jailed many minorities as DA. Ask her about Willie Brown’s “help” 🤭.
She slept her way to where she is. I don't think a majority of Americans would want her to take over as president when Biden can't. Trump wins!
She was "mean"? Coming from someone who follows a guy who says you don't even have to ask women... "just grab em by the pussy"... a man who called Mexicans rapist and murderers... discriminated against Blacks so often that he was sued &amp; you say Harris was MEAN to Biden?  LMMFAO!!
Seeing right and left wing pundits lose their minds on Twitter over Kamala being Biden's VP pick fills me up with an intense joy at witnessing the deluge of their combined tears.
I wonder who Kanye will choose for VP? 🤔  I'm already bored with Biden/Harris.  #Trump2020

5 Things to Know About Biden's VP Pick, Kamala Harris
😂😂😂 Biden was part of the administration that started doing it😂😂😂😂   the democrats have  officially gone off the deep end
"Team" Trump is a fan club and dissent of the leader is not allowed.  Biden is building an actual team. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020
Sorry, but the racist who still support that, love Trump, not Biden! Nice try though, hypocrite!
I'm losing count on all the pro #Biden troll accounts just started the last couple of months.
#KamalaHarris has turned her back on #Biden sexual assault accusers and ALL WOMEN by accepting the #VPPick! #MeToo
#KamalaHarris believes #Biden sexual harassment accusers.
Pick Biden = Die of climate change, he wont do enough Pick Trump = Die of climate change, just a little faster Pick a third party = Die of climate change, one of two above win anyway Pick Revolution = World's ability to fight climate change obliterated Welcome to the end
They're afraid of Harris because they know if Biden wins she's the 47th POTUS and they DO NOT WANT THAT.
Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his VP running mate.  She isn't African American. She is Jamaican and Indian...but bet they spin it different.   Feel energized yet?   Didn't think so.

I bet Joe Biden told  "If you don't run as my VP, then you ain't black!"
Upset to hear that I was not Joe Biden’s VP pick. I thought my platform on banning pumpkin rav was compelling but alas
Well said, Linda! I, too, am a lifelong republican and I'm voting for Biden. Donald represents everything I oppose and he stands for nothing. #RepublicansForBiden #thelincolnproject
Tell pelosi to give Us the cure everything adds up that pelosi and her puppets are behind it instead she's waiting for biden to get in so they can sell it to Us
Won't watch him today or in any way let him ruin a great day for team Biden and what is simply bad news for Trump and that other guy...oh yeah, Pence.
Biden/Harris 2020. Watch your soup Joe
Not ONE thing you just said about Biden is even remotely true!!!
biden's own words I will help my rich friends with obamacare, We will BUY clean energy, I never did that even though he's on video, I support corruption as long as my friends and me get rich,  I'm for socialism that's the only truth he has told
You're so hot on the defensive, you don't even realize I'm saying your candidate of choice SHOULD have more of a chance on the ballot.  I'm voting Biden because I understand how our broken system is currently works and the stakes involved in this race. But we should change it.
I like to have fallen out of my chair when almost in the same sentence he said Kamala was so nasty to Biden  then he went on to call Sen. Warren not by her name but "Pocahantas".
Good thing Biden/Harris 2020 will shut down any of the GOP and Trump's claims they are socialists.   #toolate #feelthebern
". what kind of shampoo is that? Sniff sniff" #Biden
#KamalaHarrisForVP ❤🤍💙🎉 Democrat Joe Biden chooses Senator Kamala Harris for White House running mate
She's the perfect candidate for American "Liberal" mainstream Democrats (center-right in any reasonable country).  This means that she's disliked by both anyone to the right and to the left of her. Just like Biden.
I'll never vote for her or Joe Biden. #CorruptPolitians
Listening to Trump talk about the "Radical Left" while addressing Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris for VP in 2020. Has he(Trump), in the last 10 years, said "radical right? Not that Trump is a far right, or even "radical right", he's just talking to his base.
Biden only had 2 things he was looking for in a running mate,  according to all reports &amp; interviews he gave. Democrats 100% AGREED! Sad it was SUPERFICIAL qualifications. 🤦‍♀️ PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RACE OR GENDER! HE WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE AMERICA🙏🕊TRUMP2020🇺🇸
BTW: It was Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden who cleaned up the Bush/Cheney mess. They did it once, Biden/Harris will do it again!
I want Biden to win 😕 just stating the real
🎵🎶There's gonna be a hoe-down in the ole town toniiiiiiiiight!🎵🎶  Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
First question(s) for Kamala Harris; What is your perspective now on Joe Biden's past views on school busing? What has changed, if anything, and what to you want the American people to understand about Joe Biden as it relates to this issue?
I hate Biden’s VP pick...I really do, but I hate the prospect of 4 more years of Trump even more.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been who I wanted on the ticket all along! You got my vote easily! Let's take our country back! #BidenHarris2020
when biden drops out she is the presidential pick
Biden pick proves the DNCs confidence in their ability to cheat.
Ladies and gentlemen...trump is showing you how chickenshyt scared he is of Biden/Harris
Time to start the clock before she "doesn't kill herself." Especially with the Biden VP pick.
I had hoped it would be her. Biden needs someone who will stand up for what she believes is right.  Will fight for him. Will tell it like it is.
November can’t come soon enough! #VOTE2020  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate  via
Do Dems think their black constituents forgot how Kamala took Biden to task about his racism? "Oh, just kidding.  He's fine. Vote for us!"

Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate?
I think Biden picking Harris just pissed off half of the Nutbags. The other half are still figuring out if it's good or bad. What a bunch of lost people.
Biden: *names a major perpetuator of the police state during a time where police abolition is gaining momentum* Some of y'all: "Oh god! A band that's fun to make fun of is teasing something!"
This election is a shitshow.  Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  Who's got a black pill I can shovel down and does it come with cyanide?
i guess i'm not surprised but god damn biden really wants voting for him to be as torturous as possible huh  acab
BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  If I were trump and/or pence, I’d be quivering in my boots…!!!
Thrilled with the choice of Harris. She will make a meal out of Pence wait an appetizer. He doesn’t merit entree status. Biden/Harris  2020.
Your starting to sound like Biden you old fool.
“But not joe Biden, he’s not that smart” 🤣🤣😂💀💀💀
Powerful Team BIDEN/Harris2020
Biden can't remember...🤷‍♂️😂😂😂
Wow, Biden just picked Kamala Harris for his VP. Just when I thought they could not fill their "stupid bucket" any fuller. She's a FAKE, so she will be a good fit for Biden.
Yes of course, as soon as I hear Biden/Harris, I think extreme radical left.....🤣
THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU MR BIDEN!!!!!!!!  The re election if DONALD JOHN TRUMP will be absolutely DELICIOUS.  Thank you so much
Kamala is Biden’s VP pick.  So much fun ahead for obvious reasons.
And yes, you will be elected !!! Biden !!

Bruh I knew Biden was gonna choose Kamala Harris. I just knew it
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate  via
Yes they are. Joe's Crime Bill is what created the state the Police are in right now. Joe's bill did everything but "put the death penalty for Jay Walking" - Joe Biden -1994   But sure, lets go on how he will fix what he created.
Honestly, if you had asked Trump insiders off the record at the beginning of the Democratic Primaries, a Biden/Harris ticket would have probably been at the top of their "Worst Case Scenario" tickets to go up against.
Here's my prediction......Kamala will NEVER become President of the US.  Neither will Jill Biden.  er....I mean Joe Biden.  Got confused since Joe's wife has had more appearances on socialist networks than Joe has.
here's a friendly reminder
I'm not lying. Joe Biden wrote the Crime Bill that locked up millions of Black Americans. Joe's Crime Bill militarized the police force but sure, go on how I'm Lying about Joes Record. Hell, Under Obama/Biden, the ACLU Sued to close the Camps. But sure Jan, He's fixing it
THIS IS WHO IT HAD TO BE!! I AM SO PROUD RIGHT NOW!  ALL THE HATE WEHAVE HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH FOR THE LAST YEARS... HOW REFRESHING!!! CONGRATS   WAY TO GO   #BIDENHARRIS2020

I’m just relieved that Biden didn’t screw this up
Kamala will be the bridge between the old between the Obama/Biden Democratic Party and the new progressive path forward. This is the news we all needed

And also, who will help Biden take away our windows?!
Why are you defending her? There’s NO excuse for someone that is supposed to be educated like her! You people don’t give Trump a break but you’ll give someone like her a break. You give Biden a break too for the racist comments he makes? Of course you do!
"Mr President, we are reporting Biden has picked Co-VP's in both Rice and Harris, your reaction!"
Fact check is that this is not joe biden operating this account. Stupid ppl that say fact check at the beginning lets you know their ignorant betas
Thats all you got? He swallowed up everyones time? What policies do you feel Biden has that are better than Trumps? Do you feel Biden is more adept at leading than Trump? If yes, how so? Biden being in politics for 49yrs and not done anything he says he will do is ok?
They were chosen for their skills as well. Biden knows how to vet and he does it well. All the women in the running have all the skills they need. We’re back to the cream of the crop choices, no more bottom of the barrel.
Also, Joe Biden
The only thing worse than COVID-19 . . . BIDEN-20!  They are both driven by the Popular Media and not necessarily the truth!
I just want to order my Biden/VP tshirt!
No! Biden's VP must be willing and capable of being sworn in as president 2025

Please don't be blind! Donald Trump NOR Joe Biden are fit candidates to run this country! To much selfishness/fraud in reps and dems! I know libertarians have a bad name because of all the radicals, but  has a good idea on how a free country is supposed to be ran!
Hey! It’s Joe Biden As a kid! Same story, different song!!! 😂😂
Well said. I can see both sides normally. Just can’t understand anyone overlooking all the horrific things about Biden without even getting into sundowning.

I hope so. No more speculation about Biden's admin picks...Naming Cabinet members now will reassure voters that Biden is the ONLY choice, AND, it'll REALLY piss Trump off!
Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via   VP  is this reporting true? I only take  's reporting with a grain of salt...But still VP  is this true?
Anyone else see how #Biden is just saying what  already done and is doing? #Trump2020
Biden also can't wait to hear who was chosen for him!!
You know what will keep Trumps ass in office? If he starts a new war. I don't trust him and Biden ain't much better. Dude takes way too many bong rips before his basement rallies. Hahah! Man. If that was the case. We need a leader that bring us together. 🌳
NEWS UPDATE: Biden has been soooo busy...the announcement of his VP will be delayed...

Amen, Ma’am, I am right with you.  Trust Biden to choose well for our nation.
No. One. Cares. You aren’t winning this election.  🇺🇸🇺🇸Biden 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
As Mr. Varvel points out, Biden's head is missing a few pieces.
The only thing threatening Our democracy is the democrat's they are fighting for socialism look how well that worked for Lebanon now the people over thrown their government from all the corruption and now have no government that's biden that will be Us
White people are not keeping black people from voting it's politician's like biden who use black people to get in office use gangs to control their votes and Lewis knew this and did he march on hos fellow democrat's to change that
Biden will destroy America.
needs to get off the pot. Pick a damn VP already Joe! I like  She’s smart and she offers a contrast to Biden’s old school mentality. But whatever he does, he needs to do it NOW!
preferable option to  who is actively and transparently trying to dismantle this country. As a Republican,I will be voting for Biden because I see even more disaster if we have another 4 years of The Orange Clown we have now.
needs to be VERY careful in the coming weeks. This election is Groundhog Day. In 2016, we had two very unpopular candidates. And here we are again. Biden has a lot of baggage and he does make truly uncomfortable statements. However, a Biden Presidency is much more
Plus she has experience with Biden having served on the Obama administration.
I eagerly await Biden's announcement for his VP.

So.....Biden-Harris 2020 huh?
Can we throw out the "he's mentally unfit" platform against Biden yet? They're both mentally unfit, obviously.
Give it a break Biden tweeters, he's lost already, mentally and physically.
Dr. Biden, a request.   Suggest to Joe that he should publicly support the relief package by . . and .   We need it.
So John Kaisch is going for Biden who has said himself he's got the most progressive platform ever. Don't see anything conservative about that, but its not a surprise. Many elites and life long politicians are going for Biden so they can get or keep their power.
Fact Check: Joe Biden Has NOT Promised To Outaw Gas-Powered Cars If Elected President

It’s a good thing we have this guy instead of Joe Biden, right? Imagine if you had someone up there whose mental acuity wasn’t ... oh, wait. Never mind.
How the hell did we not want Biden or Harris and now they’re telling us Biden and Harris is our only hope? I feel cheated.
Wasn't it possible when Obama and biden did it?

Haven’t the Democrats run Chicago for years? And it’s still as segregated as ever? What makes people believe Biden has the answers to racial and social injustice? When local officials can’t even take a step in the right direction
via  Trump does not understand how pathetic he is in comparison to President Lincoln or any other President.  If he were a gentleman he would resign instead of putting the nation through more of this.
Let’s let former VP Biden run his own campaign shall we?  I trust him to do what he believes is best.
Biden was never my first choice for a candidate. As an Independent voter, I'm really getting weary of voting for the lesser evil. If it were any other election, I'd be voting Jo Jorgensen, but this isn't any other election. Biden has my vote regardless.
Of course I'll vote. I voted for Sen Warren in the primaries but VP Biden HAS to pick a black woman.          times they are a-changing.
Ever been polled if you were voting for  or  I haven't. The polls say that #trump is only 3% behind #Biden.   I do not trust them, but 3% is within the margins of error &amp; about the same as when the #FakeNews said  was going to win in 2016!
Sadly, both Portland and Seattle have small, hardcore groups of anarchists who don't really have a vision beyond destroy it all. They don't care if they hurt Biden. They just revel in chaos and don't care who they hurt. This is not Antifa or BLM or Dems, they're just destroyers.
You mean the China Virus which started in China and Trump restricted travel from China to stop the massive infections of American citizens?   The policy that Biden and the Dems thought was racist.
It's August 10th, 2020 and Joe Biden has yet to pick a running mate OR do an in person interview.   Thus far, no info from the   #JoeBiden #Biden2020

Almost as creepy as Joe Biden.
Why does the #Biden2020 campaign make choosing a VP feel like that weird show "The Bachelor". Will Biden present his VP w a Rose!? #Enough WE WANT #DEMOCRACY not another reality show failure!  Ambition Has Always Been ‘Ladylike’
Seems to me that there are a lot of Republicans doing videos stating they will be voting for Biden!! Guess they finally realized Trump is unbelievably stupid!
A great reason not to vote for Joe Biden.
As a liberal, I don't think  is the guy. Sorry, not sorry...  y'all claim I can't have proper ideals or leadership because I have a stbi (brain injury) 2 years ago after a mugging, but Biden has a WORSE stbi that's 32+ years old, and y'all don't even blink. H i larious
He looks very unimpressed that Biden wants to talk to him.

Just another lib name calling. I asked if there is anything you can tout that Biden has done or is planning. And your response is he's never been Pres. So for the first time during a pres election, a candidate's record and platform don't matter.
People who want Biden to pick a woman POC  will vote for him whether he does nor doesn't.  Biden should pick Al Franken.
You used Biden and “think” in the same sentence
Sitting around thinking today ...How TF has Biden not gotten the VIRUS yet He sniffs everyone
This was about Biden's OBVIOUS dementia. Behind a podium he's funnier than bad lip reading. What have you offered that was of any substance.
Nancy Pelosi said, “China would prefer Joe Biden” to be president.   Here's why:  -Biden led the effort to grant China “Most Favored Nation” status &amp; supported their membership to the WTO   -Biden was the leading pitchman for the TPP which would have killed 450k U.S. jobs
Interesting video. In summary, Democrats need to do their job. I've  never thought Biden was the answer to everything. I still consider myself  unaffiliated but one step at a time. Trump must go.  Then still a lot of work to do. I don't know how anyone keeps up. Exhausting.
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
ask yourselves why is biden sooooooo afraid to debate Trump a real leader wouldn't be
Remember when you ran away from Andrew Neil like a little bitch? Pepperidge Farms remembers. I wouldn't trust a guy that gets murdered on tv by the likes of Andrew Neil to be able to offer any competent diagnosis of Joe Biden's faculties.

Nor have the Democratic Party who has had ample opportunity in Senate hearings with AG Barr &amp; recent subcommittee hearings and have refused. Nor has Joe Biden that I’ve seen anywhere.
Everybody has their own percentages to this, but I'm convinced Tom is describing reality here for a lot of people.  If Trump wins, I think it will be because those same people look at Biden and his masters and see zeroes on the right side of problems and solutions.
Except KFC would come out and disavow and condemn the arsonists. BLM has not, nor has the elected Democrats in office, nor has Biden.

If trumo doesn't get reelected he's fired. Biden better fires the whole bunch of them.
Keep wondering where does biden want to buy this clean energy I know polis and hinkenlooper want to get it from Canada because they both invested in companies up there which is a violation of Our Constitution
Colo. great example we get all these companies to move here then the democrat's tax the shit out of them so they pack up and leave taking their jobs with them that's obama that will be biden
biden keeps saying Trump is helping his rich friends what rich friends did obama help besides the democrat's let's see China, insurance companies, the medical profession, and car manufacturers
biden and pelosi keep saying they are fighting for democracy but want to turn this country into socialism which will take Our rights away and make the poor even poorer helping the rich get richer

I think the evidence for Obamagate is too overwhelming for ppl not to do time, that said, these elites seemingly get away w everything from illegitimate war to fondling children so who the fuck knows.   No need for him to spy on Biden, he’ll sabotage himself every time he speaks.
I read it and Cates is on to something here. Makes me think the reason they nominated Biden was to give him (and them) cover on the Ukrainian scam. Anyone seen Hunter lately? Wasn't he supposed to go to court with his baby momma?

When Biden wins, Trump will immediately get on twitter stating the election was rigged and corrupt. He will then do a press conference stating the same and does not accept the results, and will sue. His final thing will be to not peacefully transfer power to Biden!
Sure but we can say that about 50% of Americans. My point being let's not get catty now. Biden will produce many opportunities to needlessly critique and this is what people hate about elections. He's done enough to criticize without stooping to this
Liar! At least Biden isn’t cheating and lying during the election! Character says a lot about a person! As a Christian, character, honesty, compassion and leadership mean a lot to me. Tearing people down is not what Jesus would ever do.

Joe Biden's decision to select a Black women for VP is totally racist and confirms his extreme pandering to the Black community. The percentage of Blacks to the U.S. population being around 13%, selecting a Black woman reduces the field to less than half of the black population.

despite all the plastic surgery biden has done the more I see him and pelosi the more they look related and they both say the same thing look at what I did, " I did it " all they have done is put their needs before America and The People vote them out
if biden was a real leader and has all these great ideas on how to rebuild our country then how come he's not working with the Republican's right now instead he wants to wait while this country suffers to get in office so he can so those famous words I did it

There is a distinction between their two current roles. Trump is the president, Biden is a candidate. Biden's job is to win the election. If his campaign believes that by having him interview, it helps, then it will happen.

The consensus seems to be that our system, as ideally inclusive, is severely flawed. It makes a difference to most progressives (like those in office) that Biden defeats Trump. Whatever-I-wantism is the Trump virus.
The White House is laying the groundwork to say that if Biden wins it's because the Chinese stole the election for him.

Biden's lead is 11 points
So you’re saying you’ll move to another country when Biden is elected?
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.

Good point. I feel as though it’s quite easy to earn my vote against trump tho. Also I don’t think that Biden has any incentive to move to the left
I didn’t elect Biden and Kamala. The democratic establishment shoved it down our thoats and now we have no other choice.
Me too. One guy I talked to for quite a while was pretty cool. I hope I at least got him thinking about some things. He was going to vote third-party. I shared all the reasons Biden shares my values and Trump does not. Who knows if I made a difference. Hopefully I did.
I was afraid too! This was my first night. Lots of nerves &amp; technical difficulties. But yes, one guy I talked to for quite a while was really nice, open to talking. He plans to vote third-party but thinks Trump is a great businessman. I shared the reasons I’m voting for Biden.
I mean, I hate Biden and Kamala with all my guts. They’re practically republican. But even 8 years of them is better than 4 more years of the hell Trump is carting is towards. Calling them out for old shitty policies won’t do anything because they are the establishment.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just came to my house and forced me to eat kale, took my guns and sneered while telling me that Oakland is really in some other country.

I used to not like Yang cuz I thought he was a one issue guy, but since he's out I can look at him somewhat positively since that one policy is a fucking good one. Like I think I can respect that but also he joined the Biden Democrat Homunculus so 🤷‍♂️
I've left a lot out of this rant. Don't shame people for how they vote or if they vote in this election. There's no correct answer. It's just another cycle of ghoulish establishment monsters backed by big corporations like always. I'm voting Biden and I'm incredibly ashamed.
I also think any talk of pushing Biden to the left is a completely nonsensical joke. He cannot give more than empty gestures toward the concept of healthcare as a human right, he's backed by corporate interests like every other candidate, he's racist, and he's a rapist, and more
I'm painfully aware of what it means to join forces with ghoulish conservatives to steal the throne, it happened in 16 and will likely continue to happen as the overton window shifts further to the right.  It's for this and more, that I can't possible imagine canvassing for Biden
Because of that, I can't help but feel guilty if the state turns red or continues purple. I feel like I'm being manipulated into voting for someone, now two someones, that I despise.  Biden is a perfect example of moderates sacrificing any values or positions to consolidate power
I've been stuck back and forth on voting Green or Biden this election for the past 4 months and I think I've reached a decision.   I'm currently registered to vote in Colorado which has had a complicated red/blue identity crisis for a while and is currently purple..
Hey Don, I translated your dog whistle: The “white racists” will be voting for me. They fear people &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where people of color would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with a black guy in charge!

In the articles I linked to they say that Biden has moved left here and expanded his climate policy aggressively since becoming the candidate.
Agree. Biden doesn’t need the debates.
My new hot take is that maybe Harris can actually push Biden to the left on some things. idk let's find out
Reminder: Biden is going to lose.
Looking forward to standing with all my “nasty” women friends this fall and electing the Biden/Harris ticket - a start to a better future   #TgetherWeRise
Which is why I agree with you--it is necessary to push them both to be better. And I am optimistic that Harris can be pushed leftward, far moreso than Biden. She even had an M4A proposal! I hope she pushes Biden to support that kind of thing.
And I don't want to tear Harris down, but I am dismayed, constantly, that Biden and Harris occupy an ideological space that is, at best, orthogonal to my own, and that through them, the DNC is trying to secure a 12-year electoral dynasty with worryingly limited goals.
Here’s more about Biden’s climate policy. I need to read up on this. There’s stuff I like and stuff I don’t. I live in a state with an economy very dependent on fossil fuel production, and I’d like that to go away, but it has to be done right.
Part of Biden’s climate policy is to hire laid off fossil fuel workers to help cap abandoned wells that are leaking methane. I love this idea.
I'm not trying to be obtuse about this, but I have eviscerated Biden on here plenty, because he has a bad voting record on a lot of things! I'm a socialist, and I am going to be disappointed with anyone we nominate who isn't.
It doesn't seem as simple to me as simply promoting anti-capitalism in the discourse, because that's not a position that either Biden or Harris is going to pick up.
Agree. I discuss in my book how Biden was behind many horrible crime bills &amp; I don't buy the revisionist history of Harris as anticarceral.  But they are political creatures &amp; tough on crime isn't popular now.  I'll swallow the bitter pill bc the alternative is sickness &amp; death
Sadly, many of the Yang/Bernie  YT influencers have devolved into pouty-assed whiners instead of strategic thinkers. They likely haven't READ  Biden's platforms on healthcare + other policies, which, PS, they'd like FAR more than Trump's (who is currently working on gutting SS)
Let’s be clear, joe Biden could probably have picked Tomi Lahren for VP and I’d still vote 😓
While not perfect on criminal justice, Kamala Harris sponsors the Green New Deal, backs a carbon fee and dividend, and focuses on environmental justice. We need this to prevent climate change from stealing society as we know it!
I can not support a pedophile in office. Flat out, i know logically he is the upper option. But morally i can not bring myself to support either of these candidates. I have no supportive evidence of my claim that biden is a pedophile just strong intuition based on some actions
If  can vote for Joe Biden then you can.
Just for receipts: I still think it's very likely that Trump will dump Pence &amp; pick Ivanka. Pence brings nothing to this off-the-rails sideshow &amp; you KNOW Trump cannot abide Biden getting credit for choosing a woman VP. He is gonna pick Ivanka, also because I think his plan is 1/
and just like after Biden took the primary lead, white liberal twitter is responding to anyone who raises legitimate concern over Kamala with “we just need to get Trump out!!!!! herstory is being written!!!!”
Yeah and you don’t acknowledge the fact that this administration inherited a good economy and did nothing to improve it. Just maintain it. They never hit any quarterly highs more than Obama-Biden. Look at the whole picture next time
On Climate, Kamala Harris Has a Record and Profile for Action

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came over last night and forced me to billet an entire caravan of Central Americans, and they turned my shower to drip mode.
Kamala was a co-signer of Bernie’s M4A bill, Biden literally let Bernie write his climate change policy (which would be a slightly better alternative to the Chinese hoax that it is currently), Biden called to defund the police, Biden wants affordable secondary education, etc.

Perhaps not, because Biden already has the state locked up.
If they had chosen to back Bernie as nominee and then shoved Harris or another centrist onto the same ballot or even picked a more progressive running mate for Biden it could have united the party bc both sides would feel like their voices got heard.
The Trump administration is arguably the most aggressively and blindly pro-fossil fuels of any in modern American history. Thus the differences between the Biden+Harris v. Trump+Pence tickets on the climate crisis and fossil fuels are historically stark./4
Republican Lites/Blue Wave Dems will sing the praise of Biden and Harris bc she’s a woc while the actual left will be further alienated because there won’t be actual social change with these two. At best we’ll have an Obama-era admin.

Join us TODAY with  OIA's Senior Director of Sustainable Business Amy Horton and other  members as they discuss Biden's recently released climate plan:
You are correct. If Trump is elected they will no longer have a need to artificially prop up the financial system. If Biden is elected, they will make it crash to prove Republicans are better.
. is more aggressive on environmental and climate justice, the climate crisis and fossil fuels than is Biden. She introduced the Climate Equity Act with  Environmental Justice legislation with  supports a #GreenNewDeal and ban on #fracking.
Those were Biden’s admitted standards for a running mate. It’s not sexist or racist to call someone out for using race or sex as a disqualification for office.
You will do fine, but 98% of Americans will get nothing from Biden/Harris, and will continue to have any abundance extracted.  Other than the theatrics on the news, the actions of the administration will be indistinguishable from the Trump administration.
Jimmy Kimmel could find 10 people on the street, and not one of them would make a worse president than Trump, Biden, or Harris.
Bunch of idiots who hate Trump so bad they can't see how bad Biden/Harris are.  This election is garbage.  Candidates were chosen by the wealth class and promoted by state propaganda to continue wealth extraction and surveillance capitalism.  Revolution or tyranny. That's it.
Fuck. New ad from Trump says Biden/Harris is "Wrong for America". How can anyone argue against that?  #GeneralStrike   Demand congress and the president resign. We need an all-new government.

Since Kamala Harris was named Joe Biden’s running mate people have been talking about Mike Pence and how he won’t be alone in a room with a female staff member because his wife wouldn’t like it or he couldn’t control himself around them or some weird ass thing. My question is,
I profiled Catherine Lhamon back in 2017 and she would be an *excellent* choice for any spot in the Biden administration
I am unclear what political strategy to unseat Trump you are advocating. Or is pointing out Biden/Harris flaws the end goal here?
Election eve 2008 I identified the Zionist Emmanuel heading his cabinet.    Canvassers knocked on my door repeatedly the next day, demanding that I VOTE.  I will not VOTE for Biden.  He picked Kamala   and I said he had to appoint Jesus if he wanted me to vote for him.  FAIL...
Yes. Not sure why the Speaker would be involved in any way. This becomes a law enforcement matter and either DC police or marshals would remove him on a court order. And in any case Biden gets all powers of presidency regardless of where he is.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Donald Trump on Joe Biden's VP pick.
the one thing (singular) to learn from pandemics and brutality is fact (singular, thx TYT); if "we" don't think the Biden ticket has learned to the left we are seriously over-estimating ourselves as "#potential gurus" rather than "#potential progressives"
I don’t feed oxygen to that sort. The follower count may be high, but there’s a closely spaced set of circles in the Venn diagram of Bros, Bots, and Bad actors that like to feed this sort of division.  I’d bet 95% of Warren voters are all-in on Biden/Harris.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Okay so a Biden Attorney General is..... who?Get a Biden sign twice the size
4 of Biden and 4 of Kamala. Still not voting for them though. They didn't earn my vote, but I would rather Trump loses at the end of the day
After Biden becomes President Congress must make sure laws are in place that we don’t ever have a corrupt president like Trump who thinks he can do anything. Look at Post Office the pandemic stopping SSI and Medicaid and racist remarks  a abuse of power

Hahaha! Bubble will burst regardless of who wins. GDP heading for a nose dive.
hillary is so disliked &amp; not trusted she knows she can't be in the front running anymore. but she's still powerful which is why she's choreographed this thing, from biden to harris, from the start.  don't be surprised if joe drops out, harris becomes prez then makes hillary veep.

The DMVs are so backed up I may not have time to register to vote. We need help President Biden.
No doubt. And they keep doing it because they have faced no consequences. We can only hope when Biden wins that changes. For all of them.
It’s okay to criticize our fellow Democrats. Holding elected officials accountable shouldn’t be be partisan. If Kamala Harris is elected alongside Joe Biden this fall, we must hold her accountable for her record as a prosecutor in California.
So shall Joe Biden and Kamala Harris be voted in as President and Vice President. Come November 3,2020 Blue Wave is a Coming to clear the virus out of our white house and our country once and for all. See how it's done come November.
Obama was "You didn't build that," Biden is "I didn't write that."
And I don't care who they choose to be vice president I would like to have choices on my ballot not just Trump and Biden. I might even pencil in Mickey Mouse at least he is still a real American 🤣😂
proof.  show us where biden said he's 'going to take all our guns'.  you can't.  you lie like your father.
If Biden doesn't win 2020, Swampy-donald duck-hitler WILL. I've gotta say Biden's not as bad as the criminal-in-charge now. 2024 WILL BE A DIFFERENT STORY!
someone needs to ask biden if he'll free julian assance, leonard peltier &amp; other political prisoners.
joe biden wants to defund the police and loves the Soviet Union? Sounds great to me, lmao
Interesting how the FAR RIGHT casually ignores this while locking in on the one totally debunked accusation against Biden isn't it?
Mr 'Grab 'em by the Pussy' has 25 claims of rape, including DNA evidence against him while also wishing GhislaineMaxwell  well -- but no let's focus on the totally fabricated and unsubstantiated claims against Biden only lol
Conveniently ignoring Trumps 25 SUBSTANTIATED claims of Rape are we? One with DNA evidence????  Biden's SINGLE accuser has been completely debunked and continuously changes her story.  You all are fabricating lies! #BidenHarris #Biden2020
A vote that's not for Biden is a vote for trump. Just a reminder.
Biden not capable, obviously. So have #CAMELa debate #POTUS45 . Or she not up to it either?
Judge Jeanine says she doesn't believe Biden will be on the ticket for some reason. I have been saying that 4 mos. I have had the feeling that Biden will claim sickness &amp; the party will insert MO &amp; HRC as candidates. I have to say Judge we seem to be on the same wave length.
It’s depressing listening to Trump every day. His presidency is nothing but about him. Forget Covid or anything else. In 2016 Trump degraded Fiona she was ugly. Rubio small hands Cruz his wife ugly too. Trump has his nerve to talk about Harris being mean to Biden. What a joke
just because i trash biden, do NOT take that to mean i support trump.  i hate both of those lying, disgusting sexual predators.
And where is the DNC or Biden?
Biden /Jarris-Heckle and Jeckle.
Biden/Harris. Best gift Democrat’s could give President Trump. LMAO
Defeating Trump in November will not lead to the defeat of fascism. The Republican Party will continue to move towards fascism, naturally pulling the Democratic Party to the right, if the Biden administration doesn't fundamentally change the system
Guess this works for biden now too 😂😜🤷🏽‍♂️
question:  if something happened to biden that caused him to drop out before november...........what happens?  does the next candidate with the most votes (bernie) step in or does the dnc again install who they want?
mine is when she called biden a racist in the debates then kissed his ass for the vp.
Oh did biden buy  ?
Almost too impressive? Chance over overshadowing Biden?
Joe Biden is scheduled to make his first appearance with newly chosen running mate, Kamala Harris, during an event in Delaware this afternoon.
As a senator, Harris has been aligned with Biden on Israel: She is seen as a strong supporter with ties to AIPAC, the country’s largest pro-Israel lobby, and unlike some Democrats has not broached the idea of conditioning aid to Israel to influence its policies.   DEAL BREAKER!
how many times were we told 'we don't need you'? how many times were we trashed &amp; insulted?  NOW they say we have to support biden-harris??  yeah, well, whoever says we have to can go fuck themselves.
net worth of biden:    11 million  net worth of harris:       6 million  just saying.
Sadly Biden barely has enough mental capacity to hold a conversation let alone run a country. The Democratic Party has kept the minority in poverty for a very long time I wish they would do their research and not depend on cnn or major news outlets for information.
you're working on the premise that things will change &amp; get better with biden.  that's the flaw.  both sides work for corporations.
the dnc rigging 2 elections is NOT democracy.  NOT representing what the majority of people want ie med4all, is NOT democracy.  we seem 2 have different definitions of democracy.  biden will fill cabinet posts w/goldman sachs &amp; billionaires .  BOTH parties love their oligarchs.
i'm not a harris fan, but she'll eat him alive.  likewise, trump will wipe the floor with biden.  what choices...ugh.....
while i appreciate your freedom of choice, i do not believe biden will move america in the direction we need. no med4all &amp; his obsession with cutting ss.  i can't believe in all the people in america it comes down to the 2 most crappy choices.  just can't go there-voting green.

Biden is a true dixcrat it seems the Dems want the #altright vote
So I guess Trump is also radical left? He did donate to Kamala's 2014 AG run, ya know! This reflects poorly on both Trump's and Biden's causes lmao
I love being called out by liberals that by criticizing Joe Biden from the left, it makes me a Republican. Bitch, I've gone 7 years strong without ever voting for the GOP. If I'm a Republican, I am absolutely terrible at it 😂
A vote that's not for Biden is a vote for trump.  is a trumpster trying to divide trumps only real opposition.
Best Biden/Kamala take of the day
This is the best thing you’ve done so far President Biden.
sorry bernie, i supported you from 2016 on.  but i will NOT vote for either trump or biden.  both are liars, sexual predators &amp; NOT progressive.  i'm voting green.  the dnc played this....they can live with it!
As a woman, I’m stoked about Biden’s VP pick. As a human, I am filled with hope and excitement for the future of my grandys - Vote #BidenHarris2020
So excited about Biden’s pick for his running mate, Kamala Harris. A great moment in history! What great credentials she has.
I'm so glad that I don't live in a swing state and can vote for an actual progressive ticket without affecting Biden's chances.
What the f*ck are you talking about? It's not like Biden narrowed his choices to Kamala or someone like Barbara Lee... lol, anyway, we know you would be in tears if Tucker Carlson stopped inviting you on his show 🤷‍♂️
While Twitter is buzzing about Biden’s VP pick, FB is obsessed with sex trafficking conspiracies that involve all of Hollywood, everyone from Oprah to Tom Hanks.   We’re seriously doomed. Half the country have completely lost their minds.

Biden will take action on climate change and trump will not:    Biden will fight for a path to citizenship Trump will not:    Biden will reduce incarceration Trump won't:   Can't tell if you're stupid or ironic?
Great choice for VP Mr Biden! Now you Mrs Harris need to urge voters in every state to contact local elections office now &amp; get absentee ballots sent to their homes? Vote before the Nov3rd, #DumpTrump election day deadline! Avoid long lines, broken or sabotaged voting machines!

Joe Biden should’ve just picked any random police chief from around the country lol

Same on a cross country trip right now! 3800 miles and no Biden sign.  Lots and lots of Trump signs!
Kamala Harris is the one who fits all things Biden needs.  One of biggest young people will vote for Harris. Keeping fingers crossed

Never forget and go after Pres. Biden like hell until he relents or his VP takes the reigns.
Biden can't win. What we really need is enough dialogue and inclusive politics to find  a spot on the Trump administration.
Why do u continue ro let Trump go on and on and he is lying about Biden.. Obama has a good health program and Trump has been trying to destroying since day one. Mail in ballots work good because we do it in Colorado.  No problems
He should debate ! Biden show the nation that you are capable of dealing with other leaders of the world without your wife talking for you.
it will go exactly how the last 50 years of his life have gone..lie bully cheat sue sue sue threaten bully  block deflect blame steal cheat lie lie cheat sue sue etc. but in the end  JOE BIDEN WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT. WE JUST HAVE TO PREPARE FOR A MARATHON OF OFFENSES AND ASSAULTS
Lol, hope you're ready for another term. Biden can't win.
Far more than that are against Biden.
The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns not only about Russia, but China and Iran as well, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure, interfere with the voting process or call results into question.
biden is a rude, sick mf!
Didnt see Biden in the mix
Biden is really that dumb isn’t he!
Biden also said he would no longer allow the federal government to confiscate land for the purpose of erecting a border wall, and that all lawsuits between landowners and the government would be dropped.
So are these biden videos an attempt to make him look like an average joe or the campaigns attempt to have him off himself?
I’m so sorry, I absolutely hate Trump. My promise to you is I will do everything in my power to see that Biden is elected.😢❤️✊️
You think the dems would pay more attention to the c19 death toll co consideing those are all votes for Biden #2020Election
Lmao conservatives want a government of control and oppression.  Nothing they do is for the people. Its for corporations. Dems by and large are just diet Republicans.  Like Biden. They arent true progressives
Imagine they take Biden on a WH tour, at the end they have a ceremony thanking him for his service, send him back to the basement thinking he ran, won, and served as president. 🤷🏽‍♂️ #ItsOkayToNotBeOkay #2020Election #2020predictions
Why do you think they keep dumbing people down into believing they have the Holy Spirit, when they don't? Why do you think they created all these distractions, and built a nation that contradicts scripture. Donald Trump, and Joe Biden aren't even real people.
what's with biden?  is he trying to out-orange the orange moron in chief?
I would like to hear you Mr Biden and other leading Democrats urge voters to contact the local elections office &amp; get absentee ballots now! The Republicans own the absentee ballots system and that's why they're against all inclusive mail-in voting during the pandemic! #DumpTrump!
If Biden loses to Trump in the general, that will be absolutely pathetic. Trump's response to the pandemic has been Hoover-level bad. Unfortunately, the Dem establishment would take a Biden loss as, "well, if he couldn't have defeated Trump, no one could have!" We're screwed 🙃
There are two candidates: trump or Biden. If your vote for Biden  is dependent upon his pick for VP you have shown yourself.  This is a privileged mindset.
In handcuffs maybe?? Then Biden can say "This AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT NOW" as part of his speech?
The problem with Biden is, he can't call out Trump on this issue because he's leaning into picking Susan Rice for his VP!
Really didn’t find anything wrong what Biden said when you compare what Trump has said about every race. Gosh making to much of it
anyone who is comparing biden to fdr is either brain dead or....................that's it.  brain dead.Harrrr Is a Great Role Model for little brown &amp; black girls as Biden said.

Tragic these rules went into effect. Share your ideas too!  Biden et al must reverse this  day one when in office. Universities must hold bad actors accountable for bad behavior vs relying on weak policies like these. Never hire bad actors (see Sutton). Use our voices!
Biden has no clue about the virus nor doesHarris. Both have been on the sidelines attacking Trump constantly abot something they know nothing about. Frm the beginningTrump has faced every challenge/solved problems. Laughable Joe could step in &amp; eradicate it immediately.MagicWand?
He will. Biden knows he is a misogynistic, corrupt, criminal liar. It is what it is
President a Trump loves our country &amp; this is one example.  Joe Biden in 47 yrs made himself &amp; his family wealthy by ripping off the country.  The choice to lead the country is obvious.
I've lived in NY and they would never endorse Biden. They are thugs, everyone there hates them
There is a distinction between their two current roles. Trump is the president, Biden is a candidate. Biden's job is to win the election. If his campaign believes that by having him interview, it helps, then it will happen.
I think the so called shaming is vs people who revenge vote. Bernie Bros are all saying they'll vote Trmp, not because they like him, but because Biden got the nom over Bernie
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband’s is... #twocents

Not a criticism of Biden, but you would not the the Second Gentleman, you would be the First Gentleman. Like First Lady, only First Gentleman. CO governor has a male spouses, and he is ‘First Gentleman Marlon Reis.”
Biden is a pedophile
I'm very much not a Biden/Harris fan (they're awful on the few issues that Dems and Libertarians often share common ground on), but I do see a Trump reelection as a systemic risk to our civilization. I wish we had RCV here in CO, that would make this decision trivially easy.
I've voted LP in every presidential election since 2004 (I missed the 2000 election since I was in the Philippines at the time and hadn't even thought of registering to absentee vote). I'm a Coloradoan and planning to vote Jo this time, but might vote Biden if polls tighten a lot

The context in which Biden uses the N-Word twice can’t be denied - it’s very degrading.  Curious if Obama ever saw this.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
Wow - that’s a strong tactic - what’s next - Biden/Harris will outlaw chicken nuggets
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just came to my house and forced me to eat kale, took my guns and sneered while telling me that Oakland is really in some other country.

Listen to this guy and that man in the White House and then listen to Biden/Harris. Ridiculous points and name calling vs policies, details, and intelligent talking points. Also, complete coherent sentences.

Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
I prefer a president who is awesome enough to NOT have to dominate. It's an ugly word. I also prefer a VP who doesn't remind me of a festering boil. Biden/Harris 2020. It's the winning ticket
Definitely will be worried about my civil rights &amp; basic dignity if Biden/Harris should be elected.  You’re The Swamp &amp; will be exposed for your corruption if there’s any justice.  You talk about Beau a lot ~ where’s Hunter?
Dude, I just saw him tell people to vote for Biden/Harris yesterday
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
Finally, we get represented!
After Trump decimates Biden in one debate, let Trump debate Harris!  He’ll take them both down!  He’s been working his arse off 4 years &amp; I guarantee Trump knows all the answers.  Biden&amp; Harris have been on the sidelines demonizing him... and have no idea what’s going on.
It wouldn’t be Biden, that’s for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you’re saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That’s how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn’t be that Trump will clean Biden’s clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don’t buy it. Trump by a landslide.
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
I’d like to report a threat to a protectee.   A television personality is saying that Joseph R. Biden will not live to stand for election.  Her name is Jeannine Pirro and there is video evidence.

You Trump Haters would love to continue hiding Biden by not having debates.  What are you Trump Haters so afraid of??
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
And he has the gall to call Joe Biden creepy!?!?
Notice Biden/Harris didn’t tout any of Biden’s accomplishments or successes during his 48 political career.  It’s bc he had none.  Although he &amp; his family did enrich themselves bc of his corruption.

'I think it's great' – Wall Street execs are glad that Biden picked Harris
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
Biden can’t even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You’ve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
I helped progressive friends of mine during the Obama transition try to make the case for commercial crew/cargo, advanced technology development, and propellant depots, and I'm sure I could work with those groups again if Biden/Harris win in November.
If they won, I would be happy we dodged the bullet of a second Trump term, but wouldn't be super happy about what Biden and Harris would do, especially if they flip the Senate. But I'd also probably be able to work with them and find occasional common ground.
So I guess in some way's I'm actually in the "meh" category. I think for all her faults, she and Joe are at least basically decent human beings, and if CO narrows a bit from Biden's current 13pt lead vs Trump, I could see myself plugging my nose hard enough to vote for them.
But as discouraging as her and Joe Biden's records are on criminal justice issues, somehow Trump and Pence have found a way to be even worse. I could never see today's Biden or Harris encouraging police violence or shielding cops from accountability like Trump would.
I mean, I don't see her as being much worse than Biden or Gore, or frankly much worse than Bill Clinton or Obama. For issues I care about like criminal justice reform, I'm not happy with her record and I'd be less skeptical of her if she'd own her past mistakes as a prosecutor.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Obama on Harris as VP: 'Joe Biden nailed this decision'
I agree. Bernie should have been the nominee; then there was this stupid shift around super-Tuesday.   Yes, we could all do it.  I just don't know how to reach people. Problem is, most folks are I know are already with Biden. And they largely don't care to push for anything else.
My plan is to drop off my mail vote at the dropbox maybe a week before the election. It's unlikely polls will move massively in the last week since a lot of people will likely vote early. If things are tightening (ie &lt;6-8pt lead) I'll seriously consider voting Biden/Harris.
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don’t think people will believe you on Joe Biden.

Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn’t really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.

I'm not in for it. There was almost zero chance of Biden getting my vote, but still. This guaranteed it's just another year of voting green for me. My vote's a protest vote that has (hopefully) enough voters behind it to be noticed. That's important to me. Forever optimistic🙂
I donated. August fund raising for Biden will be through the roof.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
I'm trying to figure this one out too.  Not that I'll be heartbroken merely if Biden loses... I'll be heartbroken only if either Trump or Biden wins, so it's kinda inevitable at this point.
So, I came home today from spending a day with schizophrenic friend (seriously!)  And see that Kamala Harris is Biden's vp pick.  Feels like I never left my schizophrenic friend☹️
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
God fucking no. There wasn't much chance of my voting Biden anyway, but this certainly didn't help him. And I mean that beyond with folks like me... look where Harris polled before she dropped. She didn't excite ANYBODY, even the demographic she was "supposed" to excite. So...
We will all be celebrating for the first time since you screwed up our lives. #Biden/Harris. But enjoy your pity party
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I'm a registered Libertarian, but depending on how close the presidential race is in Colorado, I'm willing to plug my nose and vote Biden/Harris. They may be lousy in many of the few areas that Dems are sometimes good at (immigration, CJR, militarism), but Trump is uniquely awful
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
You didn’t pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we’ve ever seen.  Where’s Hunter?
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
Harris vs Pence on stage. It will be historic. Biden vs Trump on stage will be a massacre.
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
I actually feel a little hope creeping in. #Biden/Harris2020
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
You are a class act, Ambassador. I know that you will play a prominent role in the Biden administration. Let's Go!
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
I bet Biden’s binders are thicker than Mitt’s were.
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
And if ⁦ wins, we’ll have to learn Russian.  Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins but offers little condemnation of Beijing - CNNPolitics
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
We need Florida to send Joe Biden their electoral college votes in November.
Trump also suggesting that men will feel insulted by a woman VP. That should win over the women suburban vote.
If Trump stays in office you‘ll almost assuredly lose your right to choose. If Kasich is willing to go against his personal beliefs to endorse Biden &amp; reclaim America from the grips of the Trump administration (ensuring a pro-choice replacement for RBG) — why are you against it?
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they’re eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.
OMG. And he says Biden is in cognitive decline...  #trump #gop #maga #election2020 #voteblue2020 #rememberinnovember  VOTE BLUE.
I will vote for Biden. I like all his possible VP picks.  Even if he pulls someone I have never heard of out of a hat. I will like her too. ❤️
Biden has always been a Liar.

Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
What I am really, really looking forward to is the first thing President Biden says that triggers Republicans.
If you think #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica will work, given Biden...  I've many bridges to sell you.
To be clear, the entire world prefers Joe Biden. It will be a safer place
thanks for stumpin for Biden!! Woohoo

Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
I don't believe either candidate is suffering from dementia. Internet memes provide scant to zero evidence. Now if you want to compare their health, Biden is clearly more healthy than Trump:
I think it's a byproduct of his anti dementia drugs, along w the tardive dyskinesia. You know they're attacking Biden because of Trmp's dementia. Everything he does is projection
He's a more immediate danger--but the Dem collusion with endless wars keeps us in perpetual danger as well.  Get the codes out of 45's inside pocket and then fight Pres Biden at every turn until he fights for the lives of the 90%.

I agree it's a precarious situation. Biden sounding like a 78 yo white man when he talks about race doesn't help. But I'd hope that people will give the selection a chance to demonstrate her commitment to the "cause' before dismissing outright if she is not black.

Do Biden voters watch Fox?
"the billionaire rap superstar indicated, in an interview by text today, that he was in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden."  IS THIS EVEN ALLOWED AND ARE WE TRYING TO PUT A STOP TO IT??  Maybe say, election fraud??
I'm half Sicilian. I figure that has to make me at least 1/8 black. But I'm all in on Biden.
Fingers crossed for a somewhat inspirational VP pick. Biden just needs to avoid talking about race, except for when policy relates to it. He sounds like any 78 year old white man sounds when talking about black people- which is.... not good.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
What Bongino’s Sources Told Him About Biden Should Concern Everyone
This is my only hesitation with governor Whitmer as Biden's running mate. Michigan has been through so much and she seems to be a great governor. However, my impression is that you also have a solid Lt. governor who would follow in her footsteps.All Biden’s supporters aren’t pedophiles but they have decided it’s not a deal breaker.
Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I’m sure Stormy would be happy to show up

Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.

Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
I pray no one votes till after first debate get Biden to do at least one debate now
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden’s a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!

We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.

More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.
...that's a list of polls showing Biden competitive in Iowa.
They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
Unless Biden offers something big and international, I would rather stay in El Paso and not relocate my family.
I’m with China!    There So smart!  They use Big Words!     Go Biden.         Winning
Nicely done!  Loved when you pointed out she's on Joe Biden's ticket, not Bernie Sanders!!
No matter what the lying  comes up with from now to November, vote Biden/Harris. Just remember, Trump is a liar and a con man. That is all you need to remember! 🇺🇸
My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.
"They seem to be able to supercharge him [Biden] for 30 to 60 seconds at a time." -  Dark Journalist
That’s why I won’t vote for Biden!!
Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.
Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.
Whats the Biden Bungle? Please explain?
cringe !   DNC so powerful &amp; corrupt BIDEN molests girls on VIDEO!  ON video BRAGS &amp; LAUGHS about his corrupt extortion of UKRAINE forced firing of Ukraine offical for (investigating JOE BIDEN) with taxpayers money!  DNC always above laws we must jump to daily &amp; pay for
Did you read the OP... Biden explicitly said "that all governors should mandate wearing masks." So where are you getting this Federalism bit?
Kamala Harris joined Joe Biden’s ticket.  I slept well two nights following that announcement.
should SUE BLM DNC ACTION to repair rebuild 170 cities got billions in extortion checks from corporations forced to pay mob extortion so DNC BLM FASCISTS would not burn loot murder! dont use taxpayer money to rebuild like BIDEN BUILD BACK BETTER! DNC BLM facists must pay billions
...trump is 74, no spring chicken. biden is 77.   biden looked pretty locked on the other night, unlike the latest ramblings from 45.
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.
I want intelligence back in Washington.  Replace dumb and stupid with Biden and Harris!
I prefer "President Elect Joe Biden".
Just watched you with Peebles.  Why are you subtly trying to question Biden’s mental competence?  So unfair without doing the same with Trump.  Please be more fair.  Geez.  Do you seriously want 4 more years of this ? Don’t be selflsh.  Be honest !
Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻
For each question you ask Biden, you get ask Trump one. That’s it.
Yeah yeah if I did anything that anything like the Biden’s, they would throw me into a hole
Biden will win. Hope you get better
You throw mud at Trump to seeehat sticks. Problem? Biden is all mud
So you are attacking Biden after you recently tweeted that they only attack you if you are winning. So which one is it?

I don’t know how to say this but your late to the party, we already know this but I’m ready to see Trump in an orange jumpsuit. And ready to push Biden hard. We need to keep up the energy and direct it to the Democratic Party once we flip this shit.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.
Trump trying to interfere in voting and Biden told us the truth

Retreated to the high mountains for four days of internet-free solitude. Returned to Colorado wildfires, something awful re the USPS, and Chrissy Teigen’s baby bump. But news of Biden’s VP pic? Elusive. Had literally to sift through Google results for any sort of hope.🤷🏽‍♀️
This is why you want Biden/Harris elected, you will (imo) get a DOJ who will actually focus on Police brutality and reform instead of “racism” against white/Asians at Yale. I just cannot believe DOJ wasted two year of tax payer dollars on this
I would take and will vote for Biden/Harris over this corruption that you &amp; your cheater in chief have brought with killing all of the people, hate, evil &amp; who knows how many more of us you are going to kill! You have blood on your hands too Marco all republicans are.
This may seem shocking pilgrims but in many matters of foreign policy, being against Trump is not always in your best interest for you nor would it be for a Biden administration.
He echoes Jared Kushner, calling the deal a “historic step” 4 peace in the Mideast. He praises the "bravery" &amp; "statesmanship” of the Arab despot.   Welcome to Biden’s Middle East Policy which will look similar to Trump's policy in 2 critical areas that plague the region...
Biden has called Trump, America’s first racist president.   When this racist US president, orchestrates a deal between a neo-fascist Israeli leader &amp; an Arab despot (that ignores basic Palestinians rights) – how does Biden respond? ....
Joe Biden would be a fool to reject a continuation of an arms embargo against the rat like Iranian regime.
I don't see how he can debate. The Biden team will surely think of some confrontations that are new and unexpected.
Why not move on to being pissed off about Biden's VP pick? The sociopath who laughs about locking up children over homework? The one who never went after billionaires Now takes $$$ from Israel? How many liberals are going to vote for her? Trump might win a 2nd term w/ cheating
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!
Reason # I lost count, to not vote for Biden
I’m not sure why you feel that way.  Biden has moved left since winning the nomination, endorsing the Green New Deal, for one.
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
We will know. It will be Joe Biden
You don't know about Harris' record in California? Locking up poor POC and never going after billionaires?  Biden/Harris won't be any better than Trump. On the contrary, it will put sociopath Harris in power for 8-12 years.
Biden (to black interviewer): “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black!”  Biden (re busing): “unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle...”  There’s plenty more
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!
What is our world coming to? Why do people think Joe Biden is racist when he was vice president for obama, a black man?  If you were point out sexism that might make more sense.

Oct 2020: tweets photo of her voting Green, ends up the fastest ratio in Political Twitter history  Nov 2020: Biden wins, she locks her account down
They're loosing early this year because the know Biden can't win.
They aren't excited to vote for Biden, they're excited to vote against Trump
To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump

Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it’ll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden’s sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I buy that there’s an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don’t think it’s unique to Utah. It’s entirely possible that after Alaska, there’s a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Actually Biden would need a 30 pt lead in polls
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I’m “crimson and clover “
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.

We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden 😆
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let’s see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
“Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden’s true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.All Biden’s supporters aren’t pedophiles but they have decided it’s not a deal breaker.
Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I’m sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden’s AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.

Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden’s a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!

Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low

International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.

Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.

we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.

Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
Amen. And, Biden should not interfere. No pardons. No deals.
Heard you missed us we're back! For the time being..   Hear us break down Biden picking Kamala Harris, how masks and lockdowns are still a partisan thing, because stupid, and advice on how to overcome the USPS sabotage operation.
I just read another tweet about Biden went to the NetRoots conference to beg left progressive to help him to win the campaign. That says a lot. I bet he would have to surrender half of the platform to them. Even to get them onboard.

it's November 2024  Joe Biden is the incumbent candidate  the left doesn't vote / votes Green / writes-in a candidate  "don't worry we're supporting Biden"
And you are certainly not a conservative if you vote for Trump. Radical socialism? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Give us all a break.

From a listener who emailed the show: Randy: Can you bring this topic up on your show? The Postal Union has endorsed Joe Biden 4 President. (It) is not neutral in this election. Therefore, Postal employees cannot be used to deliver ballots, or collect ballots! Time for lawsuits.
Democrat Challenge:  Tell me why I should vote for Biden without mentioning Trump.
So he’s expecting someone to be listening to him?  MSNBC, CNN, AND FOX have all left him to cover Biden recently.  It’s better news.  Biden is an adult and Trump is, well.....
Drink every time Biden stutters
NYPD endorsed PresidentTrump!  Biden is screwed. 🥳❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
No!  It just shows how weak Hiding Biden is.
"Well, I was considering voting for Biden, but now I'll have to support Trump." -someone, probably
It doesn't matter. We are onto him and know that he is a decrepit person. Someone with no morals or ethics or sense of anyone else but himself and his insatiable narcissism. Joe Biden will carry on. The networks better not carry Moron-In-Chief. Enough. #DoNotCoverHim
Yet another mediocre white man ranting about how a woman of color doesn’t live up to his standards. Can’t believe the  printed this steaming pile of sexist, racist sh*t
I have not seen 1 Joe Biden sticker  At all here in Denver Colorado  Although I did see a Bernie Sanders  2020 sticker🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

'“People are tired of doing everything through their computer and Zoom,” Ruscha said.'  Sometimes I forget there's a national campaign going on. I've never even been targeted by the Biden campaign. 😳
Joe Biden is the most racist person on earth. lol. He also thinks they all look alike as well.
Acosta, have you ever asked Biden a question? You are not a journalist. You hate Conservatives with a passion. You are not a Cuban American but a Fidelito ass kisser.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020    tweet 2 4) a VP who is left of the progressive squad (AOC, Omar, etc) which means she is w Bernie Sanders, green new deal, socialism/marxism 4) a VP who called Biden a racist at the Dem primary debates yet magically has decided he's now ok No thanks!
A lot of Biden signs nearby. #RidenWithBiden
Unless joe Biden becomes president, than everything goes back to normal within 24 hours....wack
This photo is such a simple yet profound demonstration of the difference between Trump and Biden.  Trump talk goes no where and just fills the air with BS. Biden supports his words with measurable actions.

Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
He is like a gnat swarming ...  Biden will just wave him away.
Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That’s the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.
This is Trumps America.  He should resign and leave the clean up to Biden and Harris.  They are adults.
Im so proud of Joe Biden’s  choice of  Kamala Harris for Vp
More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.
...that's a list of polls showing Biden competitive in Iowa.
They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
Unless Biden offers something big and international, I would rather stay in El Paso and not relocate my family.
I’m with China!    There So smart!  They use Big Words!     Go Biden.         Winning
Nicely done!  Loved when you pointed out she's on Joe Biden's ticket, not Bernie Sanders!!
No matter what the lying  comes up with from now to November, vote Biden/Harris. Just remember, Trump is a liar and a con man. That is all you need to remember! 🇺🇸
My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.
"They seem to be able to supercharge him [Biden] for 30 to 60 seconds at a time." -  Dark Journalist

Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.
Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.
cringe !   DNC so powerful &amp; corrupt BIDEN molests girls on VIDEO!  ON video BRAGS &amp; LAUGHS about his corrupt extortion of UKRAINE forced firing of Ukraine offical for (investigating JOE BIDEN) with taxpayers money!  DNC always above laws we must jump to daily &amp; pay for
Did you read the OP... Biden explicitly said "that all governors should mandate wearing masks." So where are you getting this Federalism bit?
Kamala Harris joined Joe Biden’s ticket.  I slept well two nights following that announcement.
should SUE BLM DNC ACTION to repair rebuild 170 cities got billions in extortion checks from corporations forced to pay mob extortion so DNC BLM FASCISTS would not burn loot murder! dont use taxpayer money to rebuild like BIDEN BUILD BACK BETTER! DNC BLM facists must pay billions
...trump is 74, no spring chicken. biden is 77.   biden looked pretty locked on the other night, unlike the latest ramblings from 45.
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.
I want intelligence back in Washington.  Replace dumb and stupid with Biden and Harris!
I prefer "President Elect Joe Biden".
Just watched you with Peebles.  Why are you subtly trying to question Biden’s mental competence?  So unfair without doing the same with Trump.  Please be more fair.  Geez.  Do you seriously want 4 more years of this ? Don’t be selflsh.  Be honest !
Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻
For each question you ask Biden, you get ask Trump one. That’s it.
Biden will win. Hope you get better
So you are attacking Biden after you recently tweeted that they only attack you if you are winning. So which one is it?
Election 2020 live updates: Trump sows doubt about election legitimacy, Biden goes after his business creds
Real American here. I support Biden/Harris.   Now go away.Biden will not answer one question from the press. Even the press he has bought and paid for
The Democrats will try anything they can legal and illegal to put Biden or crooked Pelosi in power. Keep that in mind when you vote.
The choice Biden made of Kamala Harris makes- an already terrible ticket- worst. I will not be voting in November. Period!
I see a lot of mfs talking mad shit about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and all I can say is if you believe they ain’t doing shit right, then you yourself should personally get involved in politics and be the change you wanna see instead of bitching 24/7.
Great idea, Biden’s handlers and democratic power brokers would never allow Biden to expose himself to that. He doesn’t have the metal capacity to handle it.
So when is Biden going to bail out so kamala will be defacto Presidential Candidate and is Hillary going to be her vp?
So your strategy to win in 2020 is just keep lying, making up bullshit, &amp; attacking Biden/Harris? Good luck w that!
So you're saying the states that you think will vote for you are "good", but states who vote for Biden will be fraudulent? Does any part of you think this looks pathetically stupid? It should, b/c it is!

China wants Biden back in the White House so bad they will do anything and buying off our Democrats is only one of their tricks!!

Hey CNN, you think Biden is still 10 points ahead!!!
Highlights:  36% say Biden would be a good president; 33% say Trump would  52% of Democrats/leaners wish someone else were their nominee; only 25% of Rs/leaners wish it wasn't Trump  42% of Americans view Trump favorably; 47% view Biden favorably
The point is we will again under Trump. Under Biden, not so much.
No. No it doesn't, at all! What does seem odd is that Trump refuses to release his taxes b/c he actually has something, or multiple things to hide. Instead of trying to invent a Biden crime, investigate the man who's committed them for decades.(Verifiable)
So China wants to see  win election! So! I imagine EVERY world leader who's had to deal with, coordinate with or even meet with Trump wants Biden to win b/c it doesn't take long to realize that Trump has NO IDEA what he's doing! Incompetence is easily spotted!
Can't wait until Trump and everyone in his corrupt administration are walked out of the white house in handcuffs. But until the day that happens we need to work hard to protect social security, the #USPostalService and ensure a Biden/Harris victory! #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Joe Biden is prohibited from going on News Shows. His handlers are afraid people will see the real Joe Biden. They rather put his wife out there for him.
Biden will take credit for parting the Red Sea and hope the media gives him a pass which they will. The democratic party owns mainstream media and they always give Biden a pass. It's sickening.
Any vote other than Biden is a vote for trump sorry change my mind... not enough people would vote 3rd party
If don’t vote for Biden you ain’t black
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Obama is cold on Biden, probably will vote for Trump!
Yeah, I’d define a major shift as going as far left as Bernie, (not that he’s far left). And i never wanted to convince you to enjoy or like Biden —I just don’t want some stupid kid like I was to see lefty shit and do dumb things by misunderstanding. Sorry, man.
These three months cannot be critical to your revolution, but they might be for Biden. Why ever risk that?
BIDEN was wrong?  you need to stop tweeting quotes from Trump that are only true if you switch Bidens name w/ Trumps! Doing that actually makes his quotes 100% true! Just not with Bidens name, but Trumps! Sad &amp; pathetic!
So b/c you're a "stable genius" you 100% KNOW that you're going to lose the election, BADLY! So, you think if you get destroyed by Biden/Harris you can claim fraud. Even then you're NOT GOING TO WIN, so just resign now &amp; stop making yourself look so stupid!
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Obama always had his problems with Biden but is playing the game of the Democrats and keeping his mouth shut!!
Biden is incapable of answering questions. He can't get through them without losing his temper and his handlers know it. If they could hide him in the basement until the election that's what they would do. He's simply incompetent.

Clearly he isn't in control since Biden can hurt him according to your president.
Good to know that you won’t remove me from the school when I wear my death to Biden shirt.
So are you voting for Biden or his supporters? Wait till you hear about Trump voters sneezing on people who wear masks.
Weird, looks like Biden hasn’t aged a day.
President Donald Trump's campaign is canvassing for voter support while former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign opts out.
It’s because they are hiding Biden and won’t let him speak. Once people realize there is none home they won’t be voting for him.
It must really suck to shit all over Biden and now be completely irrelevant. Young white males who claim to be Democrats carry the believe we should all be grateful the cool boys are on our team. My opinion of Obama has been tarnished. He seems disloyal and cruel.
I want to see the Biden/Rice one, because, as a non-graphic designer, I just see the shorter word "Rice" looking bigger than Biden which wouldn't work for a logo...how do designers incorporate that?
Stay focused on Joe Biden, he’s the weak link and the one that will slip. Also the one Republicans have to expose. Kamala is a waste of energy
Look, I’m voting Biden/Harris for sure, but if one more cis person says something about how they “don’t care about Kamala’s past, and I don’t want to hear about it” my chances of voting get slimmer. You can hear about this shit and still vote, but don’t block it out!!!
I am with you on the principle, but as far as I remember the "electorate" went solidly Biden in the primaries.
Vote for President Biden on Nov 3rd &amp; he'll bring back our beloved country, allies, reputation, WHO, Paris agreement, jobs, economy, &amp; show the world that we've regained our honor, &amp; the corruption left w/ Trump!

Biden needs to be able to recognize his own name before he can do anything for this country.
Well said Father.  And Joe Biden professes to be a catholic.
So tired of stupid comments. He has been answering questions almost every single day since Feb. If he walks off a few times because he's busy or disgusted with the hacks, it is not the same as Biden who can't hold a conversation that is not written down!
when people say joe biden is a socialist i just laugh knowing they have no knowledge of politics like OH HONEY
How could Biden/Harris be the most radical left representation when we literally have Sanders and Warren lol
Biden doesn't need his son to rely on like Trump needs you. He can pull his own weight. Biden has grown up.
You're not serious! The world thinks America is a joke, run by a sociopathic ignorant child! Trump alone has damaged our reputation, alienated allies, befriended dictators &amp; proven to world leaders that he has NO IDEA what he's doing! But Biden will hurt us? Um, NO WAY!
We can sit around and talk "what about ___" all day. But there is no perfect candidate who can serve every facet of social and political justice the way we'd like them to. So we have to start somewhere. Would you rather start with Biden/Harris?  3/?
Look, I'm not saying I agree 100% with Biden and Harris. They both have beliefs that I don't agree with. But think of the alternative. Sure, we can sit around all day and talk about "well why should we have to choose between the lesser of two evils" and believe me, I agree.  1/?
Biden/Harris ticket threw me for a spin. I wanted to defend the importance of voting the occupant out, but I’m seeing the flaws in that and my own participation in the brainwashing rhetoric of white progressive politics. Taking a step back to be a better listener now.
She then fits in perfectly with Joe Biden. He’s a weak man that changes his opinions with the political wind. He’s got a different position everyday and the people handle his public appearance very closely
How is it not being a team player to try to get a platform to pitch Biden to your supporters, 42% of whom aren’t automatic generic dem candidate voters?

Technically, Biden is the horse in the metaphor #pedantry
She's garbage dude. So she believes the women accusing Biden, AND she believes Biden is a racist, yet she still runs with him as his VP? So it's cool to ignore the fact he's a racist, and sexual predator, as long as you get to be VP? That's crooked as hell dude
Hmmm... Biden literally called Trump a few months ago and told him what to do. Oh and he and Obama left him a book telling him what to do
this is exactly the kind of flip-flopping trump is going to pounce on as we get closer to the election - he'll claim that he cares more about black lives than the dem nominees. biden and harris have awful records, and suddenly trying to pretend they don't is a total joke/mistake.
NOT a concerned about being thrown in jail.  You know, the same can't be said about you! Your father &amp; Pence are so SCREWED! I mean they can't spell the 5 letter words Biden &amp; Kamala use regularly. Brains vs ignorance. Its going to be a massacre that you can't not watch!
comments from today's zoom call with my 74-year-old dad, who thinks kamala harris is "a phoney": "i went so far as to send joe biden an email three days ago telling him please don't select kamala harris as your running mate"

Ewww. That's a bad take considering what Biden said about choosing a VP. That's no conservative's fault.
Kamala Harris accepting the official Vice President choice from Joe Biden
Just want until Democrats pull out there Donald Trump, Joe Biden is one step closer to that
Not the choice I wanted to make, but not a difficult one either. One thing he doesn’t list is environmental issues. While Biden and Harris could be better in that regard, they will be light years ahead of where we are now.

I hope and pray it’s Biden!! We can’t handle/survive another 4 years of Trump in office...
That's how unenthusiastic people are about biden
And people think Trump is racist 😂 funny how the black community is actually doing better under him than Obama 🤔 even if Biden wasn't blatantly racist, he can barely form a rational sentence!
They’re all bad. The Biden Ticket is competent and less bad. Failed country but lets vote for the less worse ticket.
Facts, I'm happy for a potential women president/vp but I'm not happy its Joe Biden &amp; Kamla.
I don’t think anyone’s perfect, not Biden, Kamala, Trump, not me or you. But I do think people can change &amp; grow and people can be held accountable. I’m not voting for a perfect President and VP, I’m voting for people who learn from their mistakes and listen. #BidenHarris2020

MSNBC accused of 'cropping' Biden's script from photo of his virtual chat with Harris   MSDNC
Lincoln Project likes Harris: “a steadfast defender of justice and human rights...a deserved reputation for opposing the reprehensible actions the current administration has engaged in against both our own citizens and our allies. ..a powerful asset to the Biden campaign.”
We have enough cops already. We don't need one as VP. It is the absolute most tone-deaf pick that Biden could have made.
Let's be real. Biden could have picked a pack of cigarettes for VP and he still gets my vote over Trump.
It must be a bittersweet day for Joe Biden. I know he's wishing Kamala was Beau's VP pick.
It’s not bad he supported Harris. He just has to admit it. We will all be donating to her/Biden’s campaign. Finally something I will do that DJT has done! What a great example. Trump isn’t so bad after all 😀
People that are like fuck Trump fuck Biden. Please tell, who do you vote for ??? Like whose left ????
Y’all resentment for Biden gonna indirectly make Trump win again just like Hillary 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️.
In the debates Kamala demonstrated her willingness to speak truth to power. I'm confident she will speak her mind to President Biden. That brings me comfort.
I don't think leftists are rallying behind Biden/Harris. The Democratic party probably has a better chance pulling from centrist republicans who regret voting for Trump in '16.
Will said what he thought he heard was that Biden picked Camille Herron to be his running mate, which he found interesting but odd.
Why is Biden a travesty of a candidate?
Ima just go out on a limb and say Kamala Harris wasn’t Biden’s best choice...
Bring on the tshirts! Proud nasty woman for Biden/Harris!!
The people that are pissed that Biden chose Harris are the ones that already made it crystal clear that it wouldn’t matter who he picked, they weren’t voting for him.
So you had no intent of ever voting for Biden?
Due to college football twitter I wouldn’t have even known Biden picked his VP candidate 😂 but I finally figured out who it was and I am ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. Not...
The fact that your ad calls Biden racist &amp; tries to attack Harris as phony is comical! The ONLY PHONY RACIST that's ever been in our govt is DONALD TRUMP! Racist w/out question, &amp; phony Republican b/c he's a NO ONE, a criminal conman who's failed at politics like everything else!
I LOVE Susan Rice also but can SEE HER as Secretary of State or UN Ambassador too...HER foriengn Policy Knowledge is HER strong suit &amp; HER past working relationship with BIDEN would make for a TRUSTED TEAM‼️💁🏼‍♀️
Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick. Never mind that Tulsi executed her on live tv, and she has many more skeletons left to drag out of the closet.  If you needed to check all of the diversity boxes, why not choose Michelle Obama? At least your base kinda likes her.

Ask yourself this. Do you know anyone that wasn't going to vote for Biden already, that now is?
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Biden made a great choice for his running mate, and in the process, chose our next great president once his term is finished. 🇺🇸

Yeah hopefully, I think sort of damage done and if they add him the narrative is that they reluctantly did it because of a twitter backlash.  Maybe that will keep some people in the fold though. I'm for whatever gets the most people in for Biden, so whatever the best play is.
We’re voting for Biden and here is why. 1/#RidinWithBiden2020
After all the polls showing his supporters the hardest to covert to a different candidate, I don’t get it but just gonna have to work even harder to get Biden in.  That’s still the only goal for this year. We’ll revisit this in a few years.
Yeah, a Biden win is priced in, but we may also be nearing the end of building a house of cards when people frantically add top layers to get it as high as possible before the collapse.
I think they totally should. Would excite Poole more and take the focus off the Presidency itself being the most important thing voters should consider. Who would be in your Biden cabinet?
Everyone is joining the Biden campaign! The Republican party is doomed.
Why is it so hard for you to describe what you're talking about?  "Big stock market numbers" could mean anything! HUGE STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (6 years ago when Obama was President) or BIG STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (will return after President Biden is elected) You're a joke! A BAD JOKE!
I'm smart enough to realize a con when I see one, &amp; b/c the interference in our election meant to vilify Joe Biden &amp; claim Trump is a leader who will help America is not only patently false, but pathetically obvious! We ALL have learned a lesson about sociopathy in Trump!
Thank you joe Biden.  Protect Bristol bay!  Everyone needs to vote
Biden to accept democrat nomination from his basement
AOC to make prime-time appearance at Democratic convention   Go Bernie Sanders!!! Take it away from Biden
Do you lie with a straight face like your your president does?? :) BIDEN 2020
I’m just joshin’ ya. It’s Biden/Mother 2020.
Team Trump Just NUKED Biden To Hell With This NEW Ad - He’s CANCELED  via
Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report   Biden bails out violent criminals!!
Oh lordy. If Biden had said this, Trump's failsons would already be on Twitter talking about assisted living and memory care options.
I will vote for Biden no matter who the veep is. I was a Warren supporter in the primaries, but now believe that Harris fits the mood of the times better. I want him to just announce already so good non-chosen people don’t keep being beaten up for no good reason.
We'll have to agree to disagree. Joe Biden is in control of his mental facilities in a way Donald Trump has never been. Trump is the corrupt, conman criminal who's spent decades committing crimes b/c he thinks his wealth entitles him to. Plus no one honest is sued 3500 times!
I can't wait for you to be the Senate minority leader, &amp; President Biden deciding that b/c the GOP is inept he'll just sign an EO to do what he wants! I can't wait to hear you argue why Biden can't do things that you've allowed Trump to do.
Russia is once again interfering with our upcoming election and you're focused on Hunter Biden?  Really?  Do your f job you suckup!
“Tax on cap­i­tal gains di­rectly af­fects in­vest­ment decisions, the flow of risk cap­i­tal from sta­tic to more dy­namic sit­u­a­tions, the difficulty experienced by new ven­tures in obtaining capital, &amp; thereby the growth of the econ­omy” ~ JFK 1963
Maybe this is true, maybe not. But either way President Biden wouldn't ever claim that this will be paid for by another country. Why would another country pay for Bidens proposals? They wouldn't, just like Mexico didn't pay for Trumps wall!
Colorado Biden staffer criticized Creepy Joe for calling a 13-year-old hot

I think  may have it backwards - a likely consensus among young voters that have concerns of Biden’s ability to perform inspired Rogan’s comment.
We CAN'T let Biden touch our youth!
I find it amusing and alarming Pelosi is pushing China support for Biden after they murdered so many worldwide. Disgusting!
Who was that?  Because if the answer is Bernie then my reply to you is his people didn't turn out to vote during the primaries.I didn't get my candidate either &amp; I'm voting for Biden because he IS the candidate. Anyone who doesn't bother to vote or votes 3rd party votes for Trump
Anyone wasting time attscking Chuck Todd instead of Trump, Barr, McConnell, Jim Jordan, Lindsey Graham, Mnuchin, Meadows or any other corrupt person working for Trump is WASTING THEIR TIME! We must stick together for Biden! FULLSTOP!
Vote for Joe Biden
Especially looking forward to the fact checks that rate it as "True" or use it to claim a "Promise Broken" when Biden says he won't raise middle-class taxes.

President Biden will enjoy the Trump precedent of making tax policy without approval from Congress, forgiving student loan debt completely without Congress, and doling out federal money to states, without your vote.
Let's just make sure that Trump voters understand that if they vote for Kanye it will hurt Biden. The more the merrier. :)

Trump campaign officials clearly haven't watched the disastrous attempts by Trump to speak without a teleprompter. He'll be destroyed by Biden, then fact checkers!  Trump campaign says Michigan voters deserve presidential debate before early voting starts

Turns out Biden is a racist too huh? So can we vote for someone either than two racist rapists now? Or are we still supposed to choose one of them?
Swear to god, there could be a video released of Joe Biden getting head from a child and y’all will STILL be like “well, he’s not Trump, so he gets my vote🤷‍♂️”

To be fair, I turned off my Biden texts for that same reason Anand says: asking only for donations on a daily basis isn’t what I want. Give me stories, talking points, action items too.
Bs AOC is the future Biden is the past they need to come together.  60 seconds is an insult that will cost him votes
Plagiarism is Biden’s style since he has no ideas of his own. Biden been plagiarizing for decades as a part of the Washington, DC Swamp. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy from the militant socialist mob.

Funny. Biden answers no questions.

Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
Biden who?
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.

Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃

Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.

“It’s not about your rights.”  Joe Biden, speaking to Americans, 8/13/20.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.
The American people respect all the hard work you are doing for our great nation!  Well done President Biden!
The sane Americans stand proudly with President Biden!!
Joe Biden is right. You whine a lot.
The mullahs in Tehran are soiling themselves with the Israel/UAE peace accord announcement. Thank you President Trump. You accomplished what OBAMA &amp; BIDEN could not.

Disgraceful act by the Democrat inspired domestic terrorists. This is the America that the Biden/Harris team want for all Americans. Vote Trump/Pence and Republican in November. Restore law and order and save our constitutional democracy.
Do laws really matter to any of you liberal-minded people I don't think you care about the truth which was proven by Obama and his administration and you are going to do it again with Biden and Harris
So, here we are. Congress is in recess and Trump is actively sabotaging the USPS and spreading lies about Biden and Harris. How do “we” prevent him from stealing the election? Is this not a clear and present danger?
Commissar Biden’s latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It’s totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.
Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.
WATCH: Biden's Handlers Kick Reporters Out Of Press Briefing After They Start Asking Questions
Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption
After all the comments on my OMG tweet about golden showers I know one thing for sure; Biden is going to need a new mattress in the White House #Bidenwillneedanewmmattressinthewh
You know Obama/Biden built the cages and put kids in them prior to Trump
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this

Can’t wait to see you on January 20th, 2021. Looking forward to seeing you get forced out of the White House to make room for President Biden and Vice President Harris!
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions
Biden is maybe the worst candidate for President ever presented to the public. And let's remember, he still hasn't former accepted nor been formerly named as the Presidential nominee. I still think the old switcheroo could be in play. Regardless, Joe's not looking good...

Good 4 Biden
So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccine🙃
So proud of President Biden and his outstanding leadership!
Biden, to Americans: “It’s not about your rights.”
Now that Harris has been named to run with Biden, have they decided who will lead the ticket?
Ok I’m all for masks and everything, but honestly, how am I supposed to get Coronavirus outside? Think about it, and then have Joe Biden explain it to me, if he can! #stopcrazyunclejoe
Will you and Joe Biden embrace the science of prenatal life?
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
You’re absolutely right about that. Biden and Harris will kick you and Pencey out of office in November!
Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that’s how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That’s nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
I think this ad makes Biden look even better. He’s actually working for the American people. You’re probably on the train with Stormy Daniels while America dies from COVID.
Biden/Harris might be the worst ticket in like...... ever.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he’s an old guy with Dementia or because he’s a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can’t pronounce it correctly it really shouldn’t matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. 🤡🤡 Has Don Lemon’s sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‘s name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
He actually believes HE did this which is scary,  He took over from the Obama/Biden administration and just like everything he touches is turned to shit making us the biggest shithole country there is.
Look, Biden has already addressed his issues with inappropriate touching, so let's not start in with the whole "thigh land" thing again...  Yes, he didn't apologize or DO anything remotely like ACTUALLY addressing it, but... I mean, there were fragments of... he didn't...  *sigh*
buddy really took biden quotes and used them against trump😳😳 shiii he got him
This is what a Biden administration will bring to the country.
Need I even bring up that Trump supporters are more likely than Biden or Bernie supporters to have dropped out of highschool or not have a college degree??? No?? Ok😌
If we settle for Biden and get justice for the POC lives lost to police brutality - get this - the riots would end😃
Why Sarah Palin Is Trending Ahead of Biden's VP Pick Announcement

The CCP is backing Biden.
Your solution to Biden's VP problem would have been Tulsi. Literally the only area where her thoughts vary from Trump's is that she'd nationalise every business with more than 35 employees. Her foreign policy would, if anything, be MORE isolationist.

No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. 🤡🤡

Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Wouldn't it be the secret service job,  once Biden gives them the okay
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
“Nothing will fundamentally change” under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.

Ah, you’re right! Must’ve missed that part.
Probably not unemployed. I'd put money on it she won't give up her Senate seat unless Biden wins.
Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y’all think Biden picked her for any other reason?😂
They don’t mind Trump’s ethics at all. Biden makes them liars and hypocrites on every single point they’ve criticized Trump on.  They object to the aesthetics of Covfve. The bits where they talk about ethics are pretexts that disguise that.
The Steffan Tubbs Show is at News/Talk 710KNUS. Aurora ·  After careful debate (none) we've decided it'll be known as the "Harris/Biden" ticket on the program..
Voting for Biden and stumping for him on Twitter *is* being a Biden Bro. That bit where you’re saying “Oh, but in my HEART I’m doing this WITH RESERVATIONS”?  Doesn’t matter, because it has no effect on the wotld around you. It’s just a way to blame your own cowardice on others.
I follow   and  here on Twitter.  I find it curious that Biden is always in my timeline at the very top and Trump is never in my timeline.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business
A Stepford Wife- in trump’s little mind that’s what he expects women to be, robots that have no free will &amp; obey their husband’s. The other strong women are ‘nasty’ in his mind, a word he uses often. Senator Harris is a strong woman &amp; great for Biden’s presidential ticket‼️
First thing I did this morning, make this poster.  Did I mention that I LOVE that Biden picked Harris!!  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
You’re absolutely pathetic‼️Kamala Harris is a huge boost to Biden’s presidential race! Have you read the Twitter responses on here?! Most don’t support you, or trump for that matter.
Truth in advertising request... would like Kamala Harris to take same test Liz Warren took to determine the extent of Black African heritage in her makeup. If Dems want millions to vote for her &amp; Biden based on "identity" then let's be sure she IS black. Only fair.
I oppose fracking as well. So, good news! Thanks for making sure that I vote against you, while voting for Biden/Kamala.
I wonder how it feels to be selected only because of your gender and color of your skin...Biden riding with the times.
You and Pence are quaking in your boots. Biden/Harris is heading for the White House. Get out!
Definitely possible. The other explanation is that Tobin feels that Biden shouldn't just BE excommunicated (likely for being pro-choice), but actually already IS.
Woot woot!!! So excited for this Biden/ Harris ticket. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #RidinWithBiden
There haven’t been “suburban housewives” since 1956. Women from the suburbs are going to vote for Joe Biden in record numbers. We know and appreciate diversity in our neighborhoods.
They're still convinced that Biden will forestall armed revolution while the thought of Trump running the country for at least four more years will force it before 20 Jan. They don't take into account the Trumpstapo can ALREADY stymie all armed revolution, just like in Germany.
I will remind you again that I am a woman who lives in the suburbs and I am voting for Biden /Harris. I welcome affordable housing. #BidenHarris2020
The comical thing is that they are running with the attack that Biden and Harris are “far left liberals” (which is how they would have attacked any ticket).  If they truly think Biden is “far left” (which they don’t...just scare tactics) - whooo boy.
You seem a little worried today, Donnie.  #nastywoman  #wednesdaymorning  #nastywoman  #Biden
Joe Biden that’s who!
Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!
Joe Biden is “radical”?!?!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
That Wall Street is excited about Kamala Harris - taking it as a sign that a Biden presidency would not be progressive - should tell you a lot.
And yet he endorses a candidate who’s made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren’t deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
And Obama isn't Catholic (so Biden filled that role in 2008 and 2012 by his own logic) so this clown Bishop Tobin has no clue what he's babbling about.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
But hey, way to once again avoid saying anything positive at all about Biden.   I mean, since there’s literally nothing good to say about him, you go straight for sneering at what you think my “real motivations are.”  True to form for Biden Bros: go straight gor the ad hominem.
Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they’ve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he’s substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That’s an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.
Did Governor of Georgia, Stacy Abram, accept nomination for Biden’s VP?
Has anyone on Biden's team sniffed Kamala hair?
Biden’s text came through as I was in my car, getting ready to walk into a job site. I had to stay in my car to compose myself before walking in because I was sobbing. Then I had to measure the kitchen 3x because I couldn’t focus. I forgot what it was like to cry tears of joy. 💛
It’s time to get some sleep, and I’ll be sleeping much better when Biden/Harris are winning!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I think the wording was intended and factual. Anyone with a functional brain knows Biden is unfit to serve as President, even those in news media.
Guess my follow-up question would be...if not Biden/Harris, who? Because my honest feeling is that we can’t survive another 4 years of *this*...
We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Welp, no surprise on the Biden front today. The entirety of his policy positions for fifty years has been MORE COPS.
Biden sniffed.....sorry,  I meant picked, Harris for Running Mate.  Excuse the expression.
I swear to god Joe Biden is gonna drop dead from being a wrinkly old fuck within 3 months of being inaugurated, and then we'll be stuck with the cop nobody wanted to begin with
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

Is Biden too sleepy to do it?
I bought a T-shirt on the Biden victory page
I was with Rice but the announcement of Harris feels really good today and I’m excited for this Biden/Harris ticket. This is Joe Bidens choice and I support it.
Pretty sure that’s what you said about Obama and Biden. Amazing thing - there’s still a second amendment!

Can anyone tell me how to get Black lives matter and a Joe Biden signs. Guy across the street has a tRump sign. Denver
The only way Joe Biden will endorse  a new vaccine is if Anthony Fauci, the CDC, and the FDA first approve it for general use against COVID-19 based on the outcomes of repeated, accepted double-blind clinical trials. Given those parameters, I would absolutely trust the vaccine.
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: ’She Was My Number One Draft Pick’ — Trump Launches Immediate Attacks On Kamala Harris After Biden Names Her As VP
I am so inspired with the Biden/Harris ticket
There is a sweet spot in the Biden cabinet for  😀
Turn off angry, sensationalized cable news and get your election coverage at The Neutral (⁦⁦ No fatigue, bickering, or bias. Just facts and balanced perspective. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Val, we look forward to your place in Biden’s administration, also!
He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she’s a woman she can’t be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.
Where can I get a Biden/Harris sign in the Denver area?
Day two, Biden appoints Harris anti-corruption tsar.
Did you miss Biden riding the bike?  It was on FOX news.  Did you happen to catch your Dad's press conference today, now that was SLEEPY.

NRDC Action Fund: Biden Picks Proven Leader and Seasoned Fighter in Harris
I like Bernie &amp; would have voted for him. I meant nothing derogatory against anyone. The fact is I'm well aware we NEED  Bernie's supporters. It's just so many are refusing to vote for Biden, so i thought maybe if they listen to him speak at the DNC we could change their minds.
I think she is a perfect pick for Biden and she will knock it out of the park!!
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn’t comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!
Never heard of Joe Biden until yesterday, I’m guessing.
Biden/Harris 2020! Perfect Vision!I am an independent and did same but now I see that the very future of my freedoms and choices are at stake. Not a big Trump fan but 2020 is an easy choice for me. Biden and Harris are horrific for this country.

Guess that explains all the attacks you’ve made on Biden/Harris
"Joe Biden won't be the candidate. He will be replaced soon..."
Yooo did you guys know Joe Biden is a devout Catholic?! 😲  If he gets elected we'll probably have nightly fireside chat rosaries from the Oval Office. How could will that be!
So many are calling him VP Biden, that’s also so wrong!!! He was but isn’t now!!!
I’m sure the powers in charge at the USPS want Biden, but not all employees will vote that way!! Some are gun owners and hunters
Sandra how can you say a Fox poll shows Biden leading Trump by 7 points? Seriously if you people in the media and DC politicians believe the American people want what Biden is selling you are all delusional.
"Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‘Stop playing politics with the virus’" "Biden on Thursday called for a nationwide mask mandate"
I completely understand that reporting poll numbers for Biden &amp; Trump is news, but can we please REGULARLY acknowledge that polls are NOT always the true measure of the political environment. A repeat of the 2016 over confidence is a dangerous message.
Joe Biden and kamala Harris is the best the democrats have?
Why are we feeding into this?? Joe Biden as of right now is NOBODY. Does he even have a job? Does Kamala? Who the hell do they think they are to demand or mandate anything? Donald Trump is the President. So here’s to the mask “mandate” from the nobodies: #MasksOff #MasksDontWork
'Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum.'

"Top poll repeats: Biden has 71% chance to win, just like Hillary Clinton’s 71.4%"
Didn’t think a Biden presidency could get any worse but I stand corrected. 🥴
No, of course Joe Biden doesn't own
You just hang on to that. Then scratch your head when you wonder why Biden-Harris lost
"Young voters love Trump’s plan — when told it’s Biden’s…"
Not if you and Biden raise taxes. He already said he would if elected. Go get a real job like the rest of us and see if you want your taxes raised.
Biden hasn't done anything for "us".
I teared up a little when they started talking about Bo Biden
I think Biden will debate and wipe the floor with the serial liar. Taxes of the candidates should be a mandate!!!
Joe Biden + Kamala Harris = AntiCatholicism Ticket?  via  Time for   lets do this everyone #Catholic
Biden is still going to win Ohio even with all this attempting voters problems

Joe Biden built up the VP hype and then just... tweeted it out
These young students will fight to make sure Biden and Harris never reach the White House! There is more enthusiasm for President Trump than ever before
The enthusiasm for President Trump can’t be matched by Biden/Harris
Still Riden on cloud Biden and KAMALA!!!💙🌊🌊
I think Biden chose well. She has experience and tenacity. Strong pick.
I have new hope that I’ll see a woman president in my lifetime. Biden/Harris in 2020! Let’s bring this strange year to a happy ending.
Call me a tin foil wearing fool, I just think the DNC gave Biden the nomination as a life time achievement award. Harris will end up full filling his term.
These reporters are stupid, the keep saying Vice President Biden. He’s NOT the Vice President any more!!!
Interesting that you think I'm a Biden supporter.
John, that is who will be president, when Biden is removed for being unfit, February of 2021.
And Biden has to unravel a lot of crap
Don’t think I’ve felt this kind of joy in more than three years. 💙Biden/Harris💙.
"Kamala Harris Chosen To Be Joe Biden’s Running Mate"
"Disgraced RINO John Kasich Claims Supporting Trump Is Not Consistent with Biblical Teachings — Baby Killer Biden ‘Is a Man of Deep Faith’" IMO, Kasich is just trying to propagandize Christians. He wouldn't know the Bible if it bit him in his butt.

It's true. Confirmed by the Biden team. 🎉🎉😃😃

All this talk about Biden's problems are projection and you know it. Trump was saying that Biden mispronouncing words was exactly what Trump did with Thigh-land. Trump looks ill when he walks, he's losing concentration when he talks. He's destroying tus. Do you care
Alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump's name on Colorado's presidential ballot will be Kanye West.

If you have to ask that you are not looking at the big picture. It's more than Biden. It's the Scotus pick. Secretary of state. AG. Let. Col. Vindman's, ambassadors, federal judges. D The list is huge. We need someone that understands our constitution!

Biden/Harris-dripping slime as they emerge from the swamp.
We are all humans, if you are a Biden supporter, great. If you are a Trump supporter, great. But to create division by touting what we assume the other side will do, does no good!
I do not disagree. Even if and after Biden is sworn in, there may be major unrest.
More jobs under Trump-Pence since May than all of Obama-Biden.  (Even in a Pandemic, Trump's record is better than Obama-Biden)

Biden: 'A Black Woman Will Become President Over My Dead Body' ....
I care about what he has to say and I plan to vote for Biden, right now he has millions of people who will vote a straight blue ticket, just as you will votes red ticket.   Now is it so hard to be decent?
I still feel good about it because Hillary won my state anyway &amp; Bill is even creepier now (it was so cringe to think of him as the first gentleman). But if I lived in a swing state that went Trump I might regret voting for Johnson over Clinton. All in for Biden/Harris this year.
He's gonna do a LOT more of this in different ways. The strategy will be to divide the left more, and play to republicans who could be on the fence toward Biden. Think about who he needs to secure and think backwards every time he makes a move. He will also distract in ways.
Trump pushed that Israel deal through because he knew that Biden would agree for votes, and he knew that this could stir up trouble with the left. He uses the Israel/ "middle east" card strategically. Watch the strategy, pay attention, don't get played by him.
100% agree. Fortunately, I live in a state where I can return a ballot to a collection box, but still...I'd crawl over glass to vote for Biden.
a photoshopped picture of you on a bike won’t do it. We want to see a live shot of you riding with secret service &amp;answering questions from reporters at the same time!   You know, like Biden did! It should be easy your very fit doctor says you’re in better shape!
Have you noticed that the Corvid-19 virus and the BLM violence has allowed the MSM to ignore Tara Reade and her allegations against Biden? Have you noticed that?
Which is why we are voting for Biden/Harris! She is awesome and Kavanaugh is a political hack!

Harris is a truly bad pick for Biden! Thank you, Joe!
Biden should drop out of the race and vote for Trump/Pence.

Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump.  (Of course, to the MSM Kamala Harris is a moderate and Joe Biden is articulate)
Yes I’m so relieved about it. I would have very different feelings if I didn’t see this kind of compromise, inclusion, and concern on Biden’s teams part - they’re clearly being considerate of the most progressive leaders.

You going to make him answer? Deep State really likes you because your compromised.

Mnuchin, Meadows recommend Trump take executive action as coronavirus relief talks stall - NBC News- imo this is all bs. They are refusing to work w Democrats so Scump can try to appear to be a hero w any aid he offers. #Biden
The people who get their information strictly from corporate media have no idea who Joe Biden, or Barack Obama for that matter, really are and who they represent.
I’ve never stated I was for Biden lmao! I agree he’s a racist, pedo with dementia. But so is trump. Trump can’t even put together full sentences.
It’s time for black people of ALL political persuasions to start checking Joe Biden for his racist statements.
Once again for those in the back. DO NOT VOTE FOR KANYE WEST under any circumstances. Joke, dont like biden, like rap, etc. THIS IS A SET UP. Do not fall for it. #retweet hard.about that.... the only presidential candidate to have put peoples lives above politics in my too long life was one Bernard NoMiddleName Sanders
...yeah...I’ve got no idea how biden/Harris became our least worst option.  Bernie won my state.  Both in 2016 and 2020.
Are you answering the question “Why won’t Biden participate in a debate?”
vote your favorite Biden nickname!
President Biden
if anyone is wondering what the fuss is all about, Nader's asking  to perhaps be the one member of Congress to respond to this was just a step too far.  primae facia evidence of how biden killed the #MeToo movement

imagining joe biden saying "what's the tea" in a kamala / biden campaign ad and instantly having a stroke
Yesterday I was confident that on Nov 3 we would elect Biden and Harris, and this nightmare would come to an end. I was concerned about what Agent Orange might do between Nov and Jan.  Watching the post office story develop is terrifying. Will we have an election at all? Fuq DJT!
Less people know how to properly use the term "exponentially" than have died from #COVID19.

I can’t wait until the world laughs at us because of Biden. I look forward to it, fuckface.
Jesus, Joe Biden can't even find UAE on a map!!! 😐😑
in the tweet above, Tay is not asking you to vote for biden, just to not be a dick
Also this Truth is that many of his supporters, not all, are just a cult of personality like trumpers or cruzers. But he HAS told them to vote Biden on a number of occasions
Thanks for a great Biden ad! 1. Biden is plucky and tough.  Even children can sense his kindliness and know to trust him. 2. Trump is a slick railroad baron train, barreling right by Main Street America, not stopping, not caring.

Shirley was my hero from wayback!
You’re voting for who gets to pick RBGs replacement. I’d rather have Biden in charge of that pick than trump. Everyday of the week.
Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate running on the platform of bringing American military back home. Trump and Biden have shown that they're still about dropping bombs on foreign countries.
For all you "Gotta beat Trump" people or "Gotta keep Biden out" people that want to vote for the "lesser evil"...How long do you want to keep voting for the lesser evil? Here's Hunter S Thompson talking about the same situation from 50 years ago. #EndTheDuopoly #LetHerSpeak
She's the perfect pick for Biden because they both allow police to harass/detain/search/arrest/abuse/kill poor &amp; minority Americans without consequence. #LetHerSpeak #GoJo2020
Rudy Giuliani’s daughter announces her support for Biden/Harris
Trumps “press conference “ is only a trash Biden conference. Trash Harris. Why reporters stay is beyond me!
I guess it would be beneficial for Biden to be elected. He knows exactly what legislation needs to be repealed to gdt rid of police abuse of Americans, because they have his name on them.😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I think I am going to lose some money on that one if Biden wins the election, but satisfaction of knowing the money will be put in good use makes up for it.
Got a guy in another thread right now trying to convince me Biden changing his mind about the laws he co-authored/passed is still better than Trump.😂🤣
Do you really want to talk about the past 50 years of Ds and Rs? How about just Biden's record in 50 years in Senate and VP? They've done way more harm than good, and left us with a $27,000,000,000,000 bill.
Your daughter supports Biden and Harris.   You just look like a fool.
Why is a Biden lie worse than a Trump lie?
God Biden sounds like a President. We've been desensitized to the abhorrent behavior of Trump.
According to  Kampala Harris was ranked as the most Liberal US Senator in 2019. Biden is losing votes in November.
Joe Biden now partnered with Antifa
But Biden's laws he co-authored still stay on the books 25 years later. He may have "changed his mind", but we still have to deal with the consequences of Biden's actions.
We started with one covid infection, now we have over a million infected, more than 155 thousand dead Americans, and President Trump said covid will soon disappear. It didn't! That’s the kind of opponent Joe Biden and everyone will love to run against!
Biden is in bed with the clintons. The clintons are on trial for treason. Do i need any other reason to be skeptical?
We should not even be talking about Biden becoming president. Because he will not. Period.
Trump has continued the borrowing &amp; spending. He's running up the debt as we speak with a suspended debt ceiling til end of year. He refuses to end the war on drugs. He refuses to address qualified immunity or the Biden Crime Bills allowing police abuse &amp; murder of Americans.
the crippling student debt that joe biden saddled me with, that i couldn’t get out from under is the reason i didn’t go to grad school
Thanks to the mandatory minimum drug sentences Biden co-authored and helped pass where child rapists can now serve less time than drug dealers. Harsh drug penalties and a War, but drug use is still the same as 1972 when it all started.
"Electing Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators. We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path."
"From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE."
this "...shows Biden &amp; the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine &amp; Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
here's some bullshit the orange turd's trainwreck campaign emailed out this morning about Biden picking Harris:
End the Drug War, cut federal govt spending and get powers back to state/local govt under 10th Amendment, end global warfare, end qualified immunity, repeal the Biden Crime Bills,.. I'm all for the Libertarian platform.
Trump is a complete disgrace to all of America and the WORLD yet you’re going to enable him to win the 2020 election because you don’t like Biden’s VP pick? Grow up.
This shows that Joe Biden is confident and secure in himself as opposed to a weak, fragile baby like tRump. Joe will actually listen to others. Gee, what a novel idea!
This isn’t even “the alternative.” This is *now.* This is happening and has been happening and will keep happening. So go on and call me whatever you want for voting Biden/Harris. I’m still voting for them for you. Yes, you.
Biden- Corporate United States worships money and power even as Earth Extinction event to end all other events locked down on the sacred rights of words we stand by post Coup. The Trump Russian Oligarchy= Where is the Purple Majesty... as Earth is locked into heat and entropy to.
I hear you but ..... Biden2020 Biden 2024 Harris 2028 Harris 2032 looks pretty darn good to me !!!! Celebrate that!!!!
How does she reconcile this:
My problem is Biden spent 50 years in DC as a Senator &amp; VP. He couldn't change his mind about legislation he created &amp; passed when he was in a position to do something about it? Instead we still have to deal with the laws he left on the books allowing police to abuse Americans.
How does she justify running as his VP? Politics of course.
I finally found something I agree with them on: I also believe Biden's sexual assault accusers (and Trump's)
Biden loss for sure. Trump 2020!
Kamala's record of not investigating police abuse/corruption in CA matches directly with Biden's Crime Bills that gave police the authority/incentives/weapons to harass/detain/search/arrest/abuse/kill poor &amp; minority Americans. #LetHerSpeak #GoJo2020
Any person voting D because they "represent minorities" is being sold BS. Biden created the laws police are using to harass/detain/search/arrest/abuse/kill poor &amp; minority Americans, &amp; Kamala's record as CA AG is not investigating police abuse/corruption. #LetHerSpeak #GoJo2020

I feel like you're doing a lot of work to put Biden/Harris on the same level as Trump
Thanks to Democratic run states we aren’t playing sports this fall. If Biden and Harris win we may never seen sports return.
Haha your opinion doesn’t matter Biden&amp;Harris SMH gross.
The UK press clearly didn't cover Biden's conversion to Satanism.
could not have gone wrong if he had chosen either of you! I’m betting there’s a place for a wicked smart lady like yourself in the Biden Administration, ambassador. The country needs both of you ladies!
Excellent ad for Biden/Harris 2020 in this remark
Wow!  Brilliant move Mr. Biden!  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer...
Gonna be honest, I saw Biden’s VP pick coming.   Still not happy with our election choices and I’m not a fan of the existing system but the changes I’d like to see would take much longer than I like.
YES! With Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, Newsom has a chance to appoint history-making senator
We were just discussing Biden's VP pick and T*ump's ridiculous response. And my husband tells me women were suppressed for so long because we are the superior gender and men are afraid of what we can do. Watch out world ✌️💙
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
There are no Biden supporters. Only Biden hostages. #HowieHawkins2020
The problem is that Biden is a Democrat. And Democrats now have the monopoly of calling people racists.
if she’s so “gracious” can you find me one genuinely good thing she’s said about you in public?  when Bernie said Biden was “decent” is the only time i’ve ever felt he lied to me
What's the difference between Biden and Trump? Who they want to give govt money (our tax dollars) to: poor people and businesses or rich people and businesses. That's it.
My favorite anti-Biden meme, although it does have 1 inaccuracy...he didn't vote against Roe v Wade, he just didn't support it in a 1974 interview.
All other nations want Biden.  He’s corrupt, frail, and lacking his mental faculties.  I’d they are helping anyone, that would be Sleepy Joe.
More pathological lying from ⁦ ‘s boss, ⁦ in a feeble attempt to fool the American public, but people are smarter than this and see right trough this school yard bully crap Only the cult followers believe this
Brian I think it’s time for the dems to start causing some Good Trouble.  Impeachment #2 should be priority one and get the Republicans all worked up while we get Joe Biden elected.
The fact that democrats are so confident in a Biden win has convinced me he’s gonna lose
More #LiarInChief BS from ⁦  Who only sits foot on choice property for Photo Ops And ⁦ toddles along behind singing Donny’s praises  #DumpTheTrump and Cory as well
This elderly white couple is voting for Biden. We have never, ever voted for a Republican.
What's amazing is Biden could unite the party instantly by putting Bernie as VP but he won't. Same as HRC in 16.
Not a trump but I am what ever makes this country better bot. And anyone with a brain knows that's not bidenSame goes for Biden.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!
For #2, just go to Biden War Room. It has complete voting info for every state.
Biden isn’t a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband’s is... #twocents
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
They’re just Biden time
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
I enjoy that Presidential campaigns are turning into meme offs. Biden needs to step it up.
Wait, so Biden working hard to make progress while Trump just sits and does nothing? I thought he was "Sleepy Joe?" I'm confused.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
Listen to this guy and that man in the White House and then listen to Biden/Harris. Ridiculous points and name calling vs policies, details, and intelligent talking points. Also, complete coherent sentences.
Trump doesn't seem to understand that Biden is a private citizen and has no authority to do anything about the virus. This is what Trump does - projects his own failures onto other people.
What if the governors all started listening to Biden now? Acting like he's president...
When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Leftist is the new Military Intelligence
Maybe making you rething the prespective you're incessently shouting and walking away from when someone hits a nerve?  Biden's not a help, he's an enabler.
Who Biden? Maybe it’s trump
You’re calling out CatholicVote, so you support Biden? A fake Catholic?  Really?
So you are saying you support Biden ? Please speak up, do you consider Biden, who says he is Catholic, even a good Catholic?  Answer please? Trump is no saint, but Biden ?
What the literal crazy?
And this Sunday Biden will go to church while Trump will be off on a golf course somewhere. His true religion
Bullshit!!! Obama/Biden added 11M jobs, you’ve lost 11M+ jobs!!!
Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
I think I figured it out. You don't know who this guy is. That's why you don't care he is in very public neurological decline. He's your father. You should care that he can't read any longer. At least as much as you do about Joe Biden. #TrumpIsUnwell
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate 😏
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
I’m voting Biden-Harris.   Let’s do this.  2020💙
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn’t that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She’s an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
I’m in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden’s running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris’s constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because “WE THE PEOPLE” for Biden don’t need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden’s running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want her😔
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards — Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden’s VP. Lmao!! 🤣 I’m really rooting for this 🤣😉
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!

Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
I don’t know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I’m just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.Someone intel-check me here:  if he suppresses Biden's votes, isn't he also suppressing Trump votes?  Feel free to drag me if I'm missing something obvious.
2020 Election: What Biden's Democratic Platform Proposes For People 50+ via
Biden is not the POTUS. He’s not a doctor. Technically he’s just creepy Uncle Joe right now. #MeToo #MAGA2020 #DontTouchMe #KnowYourRoleAndShutYourMouth
That won’t happen if Biden retreats to the way that the Obama administration dealt with Iran.
The President of the United States 🇺🇸 is Sabotageing the United States Postal Service to Try &amp; Suppress Free &amp; Fair Voting  in The United States of America 🇺🇸. Now .. Today he Admitted that on National TV !  Vote Biden-Harris 2020 Save Free &amp; Fair Elections in USA 🇺🇸 ! Vote 2020!
Trump went on National TV &amp; said Yes if re-elected he will End The Payroll tax ie- Social Security ! On National TV ! Vote Biden-Harris 2020 !  Vote By MAIL !
Payroll Tax is Social Security !  tRump will  Eliminate Social Security IF  re elected.  Vote Biden- Harris. 2020  !!
How rich. Biden has been hiding in his basement.
Anyone voting for Trump over Biden for religious reasons  is brain dead anyway...
You have got to be kidding!! People are not stupid. The economy and unemployment was a mess for 8 yrs under Biden and Obama and they blamed Bush . Get your facts straight
Biden called Trump's China travel restrictions back in January xenophobic. Biden and Harris apparently vying for the most dishonest ticket in US history. Harris is a liar or her ambition supersedes concerns that she has that Biden is a racist and a serial sexual abuser.
I’m a suburban wife, mom, and teacher. I’ll be voting for Biden/Harris. 💙🇺🇸
Joe Biden is insane. We have 50 state governments with health departments that can decide what is best for their states. We don't need a coastal liberal to tell us all what we have to do.
seeing Biden behind that desk on TV Saying rational things - it’s like OMG th SYS what leadership fees like - I had forgotten
Let's start calling Biden and Harris, "Mean and Nasty".
Liar.  next,  next,  next,  All Biden. Toss ups in Ohio, North Carolina, then add 80,000 dead Americans many in TX, GA and IA and I like my chances.  Better stop the mail and call Putin.
You nailed it:  Trump Train Wreck.  Biden/Harris going to mop the floor with you.   #1Term. #Loser
Biden criticized Trump for taking out General Qasem Soleimani but now says that Trump has coddled terrorists. Declining mental faculties and dishonesty is not a good combination
This sounds like misty-eyed optimism.  The only way he ratchets up his favorability is if Biden's poll-power drops significantly.  Trump's "love" comes only from his base, and that's static.

'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate  via
Leftism is things like universal healthcare, which I thought Biden was waffle-ish about.
It's not a joke, it's a nebulous term people (including Trump) are trotting out to invoke fear of a Biden presidency.
Anti Trump isn't a platform. The democrats need to be FOR things. Easy to articulate and rally around. (Their version of "build the wall") Biden is just another old man, with rambled sentences. FAR better than Trump, but not inspiring. Trump has fear and anger on his side.
Shes locked up almost as many black people as biden. I thought we were against police shes a cop. Hmmmmm seems you dont know much outside of playing basketball
Trump is going to have a Rough time with Joe Biden Also !  Is time to Drain the gOp Swamp !
I’m excited about the Biden/Harris ticket. And if the “professionals” turn out to be correct, President Harris will be inaugurated in Jan 2025. And Mayor Pete? He will be her VP.  Exciting times for our country.
First order of business for Biden/Harris
You have zero So do 100% I am posting this reply. I know Pres Trump/ Pence  have do a much better job through a turmoiled 3 3/4 yrs . Better by far than 8 corrupt yrs Obama/ Biden. Biden/Harris more corruption,Dems are socialists. SAD . Not good , not happening
I so thought Biden would pick her!I guess she as too much corrupt baggage to Obama. Very familiar to Biden though
She did say that she believed the women that accused Biden of aggressive sexual advances and sexual assault.
Really I so see it waay differently. Kamal is a real fraud . Also has lied numerous times as had Biden..  Biden for sure in his comments about college degreees etc
So I really want to ask ALLDemocracts are you comfortable  with Biden choosing Kamala Harris as VP? As well are you comfortable being a Democract /Socialist Party ??
Since Putin is still alive how about a Biden/Putin ticket?
My only comment is WHAT? 😊 she is totally incompetent and I know many in Calif. think so as well. Minorities, prisoners , common people.. actually Biden during debates.. so.. as a GOP I’m good. I have Trump/Pence 🇺🇸
I wouldn't be surprised. His base is energized. No one I know is excited about Biden.
Biden won because he wasn't as extreme as the other candidates. With his declining mental faculties, there is a real possibility that she could president during his first term. People that were worried about Harris will be even more worried tonight. This pick is made for Trump!
Biden became the presumptive nominee running as a moderate as compared to ultra liberals like Harris. Harris did poorly in the primaries because of her far left liberal views. The point is Biden is no longer a moderate and his association with Harris and AOC prove it.
Having a California liberal on the ticket is inconsistent with the idea that Biden is a moderate. AOC is one of his advisors. Her attacks on Biden during the debates puts into question the level of respect that she has for Biden.
I really would love to see a Dem team of rivals if Biden wins. Bring in Warren, Castro, Sanders, Booker, and Klobuchar to fix this mess.
Looks like the stock market likes a Biden-Kamala option.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
Joe Biden has selected a person with a cervix who is a descendant of slave owners.
Biden/Harris! We got this!
Joe Biden has selected his puppeteer with a cervix as his running mate.
Pedophile Joe creepy Biden who happens to have Alzheimer’s is not a presidential candidate who by the way wants socialism
If you have anything similar to this Trump lawsuit about Biden, I’d love to see it. Otherwise, in America, we are innocent until proven guilty in court, and Biden has never even been charged with anything like this. But keep believing the propaganda, it’s what helps Trump most.
And Trump is defunding Social Security and Medicare. At least Biden isn’t tearing away the money from grandmas and grandpas who need it.
So, let me explain why I’m on board with VBNMW this year. I’m Jewish, my hubby is Mex-Am, and we have 3 girls. We have faced hate from Trumpers for 4 years. Even got death threats. Nazis love him. And they hate Biden. So I go with who the Nazis hate.
If you could provide evidence of your claims, I’d be happy to read them. I know of one assault accusation, and it pisses me off. Those I wanted never did those kinds of things, but they didn’t win. I don’t have to love everything about Biden, but I’m repulsed by everything Trump.
I do. Again, guy who’s bankrupted multiple businesses, multiple rape charges, friends with lots of pedos, 170K+ Americans dead, or Biden. I’ll happily go with Biden.
Lol, I’m no neoliberal, just someone who sees the danger in voting for anyone but Biden, as that’ll certainly give the win to Trump. But hey, enjoy whatever you’re on, clearly it’s working well for you 😂
H1N1, Ebola... no pandemics? No, they just didn’t hit American shores like COViD has, because we had a plan in place that Trump dismantled. And please show me the credible rape allegation against Biden, I’d be happy to provide the same for Trump.
Trump has been accused of raping at least 20 women, including one who was 13 at the time. Biden sniffs hair. And you think they’re the same?
I did the same &amp; voted for my fave. None of my top 5 got the nom. Biden is the only other candidate with at least as much name recognition as Trump, which means he has the best chance at beating him. So that’s why I’m voting for him, because that’s what matters most right now.
Cool, but you know that means Trump will win, right? This isn’t the year to take a stand; we tried and ended up with Biden anyway. Please consider holding the fight off until 2024 so we can get the country closer to where it needs to be, and I promise I’ll be back to joining you.
So... you want to ensure Trump wins by peeling off Biden voters? Because until you commented, I’d never heard of that candidate, and my guess is, there’s several million other Americans that haven’t and won’t vote for him. Stop sabotaging America.
Sorry you’d rather have someone actually accused of rape by almost 20 women over someone who’s bad at respecting space bubbles. And while we’re comparing, remind me of how many Americans died total due to pandemics under Obama-Biden and how many have died with Trump? Yeah.
1. Biden is not immune, never said he was, just that he’s better than Trump. 2. Trump will be on the ballot this Nov, and this is the only time I’ve supported VBNMW. 3. We get the country back on track and move further left in 2024.
Not a neoliberal, just don’t want to let this country continue with Trump. Didn’t vote for Biden in the primaries, just smart enough to recognize that if I don’t vote for him, Trump wins. Sorry you haven’t come to that conclusion yet, hope your vote doesn’t give Trump the win.
America doesn’t actually practice democracy. If we did, we wouldn’t have an electoral system that gives the win to someone who actually lost. And Biden is a far better choice than Trump, hands down.
For this election, anyone is better than Trump. None of my top 5 picks were nominated, so instead I’m voting for Biden as he’s the only other candidate with a chance at winning. Keep fighting the good fight, I’ll join again in 2024. But right now, we need Trump out.
That’s where I’m at. None of my top five got the nom, but I’d take Biden over Trump in a heartbeat.
Even if they did have justification, they wouldn't.  They'd roll him out like a Weekend at Bernie's skit before they'd let Pence step in, or his base would collectively lose their sh*t.  Similarly, the Dems would never admit failure with Biden, unless it was the plan all along.
Seeing the reticence to invoke 25A now, what causes you to believe it would happen with Biden?
How in the WORLD ? Is Biden rising in the polls of how he would handle the Coronavirus ????? Truly inaccurate reporting or polls!! What the heck ? I don’t in ANYWAY agree!!!
Still rather have Biden over Trump. This year we need to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho to ensure we can have an election in 2024, because having Trump get re-elected means we could officially slide into authoritarianism.
As long as he doesn’t pick someone named Trump or Pence, I’m still voting for Biden ❤️
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
Have you loony Libs seen Biden’s “press” conferences???
Biden campaigning about returning decency and honesty to the White House proves once again that the last thing Joe Biden is honest. Here he perpetuates a lie debunked years ago.
Why would Joe Biden need a helmet?
Proving yet again that Reliable Sources is anything but reliable. Nearly 40% of the American people believe that Joe Biden is suffering from declining mental faculties.
But if you vote for Creepy Joe Biden aren’t you doing the same with a mental ill person?
Did trump just bribe (trying to buy) the American people by saying "If I'm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax," Trump said. "Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that, they don't want that."
Joe Biden wears a mask while biking... but doesn’t wear a helmet.   Hey Joe, more than 26,000 U.S. children have been sent to the emergency room for a traumatic brain injury related to bicycle riding.   THIS sums up his mental capacity of Biden right there.
Joe Biden is not the president, genius. He is not an elected official.  Why doesn't your boss tell Moscow Mitch to hold a vote on the bill that passed the House months ago?
I'm blown away that it's come down to Biden vs. Trump, but here we are.  It's the GOP's only play though, because championing Trump but calling Biden out looks like hypocrisy.  They're both relics from another era, and really should never have been considered in the first place.
Biden isn't president and HOLY HELL Trump's entire life is a scam.
Wasn’t that what Biden’s sexual assault accuser also said his response was when she rebuffed him? This was well before he “coined the phrase”.
We have been ever since Trump was installed in office. It’s been a clown show and Putin’s been pulling the strings. Can’t blame China for trying, Russia makes it look easy. Problem is, Biden isn’t an easy mark like Trump, so all this does is hurt the validity of a win.
And cases will be zero...  You are losing to Biden!!
Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don’t. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.All Biden’s supporters aren’t pedophiles but they have decided it’s not a deal breaker.
Great! Biden can haul in what, 25+ that trump sexually assaulted, I’m sure Stormy would be happy to show up
needs to become Biden’s AG
Pinata is too polite... Biden is a shit pile and everyone NOW knows it !
Biden says he’ll veto M4A EVEN if it passed Congress. Yet you think voting in progressives, which you admit will be a slow process, &amp; we have seen Dems will fight harder than they ever fought Trump, so it passes Congress will change his mind when 88% of Dems supporting it doesn’t
Yes, without Biden apologists. Liberals are not the left. Have a good night.
She endorsed Biden when Bernie was still in the race.
I’m not worried at all for either. Harris is going to chew Pence up and spit him out. I will guarantee you this though, Trump will not stalk Biden like he did Hillary, Biden’s from Scranton, he’s still a scrappy dude
The swamp, that's rich. He's put unqualified folk that donated money in positions of power. Devoss is clueless. And what about the unprecedented turnover and unfilled positions?  Imperfect, and yet this started with how Biden is "Imperfect". The mental gymnastics from you 🙄
NO !  Trump canattackJor Biden's weaknesses which are many,  here's one.
She was acting like a prosecutor making an argument   Biden seems to understand
Biden's grades in class. Repeated 3rd grade, earned all C's and D's in 1st 3 semesters at University of Del. Made a whopping A in P.E. a B in English Writers and an F in ROTC and graduated 76th at Syracuse Law in 85. I had a way better GPA, maybe I should run. lol. Unbelievable.
starting to hope they actually do let Biden debate Trump just so we can get some more gaffe compilation videos
You destroyed 174,000 American lives &amp; the vibrant economy Obama &amp; Biden left in your hands. Yet like everything else you inherit, you've run America into the dirt, &amp; spent more than a full year &amp; $130M on taxpayer funded golfing trips that YOU profited from.
The Dem Party pours $ into fighting/preventing progressives as much as they can. I support all progressive candidates available, but the party fights tooth &amp; nail. We’re slowly building progressives in Congress despite the party’s best efforts. Biden won’t be forced after he wins
Biden can't interfere, right? That's one of my biggest concerns w/ him - kumbaya  days are long over. It will begin w/ DOJ , I hope. No pardons. No deals.
we knew you were cooking up this nonsense. whatever.   BIDEN 2020!
Ummm...Biden ain't winning.   Dems committed political malpractice with this ticket.  He shouldn't win. The put up a guy with severe cognitive issues. It's ridiculous.
81 days until we re-elect the most America loving, NON politician to be  f/four more years. Jobs. Security. Peace in the Middle East. Bringing troops home. Defeated ISIS. Killed Terrorists. Takes on China. IRAN. NOKO.... Obama/Biden committed Treason. That's a nightmare.
I mean, you’re making my point. Dems ARE in a position to effect change, they CHOOSE not to, why keep supporting them? Also, Biden said it himself. Now, he does have a long history of outright lying (like Trump), so I understand why taking his own word is risky, but still.
Look up his record of success focused on ALL Americans Ms. Swift. Lowest unemployment f/All Americans. Funded historic black colleges, criminal justice reform and so much more.  Biden. Harris.  Phonies. Corrupt Marxists.  Your statements are worthless. Uneducated. Factless.
So you played golf and bashed Biden while your brother was dying. You are an amazing piece of sh*t. Man am I glad I am no relation to you! Bless Robert. So sorry for his passing. 🙏
What a tragic and ignorant rant.  Look up President Trump's policies.  All have been good for America after decades of corrupt politicians and 8 years of the traitors Obama/Biden admin who spied on his campaign &amp; attempted a coup d'erat.
Biden love pedophiles its up to you,  thanks
American that vote for Biden you will vote for a not American citizen like Kamara lol
You know the VP basically doesn’t do anything right?  How desperate is Biden that he is constantly taking about the bottom of the ticket? “It’s not just me! I picked a girl!”
Who is going to watch the DNC on Monday? Prediction of this comedy show. Someone who sounds like Biden talks showing him in the basement, Harris will talk too much, AOC gets her 60 seconds of shame and a lot of music. Yawn. lol.
🙄  Irrelevant Greta consistently making shit up.  1)Sit tight, the Convention is next week where Biden will accept the nomination.  2)We typically respect the notion “one president at a time.” Although we *are* in desperate times.  3)You’re irrelevant.  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is an equal roadblock, he literally said he’d veto M4A even if Congress passed it. Dems voted FOR Trump’s budgets, surveillance powers, judges, Space Force, impeached ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. I’ll give them down ballot votes, chance to prove themselves in Congress
What's this analysis based on? Why would a Biden presidency return more on ave than historical averages? Also a major factor is which party  takes the Senate..What party does the writer affiliate with??
That has nothing to do with biden though
Joe Biden isn’t ideal but if he doesn’t take the opportunity to host briefings and press conferences in a casual morning environment drinking coffee and calling it “A Cup of Joe with Joe” I will RIOT
Millions out of work and facing eviction/foreclosure, 170,000 dead from COVID-19, a POTUS openly trying to suppress the vote, out of control debt...  GOP answer: Biden’s a socialist!
Same goes for Biden.
I am proud that we have such a great breadth of Democratic leaders.  The candidates who ran against Biden, all of the women who were considered for VP, our honestly impressive Congress people.  They have Trump.  The rest of the GOP went to sleep.
Can Joe Biden "Thread the Needle" Among Democrats?
A Snowden pardon would be wonderful. What can Biden offer in response for the progressives in his party?
Sanders EARNED delegates for the convention. Biden also won more delegates. The convention is where the nominee becomes official. Don’t worry. You’ll get your crappy centrist candidate &amp; a platform that doesn’t include M4A, despite these votes. They still earned a voice there.
China endorsed Biden/Harris, this should be your wake up call.
Oh yes, we all love hearing you lie about Covid, voter fraud, starving the post office, and ridiculous shit you make up about Joe Biden. Can’t wait!!!
GOP: Hillary was a crook. After Trump was elected.... no investigations.  GOP: Biden is a crook. Prior to Bidens run for President... no investigations.  Its almost like they're just screwing around
Dear traitor John  No one cares about Hunter Biden or you. Forget about it Its all propaganda
We were told Biden was “most electable”, that he’s smashing the polls, that we, from Joe’s own mouth, should “vote for someone else then” when asking the slightest challenging question. NOW y’all need us? Votes are earned. Biden is a serial liar too &amp; a warmonger. Your bar is low
Joe Biden. Chinese operative. Selling out America for 40+ years.
Biden is the coup, and Harris is the de gras. Jumping Joe Biden will open the door and do his four, preparing Harris to do eight more.
#JudgeJeanine this is the Harris-Biden campaign, not the Biden-Harris campaign
Speaking of Q,  Now you guys are retreating conspiracy theories too? That's what trump did, you've got no leg to stand on to criticize Joe Biden as long as you support that disgusting pig.
Biden:  Put me in office and then let's talk about what we can do together  C'mon jack I know to get the money first.
I am voting early against Trump and for Biden/Harris. As soon as I receive my mail in ballot, I’m completing it and hand delivering it to the election commission office.  America deserves better than this BS Trump administration.
Anyone in the GOP does not get to talk about this.  Your grift and greed, accompanied by lies and cheats make me sick.  Shall we do an honest comparison of Biden’s plans vs Trumps?  Stop whining about being victims, and do your fucking job.
This is the first time I've ever seen a Biden flag
This
You do know that Biden did not make that call right?
You're just accusing Biden of being a sexual assaulter because it fits with your narrative. It's a disgusting thing to do.
I think 4 years of Corporate-Prison Biden and another 8 of Corporate-Prison Harris will end Western Democracy.  You guys need to do BG on the Dem candidates. Either party wins, we're screwed for decades to come. #NeverKamala #NeverTrump #neverbiden

Biden got no shot #qanon
Trump and Clinton are known adulterers with ties to a child rapist; Biden is/has neither.
lmao Biden? Who was accused by one woman that turned out to be a serial liar?
By not voting for Trump (a vote for Biden), not voting for Biden (a vote for Trump), and then voting 3rd party, you actually get 3 votes. I feel very smart knowing this.
Every politician gets at least 127,853 accusations every week minimum. It should be looked into but innocent till proven guilty. Even Biden.
Good Lord STOP embarrassing yourself.  This is VERY uncomfortable for the people who know how you achieved your position in government. You are not qualified to be there. Just like Biden. We all know this. That is all.
Nothing I hate more than identity politics----it's the #DemocraticParty's biggest weakness.....Just another reason I left the party after 2016---I follow policy.....speaking of, if Joe Biden promised to pardon Julian Assange and Edward Snowden of any crimes, I would vote for him.
LOOOOLLLLLLLL Biden thinks they’re taking personal mailboxes. What a jackass.
#Biden  Kamala Harris really thinks allot of today's young adults the 18 to 24 year olds
What? Biden and his prison bill and Harris the laughing cop? We're on the verge of having even more than 25% of the world's prisoners -- with those 2 sociopaths, we'll soon have 50%. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
the ass-kissing continues unabated. this is why Biden was brilliant to pick her. still, you could maybe do some journalism at some point.
Joe Biden does not know who Donald Trump is.
We cant go to canada or Mexico. So...GO TO WASHINGYON DC
International students will avoid the US for at least the next 3 years even if Biden is elected. The numbers will dwindle significantly if Trump is re-elected. Those numbers won't rebound. So much MONEY lost. How do I know? I worked with international students. They spend $$$
In doing a little more checking, I can find at least 3 Popes that Biden was blessed to meet.  For a man you don't seem to think is Catholic, that's a pretty good track record.
If all goes well and Biden gets elected, do you have a plan for how conservatives can return to a functioning party willing to compromise and govern for the good of the people? I value your opinion but I see many never trumpers holding on to their intransigence.
He just lost 10 million votes. 👍🏻🇺🇸👍🏻🇺🇸👍🏻🇺🇸👍🏻🇺🇸👍🏻🇺🇸  Biden, at Muslim voters summit, says ‘I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith’ | Fox News
Did he just endorse Biden/Harris 2020? Guy is lost, go sit him down somewhere.
Biden isn’t a blatant liar like Donald Trump? It is scary that Trump supporters accept the transparent lies.
Win this election, John! We have to flip the Senate! I have sent money and will send more! In October, when I get my ballot, I will vote for you and Biden/Harris immediately within a day and place it in the local drop-off box! I am advising everyone to do the same!
Sounds like he's endorsing Biden.
I do not support rapist, racist war mongers, which is why I am just as likely to vote trump as I am biden. How about you try building an argument FOR your candidate, instead of against the other one.
Actually, he is more favored to win then against Hillary. His favorability is higher than Obama at this stage in his presidency.  Liberals are lurching too far left. People will begrudgingly vote Trump in order to not have Biden.
am i the only one that has access to other parts of the internet like idk the page on joe Biden’s website with his policies

Joe Biden could pass away and no one would give a fuck because he’s average and not worthy of anything who in their right mind would want a bitch like Kamala Harris for President. Get the fuck outta here bitch I am voting for Trump (again!) #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
Now that's funny. China knows that Lying Don is an easily manipulated fool and Biden isn't.
Very true, so Biden should not get elected then.  Appreciate the optimism.
Yeah youre even better than Biden at dodging and deflecting questions while cherry picking facts.
This guy goes to full retard levels in this article... 😂🤣😅🙄🤦
Fuck Joe Biden nigga #MAGA #BlackVoicesForTrump
we don't care if she had botched her presidential run.  Biden won.  ALL the other candidates lost. we are thrilled at the ticket.  they compliment each other.  and they will be the next president and vice president of the US.
I confess I'm torn. A big part of me wants the Republicans to keep the Senate to check a Biden presidency. But a big part of me wants to see a total reset of the Republican Party. Every possible outcome is largely bad. And anyway the outcome doesn't depend on what I think.
It's not as simple as "just elect Democrats". That's a good place to start. But we can't make the mistake of folding up shop &amp; going home after the election is over: that's where the hardest work begins.
Does  pivot and start yelling about deficits the minute Joe Biden is sworn in?

Is she going to investigate the #Biden rape allegations? She called him a rapist and a segregationist sewwww......   #Election2020
Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Pendley has no business being in charge of Colorado's public lands, and yet Trump still has this anti-public zealot in the building "to lead the Bureau of Land Management".  Why won't  speak out against this guy? #copolitics #cosen
I will grant you that a majority of people who identify as liberals ..sadly myself included, only complain when It is a Republican (is Trump really a real Republican??!) It's a serious concern for me as We get closer to the election, that if Biden wins we won't complain as much.
Amen. And, Biden should not interfere. No pardons. No deals.
I wonder how many set of knee pads she needed to get a VP spot with the Biden team. 🍆💦

"Well, I was considering voting for Biden, but now I'll have to support Trump." -someone, probably
It doesn't matter. We are onto him and know that he is a decrepit person. Someone with no morals or ethics or sense of anyone else but himself and his insatiable narcissism. Joe Biden will carry on. The networks better not carry Moron-In-Chief. Enough. #DoNotCoverHim
Yet another mediocre white man ranting about how a woman of color doesn’t live up to his standards. Can’t believe the  printed this steaming pile of sexist, racist sh*t
I have not seen 1 Joe Biden sticker  At all here in Denver Colorado  Although I did see a Bernie Sanders  2020 sticker🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joe Biden Voters Need Trigger Warning For Blazing Saddles  via
Second time Biden predicted something that was labeled “crazy” but came true. Hmm.
Trump bashed Fox News and Hillary Clinton, whom he called "much smarter and sharper" than Joe Biden.  via
'“People are tired of doing everything through their computer and Zoom,” Ruscha said.'  Sometimes I forget there's a national campaign going on. I've never even been targeted by the Biden campaign. 😳
Joe Biden is the most racist person on earth. lol. He also thinks they all look alike as well.
Acosta, have you ever asked Biden a question? You are not a journalist. You hate Conservatives with a passion. You are not a Cuban American but a Fidelito ass kisser.
FYI: Trump just handed Biden/Harris a golden goose on a silver platter when he tried to destroy the USPS. No matter your political affiliation millions of Americans and businesses depend on the USPS and they will protest against this to the ninth degree.
This is the best argument I've heard. Basically we are voting for who we want to fight. Do you want to fight against Trump or fight against Biden. The claim is it's easier to fight with Biden than it is with Trump. And if Biden wins his supporters will realize nothing has changed
I wouldn't leave Biden to walk my dog. The guy isn't fit for the job.
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020    tweet 2 4) a VP who is left of the progressive squad (AOC, Omar, etc) which means she is w Bernie Sanders, green new deal, socialism/marxism 4) a VP who called Biden a racist at the Dem primary debates yet magically has decided he's now ok No thanks!
A lot of Biden signs nearby. #RidenWithBiden
Unless joe Biden becomes president, than everything goes back to normal within 24 hours....wack
This photo is such a simple yet profound demonstration of the difference between Trump and Biden.  Trump talk goes no where and just fills the air with BS. Biden supports his words with measurable actions.
Biden: I'm going to beat Joe Biden 🤣😂  via
The man has golfed 132 times since taking office...he has lied  every day he has been in office. His lack of understanding of anything is staggering.I am truly sorry you cannot see that.  Biden will be the easiest vote I have ever made. He will restore on place on the world stage
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
He is like a gnat swarming ...  Biden will just wave him away.
Giving Biden a heads-up, isn't the smartest tactic, imo.
No amount of Trump being bad makes Biden any better. They are both horrible picks for leadership and the public keeps allowing it to happen by voting for it. A 3rd party can win if people were smart enough to vote for them. That’s the only way we fix it.
If you slander Trump, and the police, you are supporting Biden like it or not.
This is Trumps America.  He should resign and leave the clean up to Biden and Harris.  They are adults.
Im so proud of Joe Biden’s  choice of  Kamala Harris for Vp
More on mask madness: Biden is asking every American to wear mask while outside for the next 3 months making it a condition for full reopening of the country &amp; calling it a "patriotic" act:  How did we get to this NONSENSE from here?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it does more harm to Trump than Biden.
...that's a list of polls showing Biden competitive in Iowa.
They know it's their best chance for continued injustice. Biden may not be in favor of defunding the police but that administration will be way more apt to hold cops accountable for misdeeds.
I disagree with Trump. I also disagree with  decision to run an unqualified corrupt criminal who establishment dems think has name value over Andrew Romanoff. I will vote for Biden/Harris. But I will not sell out my values and beliefs to vote for a puppet like Hickenlooper...
Unless Biden offers something big and international, I would rather stay in El Paso and not relocate my family.
I’m with China!    There So smart!  They use Big Words!     Go Biden.         Winning
Nicely done!  Loved when you pointed out she's on Joe Biden's ticket, not Bernie Sanders!!
No matter what the lying  comes up with from now to November, vote Biden/Harris. Just remember, Trump is a liar and a con man. That is all you need to remember! 🇺🇸
My first question when Biden named Harris as his running mate was, "What's her position on abortion?" That's not the issue that determines my vote, but I know many pro-life people that give that issue the most weight.
"They seem to be able to supercharge him [Biden] for 30 to 60 seconds at a time." -  Dark Journalist
That’s why I won’t vote for Biden!!
So my pendulum is swinging towards Biden, (sorry Tara) BUT not entirely. He &amp; Kamala need to EARN my vote. My world has been rocked.. and rolled over. Where the fuck is congress RN? America needs your help. November is coming &amp; your job may be gone. My husband’s is... #twocents
Trump will have a sizable margin over senile r****d segregationist biden, but it's helpful if we remember that it hinges on us, and if we don't turn out, we could lose.
Harris, then Biden actually. I grew up inside the beltway, know what the data says, and you have to be delusional to think anybody is going back to working with the ku klux GOP. Hating Bernie isn't anything to Clinton voters who are suffering because of "bipartisan" nonsense.
Whats the Biden Bungle? Please explain?
cringe !   DNC so powerful &amp; corrupt BIDEN molests girls on VIDEO!  ON video BRAGS &amp; LAUGHS about his corrupt extortion of UKRAINE forced firing of Ukraine offical for (investigating JOE BIDEN) with taxpayers money!  DNC always above laws we must jump to daily &amp; pay for
Did you read the OP... Biden explicitly said "that all governors should mandate wearing masks." So where are you getting this Federalism bit?
Kamala Harris joined Joe Biden’s ticket.  I slept well two nights following that announcement.
should SUE BLM DNC ACTION to repair rebuild 170 cities got billions in extortion checks from corporations forced to pay mob extortion so DNC BLM FASCISTS would not burn loot murder! dont use taxpayer money to rebuild like BIDEN BUILD BACK BETTER! DNC BLM facists must pay billions
...trump is 74, no spring chicken. biden is 77.   biden looked pretty locked on the other night, unlike the latest ramblings from 45.
Still can't wait for what small infraction Biden will do that will get the media horny for 4 more yrs of fascism.
We have voted by mail in Co for  problems. Do you really want to compare Biden to Trump cognitively?👤👩👨📷📺 I do not watch CNN-I read. A lot. Harris is highly qualified. It is DJT who bankrupt a casino( among others). He cheats. He lies. At everything.
Criticism on ones record and policy platform is not homophobia. If it were rooted in silly things like that then any criticism against Bernie is ageist, Kamala is sexist and racist, Biden is ageist, etc. There’s a difference in actual homophobia and solid critique
Kamala Harris in debates - joe Biden sexually assaults women and is a racist.  Now - I fully support Joe Biden who sexually assaults women and is a racist.
Excellent point. By choosing Biden/Harris he has shown Trump/Pence that he is no friend of theirs. Huge mistake by Leo. I thought he had more political savvy than to pick a winner in the US. He also is too chummy with the Chinese Communists. Another bad decision.
I want intelligence back in Washington.  Replace dumb and stupid with Biden and Harris!
I prefer "President Elect Joe Biden".
Just watched you with Peebles.  Why are you subtly trying to question Biden’s mental competence?  So unfair without doing the same with Trump.  Please be more fair.  Geez.  Do you seriously want 4 more years of this ? Don’t be selflsh.  Be honest !
Thx admitting u regret it. I’m still in shock anyone could support this ass hat! 3rd party vote is useless, at least once dem/rep have been chosen. Sadly, it’s the way it is. Mny times (I’m 55), I’ve had to pick 1, out of 2 I didn’t love. Biden can’t be worse. VoteBiden! 🙏🏻
For each question you ask Biden, you get ask Trump one. That’s it.
Yeah yeah if I did anything that anything like the Biden’s, they would throw me into a hole
Biden will win. Hope you get better
You throw mud at Trump to seeehat sticks. Problem? Biden is all mud
So you are attacking Biden after you recently tweeted that they only attack you if you are winning. So which one is it?

I would've supported Biden if not for these followers, hachi machi jack.
Biden isn't accused of 'groping' anyone.  Trump supporters decided that the 25 allegations of sexual assault, racism, incompetence, and worst economic disaster in history isn't a deal breaker.
Biden needs to go into a bunker and let Trump dig his own grave and throw the dirt on top of himself.
My guess is that Biden will get approximately 600,000 votes from Postal workers. I bet Trump didn’t think about that.... #TrumpEvictions #PostmasterGeneral #PostalWorkers #SupportUSPS #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
They had to allow bloomberg to run, so it would make biden seem more reasonable.
The 1st comedy movie in theaters after the plandemic should be all the Liberal hype and tears leading up to the election: 2016 tears, faux outrage over Stormy Daniels and gushing over Avanatti, Kavanaugh win, impeachment failure, Biden gaffes (edited for time), 2020 Liberal tears
The nasty memes of Harris began the moment Biden picked her to be his running mate.  This ad targets people in their mid-thirties. It hits Trump hard because it is exactly who he is.
Biden also openly called for the arrest of anarchists. I agree with your assessment, the democrats are 2016 Republicans. They just are not loud and crude.
They only impeached him for going after biden. They had no mention of the crimes he has committed. If they really wanted to impeach AND remove him, they would've made a case with teeth.

Retreated to the high mountains for four days of internet-free solitude. Returned to Colorado wildfires, something awful re the USPS, and Chrissy Teigen’s baby bump. But news of Biden’s VP pic? Elusive. Had literally to sift through Google results for any sort of hope.🤷🏽‍♀️
This is why you want Biden/Harris elected, you will (imo) get a DOJ who will actually focus on Police brutality and reform instead of “racism” against white/Asians at Yale. I just cannot believe DOJ wasted two year of tax payer dollars on this
This may seem shocking pilgrims but in many matters of foreign policy, being against Trump is not always in your best interest for you nor would it be for a Biden administration.
He echoes Jared Kushner, calling the deal a “historic step” 4 peace in the Mideast. He praises the "bravery" &amp; "statesmanship” of the Arab despot.   Welcome to Biden’s Middle East Policy which will look similar to Trump's policy in 2 critical areas that plague the region...
Biden has called Trump, America’s first racist president.   When this racist US president, orchestrates a deal between a neo-fascist Israeli leader &amp; an Arab despot (that ignores basic Palestinians rights) – how does Biden respond? ....
Joe Biden would be a fool to reject a continuation of an arms embargo against the rat like Iranian regime.
I don't see how he can debate. The Biden team will surely think of some confrontations that are new and unexpected.
Why not move on to being pissed off about Biden's VP pick? The sociopath who laughs about locking up children over homework? The one who never went after billionaires Now takes $$$ from Israel? How many liberals are going to vote for her? Trump might win a 2nd term w/ cheating
Yeah Biden figured out how you could pay him fo nothing but a crippling crime bill and a way to get rich!!!
Reason # I lost count, to not vote for Biden
I’m not sure why you feel that way.  Biden has moved left since winning the nomination, endorsing the Green New Deal, for one.
I see more of a problem with the USPS endorsing Joe Biden with Democrats pushing for mail-in voting. You, of course, you miss the seriousness and significance of that.
We will know. It will be Joe Biden
You don't know about Harris' record in California? Locking up poor POC and never going after billionaires?  Biden/Harris won't be any better than Trump. On the contrary, it will put sociopath Harris in power for 8-12 years.
Biden (to black interviewer): “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black!”  Biden (re busing): “unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle...”  There’s plenty more
Biden will never be known as having an original thought with the exception of confusing his sister for his wife!
What is our world coming to? Why do people think Joe Biden is racist when he was vice president for obama, a black man?  If you were point out sexism that might make more sense.

Oct 2020: tweets photo of her voting Green, ends up the fastest ratio in Political Twitter history  Nov 2020: Biden wins, she locks her account down
They're loosing early this year because the know Biden can't win.
They aren't excited to vote for Biden, they're excited to vote against Trump
To date, are only promises with the aim of winning an election.  Perhaps Biden will flee from the Ukrainian public prosecutor in the presidency? I don't know, but I've learned not to blindly believe what a politician promises!
I'm also not sure if the whole world will see Biden winning as a victory.  They still see him as a war monger that believes in American exceptionalism.  They also talked about his incompetency and failing health during the primaries...they thought of him as big of a joke as Trump

Just depressing to think of the liberal reaction to stuff like Jennicet Gutierrez protesting Obama, how she was shamed &amp; derided then, would be seen as a hero if she did the same to Trump, how it’ll be back to the derision from liberals under Biden
The point is that Trump is so horrible, that electing Biden, pushes voters to the left in that environment, rather than turning hippies into Qanon supporters &amp; hyper racist Trump supporters.
Does she still support Biden’s sexual assault victims??
An you say Sexual Predator?? Oh yea you already called Biden your mate that!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I buy that there’s an upper bound on elasticity at some point, maybe somewhere around Biden +15, where the logic of the spreadsheet may start to break down. I just don’t think it’s unique to Utah. It’s entirely possible that after Alaska, there’s a fairly strict cutoff line.
No dude. I didn't say women and Democrats are the same thing. I said Democrats were telling us to believe women until Joe Biden came along.  Sorry if understanding how subordinate clauses work is hard.
Joe Biden has less than a snowball's chance in HELL of being President with Harris! That seals it!
#Biden-Harris #blm #Fuc*Trump. Yeah I’m “crimson and clover “
The fact the Democrats are manufacturing &amp; rigging this whole election process proves to you the pathetic jerks they are!  NO one in their right mind would nominate Joe Biden.   Dems are doubling down as they always do! He's going to lose &amp; it's guaranteed with Harris! Book IT!
Biden does look stupid and Lost! Why are they doing this?  Why not just give the nomination to Harris to begin with and quit this stupid Smoke &amp; Mirrors act!
Be real for a second, what if Obama of Clinton, or Biden drove up to Montana or Texas and started grabbing people off the street in unmarked cars who they thought might be up to something. Would you rubbed stamp that shit or would you call it unAmerica &amp; fascist? Honest question.

We're 159 days from the inauguration. Take note of what Trump &amp; his puppeteers are already doing to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated. Do you seriously think there is a limit to what they'll do between now and January 20? Mail-tampering is only a beginning.
ABC is so out of touch they don't even understand the difference between absentee and mail in and Trumps constant defense of absentee. ABC is as out of it as Joe Biden 😆
I take no joy in voting for Biden, but Trump is pushing us towards authoritarianism... the choice is pretty simple, suck it up like me and vote Dem for once. The Republicans aren't even Republican anymore, they are The Party of Trump.
He got a literal Sunrise Movement member and AOC in talks with Biden, among many other things.
I keep thinking how hilarious it would be if Trump just called them the Biden Child Cages
So funny Kumalot, let’s see how much you laugh when you and Babbling Biden lose come November.
This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.

A vote for anyone but Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump/Pence. Period. You don't have to vote for Biden... but you should know if you do not you are voting for Trump. Work to reform the system in 86 days... for 2020 the math doesn't work any other way.
Nah I think about that all the time. Imagine a UHC system where you don’t have to worry about that. I get about thinking about now. I’ll be honest I just don’t trust Biden that he’ll do the right thing. He’s taking a lot of money from the insurance companies
