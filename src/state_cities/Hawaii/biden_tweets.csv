when biden says something stupid the media is always trying to justify it. give him the benefit of doubt. this is not the same with trump.

Moving to Canada if Trump or Biden get elected.
because the media takes everything he says sooooo harshly but when biden says “if you don’t vote for me then you aint black” everything is peaches and cream. everything biden gets away with would get trump crucified.
Yet the postal workers union openly supports Biden and has said they will do all to help him win ...
Trump says Joe Biden is “against the Bible.” But when asked what his favorite book of the Bible isTrump said “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians,” which is how the book is known by anyone who has read and actually cares about the Bible.
Trump says that Joe Biden is “against God.” Actually, Biden is a devout Catholic. Nobody is more “against God” than somebody who is incapable of telling the truth, such as Dishonest Donald Trump.
Come on, writing has been on the wall. Obama shadow presidency is the goal and she’s best equipped to help accomplish it with an impotent Biden.
Biden Says He Would Not Stand In the Way of a Trump Prosecution if Elected
Why does Joe Biden view Black and Hispanic voters as some  resource that belongs to the Democratic Party?  Abraham Lincoln put an end to that.  We are Americans first, and Americans' votes should be earned and not assumed or taken for granted.
Because Biden has dementia
Biden is correct, in politics/voting Latinos are more diverse than African Americans. So what? It's not an insult it's a fact based on voting statistics. In our state more Asian Americans vote democrat...it's a fact. TRUMP YOU ARE STUPID!
I saw Trump’s untutored response. He did not appear to remember what was said, much less why it was problematic. It seemed like he heard Biden had said something and he should jump on the opportunity to say “Biden Bad!” then hope others will chime in to carry the conversation
I’m thinking the Democrats are up to something. We had some really good talent before Biden decided to put his name in the ring and then they choose him over Bernie....  Something doesn’t seem right.
Biden you dummy,,stfu before you fuck this shit up for all of us daaamn!
Yeah, that's called racism. You are a nice man Ari, but you are giving credit where it isn't deserved, nor earned. Biden is a racist. Especially in today's world.
Personally, I think this pick is disgusting no matter what.   But Biden better win Florida or there truly is ZERO excuse for such an explicitly evil choice.   Appointing Latin American fascists to do your outreach... what a disgrace 😤
It is a statement of Biden’s beliefs to be sure. Trump cannot manage the simple teleprompter speeches someone else writes for him. And on his own, Trump is a bully. Def not familiar with religious faith.
lmao you really think biden is a better option?
Biden prays in church...never seen a photo of trump praying let alone praying in a church
Maybe you haven’t seen crowds because Biden and his supporters are smarter than lawn gnomes; and not putting communities at risk with spreading COVID.
Clearly Biden must be incredibly powerful
They criticized that picture of Biden praying because the Trump folks do not KNOW what praying looks like nor what it means to bow your head in quiet prayer.  Pity, all of the Trump staff who thought themselves so smart.
#Biden expects #Blacks vote for him. Otherwise they are not blacks. His own words! Biden clarifies comments comparing African American and Latino communities

trump v. Biden... we know who wins this one! 🙏🏼
Finally Biden and competent never belong in the same sentence. Every time he has to speak off teleprompter it's a new train-wreck. It's not even amusing anymore - your party seems cruel to run a candidate who is incapable of the task before him.
Tyler your party decided that it would upend the nation and Impeach President Trump on a false and contrived pretext. If Democrats are worried about phone calls to Ukraine, they should probably be very concerned about Hunter Biden and his relationship to Bursima.
Biden's advisors recommending that he skip the debates is like pleading the 5th. It says that something is wrong. They really believe that he can't handle the debate. And these are his supporters.
In my wildest dreams  I cannot imagine a voter saying, “Wow! That Kanye West will be my choice instead of Biden!” The opposite might happen, they might leave trump and switch to KW.
We may not all like Joe Biden, or would have preferred to see someone else like Bernie take the democratic nomination, but because he is our only option we need to vote for him. Don't let your voice be silent even when Trump tries to slow down or criticize mail in voting. VOTE.
I understand God has also bought all the Guardian Angels taisers.  Hey, we are talking about JOE BIDEN "hurting God." You can't be too careful you know!  #TheAngelsAreArmed  #ItsAllCool
biden has to avoid trump and west they're both mental. tell them they can talk to a potted support plant that his staff has just so they can debate something that has a comparable mental ability.

Now Biden is trying to gain votes by getting voters to feel sorry for him.
Biden said Black do not live in a diverse community today. Get him back in the basement and away from microphones.
Joe Biden needs to watch what he says. 🤦🏽‍♂️
#Racist #Biden and his comments about #Blacks. Will they vote for him?
I love how a man who has people tear gassed so he can make a propaganda video to hold a bible upside down have the balls to say that Biden will hurt God. Give me a break.
You may well be right. But unfortunately, we have a two-party system (that masquerades as democracy, but that’s another story). So we have two choices. Looks like one choice will be President Trump and the other choice will be former VP Biden. Roll up and choose your poison.
if you like biden your brain dead
VP Biden goes 2 church on Sundays. trump pretends 2 golf.
We have hopes The Lone Star will vote Biden this Nov......I think it's already very close.....👍🏽👍🏽 (what part of Texas⁉️ my wife doesn't like to admit she married a Yankee...by birth only....moved to Corpus after H.S.....some years in Houston, Dallas &amp; Wimberley 🤠)  Blessings 🌹
but biden could never recruit bannon et. al. to hurt God whereas Trump hired these men (or they went to him) so he can be a blithering moron while his cronies work to steal the election.
He’s been open abt his racist, homophobic, ignorant, and misogynistic tendencies since the 70s but people still support him. Biden is also in the wrong for somethings That happened in the past, but at least he’s not as bad as trump
Here is where we are. In a pile of crap as bad people dick around w/our right to vote &amp; the foundation of democracy.  If you buy into their products or ⁦ you should be embarrassed.⁩ ⁦ ⁦⁩ ⁦ #cancel
I don’t care if Joe Biden unlikely doesn’t have any religious beliefs. Trumps uninformed and disgusting distractions are pathetic and we should stop elevating this ignorance to be heard. A president that doesn’t have zero empathy or compassion isn’t worth hearing.
I think whatever surprise they can drum against Biden will pale in comparison to whatever fresh Hells Trump commits between now and November.
In November, we'll be rejecting Trumpism and embracing democracy again by electing Biden as president. :P

Barack Obama and Joe Biden aren't charge. #TraitorTrump &amp; #NaziGOP only mention Chicago to race-bait &amp; advocate un-Constitutional military attacks on US citizens on US soil. You support a failing white supremacist who embraced the #KKKandNazi terrorists in Charlottesville. #SHAME

Trump Will Crush Biden. No Dought.  Landslide.    Clean The House
Biden hurts God but trump can kill 160,000 people by doing nothing.
Umm, VP Biden actually goes 2 church &amp; he knows h/t hold the Bible so it’s right side up!
Nice of Mr. Bipolar to say the quiet part out loud. If anyone still votes for him after that, they weren't going to vote for Biden anyway. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Historian who called the most presidential elections predicts Biden will win. Y'all better buy the dip win the market goes down lmao
This is pretty outrageous, even by current standards, but we have to remember that Trump thinks he is "God," and so, of course, Biden is "against God."
Joe Biden is just....

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Regardless of your politics or what you think of Joe Biden, he has shown a steady commitment to and experience with making the world safer from nuclear war.   Remember that one person -- the US president -- has the absolute authority to end life on earth.
It’s obvious that Trump is getting desperate now. He’s playing the card that only Republicans are religious (wrong) and saying Biden will “Hurt God”? Now he’s claiming the cure for COVID will be available on Election Day....
Biden wants to "hurt god" if for "god" you read "Trump".
Dear God. ANY ONE of the people that have been seriously suggested for the VP slot is head &amp; shoulders above what we have now. Which is a malignant narcissist doing as much damage to the country as possible. A vote for anyone other than Biden is, effectively, a vote for Trump.
Joe Biden is not qualified to lead this party with comments like that.
If Biden were to place personal and ideological affinity at the top of his VP selection he'd pick Dianne Feinstein, who also endorsed him quite early over Kamala Harris.  now 87, is likely providing him with key input. #Biden2020 #BidenVP
Biden ruled out a Pardon for #TraitorTrump and his criminal administration back in May.
VP Biden addressed that concern back in May. You may recall, that's when the Democratic controlled House passed the latest relief bill #MoscowMitch and the #NaziGOP do-nothing Senate continue to stall as millions face eviction and starvation.
Oh so Joe Biden can hurt God?!   I guess God is old af.
Not if Biden goes down in flames. If he does, his VP ticket will be toxic before the race even starts.
Yet he still tries to nail Biden with the whole “bumbling speech”. Trump is a fucking idiot 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Biden says dumb things sometimes. If you add up every dumb thing he's ever said in his life, it's still better than one press briefing from Trump.
Unfortunately I’m not citizen so I don’t have a right to vote. I can’t agree with that an atomic bomb was “right” answer. but I really hope Biden will be the next president✨
and the system has presented us with a choice between Trump and Biden so who you gonna pick?
you're either voting for biden or trump. write-ins, &amp; "votes of conscience" are votes for 4 more years of trump, 1 or 2 of which will still be a global pandemic. "principled" votes get the country more Trump &amp; more dead Americans. that alone is moral reasoning to vote

Want to guarantee a Biden win? Have him debate trump, but the rules say that if one interrupts the other, their time starts over from the beginning. Trump could never, ever shut up long enough for Joe to make a statement. It would turn into a two hour Biden rally.
I think one strategic debate will cement anyone on the fence as long as Biden allows trump to ramble on in his typical stupid fashion. He just needs to stand there shaking his head &amp; smiling, then give a powerful statement on his own beliefs and policies. trump buries himself.

Yeah, but have you seen what Biden can do on a slippery ramp, SPECTACULAR! Your dad, not so much, junior.
Idea for a parody Trump ad: Show what is happening behind the scenes during a Biden interview in his basement.
Oh, so it’s cool to not vote for Biden as long as your voting against communism.   I see how this works now 🤣   #Resistance
True. White supremicists and their sympathizers is more America’s speed.   Trump is literal White Supremacist. Biden just eulogized one in the early 2000s.   Clearly these men are far more American than someone who eulogized an American black communist  union leader. 🙄
Probably because Biden is smart enough to not hold a rally during a pandemic that has killed over 160,000 Americans and rising.
Ahhh But Of Course...Communist Party will endorse Biden! No surpruses here!🙄🙄🙄🙄
Oh but soon all evidence  will come out.
Just learned today, that Jill Biden got her PHd in education at age 55, so you're a kid Melissa 🧒
We could only make it through 10 minutes of this, a few minutes is amusing, after that it becomes sad.   Obviously the video is edited together but it becomes clear Biden is easily confused and frequently lacks mental clarity.
The Democrats are cruel to run Joe Biden for President.  He is not even close to lucid.
Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign

Trump’s bag of tricks comes up empty against Biden  via
Incompetent Joe's rallies have been happening continuously for months and for the record are called "riots". As a legislator his record was average. Biden cares about people? That's a nice way of saying his base is not as enthusiastic as President Trump's.
I can't believe America has Trump and Biden to look forward too.
Talk about pandering for votes. If you do not have a record of accomplishments for all the time he has held political office, offer all the enticements you can to buy votes. Talk is cheap, President Trump has done more in over three years than Biden in over 40. He's incompetent!
This should speak volumes to every American!!!
I’m hoping #Individual1 is brought before the greatest criminal trials in American history after Joe Biden inauguration January 2021.
Me too! It’s the least of my concerns, Joe Biden knows who he can serve with or the last person that stays behind after the meeting.

Father, in the NCR piece, you use Pope JP2 ”unconditionally pro-life” to say we cannot vote for Trump as “blatantly racist”. Blatant makes it easy, but Amy Cooper doesn’t. When Biden makes his “cavalier” comment “ain’t black”, are we missing it like Amy?
Joe Biden will be writng a book titled, 'WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME?'
The ascent of  is one of #Election2020's great surprises. Trump is becoming a liability even in #SouthCarolina!

I agree with your 10 points but I refuse to vote for Biden. Do something really revolutionary Bernie, Please; unsuspend your campaign❣️#NeverBiden
If you had a business and your looking for a CEO, would you put Biden in?
Yes, yes, Biden has a brilliant plan. He is so intelligent he has difficulty articulating it. But, he continues to work on his secret plan in his basement lair.  Please, get a grip.

I could clearly see Biden’s cognitive problems when Bernie was still ahead &amp; I said there’s no way Joe even makes it to the election...and yet the Democratic Party named him their candidate confirming how corrupt they have become.

Biden caught committing plagiarism in law school, plagarized British MP Neil Kinnok's bio as his own and was forced to quit his 1st presidential campaign over it.   Who lies?  Biden lies!
We know who Biden is a demented old man who can't string paragraphs together. He lacks the acumen to do the tough job as president. Nice guys finish last in this world. USA would end up last if this bumbling man was President.
It would be disastrous for Biden to show up to a debate with Trump.  A live debate would highlight Biden's cognitive decline.
Joe Biden is going after the Muslim vote by telling them he’s going to end the Muslim ban on day one. It might be who’ve the campaign to clarify there is no Muslim ban!
And will be reversed by President Biden.
Joe Biden has worked hard to earn the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party of the USA, he should savor this moment.  Given his failing memory, if a helpful staffer reminds him he could enjoy this achievement a dozen times for the "first time."
Holy crap! The RCP just issued a vote Biden call!
The trump campaign wants voters to focus on who the candidates are surrounding themselves with.  That should work well ...  For  Biden

We will declare it because it's true. We don't want establishment crony politicians in office, regardless of party. Sleepy Joe Biden is corrupt, and so are his unimpressive list of VP picks.
Kate Bedingfield is a good spokesperson for Biden. She doesn't answer the questions asked of her. That's a special talent.
Why should Biden pick for running mate someone who was not wanted by Democrats during the primary?

Liked on YouTube: Gutfeld on Biden ducking the debates
Why don't you show Trump's briefing today? Because he's currently talking nonstop nonsense that again proves that he - the man who has let 155k Americans die on his watch so far - is unfit to lead.  Biden will get us out of the mess that Trump and you Rs are responsible for.

If Biden won’t debate trump, someone should just schedule a debate anyway. They can put up a cardboard cutout of Joe Biden and a random word generator to blurt out comments every few minutes. I doubt many people would notice the difference.

Can’t figure out why anyone has been expecting early announcement.  Not strategically necessary nor supported by historical pattern.
COVID19 would be cured.  Trump and his administration would be in jail for 30 years.  Biden would be president.
Trump and Biden together would create a word salad of gibberish that the world has never seen.  Those complaining about Biden's speech should go back and listen to the last 3.5 years of nonsense coming out of Trump's mouth.
So your handlers tried their hardest to actually find Biden crowds for you to see???? I would be impressed if it was true....
If Joe Biden can’t handle the debate stage—he can’t handle the world stage.
Biden is far from perfect. Trump means dictatorship. I don’t want to live in a dictatorship. I’m voting for Biden, happily.
They know if Biden flubs the debates he will have a hard time winning.

I agree. Biden is just a shell of a man.

Biden finds his zeal, through Bob Avakian!  😯
I'd love to see Biden's tax returns. Being in public service for so long and so rich, hmm. President Trump being a businessman, of course he is going to be rich, through business.  That's what you should analyze.
Of course they don’t want Biden debating Trump. He will lose based on his record. Oh yeah, he has dementia, too. That may effect his performance a little.
Biden is pro-choice.

Joe Biden is a cardboard cut out on his best day.  He doesn't have the clarity or capicity to lead our Nation.  We imagine he will find some excuse to dodge debating President Trump, it would be absolutely humiliating for Democrats.
Trump said this because he knows prison is waiting, it ain’t only Joe Biden elected. He should’ve been on his way prison after personal Attorney General coverup, majority Republicans aiding and abetting crimes, obstruction of justice and abuse of power during ImpeachmentTrial.
Call me crazy, but something about this doesn’t sound quite right. #Biden
I thought it was Biden who didn't want to debate, with the rationale being that he doesn't need any upside, so why risk it.

trump and fox hanging the #chaoscandidate moniker on Joe Biden when  entire term has been absolute and total chaos from day one...narcissists always apply their own toxic behavior to others
I wonder how he is going to act when he loses in November. It’s probably going to be whine fest every day until the January inauguration. Ohhh imagine the letter he is going to leave Biden 😂. Just kidding. trump is so petty I am absolutely sure he won’t leave a letter.
Vote for Biden if you want higher taxes so illegal aliens can have free healthcare, education, food and housing. Biden will undo Trumps great trade deals and benefits he's done for minorities.
If Biden is afraid of facing off Trump, how can he face off Putin, Jinping or KJU? Biden is to cowardly.
Bahahaha! You guys wanted Bernie so you could claim "The Radical Left", but got Biden instead. So, now you inaccurately lump Bernie/Biden together so you can keep all those Bernie talking points. Good job, guys. Keep up the great work of doing absolutely nothing to help pandemic.
The DNC is cold and heartless. They are not only trying to fool the American people by propping up someone they want to replace, but they are shaming a man by letting him unravel before our eyes. Sad. I would never vote for Biden, but I do feel sorry for him.
Why should he have to answer this.  Will Biden accept assistance from those who despise our founding and Constitution?
And how did you take Biden’s proud citation of working with segregationists affect you? Or didn’t it because he’s a white guy so you ‘know’ he didn’t really mean it? White women are some of the most tiresome people out there.
God, let's pray he does! If Biden is elected, he will fundamentally transform America into Venezuela.

What will happen to Stephen Miller when Biden is elected? Will Reality Winner be released from prison (if she’s still alive then)?
After Biden is elected, I hope the military will stand strong and deny trump’s use of the nuclear codes when he thinks Chicago should be erased, or Dr. Fauci, or an entire country like Germany, or some other country with a leader that has laughed at him, or been mean to him.
Just think of the task ahead IF Biden gets elected? What do you think are the chances that there will be four more years?
SETTLE FOR BIDEN LOL
I really hope Biden is elected, but HRC was a shoe in and Russia and the GOP stopped her. This same shit is going on to stop Biden, and he could be cheated like HRC, and Stacy Abrams were. But even if he is elected, my god, think of the disaster he inherits &amp; what has to be done.
Here are top contenders to be Biden's VP
Trump was well within "Loving father" boundaries. Meanwhile, here's Biden kissing his 19 year old granddaughter.
so in other  words you’re against Trump &amp; for Biden. In other words you’re against a Republican majority senate. In other words you want Nancy Pelosi to keep the house.
...you know decisions have to be made quickly sometimes and I think Joe Biden has proved without any doubt he cannot make a decision.
How insulting to Senator Harris, to Biden, and to the black voters who revived Biden’s campaign to name a few, to suggest that Bernie and his abusive supporters should have veto power over a brilliant and accomplished woman. This is peak white guy entitlement and beyond enraging.
Yeah .. they went quiet when Sleepy Joe Biden was accused, too.
It would be hilarious if Biden's campaign slogan was "Make America Great Again"
Barr could accuse Biden of being an axe murderer, and I'd still vote for him.
“President Biden sends his regards.”
Nope Biden is the pick, get over it. Keep crying bernie bro!!!! Pete, Yang and Warren nope!!! Hey I hear kanye needs some support, why don't you go ahead and pencil him in!!!!!!
I would vote for Joe Biden if he Never debates Fatso Trump. I would vote for him here or there. I would vote for him anywhere. No matter what. No matter who is his VP is.
Biden is practically neutral compared to Trump. I don’t know how anyone could be upset w Biden but still ignore Trump’s criminality, deception, inability, corruption &amp; treason
I cannot think what makes you describe Biden that way. Disinterest I get, no enthusiasm I get, even caution that he won’t change enough. But, evil? I don’t get that
Biden could phone it in or play prerecorded remarks. You’ve either been awake the last four years or you’ve had your head up Trump’s ass. There’s little in between.
Oh, Its the Joe Biden Podcast...
If Joe Biden refuses to ever even speak again, I’m voting for him

I want a president who isn’t a  shady liar and has a mobster past. He should never have been elected. So don’t worry about Biden.   He will do fine!
No danger in that! Biden will debate but trump will either back out or pull some other stunt.
Biden sucks. And I’ll bet his VP sucks too. I’ll still support them vs Trump, but not calling out faults is dumb. Not holding people accountable is what led to where we are now...
Exactly what Trump is doing, because you can bet the foreign entities aren't favoring Biden. However, it's impossible to confuse voters who have the stark and simple idea: Trump/no.
Right On.  Biden Got No Chance.  It Will Be A Landslide
It’s going to be YEARS of recovery, if we’re lucky. I fully expect the media will be full-on “give the GOP some slack, golly how divisive the Dems are being!” starting 12:01 pm 1/20/21, assuming Biden wins.
Amy, think bigger.  Smart deregulation, prison reform, lower taxes, confronting adversaries rather than appeasing them, fair trade, immigration reform, etc etc.  You must support the President.  Biden called him a xenophobic when he stooped travel from China.  Think Amy think!
And I think he will be of great value to the Biden Administration.
Biden used his US  VP position to extort the Ukraine for his son's personal financial gain   You think he's going to get a  free pass on that . Don't count on it . 😎
A vote for Biden is a vote for your own demise.   Almost half of Americans are JUST. THAT. STUPID.   #4MoreYears 🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸

Biden Faces Pressure From Left Over Influence Industry Ties
Are we (non-base) not immune to his misogyny and anti-DC BS now that he has been exposed?  I think Rice will not pull Biden down, but bolster him.   and
I think that a  masterful job is being done of calling out the misogyny and racism of Biden’s Old Guard allies without trashing him. There has to be strong pushback.
Biden could pick Big Bird for VP and that wouldn't change my vote for him. Focus people and keep your eyes on the November prize - making the most incompetent, self-serving, corrupt authoritarian man in history a one term president. #TrumpVirus2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
President Biden announces Col. Vindmen (he gets promotion he was robbed of) is head of VA.
AOC is part of Joe Biden's Climate Policy Team.  A vote for Joe is a vote for AOC.  If Father Damien's love, compassion and sacrifice of his life isn't enough for AOC - how will they treat YOU if they gain power.  Vote for President Trump life your life depends on it!
I thought he was talking about Joe Biden 😭😭
A vote for Joe Biden will be a vote for AOC.  AOC has leveraged herself onto Biden's team as Climate Policy adviser - which means the New Green Deal.  If Father Damien sacrificing his health and life for the sick isn't good enough for these people, how will they treat you?
I talked to a Trump supporter yesterday and he can't wait for the 1st debate. His words "Trump's going to wipe the floor with Biden cause Biden can't finish a sentence". I was like, have u listened to Trump talk. he can't even say certain words and stumbles thru most sentences.
I don’t think Biden should debase himself by debating Trump.
I know right. And they received a discussion, what were expecting yes or no answer to this type question.  Ridiculous to even ask, Joe Biden is our choice of course we’re going to support him debating anyone
I was thinking the same thing. There has to be a great spot for him in the Biden administration.
It's signal digests because Biden only counts on one hand..
Well I think the question should actually be reversed and answered by trump supporters because it’s more than likely trump refusing to debate. I believe Joe Biden wouldn’t refuse to debate trump and why would he trumps no intelligent debater or thinker. .
I hate all these photoshopped pictures of Biden making faces he’s never made
Three minutes after Biden picked Bass, The Washington Post would have the Scientology story on its front page.  No Thanks.

Would my Fellow Americans, be “Ok” with a Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton as VP?  Knowing ANY VICE PRESIDENT under a Biden Presidentency is LIKELY to End up AS the President before Biden’s 1st 4 years would be up.  Would ANY responsible American Vote for Obama or Clinton?
As “RESPONSIBLE” American Citizens who would Advance our Great Nation for the next 4 years?  Would the “FORMER VP” Biden fit the bill? His Selection of a Running mate IS more important than people think. Is BIDEN fit to be President?
I don’t for a moment think that Joe Biden is afflicted with Alzheimer’s or dementia, despite Trump’s ridiculous projections. A good president who listens has all the brains and expertise in the country available to him. But anyone in the seventies may have a stroke or an illness
Rock steady!  Joe Biden isn't a viable option for America.   President Trump's accomplishments for the American People in the face of vicious opposition and obstruction from the Democrats and the Lame stream Media has been amazing.
You may not be thrilled by Biden, but you had better vote for him anyway if you want a functional country by the time of the next election.
You summarized clearly where things are going. I’m becoming increasingly aware of how “the cult” will not vanish, even when Biden is elected president.  There is something deep and scary in the heart of these people. It defies human reason. They are fueled by hate and lies.
Picturing the old long cat meme but it is Joe Biden as Slenderman
No matter who Biden picks for VP, the Republicans will immediately declare she is the most corrupt, incompetent, unintelligent, unqualified, ugly, foreign, sicky, crippled, deformed, mentally ill, depraved, imbecilic pick for VP ever in the entire history of the universe.
My co-worker's a Trump supporter &amp; still supports him. He's talking about how he can't wait for the 1st debate. His words "Trump's going to wipe the floor with Biden cause Biden can't finish a sentence". I was like, have u really listened to Trump talk, he can't do it either.
The Rats "What ship?  I wasn't on a ship, you can't prove I was because the ship sank!" Not even the smartest of rats. I. can't. wait. November 4th. I wonder what the November surprise will be?  I bet it will be 25th amendment and Biden runs against Satan
Fuck Biden.
I know right! It’s ridiculous to be attacking anyone about VP nominee, when that’s clearly Joe Biden’s decision or most presidential candidates throughout history. It’s sickening Democrats just can’t stop, fu*king disparaging each other, for not getting their choice as VP.
Biden. Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier.
Joe Biden’s search for a running mate enters final stretch:  #Election2020
Well if Biden‘s people have vetted her, they will find this out and should stay away from her - very controversial
I believe so. But Biden won a lot of support by being happy to play second fiddle to President Obama. Allowing a really formidable and admirable woman to share his role would be a sign of character. Also, we really don’t want another very old man without backup.
I blame this much more on the Ed Rendells of the world than on anything the Biden campaign is doing.
Don't  need "king maker" status.  If Rice is chosen. They'll continue he has no message of his own and diffently with the Biden picking from the Obama administration.  Obama  knows we need this win as a nation.  He's not going to chance it.
They never want to talk policy, only to blame President Trump for doing what Obama and Biden couldn't get done.
Biden will have the United States looking like Venezuela, within 4 years! #Trump2020
I'm someone who follows politics closely and I don't know much about Karen Bass. The lack of name recognition combined with this scientology news confirms why she would be a really bad pick for Biden
I agree. At this point, if Biden’s white dude dinosaurs manage to keep her off the ticket and he loses - which he will without her - they’ll have lost any ability to block her 2024 run because they’ll be seen as the reason he lost. This all assumes the US survives until then.
If they both oppose Medicare For All and GND, they’ll both lose a lot of votes. Given that trump will use massive voter suppression, Biden can’t afford to lose votes. #MedicareForAll
Biden - Kiss China’s butt Trump- Kick China’s butt
The last thing POC should do is fall for WHITE propaganda that pits their communities against each other in arbitrary, false choices. The choice is not between a Black or Latino woman, it is between the justice Biden offers and the anarchy tRump promises. Don’t get mixed up.
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  If America really doesn’t vote, Trump would be out in January, and he won’t like what happens next  #Biden2020
I guess you really reek of Trump Derangement Syndrome  "OrAnGe MaN bAd" is a baseless way to convince people to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden
I’m voting Biden, even if he picks Michael Moore as VP. I had a hard time thinking of which choice was most repellent. MM is my best shot so far. Yours?
It's grossly unfair to Karen Bass to portray her as "not Kamala," whether it comes from Biden's old guard buddies or the K-Hive. Bass has a great biography, a solid record of leadership, and progressive values. #Election2020 #Biden #Democrats
If Biden chooses a nonentity I will lose all respect for him.
Bizarre. Instead of seeing this as proof that  is capable of leading the country with foresight appropriate preparation, Trump supporters are twisting this into some kind of grand conspiracy that Biden planned the pandemic? Unreal.
Watching Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris ran for president. Joe Biden is elderly. Either of these women could step into the presidency should he become ill. I think he is man enough not to feel threatened. But maybe not.
Biden making the VP decision, is that joke?
Why on earth would biden choose someone named Karen? A gift to opponents projecting negative female stereotypes.
Biden needs to remember who he owes his nomination too. I hope that Representative Clyburn is ready to pull rank on those has-been politicos.
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders #GOJOEBIDEN #RidinWithBiden2020
Joe Biden was vehemently against the Equal Rights Act of 1964. He filibustered against it. Joe Biden is no friend of minorities.  Trump received Jesse Jackson's lifetime achievement award for contributions for the Black community in 1996. Trump is a real friend of minorities.
No matter who ‘wins’ this battle over Biden’s VP, there’s going to be a price to be paid - the question is will it be at the expense of the future of the party- black women - or the past - aging white guys who’s days are already numbered.
Biden, dementia, how can he be up for anything??
Why bother? Polls indicate Biden is way ahead of Trump. Save your money.
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
This won’t surprise you, but it’s ominous that there is further confirmation of what we suspected.
It’s the only chance you’d have to compete Joe, mail in ballots (fraud) I honestly don’t ever see a Biden sticker, shirt, or parade.  signs and patriots are out in clusters in So. Cal. The #Democrats lost their platform by selling too much fear &amp; anger.
I am not believing these reports about Biden VP nomination. The waters are very muddy right now. All , I have to say is don't screw this up. Don't let others change your mind on a good thing.
What side? Currently in 2020, that would be either a Democrat or a Republican. The Democratic Party or the GOP. Biden or Trump... How educated should the ‘United States of America’ president be? Our nation’s President?
Even if you elect a man that was for segregation
But when that mentality is used here in the states, it’s racist xenophobia (circa joe Biden) god I love American politics
The Lincoln Project are Never-Trumpers and Democrats who present themselves as Republicans but are working to get Joe Biden elected.
Goddamn they make Joe Biden sound awesome
In 2020 double speak from Leftists and Democrats is the norm and not the exception.  The "Lincoln Project" - wants to "assassinate" the Republican Party and elect Joe Biden while pretending to be Republicans.  Say no to the John Wilkes Booth Bozos!
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden
✔  Joe Biden is a chip off the old #ObamaGate.
not liberals shaming angela davis for being too radical w prison abolition and then only praising her when she said vote for biden yall r so fucking irritating lmao u only use parts of what she says to ur advantage liberals stop breathing challenge
Grateful for that! Biden 2020!
Elect Joe Biden and Biden puts Obama on the Supreme Court !🙏🏼🇺🇸
No - I do not. That is my complete point. To say that Biden will do any different is total BS.
I have seen Biden’s response to COVID-19. I have seen what his scientists say they will do. It does absolutely nothing different. This is not something that can be solved with virtue signaling and platitudes. It takes someone who acts. Trump acts. Trump finds the VERB
Theory: the US is on a downward spiral nearing the point of return and I think Trump is starting to realize this. He’ll lose the election just to blame Biden for the inevitable slide towards total collapse that would have happened even if he was president.
Michelle Obama as Joe Biden’s VP would absolutely rock the United States right now. You don’t think it will happen? Hang tight. She just launched a podcast for goodness sake. Why do you think Biden’s team isn’t worried?
Since the election is rigged, no need for Trump supporters to vote, Biden is going to win anyway.
This was a tweet from Biden back in October 2019!!
Did Joe blow Biden say he wasn't black either? A Great Man has left the field of play.
You’re not concerned about the 3 votes that didn’t make it. You’re concerned about the 97 that did because it’s likely that most of those will be for Biden.
Well Donald Trump is killing Americans, Russia is taking full advantage. I’m hoping the patriotic American voter does everything in their power to oppose this oppressive style government and vote for someone like Joe Biden. America first not Trump/Russia first
Fair - I was waiting to address her points one by one. If you read all of my comments, I did express gratitude to one gentleman who mentioned Biden’s 55 years of government service and Biden sharing commons beliefs on key issues to him.
Excellent interview with Chris. I love what you suggested as Biden first act as president. We need safe and equal voting rights for all US citizens.
That video is the best ad for voting Biden.
I knew Dems were going to turn John Lewis' funeral into a rally.  But was Biden there?
When your face was stretched, you lost a few more of your limited amount of brain cells.  * Joe Biden is a preposterous candidate - even for the preposterous Democrat party.
Jessica - How was the CDC intended to be used? How exactly will Biden's actions be different than Trump's actions to help quell this plague?   I understand the emotions behind this and I have listened to MSNBC to hear how Trump is terrible in what he has done ... but ... ????????
Okay - thank you for responding.  You are the 1st person to actually give a response that was not "integrity" or some other single word answer of just responses about feelings.   YES - Biden has been in politics for 55 years.  He has been on several committees.  That is all true.
Don's Russian keeper? You say that and have no proof.  But we have proof that Hillary received hundreds of millions of dollars from the Russians.  Trump has done nothing to help Russia but has done many things to hurt them.  Now, Biden has taken money from them and his family too
Who has integrity? Biden?   Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness.  Are you saying that is Biden?  Okay - let's say that is true.  Does that mean he has good ideas or will make a good President?
Who do you call the common citizen? How does one work for the common citizen.    I noticed all of your reasons are opinions that are not based in any reality that shows approval of a specific idea or pointing to anything Biden has done in the past to indicate this future action.
Bring back civility? Do you mean the press will bow around him and stop lying non stop? Maybe that will happen.  Do you mean the civility of calling to defund the police and praising violent protesters?    How exactly what Biden bring back civility? Bow down to everyone?
Improve healthcare in what way? ACA? Do you mean the bill that caused the opiod crisis, raised healthcare costs significantly across the board, and is responsible for the healthcare system not being ready to fight a pandemic?   In what ways exactly would Biden improve healthcare?
Plus she can kick ass in a debate better than Pense, trump or Biden.
Remember he’s a Republican they do not endorse Democrats. I’m sure he’ll vote for Biden. 💙
Your Future if you vote for #Biden   Robinson, a Democrat   Tennessee state senator charged with stealing federal funds
Literally?  Do you know the meaning of that word? Why are you close enough to the president where you can 'literally' smell him? That is very weird.    Also - can you give me your reason to vote for Biden, without mentioning Trump? So far no Democrat has been able to do this.

Why didn't Joe Biden leave his basement to go to John Lewis' funeral? Was it because he has been a lifelong advocate for segregation and racist policies?

He’s got that idea well and truly lodged in the howling void that is his head. The screens of chaos and fire 🔥 at Kayleigh’s alarmist briefing, the ads claiming “Biden’s” America would look like scenes from Portland— luckily, video tells the real story.
#WeWillVote of course, the easiest way is not to delay the election, should cancel it and declare Biden the winner. Easy peasy.
podcast has more listeners than you because he is not a garbage person. You say you support women do you support Tara Reade or all the other women that Joe Biden touched inappropriately. No you don’t because it doesn’t fit with your narrative.
Worse... Biden is a Deep State NWO Marxist puppet.
Their not to many people think highly of democrat choice for Biden as president cause his absent mind.

And yet the president was accuse of the Russian help him to be in office and look who the worste of them all the left they the cause of all the Chaos and peace protests which is riots and those protesters all end up voting for Biden and also intimidating the voters.
The both of you are superficial- look below the surface. Trump downplayed the pandemic from the get go, costing 50million jobs, 150k deaths and trillions in debt. LOOK AT THE ASIAN COUNTRIES BACK TO NORMAL. Biden is the least of two evils
First thing Joe Biden should do is remove that wall starting at noon on Inauguration Day!

So your voting for Joe Biden the racist. #JoeBidenIsARacist
Hillary carried a quarter century of being demonized with her. Biden doesn't carry that baggage.
Agreed... They are sabotaging Biden by going after Kamala. Cut it out!
Either Biden wants Kamala Harris and  the leaks are to get his attention to  change his mind. Or he has his mind made up and the leaks are to soften the air if Kamala Harris isn't  picked.  🧐🤔🤔 What do you think?
If anyone thinks the Corona Virus is going to be coraled under trump, I’ve got ocean front property for sale In Arizona to sell you dopes... Biden will reign it it, not the moron trump.
Biden going end up like Hillary in 2016 and all her voters crying.
🤔what do democrats, China, North Korea, Iran, Russia have all in common? They hate and are afraid of President Trump and would like Biden to be President
No, gawd help us, the MF'r now knows the secrets. If we let his orange mug outta sight for one minute, he'd just sell 'em to the highest bidder. Biden's gonna have to change the codes on those damn nukes on day 1.
Exactly... President Biden is going to have to undo all of his tacky design choices when he takes over in January anyway.
Veep leak? Joe Biden prepped talking points about Sen. Kamala Harris
I still trust him then Biden the die - hard full blown democrat.
I've been railing against demented Joe's candidacy since it was announced. It's a confidence scam by Democrats. How can someone that mentally inept be even considered for POTUS. The damage the nation would incur from Biden in the White House is easy to calculate because it's bad.
Ya, because Biden’s gonna take away the ACA, close schools, and lower the minimum wage...🙄
I ran this thru my #MAGA translator:  ...Your [white] housing prices will go up based on the market, and [black] crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
If Obama sides with Biden. Then FUCKING SIDE WITH BIDEN Y'ALL. Like come on now...we should not need to settle for a racist homophobic bigot cheeto looking ass president.
Who are "Biden's allies" and why would they even do this?
Of course not. There is bipartisan consensus that #China is the US priority. And the measure of success isn't softness versus toughness. It's about effectiveness. It's about shaping our relationship with China in a way that maximizes US interests.
"Even poor kids can be just as bright as white kids" - Joe Biden
Debated with my dad about Trump last night. He's pretty much voting Biden because OrAnGe MaN bad...  Maybe I should frame this 😂
Mr. Biden has no experience stimulating an economy.
The results of the 2020 presidential election will be unacceptable, whomever wins. The only question is whether a Trump or Biden victory will spur the most rioting, destruction, and mayhem.
Biden's aides are making sure he doesn't stop to wait for the escalator to go outside.
Forget it, President Biden. Trump won't do his job because he can't do his job because Putin won't let him.
Why would any body want to loose their country to socialism communist like dummy Biden!.
Trump just gifted Russia by ordering 12,000 American troops to leave Germany.  There are still 25,000 troops stationed in Germany. I sure hope to JC that these 25,000 troops have enough common sense to vote for Biden in the upcoming election.
Tell that to Biden when he takes that sweet sweet Chinese communist cash straight to his basement.
I’m not addressing Biden’s merits. I’m trying to point out that Biden’s chances of winning go up significantly if he’ll start supporting M4A and GND. Ideally, he wants to win more than remain loyal to lobbyists. #MedicareForAll #GND #BidenSupportM4AorLose
Biden won’t be around for that long...I am sure that the Dems will have him deemed incompetent after he is electrd
Biden should put #Iowa in play and buy some ad time there. It was Iowans that helped propel  (and former VP) to the White House in 2008 and 2012.
Fair point, though as you know a Biden administration would continue to press for more burden-sharing and the Asia&gt;Europe narrative is here to stay. So, Europeans might feel relieved but really shouldn't be.
Whether Libertarians in Republican garb win or lose, we're screwed.  Winning, they'll humiliate and continue to injure and punish Americans who oppose them.  Losing, they'll scream foul and muddy up the waters.  If Biden remains in power after all, they'll plot revenge.
Rare pic of Joe Biden
What about the Biden-Sanders unity plan? What about gaps in Sanders' M4A proposal? What about public opinion? What about the legislative process? What about alternative M4A design specifications? What about imperfect electoral outcomes? What about other proven pathways to UHC?

We deserve a better choice for President than just Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Trump/Biden). It is like Jeb Bush or George Bush, no choice at all so VOTE for SOMEBODY ELSE!
Yep, this guy appears prepared to deal with Xi, Putin and Kim.    It didn't work stuffing Hillary into a van and it won't work with hiding Biden because he's senile.    They could've picked anyone and went with this.

This shit is fuuuuuunnny. Mainly because they gonna vote for Biden/Harris who ain’t wit da reparations. Sit ya goofy asses down.
Good point. They say “it was a long time ago, people change.” Nah, it wasn’t that long ago cuz people that Biden/Harris locked up are still in prison rn. Since they so damn changed,why won’t they even act like they gonna deal with criminal justice? Bcuz They not...

It’s obviously true that Hillary is smarter than Biden. But this is America. Americans prefer a dummy if it’s someone they’d like to have a beer with. People would rather have a beer with Joe Biden. You’re finished.

I'm sorry, Beth. I know you enjoy being fired up - but I'm not a Trump apologist. I didn't vote for him in 2016, and won't in 2020. I find his character (and Biden's) appalling.  As for the bible - typically the NRSV, NLT, and NAS are my favorite, but I'm learning NT Greek.
Wow. Now that's how you bring in the big guns! Good job Biden campaign!
National polling data appears to duplicate 2016, with the substitution of Biden for Clinton.  Biden may generate even less enthusiasm than Clinton.  Particularly in polls with large samples sizes the difference narrows dramatically.  4 More Years!
You are making the case to forget about Biden and put all our resources into state races. But you do not seem to realize that.

So not reporting episodes of sexual abuse of children was not your job but complaining about Biden is your job?
Part of Trump's problem is that he didn't choose the correct advisors and cabinet members.  Or when he did, they didn't last long.  At least we know Biden will surround himself with qualified people.
Fascinating, and ignore Harris name calling, or Biden.. I feel disrespected by this propaganda of BS
A logical person would. A voting record by Biden speaks volumes. If your only reason is Trump, I don’t know what to say. Just seems very uneducated which I don’t think you are. In fact I think you’re smart.

Biden wants a presidential mandate for mask wearing. If the president can do that, what else can the president require of personal behavior? Be careful of what you wish for.

I believe the Bishops’ should refuse Biden communion for his positions on abortion. I support their speaking out on Trump. The only one left is the Pope who corrected Trump, &amp; now should set an example for all Catholics by call Biden out on his abortion position.

Honestly, I have a greater appreciation for Biden after reading the article.  The technocrats he is compared to do not have any real achievements to point to other than GDP and a great many failures.

My grandmother always used to say, “The devil doesn’t show up with his 2 horns...just because people smile at you doesn’t mean they’re nice.” Gates, Fauci, Biden, Harris are all on the same messaging and agenda...with a smile. Pay attention!

First, that’s not what Biden said. Secondly, Kamala is abundantly qualified. It just so happens that she’s also black. Every candidate had his/her criteria for what they wanted in a VP. Trump chose Pence because of his religious ties does that mean so is he xenophobic? 🤔

So how does this work...didn’t Kamala call Biden a pedophile and racist in the debates. And now they’re working alongside each other? Idk man, idk.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Fact Check: At briefings, Trump is settling into a routine of false claims and exaggeration i.e., bullshit and pathological lies.
The right is screaming at the top of their lungs “Kamala this, Kamala that” like it really is going to swing someone. The only people agreeing to that are trumps fuckface base or an idiot. You may not have been for Kamala, but to not vote for Biden would be idiotic and dangerous.

My point, bad use of OT, was that if your church had a Biden who said your church is who I am, but on TV &amp; in action denies your church teaching. He has just lied about what you believe to everyone.  Your truth is weakened &amp;  won’t matter b/c people expect him to share the truth.
Prediction: this VP debate is never going to happen. With Trump way down in the polls close to Election Day, he’s not gonna let Pence make things worse. I also predict Trump will refuse to debate Biden.
R5, forget my last pt. It isn’t about what you believe, &amp; it only matters to me b/c the words he used were addressed to my Faith Community &amp; those words have value to us. If Biden would have said he is now a member of a Jesus based Church. I would pray that he finds peace there.
Not caving here. First we moved our issues in the Prinary as far as possible. Then we moved Biden as far as we could. Election time now. Then the real work starts. Accountability time. Don’t give up now we need you in the fight!
I predict we hear a lot of argumentation about the merits of Kamela and not much about Biden from here on out.  It will be very similar to how Palin was elevated to the top of the ticket by the Democrats.  I also predict attempts to cancel the presidential debates.
Aside from the obvious lies, Trump doesn't have much going for him. Biden and Harris versus The Orange Toddler and Pence the Ass kisser.

It’s depends on our organizing. Elections are a choice, and between who we are more likely to move Biden/Harris or Trump/Pence it’s clear.
So, your claim is that Biden &amp; the minority woman worked together out of 2 different states at different years against minorities? And the other choice is loudly racist &amp; inflammatory, actively trying to capture &amp; kill immigrants, sickening Americans bc he thinks it hurts Blue?
Only if Biden wins a bright future or look for 4 more years of cronism, dictatorship, dirtier air/water/you name it, bigotry, farmers getting $16 billion in welfare checks, tariff tax on America, it goes on and on.
I'll guarantee he's voting for Biden. And so my original comment comes full circle. Yes, the hypocrites need the truth pointed out to them.
Do we mean what Joe Biden means when he says that "poor kids can be just as smart as white kids"?
Btwn the suspense on Right over a potential viral gaffe and the sudden enthusiasm on the Left, Biden-Harris events might be a real ratings booster for networks. Maybe they’ll cover them like they did Trump. Media attention in 2016 was big reason why he won
Didn’t Obama/Biden seperate them first. Also it was shown that some of the kids and “parents” weren’t even from the same family.
I’m voting For Joe Biden and Kamala Harris  And get ready for 2024 Kamala will be the next president in 2024.
Aren't your models validated on the entire voting (and prior polling) patterns involved in the election?  It's still just one election, but it's a heck of a lot more data to validate the overall uncertainty and confidence intervals than just "Biden win Y/N?"
Your days a numbered. Biden/Harris will fucking body you and Pence.
how would it be impossible? He would've united the incredibly split party right now securing the election. I know so many real progressives that will not shake their principles and vote for Biden and a Sanders VP spot would've have shuffled so many over. Instead we get a cop
Voting for Trump OR Biden is the anthisis of conservative.
I don’t at all mean to disregard the trans community, but it’s not our job to come up with a better answer... We all know they’re both horrid options, but the reality is, if we can’t get behind Biden and Harris, we’re stuck w/ Trump &amp; he surely isn’t better for their community...
Democrats want a black on the ticket for shared identity &amp; shared history with descendants of former slaves &amp; victims. But Kamala Harris' ancestors were slave holders. And Biden shows a history of racist attitudes.
We'll be streaming their first appearance on our Facebook and on
the statement was hypothetical no shit he would never pick Bernie. I never suspended a single percent of my belief to think Biden would ever do something as smart as picking Bernie as VP and uniting the party
Speaking of morally reprehensible: Biden and Trump.   You should have been raised to demand better standards and that character in a president matters.
And what an INSULT to Biden.  Who is Bishop Tobin anyway?
Hillary shows such generosity and patriotism in this support. Imagine this from our Nasty Greedy Buffoon of a president? His comment that he does not understand how Biden could choose someone who "disrespected" him in the debates is such a clear view of his own narcissism.

He's terrified because VP Biden has shown that you don't have to stand in front of a camera telling lies and mocking people in order to get things done.
Not for me l not that stupid to vote for that ticket cause it sucks and knowing the Democrats they up to no good Biden will not be president cause his been used.
Get ready for petulant Trump to punish America if Biden wins
Biden wasn't fired up in his first 46 years in elected office? No wonder he hasn't accomplished anything.
You can’t honestly say Biden is gonna do any better as a president? As much as I don’t care for Trump, I reeeeeeally don’t care for Biden. I also keep thinking of those creepy videos of him and little girls that were posted everywhere. I can’t.
Beware of those who call Catholic Faith their foundation while making &amp; professing their own changes. It is now Biden’s Adjusted Catholic Faith. Not the Truth!
I couldn't love &amp; admire  more,  but those expressing disappointment at the Biden/Harris ticket aren't true progressives. They are  revealing a rather nasty implicit prejudice. She herself is all in for real change not fantasies.
Republican spoiler, apparently
I hope that won’t happen in the US: trump getting 80% and Biden 10%. We would not be able to let that go!
if I know, then you know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will not be the ticket you ultimately run against.
Biden and Harris both lost big in previous primary runs for president. You can't have a winning ticket composed of two losers. 😎
Good point. We have plentiful evidence of 45's inability to speak coherently. 45 should have to present his platform and be compared to Biden's though, instead of just the name-calling nonsense he is engaging in now.
Trump lobs racist — and misspelled — attack against Joe Biden and Cory Booker – Raw Story
Biden and Harris both lost big in previous primaries to run for president. How is this a winning ticket? You gotta win to win . 😎
This definitely bodes well for an FDR-like presidency, what with Biden's own support among the plutocrats. Even if they welcomed Wall Street's hatred, Wall Street is evidently unwilling to provide it.
Dems so desperate, they are blaming the China virus on Trump.  Biden needs a caretaker.
Who here said I was giving up. I’m not allowed to give up. My fellow islanders are going to be underwater within my lifetime.   Biden robbed us our last chance to save their homes. Now the best we can do is help them relocate when it happens.
Wil you support Biden ? You should follow your heart and join the Rs...
Nothing wrong with clean hands.   And how does your new fan base feel about you admitting that voting for Biden is "dirty"?
U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono weighs in on Joe Biden's V.P. pick, Sen. Kamala Harris
It doesn't matter Biden will end up like Hillary cause Obama was the last President the democrat ever had it over for them the country is on our children money future and are broke.
I’m going to be very clear about this. Do I support Biden as president? No. Do I support Kamala? Not really. Will I be voting for them come November... Hell fucking yes I will. A NON VOTE IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP. UTILIZE YOUR FUCKING RIGHT TO VOTE.
What Republicans still don't understand about the never-Trump movement
Do you think 45 will debate Biden? Can he actually do it and not come away looking like a complete fool?
Everyone in America probably said Biden is hiding. So you say hidden Biden and you really think that’s impressive? I’m more concerned that you have been babbling with Biden in the basement too. And I’ve been one of your biggest fans since the famous commonwealth speech.
Saw a Bernie tweet criticizing the traitor. Then saw a Bernie Bro response criticizing Bernie for not saying the same thing about Biden/Harris.  Bros gonna Bro.
Inside Joe Biden’s search for a running mate
The same thing happened when Biden was running against Obama.
Just a cowardly way of admitting that Trump would destroy Biden in a debate and the world would see that Joe is unfit to hold any office! You'er pathetic! You will do anything and vote for anyone against  . Sold your soul!!!!!!
Did CNN just imply that Biden isn’t fit?
Nina, is there really no hope left for Bernie/Lee in 2020? I just hate the Biden/Harris option. I was still hanging on to hope for our revolution ❣️What are you advising Progressives do? Not vote? Vote Green? Write in Bernie/Lee? I’m asking you cuz I trust you won’t vote shame☮️
Discrediting Kamala to weaken her popularity amongst blacks. ‘B’ will be to give Trump the ‘playbook’ on how to draw blacks away from Biden’s campaign. ‘C’ will be to convince young blacks not to vote at all. Watch!
Where do you think Biden is getting all his funding? Now with Kamala in place, watch how they annihilate Trump. They’re going to go into campaign overdrive with Kamala doing most of the leg work. That and massive amts. of security for Kamala will be $$$.
Harris rivalled Biden a racist,  said she would round up Trump supporters,  go after guns,  added time to sentences for blacks as DA,  You folks would vote for Manson just to see Trump lose.  Your hatred for this country is so deep you can't even see it.
Kamala Harris, a Political Fighter Shaped by Life in Two Worlds

I believe Cornpop is dead. However, Joe Biden is also brain dead.
Some of them will break through. I did when I realized how little the Obama admin had actually done for me. And Obama was actually a smooth talker.   You think a bumbling fool like Biden is going to keep it together as the infections continue to rise and the
Kamala Harris will support Biden’s policies as his VP so you don’t have your facts right on her position. She is not a fringe left wing candidate so stop posting false claims about her record.
Look on the bright side. 4 years of watching the country continue its decline under Biden might poison anyone associated with the administration.
Listen, Kamala was hard on Biden in the debates, but she's a strong women who knows her sh*t and they can both put it all aside for the betterment of our country. Woman and black VP! Biden rocks for putting the people first!

#JoeBidenForPresident2020 #Biden2020 #BlueWave2020 Biden being adorable aka WHEN THE DEMENTIA DROPS 💣
Bring it on cause if Kamala Harris attacks the President on her own that only shows that Biden has a dementia problem and also that give the president every right to attack Biden when Kamala makes common cause she not running for President it B himself.
Why can't Biden run for President?
Can't Biden?
Why not the Presidential candid Biden?  What is wrong with him running for the job he wants?
Biden-Harris will be the first Democratic ticket without an Ivy League degree since 1984

Why does Biden “deserve prison”?
We in Hawaii are all for Biden/Harris and we think the entire country is going for them too. Of course there are the famous Trumpanzees. They are different than Chimpanzees. Wot?😀😋😟😁
all in for Harris/Biden!
I’m happy for new representation in the VP. To be honest though her policy sucks. It’s no better than Biden’s. I feel strongly about Bernie but it wasn’t meant to be, Warren was completely beaten...but endorsed centrist after slandering Bernie. Tulsi pretty much republican. (1/2)
Biden. Not cuz I like Biden, but I think he wouldn't ruin America any more further than trump would if he were to be reelected.
You know this is just an editing trick to make Biden look unprepared; each cut is done to make his answers look choppy.   That’s not the actual producer that you hear on the video! This is all done to reinforce your biases. Be smarter about what you’re hearing &amp; seeing!

What do you think Trump needs in front of him to sound coherent? It’s a teleprompter.   And even with it, he cannot pronounce words like Yosemite and statistics. Without a teleprompter, he a rambling word salad of ineptitude.   Biden’s a genius in comparison.

You realize that this isn’t a real news story, don’t you? Biden has done plenty of interviews outside of his basement; they just aren’t shown on Fox News.    Biden was bicycle riding this weekend. I doubt Trump can even ride a bike. He’s more the golf cart type.

Democrats have a moral dilemma in the General Election - Kamala Harris attacked Biden's character - said Biden was everything the Democrats stand against - now she's his VP?  Kamala only stands for personal ambition, and Biden just tried to buy cheap moral cover.
Organize with us. We aren’t cashing in all our chips in elections. Elections are simply choices, the best was Bernie, now it’s Biden. Because we can move Biden on our issues more than Trump. The point is to keep organizing and not counting on politicians as saviors
Biden said bad things about Obama during his campaign before he became VP
Scary thing is, Biden and Harris could be Dems’ best..all they’ve got?
I wonder if Biden remembers who Kamala Harris is??!!
all this talk I’m seeing about how horrendous Biden &amp; Harris are is unfortunately starting to make me strongly believe we have to deal w/ that monster for ANOTHER 4 years and it ~truly~ makes me want to die
Obama used drones considerably more than Bush. Just imagine how many drones Biden-Harris will use if the progression continues
I've wondered about this quite a bit, including how (if at all) she impacts health policy as Biden's VP. Her proposal was unique, falling somewhere between ACA expansion + public option &amp; pure M4A. Was this driven by political strategy, ideology, or some combination thereof?
Republicans are jumping for JOY!  She is Soooo narrowly focused on just one segment of our citizenry. If she and Biden should win, GOODBYE LGBTQ dignity. But she’ll never take our pride. #kamala #lgbtq #TRUMP #Biden #gay
So identify with her personal story. 😭 grateful for my own strong immigrant Asian American mom who raised us. Ecstatic that Biden chose supremely competent   #BidenHarris2020
Pro-Life Leaders Say Biden-Harris ‘Most Pro-Abortion Presidential Ticket in History’
Just goes to support the notion that the DNC would rather lose to Trump than push for a winning ticket that would be beneficial to the American people and the party. Especially likely given the anal tearing Biden &amp; Harris gave each other
No true Catholic could ever vote for Biden.
Set up a few ramps Biden can walk down while the Stupident tries to talk
When Kamala Harris attack the president he needs to address it to Biden and not her cause she not running for the president office that way it gives the president more ammo to attack Biden.
And Biden had to be stupid to pick her cause she called him Racist and he turns around and submits to her Vomit.
why does joe biden look like gold member lmao I’m too stoned for this
Biden is a war criminal. He and Obama dropped 26000 bombs on 7 countries. Have a good evening.
For the record. This is a unifying act in the #Democratic Party and by #Biden, and I appreciate that #Bernie did not hesitate to publicly congratulate this choice.
As Kamala Harris is poised to make history As Joe Biden's Vice Presidential Pick, It's a good time to go back  And read my blog piece about her at   Don't say I didn't warn you.
I’m not so good with songs or lyrics. But you are awesomely amazing. We need a happy song for Biden and Harris
While her advice was thoughtful, the two are nothing alike. The difference is McCain didn’t need her, Biden does need Kamala; also Kamala is smart, Palin is not!
God bless you and Joe Biden. As a retired career military officer (28 years), I am looking forward to the return of mature, responsible, and morally committed, global leadership. You have my vote and energy toward ensuring your victory on 3 Nov!

Resolved: The Illuminati forced Biden to choose Kamala because they want Trump to win reelection.  #BidenHarris2020
The fight is between trump and kamala. We know biden won’t last.
Here’s my post from two weeks ago.  “No matter who Biden picks for VP, the Republicans will immediately declare she is the most corrupt, incompetent, unintelligent, unqualified, ugly, foreign, sicky, crippled, deformed, mentally ill, depraved, imbecilic pick ....”.  As predicted.
trying to get left leaning / democratic voters to vote for biden harris is like manray trying time convince patrick that the wallet is his.. yall dumb!
And? When Biden and Harris inevitably deploy the police state on The oppressed peoples of this nation will you stand with us then?   Because that’s what scares me more than anything. People who just hate trump go back to sleep and leave us out to die.
I also remember how horrible she was to justice Cavanaugh. That will never be forgotten nor can it be forgiven. Joe Biden did even worse to Justice Clarence Thomas which will never be forgotten or forgiven.
Biden has a racism problem.
Biden should make ads about this:
BERNIE VP WOULDVE MADE ME BEND THE KNEE AND VOTE FOR BIDEN AND SUSPEND MY LAST BIT OF CONFIDENCE IN NEO LIBERAL CORPORORTIST DEMOCRATS
Y’all complaining about Biden/Harris, I sure hope y’all are registered to vote and make your voices are heard in November, otherwise... please take a seat
A TX GOP guy so bad that my mom, who only votes pro-life and won’t vote for Biden, loathes.
Guess what I'm going to do DonnieBoi? Vote for Biden &amp; Harris. You know why? For the simple fact that they aren't you. *kisses*
Serious question - how soon after the inauguration can Biden resign and give Presidency to Harris?
Having a VP candidate who got her start in politics on her back and a Joe Biden who has spent his adult life in politics with absolutely NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS means that this is the best the Democrats have to offer.  How pathetic is the Democrat party!!  Liberal tears by the gallon.
We are witnessing history being made with  being chosen for Biden’s VP. First black woman and first Asian American on a presidential ticket. This selection gives me faith in America.
How is the former incorrect? Biden, if elected will usher in radical leftism when Harris takes over because Biden dies, or continues his descent into dementia.
Guys if every single one of us don’t vote Biden nor trump can win
Biden/Harris. We need someone who:  - has read at least one book in their life - who can form complete sentences - who cares to educate himself when necessary - gives a damn about something other than himself  This is an existential election for America
So you got two people who were most likely never going to vote for Biden to not vote for Biden? You must be as good of a conversationalist as the President
Any word from Biden or Harris denouncing rioting, looting, and mayhem in our big Democrat run cities? I’ll wait.
So you're telling me you'd vote for joe Biden after he taken a train and eaten it piece by piece AFTER derailing it with his penis???
Speak Out After Joe Biden Outed SEAL Team 6 - Billy and Karen Vaughn  via   How can he be that stupid?!  How can he be the president?!
VP picks are typically nonentities on political ambition (e.g. Tim Kaine, Mike Pence). So Biden showed guts by picking Kamala Harris. Given the GOP has had a year for oppo research, their early responses are almost randomly unfocused. #Election2020
I'm not saddened by Bernie taking the high road in endorsing Joe Biden's campaign but I wish the majority of us didn't depend on FOX or CNN for our news so we aren't restricted to two parties in November. A lot of people have creative ideas that don't fit a corporate narrative.
Biden may be the "lesser of two evils" when it comes to the majority of America's ideals, but he and his VP have contributed to systematic racism two decades ago and I can't support that.
I reserve the right to be wrong, but I refuse to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump. I hope to write in my vote, knowing that the person I choose won't win but also knowing that I did not contribute to the scary America that either candidate may create.
This comes from Trump's former campaign manager, after Tulsa still inexplicably in some position, however.  Would you expect to see this sort of foul thing coming from the Biden campaign staff?  I think and sure hope the perpetrator would be fired.
So when is your Larded Master #TraitorTrump going to challenge Joe Biden to a bicycle race? He’s already beaten #PutinsPuppet in the West Point ramp run. You’ve had months to prep for this moment and this is the best you got? Weak sauce, dude.
It was Kamalaed by Uncle Joe Biden
Wow thnx I didn't know about LaRiva and there's no way I'm voting for Trump or Biden
Wow, you heard It right from Biden and you still won’t believe?
Understood. Please watch that debate before you start arguing.  Besides, Harris would be a better presidential nominee than Biden. Not sure what Dems we’re thinking when they pushed him through. Maybe 2024 will be the year 🤙🏼
Yeah, and even she has a problem Biden

The ol’ Rope a Dope is driving you all crazy isn’t it. No need to come out, just let  continue to earn Biden votes every time he opens his mouth and lets his stoned mind free to ramble! Go on, Representative, you were saying?
I'd love to hear any insights you may have gleaned during your journey of discovery, seriously.
#KamalaHarrisForVP LOLOL 😂 Truly hilarious! But, then again what does the VP really do? I don’t know anyone who wants #Biden for  let alone  I may be convinced, Jesus really is coming this time. #endoftheworld
Please share the secrets once you achieve enlightenment.😉
Harris's health plan resembled the existing Medicare program (FFS + MA), but w/ add'l reforms.   A tenable middle-ground for democrats: pragmatic &amp; ambitious. Biden-Sanders unity plan feels similar, but takes a different financing pathway to UHC.  All theoretical w/o Congress.
Kamala Harris wasn't my first choice. I was hoping for Karen Bass or Stacy Abrams. But this is still historic:  BIPOC women have often been called the backbone of the Democratic Party. It's long past time to start calling them leaders. #KamalaHarris
I think Biden tryna smash
And I thought the fact she slept her way into public office as bad - Harris, as Biden’s VP pick, likely to face renewed scrutiny about prosecutor past  #FoxNews
Moved me from “Of course I’ll vote for Biden” to “I’m THRILLED to vote for Biden/Harris.”
Why? Biden wins California  without Harris. This is a stupid decision.
I remember this from the debates. Good thing Biden didn’t pick Tulsi, she is much more likable.
Need a Kamala Wonder Woman to pair with Biden Superman...🤣🤣🤣
Honest question - how soon after inauguration can Biden resign presidency to Harris?
damn i think i dislike Joe Biden more after he announced his VP pick... smh
This IG is literally how I feel about the Biden Harris partnership 😭😭
I hate Joe Biden and I hate Kamala Harris but I’ll be damned if I’m voting for anyone either than them. Lesser of two evils.
Try search “Joe Biden has dementia” on DuckDuckGo and Google. Google removed the search suggestion 🤭
I’m supportive of Biden and Harris. This is a good choice. I love Warren and I love Harris!! Let’s do this. I’m so excited!!! I believe in you.
Google has removed the search suggestion for “Joe Biden has dementia”. See the difference between google and DuckDuckGo. Try it yourself.
Warren is still in office. She will be a valuable member the whole way. She is out star where she is. It’s going to be good. Her voice is valued and heard by Biden and Harris.
Perfect match...(a sniffer + a b_ _ _ _ _)🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
From your lips to gods ears ! BIDEN HARRIS 2020 💙💙💙
Lol of course not. Biden’s cabinet is going to be a voltron if awfulness.   All I’m hoping for right now is that Bezos doesn’t get Sec of Commerce and Buttigieg doesn’t get Sec of Defense.
NO! Pls tell me y’all not really voting for Biden. The one who said “you’re not black if you don’t vote for me” the one who has over and over again been shown harassing women and children. Nah, go write another shitty song T Swift
That sucks...
It’s the stupid theory Biden’s old white guy advisors have been spewing in their attempt to keep Kamala off the ticket. Joe Biden just provided proof of his competence by ignoring them.
You guys are twisting yourselves into pretzels trying to paint Biden and Harris as radical left Marxists... it's very amusing! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
How Joe Biden looked whe he found out she said yes.
Joe Biden has never looked better
He is making fun of Biden and Kamala
I was referring in my tweet to Rep Doug Collins who was mocking Biden and Kamala
Three Presidential debates. Let America see the 2020 Joe Biden.
I think something nefarious will happen to Biden before the election and will b blamed on a trump supporter. And kamala will b the candidate
a Biden presidency is going to be a throw back to the G.W. days of political commentary, if we’re all still alive yee haaaw
Now that Biden has made his pick for VP, I need him to stay in the basement &amp; keep that same energy he been had... silence. 🇺🇸
Harris makes me excited. Biden alone was OK. Incomparably better than the current occupant, of course, but old white guy. The addition of Kamala Harris kicks me into actual excitement. I think she’ll challenge Biden where he needs to be challenged, and I think he’ll listen.
They'd have a problem with Sheldon Adelson if Biden picked him as veep.
None of us are perfect. The defects in Biden and Harris are not unique. But Biden and Harris are sure as hell way better than Trump and all his puppets.🙂😃🤪😂
So Biden selected Kamala Harris how predictable
Now let’s see what the snakes pull out now. Biden/Harris!
Just like with Biden, the rightwing hate media, #NaziGOP and #TraitorTrump have been desperately seeking (and failing) to come up with some legit bumper sticker meme to demean Harris. So far nothing but a string of failure.
According to GovTrack, Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate in 2019.  Even more liberal than Bernie Sanders.  The takeover of Joe Biden by the extreme left is now complete.  Link:

She’s another candidate. I would never vote democrat or republican. There is no such thing as “lesser of two evils”. I’d rather vote for the person I actually believe in and I don’t believe in creepy ass Biden.
Biden has chosen Kamala Harris; Trump and his campaign is about to go after her too. She won’t take it laying down, and the brilliant thing about it is that she has a brain. Now, let’s see how our “post racial society” rears it’s ugly head. Either way Trump needs to go...
It’s clear that most Americans dislike  #Trump.  And the #Democrats should continue to build a broad anti-Trump coalition.   But selecting #KamalaHarris speaks to another thing that #Biden has to do in order to win:  Solidify his Base.    Aloha   🇺🇸🙏🏼🤙🏼  #2020Elections  4/x
It’s pretty clear who’s going to be voting for #Trump in November, so the question that #Biden and the #Democrats needed to answer is “who will be voting for Biden in November?”   And traditionally V.P. picks are designed to answer that Q.   1/x   #2020Election  #KamalaHarris
By picking Kamala Harris, Biden chose a major LGBTQ ally &amp; a formidable warrior against the GOP
I’m voting Biden-Harris but I’m going to be complaining about it every day.
Dear  When Biden/Harris wins in November, please appoint Barbara Lee as California’s next Senator. Thank you. ❤️
I bet they will go with a token repeal like the one that Obama-Biden did when they got into office. I think 94% of those cuts were made permanent by Obama.
That’s a hard one, I do think Biden wins only because he’s been in office longer
If you believe that the only way to defeat Trump is to vote Biden (or vice versa), let me just remind you that America wasn’t always a country.
#KamalaHarris is going to emasculate  Pence   Oh wait, trump already did that   Well, she’ll kick his a** in the debate   #Biden  #BidenHarris  #BidenHarris2020Landslide

you don’t have to love her. you should absolutely hold her (and biden) accountable. but i am begging you, for the sake of literal humanity, please do not let 2016 happen again.
I can’t wait to watch the Trump/Biden debate... Its gonna be hilarious
The USS Joe Biden sunk the stock market today by firing a Kamala Harris torpedo. Where are the best and brightest in the land? Time to step up.
Just because she had an Indian mother, does not imply she represents Indian or Hindu-American interests. In fact, she has taken anti-India position (article 370, etc) like most in the democratic party has and hope that pushes indian americans to vote against Biden.
So Joe Biden couldn't find the exit to his basement and had to announce his running mate via Twitter.  Well done Joe, well done!
Kamala is about as black as suburban democrat female voters are willing to tolerate.  Kamala was selected to appease suburban progressive female voters in battleground states. The Biden campaigned polled Karens and Karens wanted Kamala.  #BidenHarris2020
Why not? She’s electrifying, smart, quick. All the things Biden needs help on.

Biden probably forgot how evil Kamela Harris is
Because Biden doesn’t know WTF he doing anyway lol.
In nearly five decades in office, what is Joe Biden's crowning achievement?  Does he have any accomplishments?  Or only campaign promises?
Someone quick, tell Biden &amp; Harris to promise Armenian Genocide recognition so they can disappoint the Armenian community again and we can fulfill the cyclical nature of the political game. Also #StopAliyev because his pubic mustache certainly hasn't succeeded
Though Biden/Harris is a better pick than the incumbents, we still have a long way to go for progress. Not sure if this has been updated with Biden's new policy changes. Emoji marks where I scored.
I wonder if they deleted this, but I don’t think they should have made Biden and Harris look like Star Wars ghosts........
Dianne Feinstein was the most natural fit for a Biden #VPPick from a personal and ideological perspective.
Great.   Maybe now you should focus your energy on phone banking/volunteering. A Biden/Harris ticket is definitely going to need all the help it can get.....
isn’t biden against cannabis?
It's going to be "The Cop Kamala" my question is Biden/Harris going to take over the daily Law and Order tweets now?
If people actually believe Biden is leading in the polls, Biden said it himself! #Trump2020
In this instance, it's a vote for Harris to be president not Biden. He'll be guided for as long as he lasts, she and her handlers will be calling all the shots.  Gross, I need to take a Clorox shower. They're both reprehensible humans.
Biden/Harris is far from a "dream ticket" from a drug policy reform or cannabis reform perspective but a Democratic House and Senate can move them forward. #BidenHarris2020 #VPPick
Yall hate trump. Yall hate Biden . Yall dont want Kamala as VP . STFU. At this point you dont have a choice. Just dont be ignorant &amp; not vote .
Mondale/Ferraro is a more apt comparison other than the fact that they were more robustly pogressive--and that Biden/Harris have a high likelihood of winning.
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the right-wing that Biden wants to defund the police when in reality he’s ultra Blue Lives Matter.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first black woman   #HNN
Just to clarify... she was my first choice. Anyone else would be my second and third choice. I am voting Biden period. Kamala is smart and tough. Let’s get this done!
I’m 100% convinced Biden trying to lose on purpose with all the shit he be sayin
Even if the prospects aren’t that bright right now, I still implore everyone to vote this presidential election. Too many ppl used the “I’m not voting bc I don’t like either candidate” excuse last time and we got Trump so pls, vote for Biden anyway lol
#Dems chose #Harris! So its Harris vs #Trump! #Biden is just a figurehead! Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee  via
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate via
Unlike your moron dad, Biden has picked an equal partner, not a spineless boot-licking puppet like Pence. He's not afraid of having a strong, intelligent, and qualified VP. That is the hallmark of a true leader. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Bernie supporters, please vote Biden/Harris!
Biden really just said “Fuck it! Idc if I lose!” 😐
Senator Harris is an excellent selection for vice president. She's undeniably brilliant and tenacious and will be an important part in a Biden administration
I thought his comment that Biden's deliberative selection process helped to elevate future female stars of the Demoratic party was unusually incisive...
I’m 😕 about Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate. I’m not a fan of her having supported as a prosecutor, harsh punishments for drug offenses, or of her being equivocal about it later when running for President.
The Democrats aren't sending their best!  Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris may be the worst Democratic duo, since Walter Mondale and Ferraro.  What a disaster for the Democratic Party!
Strongest ticket since Obama/Biden... Trump better go hide in his bunker...
Must of the people celebrate of joe Biden kamala Harris
Kamala Harris “is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party, and only the fourth woman in history to be chosen for one of their presidential tickets.” 🇺🇸🥳
I predicted a Biden/Harris ticket last June
So its #Harris vs #Trump. #Biden is just a figurehead!
I think it just assumes Biden doesn’t run after winning, and there are many reasons that might happen
I'm okay with Biden picking Harris. I would have preferred Warren but at least he didn't pick Clinton.
If Biden wins in November, Kamala Harris will be the highest ranking female politician in American history 🇺🇸
So glad to hear. I know Trump is awful, but Biden/Kamala is a worse choice. Picking the best of the worst.
Yes, but did you expect Biden to pick Kamala Harris???
Joe Biden is still trying to understand why the Democratic Party, chose the recently deceased professional wrestler Kamala as his running mate.  Reportedly Biden's campaign staff, is creating a "scratch &amp; sniff" explanation for Joe.
People on Twitter jumping on a Trend: “ACAB!”  Same people when Biden makes a Cop his VP: “Great Choice!”
Biden Crime Bill and his need for child pedophilia and adrenachrome
Mayor Pete, you and Chastien better get ready to move to DC to be part of the Biden Administration!!!
I'm still happy...no ones perfect in politics. You see it with Biden and everyone else but I truly believe and hope for the future and I truly believe things will be better off in the hands of these two than the shit show we are dealing with now!!!
Oh boy, so excited to vote for Biden/Harris.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER...ONE SNIFFS🤣...THE OTHER? NVM🙄 (match in hell)
I can’t wait for the VP debate. I wanted Warren, but Harris isn’t afraid to keep Biden in check when he’s a dumbass.
I'm so happy to see her join the Biden ticket... tears of joy!
Sleepy Joe Biden selects California Sen. Horizontal Harris as running mate
How will BLM supporters defend voting for Biden/Kamala? Tulsi Gabbard rips Kamala Harris' record on criminal prosecutions  via
Oooh, Biden-Harris. I can definitely get on board with that.
Republican governor in Massachusetts, she’s gotta keep her seat if Biden hopes to have a Senate majority. She’s a team player, though, she can wait
Just in...
Biden is picking Kamala...Harris...as his running mate 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ whyyyy
Hell froze over! Joe Biden chose VP Kamala Harris! ⁦ If you think you will be elected, do you resign to hand it over? Who paid &amp; leaned on you? ⁦⁦
Fantastic news. I look forward to her commentary on #BillBarr lawlessness in the coming weeks as she is now the #Democratic #VP pick. #KamalaHarris Is #Biden’s Choice for Vice President
Y’all bitching about Biden/Harris.. I would rather have ANYONE other than Tr*mp/P*nce
Biden/Harris sounds great to me! Are we gonna cal them Kamaloe or Joemala?  #BidenHarris2020
I’m with you Biden!   Kamala is  F I E R C E!  Let’s get to work!  🇺🇸🗳🌊
Best choice Biden could have made!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP choice.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
Republicans for Joe biden 😂 what an oxymoron
Remember when Kamala Harris stuck it to Biden in the debates? Well he probably remembered that, but is using it to his advantage.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
This choice will ensure a President Trump win in a landslide!
BREAKING:  selects California Sen.  as running mate:
JUST IN:
I’m thinking Biden will appoint many of the other candidates in his Cabinet🤞
#BREAKING: Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate #BidenVP
They gotta show pictures of Biden with Obama just to make Biden look good. This is our election of our President. Sad.
BIDEN/HARRIS!!! Yes!!!!

Senator Kamala Harris will be Joe Biden’s running mate. 🤭🤭🤭
Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November
Could be Biden’s pick for the VP.
So y’all mean to tell me if Joe Biden wins he will be picking a female VP 😭😭😭😭😭 y’all vote for joe please
I don’t even give a  _____, lets get it on. Times ticking no more Hiden Joe Biden, I’m so ready to watch the debates.
1.  Also, if they they do accused Biden of a crime, ask they why they were spying on his campaign.
We'll be safer in Biden's American than we are in Trump's America.
Both Republicans and Democrats have their share of anti-trade troglodytes. Here is how and why Biden and his party should turn that around.
Everyone knows ur attempting to help our current IMPOTUS, Kanye West, so just back off. It won’t work. On second thought, the dummies who would vote for u will actually take votes away from Trump so stay in the race. It will help Biden win.
I’m afraid Joe Biden, being only human, will not choose a former rival presidential candidate for his VP.
if biden chooses harris as his vp the white house is gonna have another trump, just as vp
i swear to god if biden chooses harris as his VP we gonna have another donald trump just in a different position of power
I’m with you Biden! ✊🗳🇺🇸
This is true. And I tend to think Biden is a less exciting candidate than Hillary was.
Can we just skip to the part were Joe Biden steps down cause he’s “sick” &amp; the Vice President who is a WOMAN, becomes president &amp; then we have a our first woman president! 🙌🏽👏🏽 I’m sick of these men
My wife, no my sister, I’m Jill Biden
, I think President Biden should choose like five vice president’s African-American, Native American, white, Latino and Asian. All women. They would kick ass
Hey Matt I now believe that Joe Biden is doing an act to avoid prison time for treason.
So, what are you all gonna do when Biden tells us his VP is Hillary?
I can't believe Biden picked Ivanka Trump as his running mate. That just seems fishy.  #bidenTrump
Biden's VP, WHO GIVES A FUCK?
the margin of error is 4.3%.... Biden has a lead but it's tight.
The likely voters was actually 50-44 for Biden in June. There is a 1 point shift towards Trump.
Too bad Biden's VP pick has to be a token female.
At first when I read this tweet I thought “Oh, really?” and let this thought pass by. Then this early morning, I thought about this tweet. The recent past and current presidents’ faces (Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden?) ought to be sculpted in another location on Mt. Rushmore. Tourists
The media "whoever Biden's VP pick is had better brace themselves for the onslaught of racist sexism". Have they even seen this country? Do they somehow think Kamala is going to say "oh wow, I have never been treated like this before."? Give your collective heads a shake.
3 point shift my man.
Biden was up 8 points in the last poll.
Biden's token woman VP pick, being a dude who thinks he's a woman would be soo sweet right now.
Biden picks “Infrastructure Week” as VP
What did Biden do in 8 yrs as VP?   Biden is running on promises. Trump os running on accomplishments.
Biden isn’t hiding, he’s riding a bike. #TraitorTrump can barely waddle his fat ass around. Why doesn’t Trump prove how fit he is on a bike?
Joe Biden.. the feeble old man won't come out of his own basement... in that situation, Biden would have soiled and wet his Depends
This Pastor letter to a Parishioner on Biden’s move away from Catholic Beliefs speaks to the heart.  please Pray, Read And Yearn for God’s Truth on Paul’s warning of Self-Seeking Teachers in Romans 16:17-18.
Biden is going to inherit an awesome amount of power thanks to do nothing Senate.  AWESOME.  Crooks, your reign is coming slowing drifting away.
Biden is not healthy enough to be a world leader.  Maga with trump who led the American economy to greatness.
A satirical congrats to Biden’s running mate - whoever she is - from ⁦ “you have, oh, about five minutes before the garbage starts raining down upon you.” But, srsly, these women are already heroes &amp; any one of them can withstand Trump.
When he mentioned that Biden choosing Susan Rice could be a "liability", this is probably telling us that Karen Bass looks like a "safer" choice. Sleepy Joe is SINKING! 😂
Well of course it’s to help Biden. Hillary has destroyed the #Democrats Party and cities and doesn’t seem bothered by it. She is psycho as are you.  It’s so obvious Hillary is choosing the VP and is pressuring mayors and governors. You two intend to fk the USA.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden announces his VP will be Selina Meyer
Will Joe Biden have to join her in exile should he win our election?
If she doesn't get picked, they 100% will.   They were leaping up and down when she dunked on him in the first debate. They only like Biden because he's a short cut to get national attention and become the frontrunner in 2024.  You know... without having to do any real work -.-
A quote from a member of a discord server I'm in:  "biden the senile degenerating degenerate."  nailed it. #Trump2020Landslide #WellSaid
If biden has michelle obama as his vp i think he may coincidentally pass away while in office and the obamas will be back in charge #StayWoke
I punch Joe Biden
I think checking followers counts on twitter gives you an idea of Biden’s chances .  Hillary has 28 million followers and got slaughtered by trump .  Biden has 8 million . Trump has almost 85 million
Dr. Jill Biden explains why she won't call President Trump names: 'I won't stoop to that'
when Kanye says he’s only running to hurt Biden (help Trump) vs when Kanye says “you know how many girls I took to the titty shop”
Biden bringing the gun show !
Why would l vote for Biden! Cause Obama say so! To me Obama himself not in his right mind.
Joe Biden said that he will defeat Joe Biden in November.  Joe Biden needs to be in a home.  His supporters need to ask themselves why they are so desperate to back Joe Biden.  Look at his record and listen to his words.  Joe Biden represents dementia ..  Democrats are pathetic.
Tucker rips lack of coverage of DC mass shooting, claims media silent to help Biden campaign
Anybody who thinks Biden's mental state makes him unfit to run has to explain why this guy's doesn't: #Election2020
Is it just me or is this really creepy?
Mayor Pete is trending.  Biden isn't that stupid... is he?
Who is Biden’s running mate?
And? Bring in 10 DEBATES  with POTUS  then! That'll  test his mental health...🙄
Who believes that Biden VP pick will be Michelle Obama?
is not big on the Biden
I agree. Perhaps because Biden lost his son, I believe that his preference would be for a young man who could be a surrogate son and protege.
Biden needs to make a decision ASAP so supporters can get behind the ticket.  We need an announcement now to generate momentum!  Do it Biden!  🇺🇸
I love how he says “Biden is not all there” as if to suggest Dump is playing with a full deck. 😂😂😂😂 he must’ve gotten a good penny for this interview.
Looks like it’s Mayor Pete for Biden’s VP nominee?
My bet is something nefarious happens to Biden and it’s blamed on a trump supporter so now everyone will rally around the dems

He's also claiming that one historical event (The 1918 pandemic) that preceded the other (the end of World War II in 1945) ended the second one that it had nothing to do with at all.  And Trump is questioning Joe Biden's cognitive abilities? LOL!!!!!

Bringing class and brains back to the White House. Will they remove the stripper pole when the Biden’s move in?
I don't care who the veep is (prefer Harris, though), and I will vote for Biden no matter what in order to get rid of Trump. There is nothing more important than removing Trump from office, especially since it'll keep him from killing more people through his coronavirus bungling.
They better save it for some woke/progressive Obama crooks. Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report  #FoxNews
No, we don't. We need an end to Trump's reign of terror and for Biden to lead us through this pandemic so that we'll have someone who enacts sound, science-based public health policy instead of a whiny orange brat who has let 163k people die because he can't deal with reality.
Nope—Biden's house is his personal residence that he bought with his own money. Trump lives at the White House, but it belongs to us and isn't supposed to be used as an election prop for a corrupt and desperate tyrant whose election hopes are tanking.
Yeah. Only way to save USPS is to ramp up ads urging everyone to vote for you. Thinking about Trump winning in November is very scary and makes me sick. Vote! Vote! Vote! FOR BIDEN!
tRump says Biden can hurt God. If 1 man can hurt my God, then I gotta start looking for another god. A god that can’t be hurt by any 1 person, place, or thing.
All Biden does is hide in his basement.
The Point: How Donald Trump has already handed Joe Biden a debate win
Here’s an issue on which Trump and Biden agree. And they are both wrong. “Buy America” policies cost taxpayers $250,000 for each job “saved”. That’s not cost effective and it takes funding away from other things our country needs.
Trump paints Biden in a picture many don't recognize - The Washington Post
I believe this is what most dems are hoping for. Everyone can see Biden is in decline.
Biden ignored SS for 8 years as VP.

Kanye. Better Than Biden.  Trump Not Running,   I Vote For Him.
Biden and his new AG will investigate Trump and family.  No way he will get away with the corruption and evil illegal deeds. The orange jumpsuit will match his face.
We want and need a "big Biden win! "
Trump lowered Black unemployment to all-time low, increased funding for HBCUs, passed School Choice, raised Black homeownership,  got millions off welfare, pardoned Jack Johnson, First Step Act.  What has Biden done for the Black community? Why are you voting for Biden?
China owns Biden. That's why China wants Biden to win.
C'mon man. Let's face it. Biden is senile. That's why he is afraid of coming out frol his nasement. Everytime he opens his mouth, he says something his handlers with he didn't say.
O￼n the day that ⁦ was at his ritzy, exclusive country club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that  has a $350,000 admission fee, Biden did what so many typical Americans do for recreation:   He rode a bike
If anyone is a racist, it's Biden. Fought against bussing Black student for desegregation of schools.  What possitive has he done in nearly 50 years in elected office?  Biden is running on promises. Trump on accomplishments in 3-1/2 years.
You know what kind of candidate you have when the communist party endorses him - Biden - a shill for the communists
I saw a ad Joe Biden saying he’s a proud military parent. Wow I think he should be a disappointed military parent because Hunter Biden was kick out for using drugs. Need to lead by example. Now Hunter, a military failure making millions. Corruption all over the board
Ginger, I like your thought, but this will never be agreed upon by either party. I know you assume Biden will pass it with ease, but one small mistake, or spelling error. Could end his chances.  Sorry, everything in politics can &amp; will be spun or lied about on both sides to win.
The main reason people like Biden is because he is running against Trump.
Love that he endorsed Biden!  Looking forward to Texas voting Blue!  😷✌️🗳🌊
Isn't that the truth. Biden will have his work cut out for him. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
We need to become much better at fighting back in areas where it really counts. First priority is to elect Biden!
Joe Biden's campaign book Just got released . It's entitled   " What Did He Say? "
Biden replaced Trump.
Nobody is challenging his physical ability, they're questioning his mental acuity. Bike riding is fine but can he carry a coherent conversation? That's all people are asking, the upcoming debates should answer that question unless Biden declines, doubt will still exist then.
When Biden says he is "going to get control of the virus" he means he will never let you go to work, leave your house or send your children to school.
Ginger, you keep focusing on Trump.  I didn’t comment on Trump's failures, my comment was on your use of “no hint” about Biden. Do you see the claims of the women in Business Insider article as being valid?  If you just dismiss them, how are you better than those you oppose?
They can’t &amp; they don’t care. Let’s just move on &amp; work on GOTV of Dems-independent leaning Dems-never trumpers since the timeline is getting compressed.Let Lincoln Project &amp; other similar groups work on trying 2 peel 2-3% of Repubs off 4 Biden. 🎣 or cut bait time soon.
Presidential Hopeful Joe Biden Wants This Video Removed Of Him Speaking ...  via
And ears and brains to make sense of Biden’s  senseless
In my spare time I think about things like this: Will Trump go to Herman Cain’s funeral, is he decent enough to say kind words about him? Why is Biden taking so long to make his VP choice public? If it’s a sister, does he fear backlash at the polls? This says a lot about the USA.
A pretzel could have defeated the candidates that ran against her 2018 but I see your point.....  Her endorsement of Biden was definitely a tough pill to swallow.....
That actually is a good point......  If I was betting man, I do think Biden is going to choose Rice.
If you were betting, who do you think Biden and his team are going to pick?
Brian Stelter identifies theme in right-wing talk radio's attack on Joe Biden - CNN Video  This is the must watch of the week far as I’m concerned. RW media is not going to let up between now and Nov., so stay vigilant.

My actual preference is not happening, lol..... (Turner or Lee)   But out of the Biden's short list my top 3 are:   1. Bass 2. Warren 3. Duckworth
Ginger, sounds like you didn't read the Lifesite Catholic article that started this thread? Fr Pavone was Director of Priest for Life.  Was Tara Reade’s claim a “hint" against VP Biden?  What about the other 7 claims against VP Biden?
Who will be Biden’s “TOKEN” ??????
Biden supports those policies? So, what,his advisors are forcing him to oppose them? I'm almost 70 now, and blaming first the Soviets and now the Russians for our own catastrophic flaws has been a near-constant throughout my life. It got old way before I did.
Noted woman of color, Joe Biden
Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump's biggest attack lines
Fox News clip discredits talking point of right-wing radio
Ginger, I myself wouldn’t use “worse” to describe VP Biden. “No hint”, so how do describe VP Biden being accused by Tara Reade of sexual assault? Or the other complaints by women of inappropriate acts? Maybe Fr Pavone is correct on how to pick a POTUS.
Maxine Waters says she's confident Biden will choose a Black woman as a running mate
“Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities (meddle to help  is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.” Hmm, Biden colluding with terrorists!
No, we're obviously going to have to pay taxes at the end of the year, or have some type of federal excise tax.  Dems are the ones ignoring SS. I've never heard of a Dem plan to save SS. Not when Biden was VP.
All I can think of is to ensure that all votes against Trump is more than votes for Trump &amp; all votes against Biden is more than votes for Biden. Also, all votes against Trump 20 is greater than all votes against Trump 16, &amp; all votes against Biden is more than against Hillary.
Marsha, clearly you haven't been listening. Joe Biden said he's picking a "woman" he did not say a woman of color. Facts matter, Marsha. Get your facts straight before you speak. It is better to remain silent and be assumed a fool, than to speak and erase all doubt. #GirlBye

Biden foes not have the capacity to be a world leader and we dint need Bernie Sanders and his group at he helm
Joe Biden understands? Joe don't know what state he's in half the time. He can't tell the difference between his sister and his wide. He thinks he's Joe Biden's husband.  Elect Biden and let Antifa rule Democrat cities.
Well he’s not going to urge it, insist on it &amp; has no plans to even suggest it....of course, I expect he'll just let NY State (likely others) take care of it.....&amp; Biden CANNOT stop them even if he were inclined....Biden wants desparately to just get America back on thrack‼️ 👍🏽👍🏽
I’m going to vote for Joe Biden. I honor him and love him. But sometimes his voice seems frail and faraway, like an echo from a long-ago summer evening on the porch.
So...the Postal Union makes campaign contributions to the Biden for President campaign only. Gotcha‼️
What was all that trouble in Benghazi Susan Rice claimed to be because a silly video when she was Obama/Biden's Security Advisor?? Four Americans dies in that attack and the Obama/Biden Administration tried to sweep it under the rug.

Electing Trump will give us law and order.   Electing Biden will result in Portlands throughout the country. Dems can't even acknowledge what's happening in Democrat run Portland, instead of taking action to quell the violence Antifa brings, calling the violent protests a myth.
Ha ha ha ha! I needed to laugh! You lost me at Biden &amp; decency! Politics are ugly any which way with whomever! Decency &amp; poltics is oxymoronic.
Biden leads Trump in battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin: poll | TheHill huge if you believe polls.
The only reason any country wants Biden...is Biden can be manipulated and controlled by bribing him with money. Biden doesn’t care about Americans... he cares about himself! Like most politicians: Pelosi, Obama, etc!
A man just said if Biden is elected, he’s leaving the state!So, you’d go to another state where’s he’s still President? LOL (I’m sure he meant the country! Lots of people say they’ll move and don’t!) If Biden’s President, then say goodbye to property rights, police, jobs etc
Regarding the Biden VP choice; nothing says “token” better than choosing someone on the basis of gender or race.

The election like Groundhog Day for me. We get Trump again I’m staying in Hawaii for the next 4 years. We get Biden I’d be open to live on the mainland for a while since the majority of ppl will be civil.
How they figure Biden will win? With his health issue such as dementia, their not a lot of people will fall for this message cause they're not enough people to accept this massages.
None of them going in the White House cause Biden will end up like Hillary.

Not bitching, the enemy of my enemy is my friend... but when Biden wins, how soon does The Lincoln turn on him, and in what ways...?
Biden needs to pick a women of color, preferably black or brown.  His VP must be able to energize and excite the Dem bases. Susan Rice is as boring as Biden. He needs to pick Kamala Harris.
We love Biden here in Hawaii!
This article is a hit job designed for "both candidates are the same" BS. When Biden compared the Black &amp; Latin demographics, he was talking about voting patterns, &amp; he was right. But you'd never know it from this sloppy piece of sensationalist journalism.
Broke his heart when Gabbard endorsed Biden. Cut the foundation of his world out from under him.

Sounds like Joe Biden doesn't even know SS is forecasted to collapse by mid 2030s. Trump will do something about it. Biden will continue to ignore the problem like he's done for eight years as VP.

Never would I vote for elder abused Joe Biden or any democrat after watching their behavior to Trump. Standing Trump strong.
Biden doesn’t share my views on all issues. That might make him “wrong” in your book. But, Biden doesn’t lie, cheat &amp; steal his way through life. And Biden actually values life other than his own.   This is why most ppl are voting for him, not cuz they agree w/him on everything
The Trump Administration is done with corinavirus. Taking further action would be admitting their efforts up to this point have failed. Nothing will done to curb the spread until either Biden takes office or a vaccine is made. There will be over we 1/4 million dead by then.
I believe the biggest hoax now is demented Joe being foisted as a candidate capable of being POTUS. He doesn't seem capable of running the local kindergarten and you want him to be POTUS? Biden running for POTUS is the galactic hoax of the century. Never in your wildest dreams.
You hit the nail in the head! New York now, the rest of America as soon as they can get Biden to steal the election. These people are sick.
#JoeBidenForPresident owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride.  #TrumpCantRideABike

Did you see Biden wearing a mask while riding a bike but not a helmet?
The only way they can win. There is no enthusiasm for Biden.  #Trump2020
In other words, vote before Trump exposes how senile Biden is in their debates? I'd be worried about that too.
Remember that pic of Obama riding that bike with the helmet looking very impotent...Biden looks worse than that every day.

President Biden.
And Joe Biden can ride a bike!

I do! Great reference! Its EXACTLY what Biden and the #NAZIDemocraticSocialistPedophile. Party policy is. Turn the United States into a shithole banana republic like Venezuela and Biff looks more like Biden than Trump
Totally agree. We need to vote this scum out in November. Unbelievable what they're getting away with.  Makes me really sad, so many patriots died to give us our freedoms. Then a scumbag like Trump comes along, shitting on the constitution. Biden 2020.
Don't let Biden ruin that expression, I love using it 😬
Didn’t Biden promise to announce his VP pick this week?   Lol what happened? Could it be that he had two very racist gaffes in the two interviews he did this week? I guess we’ll never know lol.
I’d rather it be Rice than Harris. Mostly because Biden’s foreign policy is gonna be a sh** show no matter what? So might as well pick the person without the ultra toxic fan base. I would much rather face VP Rice over VP Harris in the 2024 primary.
There are Ignorants out there that will vote for him, especially if they get a stimulus check. I don't care what he does, I would never vote for the scumbag. Biden 2020🇺🇸

Biden is doubling down on getting the anti communist Latino vote in Florida and doesnt care about anywhere else. It’s the only reason to do this. I don’t think it’s worth tapping Latin American fascists either way, but if Biden loses Florida after this, it’s just going to be sad
I’m assuming you’re gonna vote Biden, so I’m going to just say that you are a pedophile that likes to sniff children, call all black people the same (with noticeable differences) and are corrupt. 🤷‍♂️ but hey that’s just all Biden voters right?
Unlike other candidates , Biden is using an  incredibly diverse number of gaffes In order to stifle his shot at the WH

lied about Joe Biden's comments about blacks and Latinos.  He's an ideal fact-checker for the far-left wing.  If you just don't believe ANYTHING he says, you'll probably be right.  Liberals are pathetic.
So why did Joe say that he DID SAY that?  Who's lying,  you or Joe Biden?  Since you're both far-left wing idiots - er, liberals - guess it doesn't really matter, does it?  Neither of you can be trusted or believed.

Trump says Joe Biden is “against the Bible.” But when asked what his favorite book of the Bible isTrump said “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians,” which is how the book is known by anyone who has read and actually cares about the Bible.
Trump says that Joe Biden is “against God.” Actually, Biden is a devout Catholic. Nobody is more “against God” than somebody who is incapable of telling the truth, such as Dishonest Donald Trump.

Biden Says He Would Not Stand In the Way of a Trump Prosecution if Elected
Why does Joe Biden view Black and Hispanic voters as some  resource that belongs to the Democratic Party?  Abraham Lincoln put an end to that.  We are Americans first, and Americans' votes should be earned and not assumed or taken for granted.
Because Biden has dementia
Biden is correct, in politics/voting Latinos are more diverse than African Americans. So what? It's not an insult it's a fact based on voting statistics. In our state more Asian Americans vote democrat...it's a fact. TRUMP YOU ARE STUPID!
I saw Trump’s untutored response. He did not appear to remember what was said, much less why it was problematic. It seemed like he heard Biden had said something and he should jump on the opportunity to say “Biden Bad!” then hope others will chime in to carry the conversation
I’m thinking the Democrats are up to something. We had some really good talent before Biden decided to put his name in the ring and then they choose him over Bernie....  Something doesn’t seem right.
Biden you dummy,,stfu before you fuck this shit up for all of us daaamn!
Yeah, that's called racism. You are a nice man Ari, but you are giving credit where it isn't deserved, nor earned. Biden is a racist. Especially in today's world.
Personally, I think this pick is disgusting no matter what.   But Biden better win Florida or there truly is ZERO excuse for such an explicitly evil choice.   Appointing Latin American fascists to do your outreach... what a disgrace 😤

Finally Biden and competent never belong in the same sentence. Every time he has to speak off teleprompter it's a new train-wreck. It's not even amusing anymore - your party seems cruel to run a candidate who is incapable of the task before him.
Tyler your party decided that it would upend the nation and Impeach President Trump on a false and contrived pretext. If Democrats are worried about phone calls to Ukraine, they should probably be very concerned about Hunter Biden and his relationship to Bursima.
Biden's advisors recommending that he skip the debates is like pleading the 5th. It says that something is wrong. They really believe that he can't handle the debate. And these are his supporters.
In my wildest dreams  I cannot imagine a voter saying, “Wow! That Kanye West will be my choice instead of Biden!” The opposite might happen, they might leave trump and switch to KW.
We may not all like Joe Biden, or would have preferred to see someone else like Bernie take the democratic nomination, but because he is our only option we need to vote for him. Don't let your voice be silent even when Trump tries to slow down or criticize mail in voting. VOTE.

You may well be right. But unfortunately, we have a two-party system (that masquerades as democracy, but that’s another story). So we have two choices. Looks like one choice will be President Trump and the other choice will be former VP Biden. Roll up and choose your poison.

but biden could never recruit bannon et. al. to hurt God whereas Trump hired these men (or they went to him) so he can be a blithering moron while his cronies work to steal the election.
He’s been open abt his racist, homophobic, ignorant, and misogynistic tendencies since the 70s but people still support him. Biden is also in the wrong for somethings That happened in the past, but at least he’s not as bad as trump

I don’t care if Joe Biden unlikely doesn’t have any religious beliefs. Trumps uninformed and disgusting distractions are pathetic and we should stop elevating this ignorance to be heard. A president that doesn’t have zero empathy or compassion isn’t worth hearing.
I think whatever surprise they can drum against Biden will pale in comparison to whatever fresh Hells Trump commits between now and November.
In November, we'll be rejecting Trumpism and embracing democracy again by electing Biden as president. :P

Umm, VP Biden actually goes 2 church &amp; he knows h/t hold the Bible so it’s right side up!
Nice of Mr. Bipolar to say the quiet part out loud. If anyone still votes for him after that, they weren't going to vote for Biden anyway. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Historian who called the most presidential elections predicts Biden will win. Y'all better buy the dip win the market goes down lmao
This is pretty outrageous, even by current standards, but we have to remember that Trump thinks he is "God," and so, of course, Biden is "against God."
Joe Biden is just....
Maybe sit this one out Bob, you don't have the record to chime in here. Biden's Priest does though, and he made his view clear to Biden...
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
Whatever their professed or actual sectarian affiliaiton officeholders should evince an understanding of, and express commitment to, upholding secular civil law in our constitutional republican democracy. #Election2020
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Regardless of your politics or what you think of Joe Biden, he has shown a steady commitment to and experience with making the world safer from nuclear war.   Remember that one person -- the US president -- has the absolute authority to end life on earth.
It’s obvious that Trump is getting desperate now. He’s playing the card that only Republicans are religious (wrong) and saying Biden will “Hurt God”? Now he’s claiming the cure for COVID will be available on Election Day....
Biden wants to "hurt god" if for "god" you read "Trump".
Dear God. ANY ONE of the people that have been seriously suggested for the VP slot is head &amp; shoulders above what we have now. Which is a malignant narcissist doing as much damage to the country as possible. A vote for anyone other than Biden is, effectively, a vote for Trump.
Joe Biden is not qualified to lead this party with comments like that.
If Biden were to place personal and ideological affinity at the top of his VP selection he'd pick Dianne Feinstein, who also endorsed him quite early over Kamala Harris.  now 87, is likely providing him with key input. #Biden2020 #BidenVP
Biden ruled out a Pardon for #TraitorTrump and his criminal administration back in May.
VP Biden addressed that concern back in May. You may recall, that's when the Democratic controlled House passed the latest relief bill #MoscowMitch and the #NaziGOP do-nothing Senate continue to stall as millions face eviction and starvation.
Oh so Joe Biden can hurt God?!   I guess God is old af.
Not if Biden goes down in flames. If he does, his VP ticket will be toxic before the race even starts.
Yet he still tries to nail Biden with the whole “bumbling speech”. Trump is a fucking idiot 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Biden says dumb things sometimes. If you add up every dumb thing he's ever said in his life, it's still better than one press briefing from Trump.
Unfortunately I’m not citizen so I don’t have a right to vote. I can’t agree with that an atomic bomb was “right” answer. but I really hope Biden will be the next president✨
and the system has presented us with a choice between Trump and Biden so who you gonna pick?
you're either voting for biden or trump. write-ins, &amp; "votes of conscience" are votes for 4 more years of trump, 1 or 2 of which will still be a global pandemic. "principled" votes get the country more Trump &amp; more dead Americans. that alone is moral reasoning to vote
'Are you a junkie?' | The SHOCKING decline of Joe Biden’s cognitive abil...
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail, And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal; And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword, Hath melted like snow in the glance of...Joe Biden?
Stop acting like CNN is a legitimate news resource. They literally on purpose do not cover the constant decline of Joe Biden’s mental acuity.
“Unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community" -Joe Biden
A vote for anyone but #Biden is a vote for trump  Don't make that mistake again  #Biden2020Landslide
trump is the consummate con man. Its human nature.  He promised quick, easy fixes for everything and they fell for it  I applaud them for waking up and hope they will vote for #Biden so we can fix this latest disaster created by the  (remember the mess Bush left?)
At long last, Biden will finish the work that Nietzsche started.
is losing it.  He's escalated his 'end of the America' rhetoric about #Biden and Democrats to absurd Peter Venkman levels   #TrumpIsLosing  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpFailedAmerica  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
A bug in Instagram's algorithm systemically shielded Donald Trump from negative hashtags without doing the same for rival Joe Biden, the company confirmed.
Biden, Bible, God, Guns, Energy.
Biden, Bible, Guns, God, Energy.
to come BECAUSE of election results, not in spite of them. "Wait for Biden" is exactly what they're doing. The NRA is a sidenote, the horse is long out of the barn.
rants about #Biden are just getting silly now   He sounds like my crazy grandpa who'd sit and yell nutty things at the TV all day before we had to put him in a retirement home   #TrumpIsNotWell
The only reason you want to debate is because you’re so far behind you’re losing Biden does not have to debate if he doesn’t want to , you’ve already scheduled these debates , loser
Biden: Unlike the Black community, Hispanics are an ‘incredibly diverse community’ via  #racistaf #racist
Who writes this stuff for you Biden? Wise up! #Pandering #GroperJoe
I’m not voting for Biden, but that ad is bad ass...I love classic American Muscle Cars
And that was about the time Joe Biden filibuster to try to block voting on the Equal Rights Act of 1964. Joe is the real racist.
The thing about dementia is that it exposes the real you as you progress down the road of cognitive decline. The real Joe Biden is kind of angry, mean, and corrupt.
Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden
If the DNC allows Joe Biden to debate President Trump the election will be a 40 State blow out.
What? The only person who maybe going to jail is “Mr. Money Under the Table” Biden and the rest of his arrogant friends who thought they were above the law. They definitely weaponized the intelligence agencies to take down Trump during the 2016 election.
This is what will happen when Biden debates Trump.
absolutely nobody:  not a damn soul:  Biden’s racist ass:
No, China and the democrats are with the wuhan flu/carona virus!!! A vote for Biden is a vote for China.
How were the questions posed? Biden is weak, he should step down and let the party choose someone else...not a yes man.
The top reasons why Kamala Harris MIGHT make sense for a Joe Biden VP (....
Hopefully our next birthday will be better and brighter under the leadership of President Biden.
If dementia patient Joe Biden wins in Nov the virus will miraculously “go away”, rioting will stop racism will no longer be an issue and everything will return to normal. The deep state is orchestrating this whole thing for an election.
CNN is being called out on this:  2018: CNN said it was "disturbing to the core" when host Sean Hannity joined Donald Trump at a campaign event.  2020: CNN announces contributor Ana Navarro will be hosting a roundtable for Joe Biden.
Dementia causes some ppl to turn nasty.  Appears ‘hidden Biden” is unfortunately going that direction.  Ever notice how he snaps at minorities???
