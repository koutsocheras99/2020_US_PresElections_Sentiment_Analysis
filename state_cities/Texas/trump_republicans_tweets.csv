All the polls are horse crap. Trump will be in office again.
It's not from 'our tax money' -
The 'budget' doesn't need saving.  The FED govt is the currency issuer- not like you and me.
Maybe learn about the 'debt'? It's not what you think...
President Trump is urging Americans who have survived coronavirus to help others suffering with the disease by donating plasma.
Trump is ‘completely unraveling’: Former top White House aide says ‘you can see it on his eyes’
He was in Oklahoma not wearing a mask  a while back at trump rally .
Every time Trump speaks.
The cost doesn’t matter. Trump campaign doesn’t pay its bills. Doesn’t he still owe El Paso?
The human race. Lots of choices not Trump.
Trump’s ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded — and given to The New York Times
Dufus trump doesn’t understand that there is a direct correlation between controlling the pandemic and economic recovery!! Complete idiot!!
Obama gave political speech at a funeral. What a shame. What he has done for blacks when he was president. What he is doing now in his private life for blacks. Trump has done more for blacks than Obama’s entire life. Obama, Biden, Hillary and Pelosi all worshiped KKK Robert Byrd
And its going to be a landslide .. count on it Trump...
Proud of fellow Canyon-ite &amp; Red Raider  for hosting our President  in Midland this week. Thank you for shining a light on our region, what we bring to the table, and the hard working people of #WestTexas! #FoodFiberFuel
“We want a temporary extension of enhanced unemployment benefits,” Trump said at the White House. “This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.”
Cmon, the election is 98 days away. This will be gone by Thanksgiving. But Trump will be impeached again for something right after that.
trump is a monster    We will vote him and you OUT!!😀😀
vote trump out !!
I agree. There are definitely some downsides to Trump, but I‘ve actually grown to like him more and more because he’s kept so many promises that he ran on to begin with. It feels like ‘16 all over again; it’s just glaringly obvious who the right choice is.
People need to know what is taking place... Hydroxy works, but because Trump is promoting it, the news says it will literally kill you if you take it. Because of this fake news, thousands have likely died.
High, is what she is...
Trump is a monster 😡😡
Trump is a liar 😡😡
WATCH NOW President Trump daily coronavirus update.
Ventura never had the political skills... he even grew to hate the job... I think if Trump believed the public tired of the fights and disfunction he would have reduced it a long time a go... but it's always been his way to control the narrative.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The family of a slain soldier found dead near the Texas Army base where she was stationed has taken their story directly to President Trump.
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
President Trump said Thursday that the November election should be delayed. Do you agree or disagree with the President? Let us know!
No they aren't.  If McConnell thinks he's going to lose *his own* election, he will be parroting Trump.  Watch...
Good idea? Or bad?
If McConnell thinks he's going to lose *his* election,  suddenly, suddenly, his words will mirror Trump's.   Vote them both out.
I don't know if it was a joke, but it was meant to get a reaction out of the press and the left and to push the discussion on mail-in voting. It also came on a day of economic bad news. And judging by my Twitter feed, Trump got what he wanted.
His response will 100% depend on whether he thinks he's going to lose *his* election.  He'll be all for Trump's plan if he's behind.
I’m tired of seeing these headlines. Trump isn’t going to quit. He will collude, cheat, there will be voter suppression. You name it he will attempt it. So instead of banking on him quitting just go vote for f*&amp;k sakes!
It may be a stretch to you. But Trump has always worked to distract, deflect and be the center of attention. Not one iota of a stretch to me.
I blame Trump!
The viruses were introduced , there are predictable time tables .. Given Joe Biden’s association closely with China .. it is not far fetched to put together a perfect storm to crush trump..
The news conference Trump called at the last minute was an attempt to dampen interest in Lewis' funeral. And to distract from Trump's abysmal Covid response.
Trump is a monster 😡😡
"More than 6,400 residents have died in the state’s nursing homes..."   Where's the 33,000 people number come from?  And you say CNN has no credibility? LOL.  But nice avoiding the question. One more time: what SIGNIFICANT change has Trump made?
The reports on that mistake are mixed AT BEST -  - and Cuomo has reversed said policy  What significant policy has Trump reversed, as more information on a novel coronavirus has emerged?  But nice clinging at straws.
Trump is in no way a perfect president, but this graphic is blatant ignorance. Ya, Trump has a big mouth and he has screwed up as president, but he without a doubt has taken a stronger stance on foreign policy and creating policy that benefits America than Obama ever did
Sure, use the contrast between Trump statements and reality to condemn Trump's policies. Still seems inappropriate to pretend we are now way worse off than anyone foresaw a few months ago.
He’s trying - and will fail - to step on John Lewis funeral service. Trump is a whiny toddler. Has no compassion or empathy. Willful negligence in Covid response.
With his toadies installed on the Supreme Court, yeah, I'm not all that confident that there would be *any* check on Trump doing literally *anything*  The record so far of any of our institutions managing to check a lawless president is pretty dismal
Trump's toadies in the Senate are trying to dismiss this as "a joke."   Trump is never, ever, EVER joking. He did not joke about the Muslim ban, the wall, caging babies, injecting bleach, sending troops to bust heads, etc. etc.
Dunno. Maybe he'll close the stock market as well and nationalize all companies as subsidiaries of Trump, Inc.?
Hm. And the videos showing roaming packs of thugs many blocks away from the Fed building? The ones beating veterans and moms?  Oh yeah, and then there's the thugs gassing peaceful people so Trump can hold up a bible?
I know someone who died in a car crash and their cause of death was due to injuries sustained in the crash, not COVID. Does my anecdote trump yours? Is that how this works?
Trump 2020!
Biggest drop in GDP in history. 1 person dying every minute in the US from Covid 19. 19 straight weeks of over 1 million unemployment claims. Any guess why trump wants to delay the elections?
Americans prefer not to watch our political sausage be made. We prefer a Clinton-Bush-Obama style of secretly handling pesky problems, or dispatchin official talking points. Mr. Trump enjoys publicly making sausage. And November will likely prove a national fatigue in watching it
Trump wants to open the schools up because it's safe... but delay the election because it's unsafe.   I hate it here.
ah yes, elections that Trump loses in a landslide must be INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT
You want a thousand more?  Pretty sure you wouldn't read any of them,  listen to any Republicans that agree,  listen to anyone outside of your media bubble.  If you want to step out of the cult of Trump there's redemption, but you have to take the first step...
Russian collusion hoax investigation by muller, fabricated intel to warrant illegal spying on Trump, and General Flynn all provable facts, Corrupt FBI caught in the act, I would say the same thing . The lefts corruption cannot be trusted..
And yet, if a Supreme Court packed with Trump toadies upholds it, what then?
I’d like to see one of trump tell where to find the video of Trump saying the virus is a hoax.. I’ll be waiting
... Right up to the point where it isn’t  When you let him get away with using foreign aid to Ukraine as a blackmail tool to try to rig the election, where did you think Trump would stop?  When you dismissed open corruption and incompetence, did you think he’d learned his lesson?
Imagine being  smiling when Trump acknowledged him as if he’s part of the cool kids table in middle school. Honey,  doesn’t care about you. He never will. It’s time to find new friends and actually speak for Texan interests.
You must have been living under a rock- please inform yourself-
I’m so over 2020. Herman Cain dies from COVID 19 and Trump wants to push the election out further because of mail in votes. Smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
When your entire political philosophy boils down to “Whatefer Trump says, I agree with!” I don’t think actual labels apply any longer.
What? Trump didn't offer the hydraquisine? Didn't send them  bleach?
Next up: “Trump has never once ordered his mercenaries to open fire on crowds of starving women and children.”
Pandemic Preparedness in the Next Administration: Keynote Address by Ant...  via  Within the first 5 minutes, Dr Fauci states that Trump will face a sudden Pandemic!
Dear  - What rationalizations will you now make to retcon this? What Fox talking point will you parrot now?  Or will you continue to ignore the clear evidence?  Will you cheer when Trump’s savage mercenaries shoot Americans in the face when they try to vote?
Enter this into an addendum category to the near-constant Trump “there is always a Tweet” stream of deadly irony
Trump has been a grifter his entire life.  Biden sucks on money stuff, no doubt.  He's not pro-abortion up to 9 months.  No one is 'pro-abortion'. There are certain rare cases where the mother's life may be in danger where exceptions are made.  ...
Trump doesn't feel guilt. That is an emotion that's foreign to him.
The word “legally” is doing a lot of work there, especially when you consider Trump’s violent mercenaries beating and gassing Americans in the streets for trying to exercise their rights
This didn’t age well.
There’s stupidity. Then there’s Donald trump.
Do you think Trump is pulling the “delay the election” card to A) use the pushback as ammo for opening schools on time B) hide the 32.9% Q2 GDP contraction (which has NEVER been over 10%)
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Well.... I feel for his family, but dammit, he let trump kill him.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress.
Trump’s musing about delaying the election because... -GDP dropped 33%. -Unemployment numbers rising again. -They have no relief package. -Maxwell indictment dropping. -Grand jury’s getting his taxes. -He’s a traitor. Let’s stay focused.
LOVE Trump ❤️
stopped flights to USA from China in January. Hillary, Nancy &amp; Chuck made fun of Trump for stopping them. But, Hillary would have 'done something'? She DID do something - made fun of what later proved to be the right decision.
The GDP dropped 33%. Let’s focus on that. Trump doesn’t have the power to delay an election. This news source knows that. This is nothing but a distraction. Do better, media.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Political loyalty is going to cost people their lives. If you are of African descent, a professor or admin, Republican, and voted for Trump please love your students enough to protect them if you teach F2F in the fall. WEAR A MASK!  #AcademicTwitter #BlackInTheIvory
Trump will still tout Q3 as the greatest recovery in history and the gullible will eat it up.
You know it's going to be better in the third quarter right before the election and Trump will convince the gullible that it's the greatest recovery in history...
When all is said and done... a few years down the road... the biggest stories from this time will be the audacity and breadth of treason committed by trump and the GOP, the massive amounts of money they stole from us, and the 100’s off thousands of unnecessary deaths they caused.
That’s exactly right. In fact this has been the message of the Republican Party for decades. Trump’s just the first in a very long time to say it plainly... and they’re going to find that the part of the base that wants to be openly racist isn’t as big as they thought.
More Americans have died from Covid19 than Persian Gulf War (91), Iraq War, 9-11, and Vietnam War combined!! Fuck trump!!
Want to flip Texas blue and make Trump a one-term president?   Join fellow Democrats and make calls into Lubbock!
She doesn’t want to see Trump announce her successor...she will die in office ..
Dr. Fauci knows what he’s doing!! trump shut the fuck up!!
Just like that trump is right back in this race. Buckle up we got a looooooooooong 96 days ahead of us.
President Trump signed 4 pipeline permits that will, in part, allow Texas to export crude oil to Mexico.
So Trump wants to build a wall to keep out drugs, illegals, rapists, criminals, murders =😡CHOP builds a wall/ to hide all the above=😁Feds put fence up to protect property from ⬆️=🤬🙈#Trump2020
Trump just touched down here in my small west Texas town of Midland. You should see all the people that pulled over on the highway to watch... This isn’t the first time Air Force one has been here. This is the Bush family’s home town.
Save America,Trump 2020
Republican Voters Against Trump Face Masks! This is awesome! #NobodyLikesTrump
Trump is a racist....plain and simple.
Trump has more rape cases against him and the stuff on Biden turned out to be false. And whose name did epstein have in the book? Hmmmm not Biden but Trump...trumps even admitted liking young girls. Back your stuff up with some facts...
Trump isnt an American patriot. He is a Russian Patriot! 150,000 AMERICANS dead cause he is an idiot. He is pushing a pill that doesnt help covid19 patients but it sure is filling the Trump bank accounts. How can 1 even think trump is patriotic with what he done to Ameicans?
trump is a monster 😡😡
Why would Trump winning be more likely to produce a Tom Cotton?  Remember, John Kasich wasn't the runner up to Trump.  That would be Ted Cruz.  The more competent fascist will be waiting in the wings regardless of who wins this year IMO.
Trump signed pipeline permits while in Midland. Here is an IMAGE SLIDESHOW of his visit to a West Texas oil producer.
Can’t believe Trump is in West Texas 😂 can only imagine that crowd 😅😂
trump is a monster 😡😡
Trump is a monster 😡😡
If you want to deal with Trump using your song, write new anti-Trump or BLM lyrics.  Once the song gets into circulation it might have his followers hearing different words...
trump is a monster 😡😡
Trump is a monster 😡😡
trump is a monster 😡😡
trump is a monster 😡😡
trump still won’t attack Putin on putting Bounties on Americans soldiers!! Clearly a Russian puppet as Hillary noted!!
The death toll from the coronavirus in the U.S. hit 150,000 on Wednesday, by the far the highest in the world, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Brazil was second with over 88,000 deaths, followed by Britain at about 46,000.
Thank you President Trump for visiting West Texas❣️🇺🇸❤️🤍💙🇺🇸 #Trump2020
To be absolutely clear!!! Black Lives Matter!! To all trump supporters who is backed by the KKK and Nazis... fuck you!!!
Trump delivers remarks, signs executive orders on lowering drug prices  via
Trump was publicly critical of his GOP allies over the $1.7 billion for FBI headquarters that’s included in the bill, but which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later said he opposes as not related to virus relief.
Trump refuses to autograph Dan Patrick’s mask
It's all projection. Trump thinks that everyone he needs to like him is, well, like him  That is: irredeemably racist and a garbage person  Thus, he crafts his policies to appeal to such people  Our national shame is that such policies are often popular
Oh, this is going to drive Trump batshit crazy with envy  He may knife Mitch McConnell just so he can try to one-up Obama
Trump is an extreme case, but the degree to which Americans defer to the wealthy creates monsters who are convinced of their own genius &amp; superiority because everyone bows &amp; scrapes to them  Many running around the movie industry, for example
really curious what you have to say about Trump ending the AFFH.
really curious what you have to say about Trump ending the AFFH.
I’m sorry, but the price oil has bottomed out since Trump took office. How is that good for the oil industry? The jobs disappeared, too. How has he helped Texas? What’s that you say? It hasn’t.
I think it more likely that the longer things stay shut down,  less possible it is for Trump to be able to pretend that Everything Is Awesome (now vote for me!)  They may have a malignant plan, but truly, after 4 yrs of utter incompetence, I doubt their ability to wipe themselves
And before January 21, 2021, Trump will go lower, lower, lower still...we underestimate his ability to do evil brand of damage to people and our country's institutions.
Love that Trump and Arrington nor the military guys have on masks!!
HOUSTON (AP) — Weeks after it was criticized by President Trump as “done to make me look bad,” a private border wall built by supporters in South Texas has suffered new erosion in a weekend tropical storm that was the project's first major weather test.
Trump is really in Midland, Tx calling Corona Virus the “China virus”.😑

Icallyouatraitor...trump as literally killed Americans and injured Americans and now he wants us to believe some quack who thinks demons and witches impregnate people.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require mandatory drug testing for some food stamp recipients.
would be a great time to mention how blatantly racist it was for Trump to end AFFH.
Donald J Trump has appointed a new campaign manager, he believes she's a genius and continued to show his support for her. Congrats Donnie Dotard!
Really? And trump and pence are promoting a doctor who believes demons and witches impregnate people while they are dreaming. Land of the free? Sending federal agents to hurt non violent protesters doesnt seem like the land of the free to me
How cool is this?!  The United States Secret Service and  asked our very own Lubbock Motorcycle Squad to assist with the Presidential motorcade!  Early this morning, our officers headed out to Midland to help escort President Trump from the airport to Odessa!
He's actually worried that people will learn about modern monetary theory. (MMT)
Representative Louie Ghomert was banned earlier today from boarding Air Force One and flying to Midland, Texas, with President Trump.  Ghomert apparently tested positive to COVID-19 before boarding Air Force One.
Y’all better keep trump away from them taco trucks in midland he’ll have the runs all day lmao 😂
President Trump is in West Texas today to show support for energy producers. Check out this image slideshow.
A person of color as nutty and damaged as barr would never have gotten so much authority.
Mona is ALMOST there. So close.   Drill down past Trump, and what you find is the entire right-wing lie machine that deludes conservatives, feeds them fantasies, and ignores or exonerates criminals and corruption  That is the true face of the enemy.
why is trump in midland ?
I’ll be voting in person. Trump has corrupted the postal service.

*One* thing I like better.  I don't want to see Biden at any correspondents' dinners.  There's no reason to be so chummy with people that are supposed to be holding you accountable. One thing Trump did right IMO.
I would love for Trump to hide and not say anything. Dream come true...
President Trump on the ground in Midland, Texas today.  Photo:  Jason Davis    #trump #potus #midland
So alot of my mutuals that have been quite about politics are now suddenly supporting trump because he is in Odessa.. yonkers thats a rough one 🥴
Give an example comparing hillary Clinton uranium dirty deal to Donald trump.. I’ll be waiting for an example..a real example. I’ll be waiting..
(and that’s not say Trump changed anything for those voters, because he hasn’t)
All the bribe money didn’t work and Mitch’s puppeteers are worried the dollar might deflate if we load in more debt, so what does Trump have left?  Doing his job?  Nah.
President Trump has landed in Midland. Follow  throughout the day on The President’s Texas visit. #TrumpinTexas
One wonders what October will bring, as Trump grows increasingly desperate and deranged  Rallies with a live flounder strapped to his head? Eviscerating sheep to read their entrails for a cure?
“No riff raff will be moving into the neighborhood on my watch”.  Trump now proudly flying his racist flags.
I do have the magazines nearby just in case I need it for home protection. I wish people wouldn’t assume that I’m some gun crazy lunatic that supports the blonde apricot in office. Trust me, I hate trump and I don’t plan to become a gun crazy lunatic.
They think cause trump doesn’t they have to side with him ?? He’ll this diease this virus don’t give a dam who you are it’ll get you like it did me ! Cover up and wear gloves always and keep 10 feet away. It’s in the air
He's still wrong about the debt-
Yeah,  Stevens is still wrong about the debt-
Except he's still wrong about the debt-
The latest polls show Texas is a toss up between Trump and Biden. Do you think Trump's visit to Midland will shore up Texas support?
Trump is a trojan horse for Russia. Let’s talk about it.
So pence was making the deal while trump was giving the interview. Or made the deal without trumps knowledge or approval. Either way pence is in for one hell of a day
U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, has tested positive for the #coronavirus. He was was one of several Texas officials scheduled to fly to West Texas this afternoon with President Trump.
Trump is a #TrojanHorseForRussia ... pass it on.
I’m not sure “the country is devolving into chaos” is a great image for the incumbent, but then Trump is that stupid.
Trump is combining some fundraising Wednesday with his first trip to an oil and gas rig and to his first visit as president to the Permian Basin.
Follow Mitch for more on President Trump's visit to Midland today.
Is Trump throwing the election?  You have to wonder at this point.
“Nobody likes me” will be the most honest thing trump has or will say during his presidency. Also it’s my favorite quote of his
Sounds about right coming from an old white man/trump supporter..  I'll be back to get those handpays  when y'all open. You guys should ban this racist trash from y'all's casino also. Pure filth #BLM
Stephen... surely you know by now you can’t tell a Trump voter anything! The fact is, they don’t care. Period!
trump really is a childish insecure immature narcissistic attention grabbing pussy Bitch!!
We have seen countless federal agencies bend to Trump’s will—despite the fact they have to dishonor themselves and betray their duty to the Constitution in order to do so—and there’s literally no reason to think these agencies are going to suddenly find a spine in January.
If 77% of voters trust CDC &amp; 23% trust the Trump administration, then 100% of voters trust.... The Trump Administration
And if there are Trump loyalists within the leadership of the Secret Service and military, what makes anyone think they will put their duty to the Constitution above that loyalty?
Trump is combining some fundraising Wednesday with his first trip to an oil and gas rig and to his first visit as president to the Permian Basin.
If Trump begins making hay about how the election was stolen—a possibility that grows ever-more-likely when you consider it will probably be several weeks between Election Day and when the results are finalized, given the pandemic—the Republican establishment will fall in line.
The thrust of these “Relax, everyone” articles is that the Republican political and media establishment will see the writing on the wall if Trump loses, and so will pressure him to give up the White House. Umm... what fucking planet have these journalists been living on?
The Trump administration is dismantling DACA. We've had ENOUGH.   Send your senator a letter demanding they defund ICE &amp; pass permanent solutions without hurting people by supporting HR6, the Dream and Promise Act. Join the fight with
The Constitutional lawyer in me needs everyone to understand that our system literally buckles in the face of someone like Trump—someone who disregards norms and traditions, and who possesses almost no regard for his fellow Americans or the American ideal.
I have been reading a lot of articles that basically say “Relax, everyone: Trump can’t refuse to leave office if he loses.” These takes are universally naive, and show a real lack of understanding of just how much Trump has been able to get away with by simply ignoring norms.
Trump can never admit he was wrong, even about rambling off the cuff. These fucks can also never admit Trump was wrong or that they were wrong about Trump.
Twenty-two Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee fired back with a letter to Trump saying a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe’s defense would encourage Russian aggression and opportunism.

Bernell ‘Ras’ Trammell, 59, was often seen wielding large, handwritten signs with his personal beliefs in big, bold letters. These signs supported George Floyd, police reform and President Donald Trump.
#TuckerCarlson Im glad to finally see news that isn't propagated with anti Donald Trump to its entirety. I know so many ppl who are neutral &amp; don't do politics and they are baffled by the fact they propagate this way in a crisis. And discredit everything pro trump. It's insanity
☀️WATCH DAYBREAK TODAY☀️ 105 new cases of COVID confirmed in Lubbock, LISD outlines health priorities, Trump to visit Midland today
If you distance from Trump you will be GONE!!!!!!
The media is pumping out anti trump on all their platforms. All the anger and hate was propagated and believed without question. I feel sorry for you Sheeple. I work at a cemetery and bury covid victims everyday and I can tell you almost all were imuno compromised.
Freethinking, beloved Republican who promised in 1996 to serve two terms. Trump's Stooge McDuck.
Awh hell yea white people are literally out here calling doctor Anthony Fauci a fraud because he isn’t saying what trump wants him to say. I think it’s gonna be a lot harder to control all of this in the fall because not only will people be catching the flu but
President Trump is in West Texas today, and what's up with those mystery seeds, reportedly from China.
it was the trump crop top for me 😭
Sounds to me like he’s saying russia(trump) is planning to print millions of fraudulent ballots. But I’m just an alarmist.
I figured that a lot of them were people who had no stakes in the election.  It doesn't make sense why somebody who has to live in this country would allow the possibility of Trump over something as trivial as the difference between M4A and Biden's health care plan.
Yep, Trump screwed up the COVID response and Pelosi sat and watched him burn and ultimately over 200k will die to help ensure they win the Whitehouse in 2020.
Not a Trump fan.. independent... kool-aid drinkers on both sides need to sit down, shut up, and let the only Adults left decide this election. Go watch your Hanity/Rachel Meddow reruns!
What does Schultz on Hogan’s hero’s and Trump have in common?  "I see nothing! I hear nothing! I know nothing!"  What is the difference between Epstein and Trump? Epstein never raped  ! ✌🏻😱
Come on...  I know you despise trump. This was the most one sided impeachment and trial in US history. Admit both sides were partisan as hell.
I’m just curious how Trump is gonna handle west texas heat.. let alone when he visits the oil company. Like is he gonna actually be outside when visiting the oil company or is he gonna be inside his vehicle in the AC? 🤨🥴
He looks up to Trump
Such incredible powers of observation has only been seen in Charles Darwin before.  Trump might be a certain kind of genius after all...  Loved the poll results though. Tony Fauci deserves it to the fullest.
And you think That makes me a Trump colt member?😂😂 your not so simple sam.
How is it that all the anti -vax , anti-mask, YouTube conspiracy theory people are all of a sudden becoming trump supporters ?? 🤔🤔. Maybe this was all apart of trumps plan. I mean A couple months ago you were bumpin some immortal technique. Now creedance Clearwater. Weird
A thing I've noticed on this site is that everybody spends more time talking themselves into why Trump might come back for no particular reason and very little time talking about the possibility that Biden's lead may get larger.
Democrats say this visit won't help Trump's chances in the state come November, but Republicans say Texas is still a deeply red state. What do you think?
Trump walks out of briefing after CNN question
#Trump #Covid19 death toll tops 150K. And still more lies everyday. Dump #delusionalDonnie
It seems that Seattle is not reacting well to Trump sending in the storm troopers.
yeah I think this is the key point.  The legal ways to “rig” the election might be worth 1-2% of the vote.  Fixing an election that Trump is losing by 15% involves crossing a line into stuff that leads to jail time if caught.
Trump is dumb as a stump? But folks he always has been. The man is a loser, if his daddy wouldn’t have given him millions the guy would have been a homeless person.
Trump shared on Twitter that went viral across social media platforms that claimed hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Don’t be a fool. Is this the guy you love:   Trump shared on Twitter that went viral across social media platforms that claimed hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Trump shared on Twitter that went viral across social media platforms that claimed hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Never has the world set the bar so low for a POTUS:  Trump shared on Twitter that went viral across social media platforms that claimed hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus. Dense Donny!!!
Explain this CRAZY ASS LOU: Trump shared on Twitter that went viral across social media platforms that claimed hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus. IS THE BAR SET SO LOW, A POTUS CAN INDORSE CRAP LIKE THIS?
Their angle is that they are going to cheat to win the Whitehouse, and Trump will find out.
We all knew that trump and mnuchin had an agenda that wasn't in the  nation's interest.
the senate republicans have no interest in helping working people, only covering trump's incompetence.
While I do wish Trump had more of a sense of decorum, I'm glad he doesn't give our money away to people that are full of shit. The notion that people believe diplomats are pillars of morality is bonkers to me. Same people that probably give a trophy to every team, first to last.
Trump has destroyed America 😡
“Faithless electors are going to save the Republic” and “Trump refusing to accept the election results carries any legal weight” are somehow believed by some of the same people.
Watch now
We’re gonna have to do it over.
A thought I just had: I am more concerned about the possibility of Trump dropping out in October than I am about the possibility of Trump refusing to accept the results.
President Trump recently announced the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida was cancelled, saying “it’s just not the right time for that” due to coronavirus concerns.
The reason why peaceful transfer of power breaks down is because a significant portion of people in power don’t accept the legitimacy of the election results.  Like it’s a problem if the military has Trump’s back on this, but not just if Trump is screaming into the void.
It doesn’t matter whether Trump accepts the results; what matters is whether the American people (and here I’m specifically excluding Trump dead-enders) accept the results.
Trump has destroyed America 😡😡😡
Tie ..both can’t think well due to the lack of circulation to the brain having their heads stuck up Trump’s Ass. Lindsey is up there too. The great “Up the Ass Trifecta”! 😂🥴🤷🏼‍♀️
Trump will destroy America 😡
Trump has destroyed America 😡
I am an older woman &amp; I have seen many a fair politican a few even great, some pretty bad ones, a few really bad ones but only one I could dub evil! I hate that I am living in the Time of Trump which I perceive too to be unredeemable. My days simply run together as I wait for Nov
This is exactly why I think publicly pushing the “Trump will steal the election” stuff is dumb.  It gives people an excuse to not vote if they think the game is rigged.  (Same with Bernie, actually.)
CHICAGO (AP) — Twitter has temporarily halted President Donald Trump’s son from tweeting on its site after he shared a video riddled with unsupported claims about the coronavirus Monday.
you lost me when sis had the trump crop top on
So much irony coming from someone who wants so badly to be Trump’s lapdog. Not even good enough for that. What a worthless rep. Can’t wait to vote against you in 98 days.
This weekend I visited a blue state next to Texas for a weekend vacation. I won't say which state but it rhymes with blue texico. Never saw a Democrat sign anywhere. Saw Trump signs. Saw plenty of California license plates headed east loaded with furniture.
Here’s how Trump’s opposition to voting by mail hurts the GOP
The administration will deny new applications for “Dreamer” immigrants and cut renewals to one year from two years.
Don’t believe everything (anything) Breitbart puts out there y’all. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Two words-Donald Trump
Two words-Donald Trump!
Cohn was portrayed in the HBO show 'Angels in America.' In the movie he said he wasn't gay, only that he had sex with men. Also in the movie: when dying of AIDS, made his doctor write in his medical file that it was liver cancer. When Trump learned Cohn had AIDS, deserted Cohn.
I mean how is Trump going to attack Kamala for putting people in jail?
Barr is building precedent for “you can’t send former President Trump to jail. He’s too old!”
Building precedent for “you can’t send former President Trump to jail. He’s too old!”
They're afraid of the delicate sensibilities of reactionaries.   And too tired to be ready to continually fight the lies. It's sad that Trump might lose *only* because 1000's of people are dead and millions have lost their jobs.
It's hard to watch bernie videos now. Knowing he won't be president. I mean trump or biden is the best we got? Jesus that's depressing.
Peter Strzok believes that President Trump is Russian asset. Here are the details on the upcoming release of his new book.
If you want the reason to reelect Donald Trump and a landslide of Republicans in the 2020 General Election, listen to the opening speeches of both Jim Jordan and Attorney General Barr.  Our Liberty will be restored.
And this is who Trump trusts more than Fauci?   No doubt she's already been offered her own show on Fox to spread lunacy &amp; lies about a malevolent alien takeover ...   Hmm. On second thought, THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING!!
Well, TBF Trump's preferred source for medical knowledge might not be entirely wrong about the gov't being run by reptilians and aliens   Right, Stephen Miller?
Well, Lookee Here: Trump's Base (some of them) Starting to Wake Up
In their thirst to stick it to Trump, Pelosi was taking tours through SF China town in late February... actually had a house committee pass a bill in mid February to prevent him from restricting travel from China or anywhere over Covid. Trump under-reacted, but Pelosi was AWOL.
With Covid.. listen to Fauci.. end of February was saying this was not a big deal... Trump did listen to them... they were wrong... arguably due to misinformation from the Chinese... but now they have big credibility issues with him... big suprise.
The constitution creates elections to remove deeply hated presidents... impeachment is for removing those who commit High Crimes and Misdemeanors... and I will happily compare the crimes of Obama over Trump...
She is prioritizing taking the Whitehouse in November over saving peoples lives... deliberately staying at arms length... letting Trump go down in his own self inflicted flames... it's the most callous thing I have seen in politics.
“Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump” is due out Sept. 8, publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books &amp; Media said in a statement to The Associated Press.
You messed up, you lost the Hispanic and Latino vote. You excluded me and my children for help. You lost my vote this time around. BY TRUMP!! 👋👋👋
I FUCKING CALLED IT
Biden has his gaffes, but I would want to debate Trump for an hour if I were him...Trump isn’t going to follow Biden around the stage like he did Hillary and he’s still - even after 4 years - way in over his head on topics, won’t study, etc.
Bernell Trammell: Black Trump Supporter Shot in Milwaukee |
Drugmakers refuse to attend White House meeting after Trump issues executive orders on costs
What's with the Trump tweet that is no longer available
I generally think not giving Trump free campaign attacks is a good strategy.
It’s nauseating. They knew in a couple months there was no collusion. Now, it became clear Trymps campaign was run by idiots as well. But, a coordinated conspiracy? Come on. Trump’s Campaign could barely tie their shoes.
He was trump squared. How do people not see that... take every bad thing about trump.  Square it.  Philandering, sexually assaults, tax fraud, bribery. Except the was charming and a Democrat where it’s ok to be misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and a crook.
let me just point out that Trump has 20% approval in Melania’s homeland
That looks like Trump 🤣
Cuomo: White House can't contain the virus within its own walls
Johnson earned over $40m in FTC Bribes through KLJB Radio... his fixing of the 1950 senate race was the stuff of legends... makes Trump look like an amateur
“Conservative insurgency against the Trump candidate” is a new one.
Everything u see of Trump is displayed to u by the media who is clearly pushing for a one sides narrative. u can wake up from a coma and watch 6 months of news and see its a Trump bash on every channel and its all one sided.. There's been a virus every election year.

Check out teens for trump's video! #TikTok
Landslide trump wins your polls are full of shit ..life long Democrat here.. never again.. voting trump again .. count on it
Gaslighting is pretending both the Democrats and Republicans didn't screw this up royally. At a time we needed them to work together, they used this as a way to attack each other... and 200K people will pay the price. Trump is not by any means blameless.
Drink the Kool-aid some more... maybe you can believe Biden really wasn't a racist homophobe in the 80s... seriously.
She is not a coward.. I actually used to respect her... but she saw Covid as a chance to let Trump flounder and swing the election... and who cared about the 200K that will die.
Trump senate trial February 6th. CDC issues first Covid alert January 6th.. First Senate hearing January 23... no press attend due to Impeachment deadlines that day.
Trump Is The Black Swan
Read the timetable.. Trump not the only one in the administration...
Biden will eradicate it but Trump will make it a new super strand
If Biden wins: the day after Election Day.   If Trump wins: the day after Election Day 2024
Do you people seriously not see the propaganda campaign let by the media. You guys are brainwashed into believing the billions of anti trump BS they say every other word. Even with a negative view of the man it's obvious he cant be controlled. Biden in the epitome of a puppet.
He’s a petty human and Lewis would probably care less if Trump was there.
That's why we love Trump

Steve Munisteri on  w/ discussing  abbott ratings, difficulties facing  in the upcoming general election, and GOP figures expected to run in 2024. [AUDIO]
I mean, I guess this depends on what you think of Trump, someone who has probably paid for an abortion at some point.
If Biden wins, we won’t have this issue much longer after election. If Trump wins... well, we will hear of this for even longer.
Fred Trump didn't teach his boy very well, did he?
Its too important for Pelosi to wash her hands of this. Trump may run the administration, but she has a major role... And for the record... Bengazi and the email server were baseless political theater. So was Ukraine. Bounties a joke.Trump? I'd vote for a good Dem alt - not Biden
WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump has announced plans to redo the White House Rose Garden to make it more in line with the original design implemented during the 1960s Kennedy administration.
Wonder if he's gonna vote for tRump again
No I don't deny that... Trump has spent more than Obama and is set to outpace him with spending by far. Congress does write laws and obama legislated from office but so has Trump. Youre making my points love.
Melania Trump on Monday announced details of a plan already under way to spruce up the White House Rose Garden, the iconic outdoor space famous for its proximity to the Oval Office.
Trump seeks political shot in the arm in vaccine push
I read Reuters and for opinion go to Reason. Do you somehow deny the fact he has created more debt than any president ever? You can literally see the numbers... Europe, our closest allies openly mock Trump. Do you deny he has done nothing to support Hong Kong... cause show me Lol
I'm no Trump fanatic... and yes, seriously believe this. Besides, do you think Trump would first admit this was out of control in order to blame Pelosi for part of it? Come on.
im sorry, why didn’t trump go to John Lewis’ funeral????????
President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has tested positive for the coronavirus — making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.
trump is synonymous with the KKK!!
The guy in the picture scrubbed his website of all references to Trump, lol.
So trump refuses to pay respect to Civil Rights Icon and Congressman John Lewis!! Because it would insult his KKK base!! Fuck trump you racist fuck!!
The easiest way for Trump to get re-elected is tto cut the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $2.13, plus tips. White, male, non college educated voters would flock to Trump for saving them so much income tax!  And Trump and his fellow Republican fat cats would change to victory!
this whole conversation started with me saying I’ve been watching streams on periscope, you’re being obtuse   anyway yeah you don’t know anything about me and my friends in pdx all say fuck trump so have a good week and stay safe from all the terrorists out to get you! ❤️
Trump is a monster 😡
Trump is a monster 😡
Trump is a monster 😡
Trump is a monster 😡
Trump is a liar 😡
Trump will destroy America 😡
Was there more than this tweet? If not, he merely stated a fact. Trump is, in fact, the president. The sky is blue and grass is green. This is completely asinine.
Then again, there are days when I wonder if we’re even going to have an election this year.   Trump may just unleash his stormtroopers to gas and shoot anyone who tries to vote against him  Are we just rearranging deck chairs at this point?
Thanks. I’ll take a look at it. My opinions were mostly formed by watching her grill mendacious Trump toadies in hearings   Earned her the label of “nasty” from Cheetolini
Gee, give me a break. Half of the country thinks Clinton did it and the other half think Trump did it. I'm asking you what gave you the impression, not me. I've looked into some of these (some I've never heard of) and the more I dig, I find that the media skewed their coverage
Counterpoint: do Benghazi news cycles make Trump look good?
Trump basically said fuck your civil rights movement. I would say I’m surprised .. but naw 2020 is a nightmare
yeah, and like, I’m not sure why giving Trump an out to make the election a choice between Trump’s idiocy and outright socialism is a great idea
Figures that Trump built a wall around the public White House. #NeverTrump   This madness gets worse each day.
And like if you have a debate on foreign policy, what exactly would make anyone think that this helps Trump?
Yes... and Trump propagated and encouraged that same division. Just because a former president was bad doesn't mean the current one isn't.
President Donald Trump on Monday welcomed a Marine veteran to the White House as he completed his 300-mile walk to the nation's capital to raise awareness about the problem of veteran suicide.
Fauci: Some messages from Trump's task force don’t match reports from 'trenches' -  News The experts or people connected to Trump. Hard to know who to believe.   Please don’t take that last comment seriously. *Sigh*
Lewis believed trump was a illegitimate president....
Trump literally gives his presidential paycheck back to the government to fund various departments.
Yes we are, and we will make sure every last person is registered and ready to vote out trump, cornyn, and Texas Republicans. We’re flipping Texas y’all. #PoweredXPeople
Yeah, umm this should probably be deleted along with the firing of the campaign fundraiser and the social media director. Not a good look to attack a TRUMP SUPPORTER.
The senate brought attention to the issue... Trump even said it was what drove him to restrict travel from China.. saved thousands of lives... The House punted for a full month to even hold a hearing... Democrats in the Senate certainly did not try to keep this secret.
The party that nominated Trump just isn’t nominating Charlie Baker.  This is complete nonsense.  I’m not even sure they would nominate Nikki Haley.
Both came be true... Trump admin under-responded and Pelosi did nothing to help until it was far too late, and even impeded the process by distracting the press and congress at a critical time. Lots of blame to go around.
The comparison is EXTREMELY telling. Does Jodey Arrington subscribe to Texas values OR Washington values? Look at his words and actions. No meetings with constituents, only support of Trump. He's got to go!
Everyone thinks voting trump out will end end thisFascism, bit in reality Joe Biden had a heavy hand in creating the current police state, and I refuse to let covert Fascism back into our lives #Bernieorbust
I am not a fan of Joe Biden, and normally would vote Green or Socialist. But this is so important that I will vote Biden this November: How the global #climate fight could be lost if Trump is re-elected #ClimateChange
Even if it was all true and much was it was SOP for every administration. Show me a president that didn't use foreign policy to get elected. My god, Obama actually sicked the FBI on the opposition presidential campaign based on a known false premise. What Trump did was trivial.
Because he actually committed crimes and lost the support of the Republicans. There were no crimes committed with Trump... even the Democratic House Managers admitted that... said it could be just about a nebulous abuse of office. Both sides knew it was a baseless political hit.
Covid became the primary political football to defeat Trump in February... Anything Trump was for, she was against. Country first! The Strategy - create divisions, attack the administration, blame them for the chaos... and wash your hands of responsibility.
melania trump is as useless as donald, donald jr., eric and lvanka put together.
Texans love Trump!!!!!!
Thank donald trump
And certainly not unprecedented as the papers say, Johnson did the same thing to Nixon ... pulled Laos into digging up dirt to undermine his candidacy against Hum pries. Johnson did so much worse compared to trump.
An entire political party has been driven batshit crazy, by consuming an endless diet of lies, conspiracy theories, and white racist grievance theater, and the  just can’t seem to process this  Denial of reality as strong as Trump’s denial of Covid, really.
trump is a monster 😡😡
Trump's national security adviser tests positive for Covid-19
Here's my question: how in the world has Trump not caught it yet?
Trump is a terrorist and the Republican Party is a terrorist organization:
Check out Boris Trump 45's video! #TikTok
Deep-pocketed and often anonymous donors are pouring over $100 million into an intensifying dispute about whether it should be easier to vote by mail, a fight that could determine President Donald Trump’s fate in the November election.
Of course Baron Trump will not have to worry about his private school not opening for school. And djt can afford private tutors and whatever his little heart desires.
He and tRump cut out of same cloth
Right wingers and trump supporters have one approach, Lie and Cheat !!!
The Trump of the Democratic party... loud, mean and clueless. God help us... she will be president one day.
Had she been the nominee, and picked a young (non AOC) progressive... she would have won hands down... with Biden on the top of the ticket... Trump better win this or god help us.
Get them out of there. Quit being Trump’s GMan, America is smarter than this.
When will the LameStream Media,   etc, actually investigate the fact that Obama, Biden and their staff speed on Trump during his Campaign and after he was Elected President? Are LameStream Media scared of the TRUTH? Who’s paying LameStream Media not to investigate
Trump tweeted Sunday that he won’t be able to make the trip because of his “strong focus” on the coronavirus, vaccines and the economy.
If you were a trump supporter you’d have no brain for complex thinking like that.
You know, if they wanted independents... Kamala Harris.. she was the most interesting of them all. Strong on crime, tough demeanor but likable... she may be VP I hear... but its just not the same. I would have hands down voted for her over Trump.
But its why I don't trust anyone anymore when it comes to Trump.
Add to that a nearly bankrupt news industry needing to generate clicks to survive... they all conspired to push this lie. It certainly wasn't hard... its easy to hate Trump.
Got into a guy one time who insisted Hunter S. would have absolutely loved Trump.
Oh, Trump lies... a lot... all politicians do. But its like The NY Times said.. its unique times and the previous standards don't apply to Trump. Hence, before I believe it (and I have no delusions he is a saint), I need to know peoples motivations.
Puto’s can’t throw pitches. They just abused other puto’s.   Trump’s technically a Puto Sien Verga.   Don’t know what that is? You don’t live in Texas.
This mentality is why Trump’s admin and his “platform” exist and can do whatever they want. These people are stupid enough to put us in the position of losing all our freedom and they won’t notice until they’re dying and won’t have to deal with it :)
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will shift his focus to American energy dominance during a stop in Texas later this week that will include his first visit to an oil rig.
I just wish that if there was anything the last 3.5 years taught us was that with so many people willing to lie to take him down... FBI officials, newspapers, House chairs... you have to vet the motivations of the source. Trump is nasty... and hatred makes people Machiavellian.
Yes that’s trump’s wall. Blown over by a simple tropical storm.
This is the perfect metaphor. Everything trump did will crumble in the wind. We are the wind.
You forgot to mention that Omar Navarro has stalked an ex GF and violated his restraining order. But “agree with him on everything” is a little strange.  Btw, so glad I get to watch rugby with fans, wish Trump would’ve had a more stern effort to stop the Trump Virus.
AP: President Donald Trump won’t be throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after all.
So ... how soon until we find out that Trump pocketed BILLIONS in kickbacks and bribes, built a shitty wall that a stiff breeze can knock over, and is now demanding more $$ to do it all over again?
Because you can bet your asses all of the Trump-y boomers and gen x’ers are going to make sure to go out in full force for Trump. And I can NOT endure another 4 years
Imagine going into a coma January, 2020 and waking up today. Kobe Bryant dead, the NBA playing in a bubble, people wearing masks, Trump talking daily about the radical left Democrats, Kanye west running for president, oh and Regis Kelly dead.. A nightmare we can't wake up from...
Trump has destroyed America!!😡

You stated Trump ignited it. Since you believe it I used it as an example. You should be condoning these actions in Portland because antifa is just as far put of bounds.
"Today the intellectual leaders of the Republican Party are the paranoids, kooks, know-nothings and bigots who once could be heard only on late-night talk shows," Stevens writes. Trump last week called coronavirus testing "overrated”
I just informed a trump support that they were being lied to with fact and reason. What did you do today?
Under Obama, Texas Republican lawmakers punched up at the feds. Under Trump, they punched down at locals. And now, in their most vulnerable cycle in 20 years, they’re punching at each other.
I think I would rather have Biden as President with a Republican Senate than Trump with a full Democratic congress.
She’s a HUGE trump supporter!
trump will destroy America 😡😡
I agree that both these men are terrible people. I’m just saying that I would leave my freedom in the hands of President Trump bc he protects our rights and doesn’t convert to communism which has never worked before in other countries.
Answer to Does Donald Trump actually weigh 239 pounds? by John Cate
President Trump has almost doubled his support among Black voters.  He was elected in 2016 with 08% of the Black vote.  Trump is now receiving support from 14% of Black voters, with 09% still undecided.  Receiving 16% of the Black vote would insure his victory over Joe Biden.
Students for Trump! You guys have to be strong from coast to coast! Too many universities are teaching liberal views and those students are brain washed and even throw frozen water bottles at police! Students for Trump grow your base, knock on doors. Please.
trump using Black Water mercenaries in Portland!! Evil Evil Dictator!!
The Trump Administration is boldly telling the Chinese people to throw off their oppressors, the Chinese Communist Party, and to govern themselves.

Good election strategy.  Isolate your supporters with COVID-19 and then prevent them from voting effectively.  Not sure that's how you win elections, but you do you.   xss
Most Republicans — 81% — approve of Trump’s job performance, but just 68% of Republicans support his handling of the pandemic.
This man will be my inspiration to continue doing everything I can to bring America back from the brink of trump’s destruction. Every day. Until trump is in jail.
One word, trump.
nobody cares about your feelings, just vote Trump out
Okay?  I mean I like Biden just fine but I’m voting for him mainly because I want Trump gone.
Seattle police Chief Carmen Best called for peace at a late-night news conference, and told reporters she hadn't seen U.S. agents the Trump administration dispatched to the city at Saturday's protest.
You know what would end the protests? Trump’s resignation.
"Trump golfs while the nation he set on fire burns"! #TRE45ON
Sounds to me like you’re letting your emotions do the talking and not speaking any facts. Tell me, what has President Trump done to the country that is so bad that he should be taken out of office?
Trump’s a dirtbag...but he acts just like this to those who follow him as well.  ...and Biden is on multiple videos literally telling people to vote for someone else because he doesn’t want to talk to them. Not sure how that shows he cares for all constituents.
I will try to repost as many anti trump messages as possible on this platform and others, and most of all I WILL BE GOING TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump is not a racist.   And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.   Just because you don't agree with him doesn't make him racist.   You ma'am are racist for saying that..
Hillary Clinton is warning that President Donald Trump may not accept the results of the 2020 Election.  This is an interesting comment from the person who has not accepted the results of the 2016 Election.
The Atlantic: Canada Got Better. The United States Got Trump..
I have a Russian and Arabic murder joke but trump chopped up the journalist... 😖
No, the Dems are dividing the country because of Trump.  If you think Portland is normal then you cant have an issue with what happened in Charlotte. What we see now are the far left radicals stepping up. If you dont condone it you are a hypocrite.
Biden v Trump
It hasn't just now become an issue. It's an issue now because Trump is in office. Wake up
Trump out here tryna put out all these last minute bills to try to convinces people he’s good 💀 where was all this in 2017?
because why do you assume Trump knows how to steal an election?
the idea that Trump is about to steal this election is premised on the idea that Trump is good at concealing crimes
No he wasn’t. In fact, When Trump found out what Epstein was up to, he barred him from his golf club and reported him to local police.
Lost all respect!! I bet Trump wet his pants
My mom just tried to convince me that trump is a good president because of the executive order on insulin prices, and honestly, I just hope it’s real and not another scam to get votes. I realize that not many people will see this the same way but, it just seems to good to be true
El Paso County is on this list -- suing the President.
Omg I was about to drop my phone and while grabbing it I touched the Trump choice 🙈🤦🏻‍♀️ that doesn’t count! I pick China!!!
Don’t need to watch your mashed up Trump Conservative propaganda to know what AOC said or didn’t say. But thank you for making point clear.

When Trump speaks, it's almost always a lie.But the top White Supremacists is still tweeting from our White House. KKK Donald J. Trump
If Trump says to drink cyanide kool-aid the  will be lining up with their cups.
Voters unwillingness to reveal support for Trump is affecting poll numbers After 2016 many voters made a decision not to reveal any true feelings to pollsters
Send a message to voters instead please!  Trump won't listen nor his cultists.  We need to all vote as if we are losing this race and even then if we win it through a massive #BlueWave expect Trump and his cult to fight and possibly use violence in protest against it.
So spending money on sycophants partying unmasked at Trump resorts and events isn't working??? wow
some people love to agitate and create chaos.  If Trump knew her I think he'd place her over Betsy DeVoss.  she would work in tandem with Stephen Miller to malignantly misinform Millions of ignorant Americans to do what is harmful to them.

I would love for Bernie to be in the White House but sadly that ain’t gonna happen. But we can’t have another 4 more years of Trump we can’t. This past 4 years have been a chaotic shitshow and it needs to stop.
Because trump made it worse!
I hate Trump, too for 1000 different reasons.  And now I hate him more. 👊👊
Ah yes the infamous Trump Supporter. They are becoming a endangered species.
Look, I'm anti NATO but that doesn't make me pro Trump.
Trump has dragged this economy straight into the gutter. We will be like that movie The Book of Eli if we are forced to remain under this idiot.  He is awful.
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.
The human side of the party will be appalled, the Trump's side not so much.
Greg Gutfield is a hypocrite-so high &amp; mighty complaining abt Twitter!  2-3 weeks ago he posted on Twitter saying "Everybody should hate all Republicans! They shld  hate all Republicans &amp; President Trump!" Don't believe me? Ask him!
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.
Trump is like any loser who isn't "winning". Whenever they start losing they try anything to cheat. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.

Oh really? John Cornyn is a trump lap dog.
This is why he called the press in. Another photo op and distraction on this day of final goodbyes to John Lewis. Trump is a pig from hell. How dare he use people in this fashion? Uncouth ass.
I hope now all the black conservatives out there Will stop listening to your God King Trump and wear a fucking mask  there is no reason this man, who I do not agree with on anything, should be dead right now #RIPhermanCain

“Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,” Mr. McConnell said.

Lol even the ⁦ leaders disagree with trump postponing the elections 💀
Please Trump Supporters wear a mask, practice social distancing, stay at home; when you can, Covid19 is not a Hoax and wash you hands. May God rest his soul Amen!
From what I was saying the Democrats they were just bitching and yelling at him never let him answer any of the questions. The Democrats are the ones that are lying dividing and trying to cheat this whole time Trump has been in the presidency
Just in time for the 2020 Presidential Campaign, Trump has a new hat.
Yeah your right....... Keep letting that TDS affect your vision.
Nice meme. Could put Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton (both), Pelosi, Schumer and many more before putting Trump on it.  How’s that TDS doing? Must take your medicine before it drives you crazy 😜
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He’ll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
And every warning has fallen on deaf ears. And when state leaders actually try to do something useful to help, the Trump bunch cry out unconstitutional. It is so sadly stupid that anyone cares about those idiots.
I live in a suburb of Dallas. A blue collar suburb. We have quite a few low income housing complexes here. I live in an eclectic neighborhood of many races. My home values are fine and seeing an increase as opposed to going down. Trump is wrong.

Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, dies from coronvavirus  via
The nomination of a retired general for a senior civilian position in the Trump administration was cast into doubt when his confirmation hearing was canceled just before it was scheduled to begin amid signs that he did not have enough GOP votes.
Cain reportedly learned that he tested positive for COVID-19 on June 29. He was hospitalized two days later after developing “serious” symptoms.  His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa.
Very sad bc this dude should still be alive. This is what happens when the disinformation of the trump administration and his supporters resonates in their minds.
Two trump ass kissers.
Trump wants to open schools now but then delay the election??? The hypocrisy and corruption of the trump administration and his supporters knows no end.
Trump continues to try to tap into the “fears and anger and resentment of people...and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.”
Mr. Obama spoke about how Mr. Trump has a core base that “filters out any contradictory information.”
Mr. Obama was asked what keeps him up at night these days. He cited fears of voter suppression and an effort by Mr. Trump to question the election’s legitimacy.
New York and other states sued the Trump administration over new limits on the “public charge” rule, which critics said would discourage immigrants from seeking medical treatment during the pandemic.
“In the campaign of 1968, my father, Governor George Wallace, understood the potential political power of downtrodden and disillusioned working class white voters who felt alienated from government. And Donald Trump is mining the same mother lode.”
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
And Mr. Trump’s claim that mail voting leads to inaccurate counts or fraud is false.
Mr. Trump has no authority to unilaterally change the date of the election, which is set by federal law. His suggestion comes as polls show him trailing far behind Mr. Biden in surveys of nearly all of the key battleground states.
Even for Mr. Trump, suggesting a delay in the election is an extraordinary breach of presidential decorum that will increase the chances that Mr. Trump and his core supporters don’t accept the legitimacy of the election should he lose.
On Thursday, for the first time, Mr. Trump in a tweet suggested the vote be delayed “until people can properly, securely and safely vote,” something he cannot legally do.
The president is very clear about how he wants things done,” said David Lapan, who was DHS spokesman during the first year of the Trump administration, “and the ability of people to push back when they’re in an acting capacity is much more limited.”
Where is The Taxes ? Amazing what the Trump’s will do to hide them...
I think we all knew that was coming next from trump. He is more authoritarian and delusional every day. Early voting for the Nov election starts 13 Oct in TX. #NovemberIsComing
Delay the election, because Trump has the virus under control? #covidiot

BLM GROUPS HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EXCEPT FURTHER DISTANCING ALL THE YEARS OF PROGRESS MADE BY ALL PEOPLE BLACK AND WHITE WHO STRIVED FOR A BETTER AMERICA. BUT AMERICAS LEADERS WHO HATE TRUMP FORMED" SYSTEMIC RACISM" IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN AMERICA AT ALL COST. WAR!
Opponents spinning wheels   They say he serves Putin, risks Germany.  Then mock Trump 'he only moved them to Poland' like its a fake draw down well if the troops R still nearby how can one argue that it puts Europe at risk?  when you get to be prez YOU can decide where to deploy
Donald Trump pulls 12,000 troops out of Germany slashing presence there by a third because Angela Merkel is ‘delinquent’ on NATO spending
I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.
why do trump supporters even exist???
Do you not realize who Ronald Reagan was? He was just as racist as Donald Trump if not worse

Who is “we,” you and trump? That’s a scary notion.
He is laughing at this. It’s the only explanation I can come up with. Trump is using this 14th century medical “expert” to make fun of Fauci in some odd way. No one believes this. Well besides cultists.

President Trump has never confronted Vladimir Putin with intelligence indicating Russia paid the Taliban to kill U.S. troops.
“The money is being laundered through corporations run by top Trump campaign officials,” said Brendan Fischer, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center. “That has the effect of keeping the public in the dark as to a big chunk of Trump campaign spending.”
Trump’s campaign is violating federal election law by funneling close to a quarter-billion dollars to date through private companies in order to hide the ultimate recipients of the money, including the wife of one of his sons and the girlfriend of another.
So far, $216.6 million of spending by Trump’s campaign and related committees has flowed through just two firms, with no disclosure of how that money was spent.

Barr Pushes Back on Assertions He Politicized DOJ to Defend Trump
They don't care if Trump picks they'll agree with anything she says. Cults operate this way.
If President Obama had reason to say 'Protect the people's park' I would have agreed with him.  If Obama had said, 'I'm president, &amp; have the right to walk across the street' -- agree again.  So I can hardly reverse that to say Trump was wrong.
There is no misunderstanding on Barr's part.  It is intentional.  He doesn't care as evidenced by today's testifying.  Barr was a pick by racist Trump.
Nurses, veterans, moms, dads, teenagers... all seen as a threat to Trump and his fascist cronies.

It’s interesting, some of the similarities between Obama and Trump.  Obama was re-elected, Trump was impeached.  Obama kept many of his Cabinet members, Trump is running out of people to replace his Cabinet members.  Trump is orange, Obama is black.  “Similarities” may not apply.

A bad day for Trump!
President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
The  found in an analysis of more than 200 Portland arrests that even those accused of breaking the law during the liberal city’s nightly rallies don’t neatly fit into President Donald Trump’s depiction of protesters as “anarchists and agitators.”
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there’s that.
Donald trump could never do you hear me. NEVER. #JohnLewisMemorial
You know Trump Bad when Bush looks like a old friend .....that I didnt vote for! #JohnLewisMemorial
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. 🤣
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his “joke” about injecting people with bleach. He wasn’t joking.
I doubt it, I don’t see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can’t glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should’ve learned.
Should of happened over a year ago when Trump said he was going to what about the rest of the conspirators in the coup are those BASTARDS blocked yet 🤔

I wonder what Superspreader Trump will say about this?  Trump, now has one less vote.
I did not vote for him and have no opinion on Mr. Cain as a person.  I did not like his politics.  No one should be attending Trump rallies, with or without a mask.

all you have to do is look at how hard they fought when President Trump announced he was taking it. All countries that deal with malaria take HCQ and subsequently have hardly ANY reported cases. The Demoncraps and their LAPDOGS the Marxist Media fought because they KNOW IT WORKS
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies

Trump doesn't have the empathy or concentration to do a eulogy. You need to be confident in your own abilities, and that's not him either. You shouldn't be jealous and competitive with the person you are laying to rest. He's not a good person.
Yes it is so vote for Trump!
The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.
I just spit on my screen. LOL!

What if President Trump  devised a plan for Kodak Pharmaceuticals to be an additional manufacturer for hydroxychloroquine, which will produce enough of the drug to put down the COVID-19 pandemic narrative?
That’s true but Putin knocked a bunch of interest off his loans to trump so he has that going for him.
That’s how he rolls. I’m sure trump and his friends made a bundle using our tax money to pump up Kodak. Trumps never had it so good. Did he cut Putin in on it or any of his other Russian backers.
Absolutely, luckily for America President Trump shall win in a landslide.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

PS: if anyone hasn't watched Netflix's Trump's American Dream (I think that's the title) it is quite comical. :) They interview his past employees, friends, etc. :) Pure comedy that Trump. :)
No, he already had underlying conditions.Ben Shapiro slams 'gross' pundits blaming Trump rally for Herman Cain’s death from coronavirus  #FoxNews
And hes not voting for Biden, he just “doesnt know” now if he will vote for trump!!! Who doesnt know yet??? WHO?
Yet we can’t stay gridlocked like this - it seems like whether we ditch the filibuster or not, we still end up at Trump 3.0.  When and how does the suffering that the reactionaries are inflicting on us end?
Lmao. Racist!!  It’s the tRump virus because if he were a competent leader he would have prevented all this death!
OMG it's Christmas in July! Read and weep libtards. Theirs some paedos going down and Trump ain't one. 😆

So spending money on sycophants partying unmasked at Trump resorts and events isn't working??? wow
some people love to agitate and create chaos.  If Trump knew her I think he'd place her over Betsy DeVoss.  she would work in tandem with Stephen Miller to malignantly misinform Millions of ignorant Americans to do what is harmful to them.
Fine by me if it also means we drag Trump out of office.
What is it going to take to get Trump to shut his racist mouth and stop saying “China Virus”?  It’s so offensive and does not make anyone believe he’s somehow not responsible.
Trump will remain a factor, but minority parties have a way of many voices being relevant.  And Trump isn’t on the 2022 ballot either.
I’m not surprised that MSM are having a moment Today! It’s what they do! Trump can play them like a Fiddle! We won’t be having  Mail-In Votes Dimwads!
Trump and his complicit republicans are doing a good job of making our democracy “go away”.  I hate all of them for violating their oaths of office.  There is nothing worse than a liar with no honor and no ethics.
Either Trump supporters are playing dumb or is not an act.

He knows if he doesn’t say these things and try to file people up he’ll be in jail after trump is re-elected and all his incompetency will come to light. A crooked president he was...
Because he is a germaphobe. I imagine those people probably have to go through some kind of major decontamination process before they can get near Trump.

That is exactly correct.  Trump continues to make horrendous mistakes and refuses to listen to the experts because he thinks he is an expert at everything.
Take a good look at Twitter "trending" tonight.   MichelleObama Podcast  Evict Trump CNNTownhall TrumpHatesScience  Notice a pattern?
So you think ONE person can run a nation wide response solely on their own without anyone else involved? You do realized the blue cities and states "resisted" when Trump ordered their compliance, as did all the sheeple.   There is the problem right there - own it.
You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
Sad, but true. The Left has gone full fascist! Censoring medicine and medical advice to make Trump look bad. Sad.
I think this is what they call getting rid of the riff raff. It's why people like Trump like borders and country club memberships. Jack up the prices until "undesirables" can't afford to hang, then all you have left are the willfully ignorant deplorables.
Look, supporters of Trump, and Herman Cain, and...you can say what you want, but big gatherings, and opening up, and skipping the wearing of masks...these are dangerous, and dispiriting to our front line health care givers. Help them out!

Okay when Fauci speaks all I hear is QUACK QUACK QUACK.  The man is working for Hillary in my opinion because if you pay attention to Hillary's body language she doesn't appear to be as upset like she was in Trump's first 3 years but after the China virus it has changed.
You’re a weak-kneed Trump mama’s boy.  We need a real man as Texas Senator, which in this case is a woman.  Bye bye, Cornyn.

Trump fans are a terrorist organization!  They don’t care about the people. Trump fans hate an America that wants to progress and everything about progression.  Facts do not matter to trump fans. All you need to do is listen to them speak and incite riots in American cities.
I know if tables were turned-Obama went against science, Drs advice &amp;lead people to their demise, your post would be different. Mr Cain was responsible for his actions. He did it to prove a point in support of Trump &amp; a point was made. I wish death on no one. We have to be smart!

I hope more do in Congress. Mail in voting does not favor one party over the other. In fact, since older people tend to use mail in voting a lot and older people tend to vote Republican, it may actually offer them an advantage. But they listen to trump.

Herman killed himself following Trump to slaughter. No Sympathy for all the followers, Allowing 45 to rip this country apart. Stupid is stupid dies
What?  lied again? I’m shocked!! (Sarcasm) Obama used a funeral as a campaign stage for Biden!  if you were not able to have a funeral for a loved one, remember this moment. The only people who matter to Obama/Biden are the ones with power !  Imagine if Trump did that
This country is so fucked. Has to be the biggest collection of the dumbest fucking people on the planet
Obama used John Lewis funeral to try to save his hide because he spied on Trump campaign and got caught. Desperation is the nail on the coffin.
And where is the f4cking stock market ? They don’t care that trump is running the country into the ground or that the republican want to take away consumer spending ability with unemployment? They used to react to tan suits now nothing

It totally is! My husband got all freaked out about one of them and I I had to walk him through the logic of trusting Trump until he gives us a reason not to 😂
Because Trump lied and said the Covid was a Hoax.  How many more will follow to the slaughter house? How many more will be lost listening to his lies? Can't have sympathy for those following the dictator tRUmp.

Because trump made it worse!
The governors were tasked with protecting their own states, and the mayors tasked with their cities. So, are you saying they were all inept? Only certain cities took it real hard. Mostly those busy trying to "resist" anything Trump says.
Or making fun of the man’s death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump’s lead, by attending a gathering that didn’t need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....
Can’t say I’ve ever seen the trump criticism that you speak of and I live in Texas.
I can’t say I blame him... I would totally take the Trump approach of ignoring it hoping it will go away
Barr is on the way to that. Give it time. He lied about taking orders from trump. He’s lied about Lafayette square. He fired prosecutors who were investigating trumps cronies. Roger stone. You haven’t got much of a leg to stand on here. Better quit before you get further behind.

This is what America is supposed to be about-what it has been for 244 years and will be no longer if Trump is re-elected.
Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY “Trump supporters” refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN’T wearing masks because Europe❤️Trump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb
Thank the lord for President Trump hearing the assertion of the Gillian case too it was more than a sexual assault it was a stalking&amp; brutal attack against that soldier with more than one person involved w/ it    will amnesty be granted
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a “conspiracy theorist” for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.

Party agnostic, I’ve always been a sucker when former Presidents are together at historic events  Sadly, I don’t see that happening for years as I don’t see Trump performing ceremonial duties of former Presidents
This is about the nominee for the defense department they pulled today.  This Senator already gave a statement that he had a conversation with a Trump last night recommending Trump withdrawal him nomination.
The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican “leaders” and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people’s lives?
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.

(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He’s no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump’s
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y’all goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?
McCarthy is a wanna be fart smelling dick just like trump
Well Trump needs to tell Russia to back off then.
They’ll blame President Trump.
Get this all you BLM supporters! When Bernell Trammell, a peaceful loving BLACK man was shot in cold blood in front of his BLACK owned business. BLM told his business partners who reached out to them for help that they won’t help them because he supported Trump! Hypocrites!
Is there a "flattering" book about Trump?   The president's ex-lawyer is allowed to publish a tell-all before the Nov. 3 election under an agreement filed on Thursday  via
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
Repugnantcans were more outraged about the made-up, pretend “war on Christmas “, than they have been about trump’s idea to move the election.
Maybe they delay the outcome calling all swing states into question, trump campaign sues, drags out Electoral voting into December, God knows
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn’t even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn’t have a clue but they deserve it. What’s that saying you reap what you sow.
lol.  no one believes your bullshit Rafael.  Energy costs to $65,000 lolol.  Your Donald Trump economy is in the toilet.  All the problems are happening on your watch.  Blaming future democrats for your problems is laughable.
Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
Watching  make Zuck feel uncomfortable never gets old. I wanna see her debate trump.
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes
Apparently, someone did not pass third grade grammar! Where did you learn how to write...tRump University?
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction😂👎🏿
Impeach and remove Trump again and Barr at once.
What Trump is doing to the United States Postal Service is criminal.
Cotton, hope you go to the next tRUMP rally and make the same decision Cain did!
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
Does not want to go down with the ship, but he was glad to sail along ... hypocrite, cya maneuver.  You cannot wash off the stench of Trump that easily.  Sorry.
'Donald Trump killed Herman Cain': Liberals waste absolutely zero time politicizing Herman Cain’s death  and blaming Trump
She missed DACA under Obama. Trump ruined her second chance.
President Trump made a stop in Texas on Wednesday, visiting the Double Eagle Oil Rig in Midland. Correspondent Clayton Neville had more information on Thursday's WBAP Morning News.
I don’t remember Will’s criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you’re right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that’s not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
30 JULY, 2020 When will #CNN, #AC360, #Donlemon, #BrianStelter, #ChrisCuomo, and #JeffZucker all be held accountable for all the lies and smears against President #RealDonaldTrump, Conservatives, Trump supporters, and the American public?
Greg Gutfield is a hypocrite-so high &amp; mighty complaining abt Twitter!  2-3 weeks ago he posted on Twitter saying "Everybody should hate all Republicans! They shld  hate all Republicans &amp; President Trump!" Don't believe me? Ask him!
Trump’s housing tweets, explained
My issue with Will is that he is ex-IC. He co-signed on way too many tRump attacks on our IC people and sources around the world. He knows better than most of how dangerous tRump has been to our national security and he will forever wear the Scarlett T as far as I’m concerned.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction
Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn’t exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don’t buy that he’d have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump’s rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I’m not convinced Trump’s team can thwart it.
The same Chinese that trump begged their president for help in the upcoming election...those Chinese? JFC you are not bright at all...🙄😂😂😂
So your asking him to lose? He avoids Trump he wins by a landslide, he debates Trump and he loses and gets a ton of vids made of him like Jeb Bush did in 2016
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.
I seriously think Trump wants out of office, I really don't think he wanted to ever be President.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction 😂😂
"voting my conscience" by voting for someone that would do 90 percent of the things trump is doing but would be friendly about it.
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
IGNORE Donald. Some call him, “Treasonous Trump,” everyone else calls him “DIP-SHIT DONNIE.”He wants you to buy Prince Harry and M. Markel book.
Big tech lies about suppression of conservatives and efficacy of Hydroxychloriquine, crickets.... Roger Stone broke no law, but uttered a trivial error in memory and FBI raids his house at 6am in the morning.  This is why Trump will/must win
Look at Trump and his African American. Bet I know what he calls him behind his back.
Trump is a dictator not a president 👎🏿👎🏿
Nice spin, my boy. You should be in politics. Donny Trump 👀
Trump is a laughing Stock no thanks 👎🏿
I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump’s birth certificate to verify his birth info).
How popular is   provides an updating calculation of the president's approval rating, accounting for each poll's quality, recency, sample size, and partisan lean.
New B2T Show!  Why Lie? The Cabal's Last Stand. Trump Out or Die. B2T Show Jul 29, 2020 (IS)
They should seize colleges' endowments and assets to go into a public fund that would pay off students' toxic student loans.
Why is blocking President Trump and not the Ayatollah of Iran.  I think Twitter employees should all move to Iran to enjoy the freedom afforded the media in the Middle East!  Traitors!
Just wondering,  did this black life matter?
Help me real quick. You’re not fond of Barack, and Michelle appears to bother you because she allegedly does anything to remain relevant. I’ve seen tweets about trump where you appear to not care for him either. Where do you stand? I’m curious.
President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.
Like Ford. Can't wait to find out what happened to all that missing Trump inauguration money. Gonna get juicy when he's out of office!
Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump’s term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You’re all talk with no action.  Why hasn’t anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn’t like trump when McCain was alive but since then you’re playing good guy to trump. It’s obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.
Herman Cain, death lies directly at the feet of Donald J. Trump. Tulsa-No Mask. #COVID19
Trump is an evil POS. -jvo Trump Can't Postpone the Election - The Atlantic
Dems all hate each other, just hate of Repubs/Trump unites. Still can't wait till more muslims and LGBTQ realize they are in the same party... wtf
Trump hates American soldiers. #TrumpTraitor
Maybe we should start saying the top military brass HAS NO BALLS, not even brass.. maybe trump neutered them too. Then they too would be COWARDS, with wha tails they have left between their legs.
Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don’t matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
Trump is often persuading.  His goal here may be to draw attention to problems in mail-in voting.  Or it may be to get Democrats to commit to accepting the results of the election.  Or it could be a random thought, but don't ignore persuasion or you will misunderstand Trump.
The ignorant love Trump.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that’s cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples’ lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn’t accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.
NO MASK. Trump does not care because anyone near him gets tested. Trump is safe while he let's 150,000 die. DUMP MALIGNANT TRUMP
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  😴
Actually Herman Cain got the Trump Tulsa Virus
Unfortunately, defiantly going unmasked to a Trump rally was his latest claim to fame, so becomes becomes the title of his obit. Sad reality.
Hey occupant of the House chair...  You want school delayed. You want economic recovery delayed. You want hydroxychloroquine delayed. You want everything delayed.  Maybe President Trump is tight, let’s add the election to your list of delays.  🤣
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ⅓ on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
Bullshit Stop getting off the subject. You posted about what Trump supposedly did. I corrected you now you wanna talk about Obama. Every word you typed is an opinion. Whats your point genius
Imagine how many dead Americans would have lived had you not compromised your honesty and ethics.  Wait!  You work for Trump.  You showed us who you are by working for him. #WrongSideOfHistory
. said no to Trump but yes to 12 year olds signing up to go to war for a chance to win a fortnite pack. 🤧
I will vote for #JoeBiden on the first day of early voting in Texas. Apparently, just being 62 with underlying health conditions is not enough for me to qualify for an absentee ballot. No worries. I can’t wait to vote Trump out. #WeWillVote  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I don't know who 2 direct this 2 but will we someday see a "U.S. -vs- Trump Family" lawsuit? There is NO WAY they deserve the taxpayer supported services &amp; monies that are usually provided when an "official" leaves office.  Further, we should go after ALL of their assets. 🗽💰🇺🇸
If you don't like Trump, that's fine.  But don't call yourself a conservative if you are voting for the other side because given what they have openly showed us these past few months you would be voting for socialism and anarchy.
Trump sinking, rats jumping ship. Great Trump iceberg of undocumented Trump voters does not exist.
#DemonSpawn #TrumpImps By the way, you put politics ahead of the American people.  Your actions killed Americans.  Your compromising ethics to serve Trump, no matter the excuse, KILLED AMERICANS!
Trump is like any loser who isn't "winning". Whenever they start losing they try anything to cheat. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Cornyn is up for re-election at the same time as Trump.  Guess he wants people to associate him with the Cheeto.
You’re not going to be president because trump is going to cheat.
Blame Trump's appointed Postmaster General.  I live in a Republican town and state.  It is happening all over since we have a new Trump person in charge of the USPS
#VoteMJHegar IN &amp; #VoteJohnCornynOUT because Texas deserves better than this trump stooge...
Latinos For Trump!  Defeating the narrative one tweet at a time!
Trump's lack of competence has confused ppl in to thinking that words matter more than ACTION. Ppl love to forget the racist ID laws that the Bush Administration helped pass and left a legacy of disenfranchisement. This behavior helped create Trump. #KnowYourHistory
How much blood have YOU donate, TRUMP? Or are you going to claim you donated 150,000+ AMERICAN LIVES TO YOU CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WAR EFFORT!
He’s scared to death if Trump is re-elected, Obama is going straight to jail!
All politicians must stand behind Congress ruling &amp; not even discuss changing the election date. It is imperative that the GOP stand up &amp; stop this kind of radical chatter now.  Trump, Barr &amp; Pompeo need to be stopped in their tracks in regards to throwing this out to the public.
FEC commissioner to Trump: 'No. You don't have the power to move the election'

For sure, push for that all you want AFTER we’ve stopped the very real threat of EIGHT WHOLE YEARS of Trump and we’ve already seen how much damage THREE AND A HALF does!
Cornyn waited until McConnell and Trump told him what to do
Messaging is not their true issue. Trump is the true issue. No one can fix/halt/change him 🤣🤣🤣!!
Remember when #theWrongRight screamed about how they were afraid that Obama was going to try to find some way to stay in office beyond the end of his term?
These Latinos Could End Trump. The Frontier That Could Crush Trump He’s thrived on border politics &amp; may be doomed by them. President Trump is barely holding a polling lead across Texas. One trove of reluctant voters in the Rio Grande Valley has the potential to hand the state —
I know, but that message doesn't get the same sort of backlash. Lord knows it *should*, but saying that sort of thing won Trump an election.   Also, Barr know that if there's no election by January 20, it'l be President Patrick Leahy.
To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.
The dumbest people in my graduating class became teachers...and though it was funny at the time, it sucks long-term. They're all bitching about Trump and trying to sell me body wraps on FB now, lmao.
I understand your stylistic objections to Obama.  I have a similar hostile response to oleaginous politicians like Cruz who insult your intelligence; and that’s even before Trump turned Republicans into the nihiliststic Trolling for Liberal Tears Party.
John Lewis never accepted ANY election results when Democrats had to hand over power to Republicans. He never attended inaugural for George W Bush nor Trump. Not accepting election results is what happens in banana republics. The only people who refuse to accept results are Dems.
You better believe it an TRUMP WILL WIN AGAIN
A Trump adherent is the definition of an insane troll, there is no other explanation for that support.
Sorry but I’ll be voting for Biden. Trump is a laughing Stock 😂😂.
TRUMP will lose so it doesn’t matter.
I don’t mean this in a bad way, but the election of Trump was in many ways a rejection of a guy to whom you pledge fealty.  I only pledge it to ideas.  Sorry that doesn’t confirm to your attempt to feel superior to Rs.
#trumppresser Time for the Trump rats to start leaving the ship. Sorry if I left anyone out.
I initially thought trump got ahold of a sharpie 🖊 again?! 🤷🏼‍♀️
But we will not forget that #TrumpOnWheels kissed the ring and followed trump's implied advise initially. That put us 4-6 weeks behind. The deaths in that period will be calculable when we are past this. I hope they are all held accountable for their deadly shit decisions.
Of course, Trump was too busy to pay his respects at the Capitol ... only dropping the ball when it's inopportune ... or continually ... whichever is more frequent.
where did  get those rediculas polls about Trump dividing and hurting the country? VI don't remember anyone asking me or polling my neighborhood.
Every resident of a state is traditionally counted during apportionment, but Trump last Tuesday issued a directive seeking to bar people in the U.S. illegally from being included in the headcount as congressional districts are redrawn.
Fill out your Census form &amp; Vote. The GOP is trying to take away your rights to do both.   California, Florida, Texas would lose House seats with Trump’s census order.
This fascination with evil men is what got us Donald Trump.
not only is my downstairs neighbor a cop.. my next door neighbor is a trump supporter 🤢
Herman Cain at the Trump rally. Its crazy how he lost his life. This is what happens when you don't social distance and wear masks
“Like, this is easy,” George Clooney said. “There’s two candidates here. One claims that our first Black president wasn’t a citizen, and the other was his vice president.”
This is, again, Trump saying the quiet part out loud.
Biden is getting 92 percent black support. Trump only getting 8 percent in 2020 yeah your so right Trump has done such a great job with Blacks 😂😂. Let’s delay the elections. The only man who says dumb stuff like that is when they know they will lose badly.
I mean the one Trump policy I approve of is killing KKKonservatives
Christian Groups Applaud Trump Admin. for Reversing Policy on Int'l Students
Thank you too Mr Rather for your years of service to the people, as a kid I can remember hearing your reporting and the integritty you bring to the table with honest stories reguardless of political background. Sad to see that trust tarnished by other "reporters" praising Trump.
Senator Cornyn is a lackey who does not care about the average Texan.  He sold himself to special interests long ago. Texans will vote him out November 3.  In the meantime,  keep shining Trump’s shoes
Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after battle with coronavirus  number #1 Ninja dies of Trump’s coronavirus
Yes Lindsey Graham has a golf date with trump
Trump is/is not responsible for anything, he has made that crystal clear. (Except Eric, we gotta tag trump for that mistake)
A pawn..... there is a documentary on Trump on Netflix.... it’s clear why he has a woman on his arm... to use for success... etc it’s excellent in going into detail his dealings in NYC when he was bankrupt.... and he’s “running/ruining” our country
Look at America. Voting for socialism is better than Trump. He’s killer

Yeah no Trump is just a laughing Stock not only in America but all around the world 🌎.
If you think that Donald Trump isnt involed in this Hoax you are sadly mistaken the only difference between a Democrat and a Republican is this Demorats love little boys and Republican love to go to war with anyone who doesn't believe that Jesus is God
Trump teach you how to project?
Except when it comes to children &amp; Rona. Then you MUST do your own research.   To learn the TRUTH of how career civil servants at CDC, AAP, and socialist Swedes conspired with godless Iceland to hatch a plot involving fabricated viral sequencing . . . all to get trump re-elected.

#trumppresser Q : How come Trump never catches #Covid19?  A: Covid19 is very rare in the non-human species.
Defeating trump in November will only cause the white nationalists in the Republican Party to redouble their efforts to erase the last 70 years of social and economic progress. Fortunately, though they will be more motivated than ever, they will be left far less capable
Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.🙄

He's a coward who've seen the internal polling and Trump is in for a shellacking.   He had a chance to vote for impeachment and show some grit, but voted against - because then Trump was still polling good.
And these theories being floated by Trump and his cult. Going on every air wave to speak nonsense
I’m short— fuck Trump. 🥰🥰
Trump and names!
Trump is essentially saying that HIS government than HE’S had control over for 3.5 years is too inept and too ineffective to pull off national mail-in voting.
Trump kills democrats to improve chances of re-election. Its far worst than false claims of voter fraud. He is literally killing out the competition.     2nd impeachment needs to be considered on principle. Ppl r dying 1 per minute
Yeah no. If you Americans like Death and destruction you can vote for Trump he can give that to you.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.
Yeah no chance in Hell trump wins in November
How sad is this headline? Are we great again yet?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs

Trump is the most clear and present danger to us right now. Above Covid. He has endangered Americans with his conjectures and confusing data, pushing lies &amp; outright incorrect medical info, and letting Jared muck up the national testing program. We need to move this election UP!
Yeah that’s a whole lot of bullshit trump. The vast majority of Americans hate you. Can’t wait for NOVEMBER 3
Why can't ONE JOURNALIST tell trump that Absentee Ballots and Mail-In Ballots are THE SAME DAMN THING?
Why doesnt anyone ask Trump that. He says elections are at risk and their is legislation ready for consideration. Why isnt it brought to senate floor  Trump again challenges democracy but offers no solution. Congress has solution but wont act. Its a nitemare
Trump gone hate this😁😁
I can assure everyone Trump will tweet something false and stupid tomorrow.
Let the record show that  DID NOT PUSH BACK. He said Trump “was joking” so that when he really does try to move the election, John can then say that Trump told us what he was going to do months ago. We’ve been here before. #JohnTheComic

Having read her platform I’d have loved to have her as President so that’s not a valid excuse for supporting Trump. Even if she wasn’t a top choice there was Gary Johnson and Evan McMullin on the ballot and anyone could write in John Kasich or any other name that’s qualified
Trump economic theory: Capitalism survives by maintaining income &amp; wealth disparities. Capitalism requires human capital &amp; wage slaves so capitalists profit without regard for the health, welfare &amp; lives of workers, even when they meet a too early &amp; unnatural death.

Not going to lie. I’ve never seen someone in my 52 years that I want to see lose as much as Trump. I hope it’s a biblical ass whipping. Is Joe Biden my choice? Nope. But Trump needs to go down in a historical manner to shut his ignorant fat mouth.
Integrity meaning moral and ethical principles soundness of moral character and honesty. Trump has none of the above he continues to destroy this country thousands of lives lost daily. With no empathy with no remorse no respect, no dignity,he’s let us on a path of sorrow and pain

His and Trump example of not wearing masks killed hundreds if not thousands. Spare me your sanctimonious. Shit
This is an issue because Trump's polling numbers are terrible. He's  trying to use the expected rise in absentee ballots due to Covid-19 (no one knows what the # will be) to shovel conspiracy theories. This time he has Barr helping to peddle the theories.

Trump probably cheats at golf, which is the ULTIMATE sin 🤣
The reporter that asked that question deserves a Pulitzer, or as Trump calls it "Noble Prize".  #trumppresser

AH today was some seriously crazy shit setting the stage for an amazing #Friday session so long as we can keep a clean news cycle between now &amp; then. Someone shut down Trump's twitter &amp; everyone else post the hell out of the #COVID line graph of states going down in caseload!
Nope! This is all tRump!

America,  Donald Trump wants to delay your American democracy by needlessly postponing our elections, but he wants to rush your children into the mouth of a pandemic (that has killed 151,674 Americans) by pushing them back into unprepared schools.  Your children deserve better.

There appear to be more than a few people upset by people who point out that Herman Cain went to Trump’s Tulsa rally, and mocked the call to wear masks. But, he did, and he did. Shouldn’t people point out that reckless behavior may have ghastly consequences? A serious question.

Correct, Trump supporters are now getting off work and voting and it's actually more like 53% Trump.     Expect it to be higher before poll ends (or when owner deletes and blames outcome on "spooky little Russian bots"). 😂😂
Stupid choice. Personal choice. A stupid personal choice. This man was in the hospital 8 days after the rally and never left the hospital. Trump doesn’t give a damn.
Trump can pardon him today. How long the case drags on is irrelevant. Flynn doesn't have moves.

Is there anyone that can explain to poor trump that absentee and mail in voting are basically one and the same?
Yeah right, as soon as you stand up to Trump.
Trump doesn’t follow SUPREME COURT RULINGS. What makes anyone think CRAZY TRUMP will not try to create so much chaos so that he alone can DECLARE our election was fraudulent because he LOSES. TRUMP IS INSANE. Remove him using the 25th Amendment immediately. NOW.

I’m talking actual IQ. He’s low, probably below the American median. Getting a rise out of Americans who care about preserving a republic isn’t a high political IQ. Even the cofounder of the Federalist Society called for his impeachment and removal today.
..yet on the other hand, Biden is SUPER boring. I think between Biden's lack of charisma, Trump looking weak, and COVID, this is going to be a record low turnout, and it's going to come down to which side is less interested.   Force me to answer, and I'd give the edge to Biden.

Why doesn’t  &amp;  do a live Fact Check during the Trump #coronavirus press conference.
Trump is rattling on about the vote count taking years. That is impossible. On January 20, if the election can’t be called, the speaker of the house is sworn in as president. But keep on talking, Trump.
What the hell are the "therapeutics" that trump keeps tossing out as doing very well?
I wouldn't bet a dime on this election.. absolutely impossible to predict. I will say that before February, it was Trump's election all the way. But with the economy going south, regardless of the fact he literally couldn't have saved it (no one could have), it doesn't look good
Watching Trump’s briefing. It might be less painful to just beat myself over the head with a brick.
5.  Passed the buck to governors! 6.  You get the first vaccine 7.  It was the Dems that forced the PPP and then tRump fires the IG so the money was never accounted for and small businesses couldn’t get those loans! 8.  Unemployment in double digits  9. Recession
If your response to Trump’s tweet today is any less than “this is fascistic and impeachable”, welcome to the right of THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY
Because they finally realize Trump is going to lose and that they have sold their souls to the devil. Trying to get out of that contract.
A reminder that Trump approves of Russian bounties paid to the Taliban for killing American soldiers, and still the  have done and said NOTHING.   Enabling our enemies to hunt and kill our own soldiers is treason.  #BountyGate  #GOPTraitors  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Trump just said if we have mail in voting we will be the laughingstock of the world.  We are already the laughingstock of the world because of him!  He said you have to be really stupid not to understand that. Oh my God he is really an idiot!.  😲
He's going to vote for Trump.
You’re going down Trump
Except at this point, Trump has nothing to lose. He'll pardon him.
Clearly the CDC (under Trump) now recommends we wear masks.
Maybe if enough Federalist Society types get mad at Trump someone'll finally do some Second Amendmenting about all of this mess we're in.
Trump's whole virus response hinged on the mistaken belief that viruses only take direct flights.

“President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and w/out precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again.”
Trump suggested today that we delay the election since he will obviously get hammered by even a senile old guy. Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy both said not happening.
Trump: "I'm an absentee voter."  Dude, you're an absentee leader.
How dare Trump get on national tv and say that he will delay our election. He can not.
If there are three things Trump can't do, it's appear to be sincere while talking about someone else in a positive light, remember a dear friend's name without woodenly reading it from a speech, and not being racist.
We call a disaster of that magnitude a "Trump".

Did That man hold up a YouTube print out?? #Trump #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsNotWell
Trump was serious about delaying the election
We have been through dark times before. We will get through the disaster that is Trump and Trumpism. I have faith in the people. Vote for decency in November.
He made it a political statement himself, by refusing to follow guidelines during a pandemic because trump wouldn't like it. Too bad YOU obviously haven't learned anything from it.
Joe Biden will cut your taxes. Trump will cut the taxes of the rich people so they’ll get even richer. 💣🎊
First a Trump supporter and now I find out he is racist? Smh   One of the best commentators in the sport and he couldn't figure out that what he was saying was dumb.
Donald Trump Brought Reciepts lol
HA! That tweet is driving the left INSANE!
Yes, but unlike the people in El Paso who were gunned down because Trump put a hit on Hispanics,  kind of volunteered for it.  For the good of the economy, of course. . .
He put America first with 151k deaths #Trump #AmericaFirst
I agree with you. The 2 party system isn’t working anymore. Both are corrupt and ineffective. But, this is not the election to make that point. Right now, it is either or... you are wasting your vote if you don’t vote for Biden. America can’t endure 4 more years of Trump!
That's how they might get the word out to the mail carriers (which didn't happen). And I would like a link or reference to where Trump says he won't "go peacefully" if he loses. Can't seem to find that anywhere.
Thank you trump! My city recently tore down our only low income housing project. It was filled with crime / drugs / trash
And Trump’s tweet wasn’t a troll. He’s a low IQ know nothing who prays on people too ignorant to recognize it. He knows he’s losing badly.
I wish the WH press Corp and the networks would all skip covering these entirely. It’s not Trump is going to actually saw anything news shattering. We all know he tweets the ‘important stuff.’

Every deflection must be bigger than the last to change the newsfeeds. We are days away from Trump threatening to launch nuclear weapons on red states to cleanse out the traitors.
Trump, the smoke and mirror President. Meanwhile 150,000 Americans are dead and the GDP of America just dropped 32.9% this quarter. By the time November gets hear he'll be threatening to drop nuclear weapons just to change the news cycle.
Another Trump success story.
Idiot Trump wants to delay next election may be four years due corona virus which he said would disappear!!He has no power to delay election as he did not have power to open or close states for virus.

1. I didn't hear him say that. 2. Oh he said it but he didn't mean it. 3. He meant it but he can't really do it. 4. He can do it by executive order because he is President.  Then... (5.) The election was rigged so Trump can stay until it's rescheduled. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Republican, Presidential Candidate, Trump supporter, and business leader #HermanCain has passed away due to #COVID19 prayers for his family and friends.

TRUMP 2020
TRUMP 2020Trump will go down in history as the world’s greatest mass murders in the history of the world.  Fact.152,000 dead and should not have died.
Trump killed #HermanCain . Everything he touches dies.

Grace &amp; dignity shown in Atlanta by our former Presidents. Complete garbage from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Trump is not and never will be in the same class as those 3 past Presidents.
Guys it’s time to wake up. Trump has lost his marbles. All he is worried and concerned about is his re-election while over 1000 people are dying in this country due to his his mismanagement of this virus. Work with your fellow Senators to kick the moron out.
The day Trump came down the Escilator
Idiot Trump is only doing all of this to completey Disrespect John Lewis And his Honorable Legacy. One of which Trumps will only be as Racist Criminal Fraud Liar Moron Lunatic Idiotic Discase to America and its Biggest mistake and Regret.
Trump needs to stop calling them the “silent majority.” The term “silent but deadly” is much more fitting and accurate.
Ad hominem attacks, how surprising. So the people who listen to a liar like Trump are woke and the people listening to reputable sources of info are sheep, huh? No wonder Trump loves the uneducated.
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
Texas is fine.  We all know these covid numbers are propaganda to derail Trump.
You misspelled Trump. #VoteTrumpToSaveAmerica2020
The most amount of money you’ve ever received in your check thanks to trump. Obama isn’t even a citizen, he’s gay, and Michelle’s a man. He is also a part of the Jeff Epstein scandal and is a part of the lawsuit Hillary is going through for all them emails.
Idk im not for him. But Obama during his term deported thousands more than trump. And the ice facilities the way they are now is because of Obama. Not to mention Obama bombed countries left and right. Trump is brining light to the child trafficking pandemic and this is
Trump’s attempts at sincerity remind me of Pitt football injuries. (If you get this, we can be friends.)
Bless his Heart!! Fuck Trump!
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
Thread by  No mechanism exists that I am aware of for delaying a Presidential election. Trump also is aware of this. Trump is  Left again. This never gets old. Trump **wants mail in voting**. He is going to keep trolling them into demandin…
Thread by  OMG...IT'S GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE TOP OF IT NOW... You think TRUMP SUPPORTERS will be PASSITURN OUT this November? When they keep being ENRAGED by DC elite crap like this? We **can't wait** for November 3…
Well unfortunately he's a Trump supporter and believes in a lot of stupid conspiracy theories.
"How do you abandon deeply held beliefs about character, personal responsibility, foreign policy and the national debt in a matter of months? You don’t. The obvious answer is those beliefs weren’t deeply held."
Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the Implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship  via
We will vote and we will vote Trump, right Joe?
Sue? We’re voting for Trump, even Joe knows it.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on!
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won’t oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Obama fought for what he believed in and would not back down.  Trump does the same thing.  Mitt, rolled over, and still does whenever the Leftist press put pressure on him.
68% of “Trump voters” maybe.
Make no mistake. This is Trump's version of "There goes the neighborhood".
So it begins.
And here we go. Trump suggests delaying the election.
Love the NBA but they’re the most hypocritically professional sports league. Speak up to Trump, but hush up for their communism leaders #puppets
If you listen 2 Mary Trump's Interview &amp; read her book it speaks volumes of what a mad man we have in our Oval Office. It's crystal clear he's lying about the Bounty to protect Putin. Without ? Trump is THE biggest TRAITOR this country has seen in a long time.
Every time U get caught with your pants down U ALWAYS USE "A lot of People are Saying" YET we NEVER hear who these people are. It's a PATTERN-CHECK OUT TRUMP'S RECORD 2 PROTECT PUTIN:  #Helsinki #Kurds #Bounty #Germany INTENTIONALLY Endangers Allies-OUR Troops!
It boggles the mind ANY AMERICAN will even bother 2 listen 2 a Pathological LIAR over what Scientists &amp; Doctors have told us over and over. If Trump is talking about the virus just turn your TV off, quit listening 2 someone who's ALWAYS WRONG! Don't allow him 2 make U a statistic
This Trump?! 😂 Y'all are drowning in hypocrisy.
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE
Trump thinks the educated people in the suburbs will fall for this inside of the last 100 days.  I hope he’s not right.
Nope, just telling the truth. The truth hurts  doesn’t it. Mr. Trump
Shoot  why not sooner if it's so important?  How long have you had the authority to do this?  One would think that it would have been done long ago unless this is a purely political move.  I'm not a Trump supporter so not saying it has anything to do with him.
Is that the statement where Biden implied Trump was Xenophobic for restricting travel from China?
This is about as clear as it gets why we need President Trump out of office mostly from his own mouth and tweets! My personal opinion.
Sure build one next to a Trump Tower!!
As does China, The World Health Organization, Cuomo, De Blasio, and many others. But sure, make yourself feel better and blame it all on Trump.
Trump defends sharing bogus COVID-19 'cure' at odds with his own FDA  via   Why did America have to get the DUMBEST WORLD LEADER EVER?
No matter how much you might dislike Trump.  Why would you even vote for Biden?  He is obviously mentally compromised and delusional.  He needs to be in a Hospice
has been dragging their feet regarding this TRUMP VIRUS for months!!! #TrumpDeathToll150K   #TrumpDeathToll150K   #TrumpDeathToll150K   #TrumpDeathToll150K   #TrumpDeathToll150K
No matter How much someone dislikes Trump how can anyone believe this is a better choice.  I firmly believe Biden is mentally incapacitated and could not even order a Happy Meal at McDonald's
Putin is going totally sell that vaccine to trump. You know to help him win the election😳
I’m sorry if I offend you, but fuck Trump (:
The exact same answer that the democrats have to every law that Trump has proposed. Hmm.

Mr Trump YOU are the one we want to vote out
This is a decision from President Trump? Why aren’t you making real decisions for the people?
Really? It’s Trump?
I guess all we can hope is that the rest of the world has put a mental "pause" on us and will "unpause" when trump is gone.
This is what we are up against... thousands of doctors have success but they cannot and will not let Trump be right. ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ #Trump2020 #Plandemic #WWG1WGA

I’m not saying they are great. I know that Obama was the Deporter in chief. I’m just saying that trump truly just wants us out of here sooner than Obama/Biden ever did. And if you are happy with this 4 yr and how trump does business then, I guess you deserve trump as a president.
Newest Covid 19 test released under Trump administration...many people say it’s pretty accurate.
I do have a strong anti-Trump bias yes... But I'm pretty much a lifelong Republican and I'm not naive enough to think there aren't "Radical leftist" viewpoints out there. I just hate that there's no "middle ground" lately.
He established a council to restore black neighborhoods, he once dated a black woman, he granted clemency to Alice Johnson, he upgraded MLKs birthplace to a national park, he promotes HBCUs...Trump isn’t racist.
No kidding I felt the same way. Who knew that he would be such a GREAT President. If he could run I would vote for President Trump a fourth term. 🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Former prosecutor, he rocks,  I would love for him to question tRump!!!
Same here. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2016 because I didn't feel good about Trump or Clinton. As much I'd like to see third parties get traction, this election is all about country over party
One of My Hall of Fame Fuck That Guy! Guys. Other than trump having a monetary investment in the millions of debunked, dangerous doses he and Navarro are stuck with, why are he and his trump tv White power hour cronies pushing it like his Dealers? That and alien DNA 🧬??
Why would you blame Trump?
Trump isn’t a racist though.
I don’t hate Trump. I admire him. I think what he has done for our country is so incredibly wonderful! Look, I get why you don’t like him, you’re fed negative lies shoot him every day on your fake news, plus he beat your hillbilly lady for President. That had to hurt. TOO BAD.
Trump isn’t a racist.
I am literally Terrified about the Election. No Rule of Law, Barr propagating trumps corrupt agenda and claiming falsely that Vote by Mail is fraudulent and will compromise upcoming election, admitting outwardly today that he will help trump Cheat!! I wish He could be impeached
The same person that starts all lies about Trump: Trump.
She’s one of the daughters of the best President if the USA, Donald Trump.
Trump said he doesn't understand why nobody likes him...go figure.
Why u want Trump?
Y’all gonna flip shit when you learn that Obama, Bush, Clinton, Pence, Biden, and Trump are all on the same team.
He’s only inspectin it... just like Donald Trump.
HQC isn’t a “big pharma” drug though...That’s also Trump’s message. It’s cheap, can be paid for even out of pocket for around $50 if needed, and big pharma doesn’t like it all.
One got on drugs and messed up his teeth and the other voted for Trump
It isn’t a stretch at all. Why is Fauci changing what he says all the time? Because his people have told him to change to be against Trump.
Then what is Doctor Brian Proctor curing people with? It’s too bad you don’t like Trump...he keeps giving the right info out, you just don’t like him.
If Trump wins again, Covid will continue to last “somehow”, but if Biden wins, Covid will disappear around Feb 2021 right after Biden takes office.
No, you wouldn’t be so demanding “WHO IS YOUR DOCTOR???” to the other person...calm down Greta. Doctors ARE out there stopping C19 with HCQ and it works. Sorry Trump called it back in March, but just because you don’t like him doesn’t mean he can’t be right.
Across the board...If Trump loses in November, then Covid will be gone in February. If Trump wins, then Covid will still be here because there’s “always a reason to blame Trump” when he’s been touting HQC all along.
Fauci told Trump not to have people wear masks...remember?
People for Trump aren’t burning things...that’s BLM rioters. You’re confused.
Trump campaign accused of breaking federal campaign spending rules - Business Insider
Trump took it back in March. It works. They don’t want to be TRUMPED again!
That’s debatable. Take Chicago for example. Obama pumped millions of dollars into that city. Yes, Trump withdrew the remaining funding, but Chicago saw little to none of that money for improved infrastructure.
Just as well.  doesn't belong anyplace where honor and courage are celebrated.
Dancing all over my house when Trump loses.
Depends. It Trump wins, Covid continues...if Biden wins, *poof* it magically goes away and we’ve found a cure around February if he takes office.
If the US weren't such a biased partner anymore then of course it would be a worthwhile relationship. Even outside of Trump, the domestic &amp; external political realities in America are chauvinist and hysterical. Record homelessness/rent defaults &amp; we still give BILLIONS to Israel.
I seen the trump cut off and I knew all I needed to know
Trump just put his mask on and what do you see? The backtracking of these corporations. I’m going to wear a mask until things go back to normal because 1. I like how I look with one &amp; 2. Maybe folks will think I have it and will stay tf away from me😂

"Donald Trump's thugs" these people need to watch my Ferguson livestreams from Obama era to understand how deluded they are on this false partisan divide over our 9/11 Patriot Act Secret Police. George W. Bush CREATED all this nat sec BULLSHIT with overwhelming Dem support.
It's easy for liberal Zionists with money to use Trump as a bögeyman to enact a shared Zionist vision for the Middle East. It's clear that this is more important than Americans' quality of life, some will fuel antisemitism &amp; cause incidents like Pittsburgh to push more to Israel.
They're working together. Trump was necessary to advance goals quickly before the 70-90 year old Zionist boomer crowd with all the money and political clout dies off. Biden isna bigger Zionist than Trump, he's made Christian congressmen calling themselves "Zionist" a whole thing.
....ohhhh ✋🏽 ohhhh ✋🏽...now do Trump. I’ll gladly wait...

I mean trump is one, trump is a closeted one, that’s the ones you gotta lol out for.
I mean trump struggles with pronouncing certain words in his speeches, so they both old. What do u expect. We gotta choose better candidates be a both of them ain’t good.
Have you not heard Trump’s speeches yet?
Also, Trump was the one who sent the feds, who perpetrated the violence in Portland. The protesters were peaceful until the feds wanted them to leave because there were so many people. The people did not want to leave, so the feds use violent force and tear gas to get rid of them
I don’t think it’s the Democratic Party. I KNOW it’s the Democratic Party. Is Trump perfect? No. But he’s doing a hell of a lot more than Obama ever did in office.

Herman Cain died for being a Trump follower.
Love this screen name. The liberals hate it when Trump talks to Putin. But they are working hard to make us more like the failed Soviet Union. Truly irrational.
You two have it WRONG. President  Trump  was asking  a question  so he could point out that mail in voting is not needed!!
If I have to vote for Trump in a hazmat suit come November I will do it.
You are a fraud... criticize trump while all ur Bros hate on the LGBTQ community
Why no warp speed approach to study hydroxychloroquine? Unless Trump is just selling us snake oil.
Paula, if possible, please ask Trump if Herman Cain signed the waiver before the Tulsa rally.  Curious.
Dear   and other WH Press, If possible, please ask Trump if Herman Cain signed the waiver before attending the Tulsa rally. Thanking you in advance.
Trump first announced his candidacy for President in the late summer of 2015. And you can bet he was planning it several months if not years ahead, starting with his "birtherist" claims against Obama.
Trump's fumbling is easily explained by his inability to trust intelligence agencies who are clearly opposed to him, and obfuscation by your friends in Beijing.
It’s so funnny to watch the left praise people they labeled terrible people just a few years ago just because they dont support Trump.   They praise Bush, but claim he hated black people  They praise Romney, but claim would put blacks back in chains.   Make up your minds.
Let’s be honest.  Trump wasn’t invited.

Upon losing the election, Trump's fade into irrelevance will be one of the most amazing transitions ever. Most of us will simply be done with him. He'll claim to be a martyr and that the system is rigged, but his tweets won't matter anymore.
Read This: "It’s Hard to Find a Trump Who Hasn’t Voted by Mail" Here trump is such a hypocrite. His whole family votes by mail, many in his administration voted by mail, but now voting by mail is fraudulent! trump is the real fraud! ✊🏻🇺🇸
Why leave out that he traveled a lot before and after the rally and could have gotten it from traveling? Must suck to think Trump Trump Trump 24/7.
There's no doubt Trump will claim illegitimacy in the election if he loses. But that election will be on 11/3. He can't change that date or dismiss the results.

At this point in history I quit flying 🇺🇸 at my house, except national holidays, because of trump. I fly the Texas flag everyday instead . When the trump administration is voted out I will resume flying the 🇺🇸 everyday. It’s pretty damned sad.
I don't see the importance of Kasich. He is no different than Romney, Bush or the late Sen Mccain. None of them liked the President. The fact, that he going to speak at the DNC won't influence my voting for President Trump.
But, Trump and his Deplorables are "divisive."
The going after Bill Barr now.becsauce the got nothing  on Trump.
Trump put immigrant children in cages, dude. Get with the times, republicans suck
Oh yeah I completely agree. Money has no place in politics and rich people suck. Do you also hate the trump family who do business in China? Or all the rich people in Trump's cabinet? Sounds like you're in favor of a marginal tax rate that would tax the rich...
Great news for the PRC and the Socialists Dems. Bad day for freedom  and personal liberty if Biden wins. Oh I forgot you don’t care do you, just want to win at all cost.Thats all you care about ; put down Trump.
If hydroxychloroqine worked... People would get well, go to work, go to school. President Trump will be right. The economy would soar, the employment numbers would go back up. Small business would come back.Fear and Anxiety would ease... America would heal. Oh No!
People would get well, go to work, go to school. President Trump will be right. The economy would soar, the employment numbers would go back up. Small business would come back.Fear and Anxiety would ease... America would heal. Oh No! The Dems want nothing to do with any of that!

President Trump won't be visiting the Capitol to pay respects to Rep. John Lewis, reports   via
But the #democrats will take away your freedom, guns, free speech, religion, fuel, safety, ability to earn a living, plus raise your taxes to 30% or higher, and worse... why would you want that? It baffles me why people would embrace that just because they dislike Trump.
Rep. Swalwell expertly corners Bill Barr and details evidence of Trump’s crimes
Even Independent voters are seeing through the liberal skim , its' helping President Trump
Just another attempt to get to Trump.  Wake up . I can sue Houston &amp; put Trump name on it 2.  What happen to porn stars. They weren't little girls.  He may be a lot of things tactless,  womanizer,  rude, add what you want.  Pedophile isn't 1 of those.  Find your next distraction
Not everyone peeps into peoples bedrooms. In rich circles many things aren't talked about.  Beating your wife, kids,  molesting kids, money. In my house I wouldn't assume that on anyone. Name someone in that trafficking ring that mentions Trump.  Please
FB Friends:  My prediction, first made on 6/30/2020, check it out, was an Electoral Vote Count  at the end of the day on 11/3/2020:  Trump: 400  Joe:      138  Leading up to that historic vote though, who do you think has been the Best President of the 2 pictured: Trump or Obama?
This wasn't Donald Trump, this was a press conference held by legitimate doctors who are currently working and saving their patients. #Liberals want everything closed and everyone to be afraid, they care more about winning an election than about people's lives. #FauciTheFraud
Now I see where you get your medical info from   - a total whack job, no wonder you and Trump like her.
Simple.  Because Trump originally said the treatment looked promising and they jumped ALL OVER HIM and now don’t want to eat crow for that.  They don’t give a s**t about people’s lives.
If you don’t support trump go donate all the stimulus check money you’re about to get.
Trump 2020🇺🇸👍
Trump 2020🇺🇸👍
The more the riots go on, the more Trump is likely to win.  But Democrats have lost control of their militant wing.  The script is flipped.
The entire article:
99 more day then we can hand you and Trump pink slips. Oh that means you are fired.
Support her opponent, her opposition to Biden means she is a Trump supporter.
Read Mary Trump's book about Fred and  . It will help you understand the lies. It's because he can. Nobody makes a big enough deal out of it. He just does it and gets away with it it. Hopefully a jury sometime next year will not be so tolerant of his lying for fun
I guess he did not have Russian ties so Trump will now bash him after Steve told him to 🖕off three times.  By the way Brit, wipe the orange 💩 off your lips every once in a while.
Just because it hasn't happened, Trump and his minions will come for you.  Take no comfort in not being his target yet.
Gregg Jarrett: Christopher Steele's secret source for anti-Trump dossier is finally exposed
What happens if you hold. trump sign in Harlem?
Miss Lindsey, A little late now! That should’ve been done 4 years ago when Trump was complaining about China!
You’ve earned the fight you are going to get.  I hope  puts you out to pasture after you betrayed your citizens to be a Trump sycophant.  Only Trump and his minions could turn Texas blue.
Oh they’re gonna burn down all democratic polling places? trump in a landslide.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Here is the Atlantic article the interview came from (the term is slang for a political lose-lose).  Here is the Atlantic article it originally came from:
Here is the Atlantic article it originally came from:
CSPAN host silent as caller threatens 'a lot of bloodshed' against Trump supporters
Hey dummy if mayors are not doing their job and tying the hands of their police . President Trump has the responsibility to act and protect the citizens
It makes expensive meals &amp; events at Trump properties tax deductible.
Mr Navarro is one of several that mocked Dr. Fauci try at throwing the first pitch. This is another piece for the liberal media (Politico) at the 'Divide &amp; conquer technique, to produce as much comflict , within the Trump admin....
Trump supporters aren’t even pretending they aren’t sexist assholes any more
I think this is fake news, as much as it would be delicious irony. Corpus paper says unlikely. Also, where's WaPo's story? No way this wouldn't be headlines
I don't think so. Corpus paper says unlikely. Also, where's WaPo's story? No way this wouldn't be headlines
She also says she prays every day, I don’t know who she prays to but I think God is a little bit more powerful than President Trump.
Hey idiot - the country is burning due to fascist stormtroopers attacking vets, moms, and peaceful protesters at the direction of Trump and his SS leader  and is in crisis due a pandemic and a recession.  Stop with the deflection and deal with the problems.
When Trump kick y’all to the curb. No don’t come back to the black community for support
1994 Crime Bill young “black males predators”, plus young black males put in prison disproportionately......if “you vote for Trump you aren’t black” and 1977 “RACIAL JUNGLES” if there’s integration!!! Who’s #RACIST??? #LyingsleepyJoe
Trump did push for Russia to rejoin. Trump has only addressed the bounties by saying that he wasn't briefed. There's plenty information available for him to understand Russia's intentions, but the buffoon dithers. So, the conclusion is that you are talking out of your ass.
I guess they’re “spinning in their graves” bc all of their statues have been or been attempted to be destroyed. It’s up to Trump to save this country from that kind of destruction!
Trump you are delusional!! What have you done in the last 100 days but let 145,000 and counting American people die from COVID19 because you failed to take it serious?
Trump you called the Coronavirus a HOAX!!!
The crises were all made by the #deepstate, from even before Trump took oath of office. They were already working on the setup of the #RussiaHoax, then covering for #quidproJoe's fab deal in Ukraine, then #impeachment, then #COVID19. #DemocratsAreMarxistsDestroyingAmerica
Yeah 100 Days Until Trump Embarrasses The Living Toilet Crap Out Of You And Wallops You In The General Election You're Not Going Anywhere Bunker Basement Joe #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDEVICTORY
Great visual metaphor for the entire disaster of Trump’s presidency.
Trump and his sycophants are an unnecessary evil.
Thats why Trump declared ANTIFA as a terrorist organization.  Their mere  presence is dangerous thus killing one is justified homicide
CDC Sides With Trump, Says Students Need To Go Back To School
Donald Trump says he won't be able to throw first pitch at Yankees-Red Sox game - Strong focus😂😂😂😂😂😂  What he means is that it will conflict with his golf game that weekend.
Trump should never be in a portrait with these people who actually served their country! He serves no one but himself!The others shown in this picture weren’t dictators like Trump! They were brave, humble, and honorable. None of those words apply to Trump! #MoroninCheif  #NotMeUs
Nobody asked you to throw out the pitch, they blame you for your piss poor handling of the Trump virus.
Can you imagine the complete and utter delusion behind this picture? Who in the world thinks that the people who created and led this country would be behind this travesty of a president? The Reagan library has requested that Trump and the RNC stop even using Reagan's name!
Hey  - care to have Trump comment on this, oh never mind, he still hasn’t commented on the Russian bounties on US soldiers and neither have you.  You are a disgusting pile of 💩.
Here you go  - Trump finally announced his plan and I am sure you will support it just like  and  have for the pandemic.
That is why we have President Trump
Never has and never did. Floyd was used by the Democrat’s to stage this anti Trump/ anti America war. Just another example of how the Democrat’s use race to their advantage.
Um, is trump wearing a blue suit coat with black pants? Or is that just the lighting?
The 11/3/2020 Vote will be: Trump 400 Biden 138 Bob Lewis Vietnam Vet
and no.. this isn’t trump’s america. its not trump supporters that are out there destroying property and getting innocent ppl killed in the crossfire. its trumps opposers that are causing the violence.
You are such a NEGATIVE person and we all want to know what happened in your childhood to make you so hateful and non apathetic? Mary Trump might know🤷🏼‍♀️
And how much did this Cost Americans? tRump golf vs OBAMA golf...?!?
Amazing nobody paid any attention to President Trump until he decided to run for office.The amount of hate people have for him only shows me their true character of Socialism . I’ll be the first to say POTUS is far from perfect, but he’s focused on the United States.
What's the Biden plan Trump claims would "destroy" suburbs?  #FoxBusiness If You Vote Democratic Party In November the Suburbs as we know it will be destroyed!
Without a doubt the   can no longer be trusted due to them now being nothing but Trump ball lickers.
So Calgary loves Trump a$$ lickers, good to know.
President Trump is doing this??? Ummmm...no. Seriously, dude, just for one freaking second have an honest thought in your head. President Trump is NOT your city’s problem. #StopTheViolence
But Trump loves his idols so there is a big problem there. Then we have christians defending the love of idols and that's another problem. Then we have the propagandist  defending idols and that's another big problem.
You know, I once was a fan. 🤦🏼‍♀️ The economy was wrecked because of the pandemic. It’s bouncing back.  V.  The greatest number of deaths, per million, is in democratic run states. President Trump is a great President. You are a fool, that I used to think was somebody. #Trump2020 🇺🇸
Secret source for anti-Trump Steele dossier is revealed
Native scholar says Communist China has 'met its match' with Trump admin following consulate closure
You do realize that #Trump was the president who signed the First Step Act that Clinton/Biden and #democrats made, which eliminated 3 strikes and freed many minorities from unfair sentences, giving them a second chance in life?
Imagine thinking Trump is the cause of all racial tension within an inherently racist US, yet you had an Black American President for 8 years who didn’t do shit for black Americans while in office.
These Trump Campaign Payments to the Trump Organization Look Shady as Hell
Just came back from a road to Florida from Texas and did not see anything related to Biden. Saw Trump stickers, flags and signs.
Ok, I really don’t care...and trump talking chaps your ass regardless of the subject so again, I don’t care about your ridiculous opinion
Nice try Ronny this was going on long before our great President Trump
Dana Carvey on Regis helping to create his Trump impression: you start with Regis, and then you add Brando, it combines to make Trump!

He wants trump re-elected
I wonder if the black trump supporter’s life matters

'Trump Might Not Accept The Results Of The 2020 Election,' Says Movement That Still Hasn't Accepted Results Of 2016 Election
I was thinking. Why waste time-Start at the top and work your way down.
The Lincoln Project. Republicans against Trump.  These are two of your biggest fan clubs huh?
Trump said in the beginning he would help and the governors said NO! Serves them right...they hate Trump more than they move their communities!
We want to leave but trump has ruined the country
For someone that doesn't like President Trump, Ms McCain went through Mary Trump vendictive motives for writing a garbage book extremely strong
y’all scream fuck trump &amp; everything he stand 4 then stay in his hotel for 3 nights. y’all are sooooo fuckin embarrassing.
Baseball is my happy place! Some much needed distraction from the shit show that is Trump and his band of idiots and criminals! #DumpTrump2020  #TrumpMustGo  #LiarInChief  #CheaterInCharge  #InjectDisinfectantsHeSaid  #WorstPresidentEver
At least until Trump is out of office, until that time they'll keep on with the same BS on repeat.. fear the virus.. riots are good and peaceful.. Republicans are bad.. racial tensions are good.. peace and equality is bad.
No arrest..tired of waiting like most of us that voted for Trump. Come on!
At least Trump can recognize a cartoon picture of an elephant.  Well,  at least when he only has 5 animals to choose from.
This as Trump gives billions of our money to Big Pharma for untested vaccines.
The Narativ sessions provide great investigative reporting on trump, Putin, Epstein/Maxwell, mob influence, etc. This interview with  lives up to the high bar they set. The whole session is great, but from 1:09 on is pure gold.
Lots of subcontractors hated Trump after he refused to pay for their work.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Trump and the Republicans have no plan to fight the coronavirus, and no compassion for the citizens who have been devastated by the economic recession.   No plan, no ideas, Republicans have no interest in helping American families.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
He’ll yeah Trxas Trump Truck
trump. #AmericasGreatestMistake
Trump2020  #BuyGoya #buycott #TrumpTrain2020 #trump #Trump2020
It takes a special kind of dumb to believe anything the Trump administration puts out.  Congrats
Like this or nah?
I'm not a Trump supporter. I just think most (not all) of his critics are as full of shit as he is.
MSM is getting desperate again, There is Never-Trump from 2016, but the "RED Flag" if really 'Republican' would never-never vote 'Democrat. We would write-in our republican choice. The fake news is using the divide &amp; conquer technique.
2/2 There is some interest in stability, but I hate every single thing Trump has done, so I don't know... too bad we can't get stuff passed by consensus, though that is what Obama tried to do, and look where we are now. I'm hoping smarter people than me figure this out
1/2 Been struggling with this. I want Biden to just undo everything Trump did. But that is what Trump did in re Obama. What I don't want is for every time we switch parties in control, they just go through and undo the previous admin's actions.
This is a standard dementia test for any Medicare patients. Trump spinning it into he has high IQ is laughable.
Mayors see broken trust, political agenda in Trump's surge of federal officers to US cities
Really amazing how Marie thinks she can read other's minds-"President was scared noone would show up"; "Trump and his advisors are worried about the image" but doesn't understand  "yes or no" question and blathers on with Dem talking points.
I detest  and I am offended that you, "Little Marco," should even insinuate that hating Trump is connected to not being 100% patriotic. Trump is a conman that got elected because he out did weak people like you.
Let’s postpone the elections until the Democrat’s quit manipulating crisis after crisis. How’s that sound Democrat’s. Trump can stay right where he is. Works for me.
King Trump
Time for some Trump rallies
They are waiting for President Trump to fix the problem so they can take credit for it just like they tried to take credit for the economy.
California is not super Dem like people make it out to be. It’s incredibly red. The 4 major cities are blue but that’s it and then it’s shaky. Trump country is deep in California so this isn’t shocking.
Shame it took you so long to put Texans over Trump. Time for you to go. You are no better than him playing political with human lives.
It will only be over if Trump loses.
Trump Abruptly Cancels Republican Convention in Jacksonville: ‘It’s Not the Right Time’
Hello Dear Mr. President Donald J. Trump, if you want to drive the left crazy and the media nuts. Plus give a rest to your supporters a few day from Trump fatigue. Disappear for 2 weeks from the spot light, enjoy family life. Watch Americans rise, appreciate your work .
Let me see if I can guess...  “Trump made me so angry I couldn’t help it.”  What do I win?
Nothing you said is true. You should wake up. I will pray for you President Trump greatest president EVER #TRUMP2020
Since none of the polling companies have called me for my opinion, I want to certify that I strongly disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic. And I am not reassured knowing that Trump can recognize a cartoon picture of an elephant.  #VoteBlue2020
Would you PLEASE ask President Trump about the Russian bounties in tomorrow's briefing? And hammer him about his stormtroopers as well?. As satisfying as it is to see him grovel about Jacksonville he needs to be accountable.
Would you PLEASE ask President Trump about the Russian bounties in tomorrow's briefing?
Would you PLEASE ask Trump about the Russian bounties tomorrow?
Would you PLEASE asking Trump about the Russian bounties tomorrow?
Trump is already on it !
I think Nancy forgot about how she tried to put everyone in harm's way by saying "come on out to Chinatown, go shopping, everything is fine" &amp; calling Trump racist for stopping air travel from China.
This #NeverTrumper celebrates every one of your (many) comical failures.  Hooray for the comedy that is #trump. Makes every day worth waking up for.   #ridingwithbiden
And he blamed Trump for sending in help.  What an airhead.
July 22- more than 200 Texan deaths.  and Trump are failing us! #COVID19TX #COVID19Pandemic
Personally is contagious is all this is even with a very very less than 1% death rate it's not worth the risk I mean if you can do it safely been great if you cannot I don't think we need to lose any Trump supporters do you?
I've said this before:  Notice how Trump's attitude about the virus suddenly changed after they took the data away from the CDC.  What do you think they saw?
So the White House is encouraging Trump to resign?
Tell trump to have them stop. This smells of being orchestrated by him to scare the white folk.
Top General Called Trump 'an Idiot' and Said Melania Was 'Inquisitive
Trump won’t actually do it.
Unlike you, I follow facts. Trump was never seen on the island. None of the victims said they saw him. But you can keep your head in the sand.
#JoeBiden is corrupt as hell, everyone knows it. But the #dems hate Trump so they will even vote for the most corrupt, #deepstate puppet with Alzheimers before they choose Trump.
WATCH: Top Trump campaign official urges Catholics to ‘call out’ Dem governors ‘who deny you Mass’ | News | LifeSite
I really believe the hate of Trump is a mental illness.
Wrong.  CNN reported on several occasions that there was no wiretap on Trump’s campaign.  That was patently false.  Not only was there a wiretap, but it was illegally unmasked and the transcripts walked into the WH.
I’m sure that our intelligence agencies have more than enough information and proof to remove Trump from office. Treason, pedaphile, money laundering, Russian asset, mob connections, tax evasion, bounties on our soldiers. And they do nothing...
Looking good don’t you think  - only a Trump ass kisser would try and play this as making progress.
trump will add the memory test to his ability to drink water, and walk down a ramp, when he starts his rallies again.     #TrumpIsALaughingStock   #Biden2020 ✊🏻🇺🇸
What is sad, with the main stream media, some days we NEED that reminder.  Vote TEXAS RED 2020!  Download the Trump 2020 app today!
Trump, the most lawless President ever  is taking up the "law and order" mantle of past Republican presidential candidates. He's the consummate con artist.
Ken is currently under indictment on 3 criminal charges.  Very on brand for the Trump criminal enterprise.
It not Trump, it’s that he is exposing their corruption. And threatening their power and illicit funds. Show me how a political figure can go into politics broke and leave a multi millionaire. Obama for example.
They should be charged with causing Trump Derangement Syndrome in pea brained left wing dolts
Pro Trump demonstration in Temecula California. Over 5000 people saying they had enough of Liberal Democrat Pelosi &amp; Gavin Newsom destructive policies against the state of California. Protesters ask to recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Fake, I live in the same area, Trump 2020 signs everywhere. I drive to med center everyday and I have not seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker!
biden would only be responsible if he didn’t have NG ready in case state governors called for help. imo, trump has taken too long on some things so maybe he is at fault. i just know y’all wouldn’t like me as president. i’d put all these assholes in prison.
but isn’t it true? what are they rioting for? who is allowing this to happen? idk if you have hate for trump, but if you do, your hate is blinding you. i dont see how DJT stopping this is bad.
whats bad about trump sending ‘secret’ police? what don’t ppl understand about that? the cities are being destroyed, so they need to be stopped. it’s doesn’t make him a bad guy or a ‘dictator’.
Yep my Great President Trump #Trump2020
It’s not just Trump, it’s all his fascist enablers
I suggest the  and Trump supporters go last since it’s just a hoax to them.
So Ebony - I see you now work for the Fuhrer Herr Trump.  Zero credibility and zero integrity, but that is exactly who works for
And, let's remember, Republicans voted for Trump twice.
Chicago and other #democrat mayors are total hypocrites. Their citizens are getting slaughtered by the hundreds, all in the name of TYRANNY, and yet blame Donald #Trump for  cleaning up violence in their cities, which is supposed to be THEIR job to protect and serve citizens!
Yeah, could really tell by all of the Biden bumper stickers. Sounds like 2016,again. Will you let Biden participate in a live debate with President Trump?
But it's Trump's America
Just a reminder,   China levied sanctions on Ted Cruz and Rubio. Now the Chinese consolate that handles world for Texas and Florida has been closed by Trump.
Did I get this straight?  Trump left the COVID-19 battle to local officials,  but insists that he must help them fight ordinary street crime. (Although, sending a hundred undisciplined agents is not really any help.) #TrumpsGestapo
The real issue is that Trump thinks that he passed some kind of IQ test. He just doesn't get it.
if all Q being banned on twitter, the covid ‘reporting errors’, the unconstitutional shut downs, the democrat mayors trashing trump as their cities burn and their ppl die don’t convince you of the agenda at play.. then you are a very gullible human.
I'm all for you, Joe! But maybe you can apologize for that "first racist president" comment...Trump is just the latest in a long line of racist presidents - he's most likely the 44th racist president, honestly. Why don't you just vow to not be racist, and leave it there?
So... showing a picture of violence in Trump's America is supposed to scare people about Biden being president? Did I get that right? The saddest thing is that his people won't get the disconnect
Once the election is over if Trump wins he will order military force and clean it all up...Let’s face it, the governors and local city officials have shown they won’t do Sh*t...it’s beyond ridiculous...It’s played outSo make sure you never call the cops when you get in a accident or get robbed or if anything that one would need the police for. You call Trump an idiot but  I bet you sure like those tax cuts. And of you have stocks you like those stocks.
A deal to stop nuclear proliferation. Compare to Trump's deal with Saudi where he gave them nuclear tech, weapons, intelligence on Khashoggi. They financed 911 btw.
Ok, here is Trump saying he ignored the experts. Full interview hasn't dropped yet.
LOL considering I don't have cable or antenna to my TVs? I love when you folks make this claim. Now you'll say it's the info I get from my phone. Which is funny as well since I read from a variety of opposing sources I don't trust gov, but you trust Trump, who is the government.
You realize Trump has largely ignored most of the advice from his experts, right?
Ok, he takes it in the squatter from his wife/husband, he was raised by a porn model, he gave 15-billion of Taxpayer money to a known enemy, he spied on Trump, during an election!! Does anyone expect him to display some type of moral fortitude?
To be fair, due to trump and the trumpvirus, the job market looks pretty bad.
Yes, we really need to call out the bias of someone willing to denounce...*checks notes*...Trump's federal warfare?
Hey, Trump can change that rule!  You know, the same way Democrats change rules all the time for their benefit. What's good for the goose is good for the gander!😂
I'm listening to King George while the TV, on mute, shows Trump's press conference. It works.
Trump’s October Surprise: A Vaccine for Covid-19? via
I dont know, I didn't like how Ted and Mike Lee acted at the Republican convention toward Trump. Even though Trump won, they still wouldn't endorse him. Their actions could have given Hillary the win!! I thought that was shameful!  Thank God those two weren't successful !
Paul Weyrich already did that. So did the kochs. Trump merely expanded on Reagan. Soon, forty years of Reaganomics and talibangelical theology will be be repudiated.
And why shouldn't he support the police and Trump? Stop just hating and educate yourself on the facts of what great things Trump has done for this country. I'm not a fan of a lot of cops but I know not all are bad. With out cops as u can see in Portland evil will accure.
I think we both know why ppl leave certain areas no matter the race. What were you implying about Trump admin stopping the the movement of “certain” ppl? My comments were about first hand knowledge of a white housing project.
Way to get things right, President Trump!
I guess Kanye didnt get the memo as Trump missed it too. Only political hacks can govern.
We all had trump freaking out and not wanting to leave the whitehouse on the 2020 bingo
How does anyone prepare with your sides constant hypocrisy and exploitative nature? This vid is nearly a month after Trump was called a racist for shutting travel off from Europe and China🤔. This virus was here long before we all knew you watch, was it intentional🤔
Just confirmed:
Donald Trump colluded with the Chinese government to manufacture a pandemic through a trade deal in January, and the result is the destruction of the US economy.
Liberals heads exploding over 'suspended elections' as if this is Trumps plan. Notice the question mark at the end of his sentence? Trump loves trolling Democrats. 😂 He puts these tweets out to keep them busy, while he laughs and moves on elsewhere to gets things done !😂

Yeah..exploited. Gotta keep this going. Exaggerated deaths and cases. Why?Well figure it out. Teacher unions making demands that hv nothing to do with covid but demanded charter schools close, money, hurt Trump/economy optics and so on. Welcome to the left

How does this prove trump is not a racist? Btw, you can leave the snark behind.
Aside from my awesome family, Donald J Trump, Michael Berry and Dan Bongino. But so many more.
The Putin puppet trump does it again! This has to stop! Vote in November to save America and get rid of this idiot president!!
So if Trump is a Nazi, there would be some of his books in her casual reading shelf, wouldn’t there?  Asking for a friend...🤔
Does Trump know how many voters work at the post office?  600-thousand.  They have families who vote, too.  This whiz kid wins by a razor thin 80,000 strategically placed voters, and offends a million people without a thought to the consequences.  This is why he’ll lose.
Is that why you call TRUMP RACIST? Because I personally know a lot of Black people who don’t want low income Blacks moving into their neighborhoods. BLACKS call LOW-CLASS BLACKS,HOOD-RATS or ghetto. So,are they called RACISTS, BIGOTS , BOUGIE or your every run-of-the-mill SNOBS.
After seeing 85%+ of evangelicals supporting trump, I will never accept that they are anything but hateful bigots.

Then the Dems and MSM went all #Batshyt Nuts and that was even more epic.....😂🤣 When the #Leftwingidiots Cry it’s a sure bet Trump, just hit em between the peepers again...
and hey babygirl just because they say one thing about trump doesnt mean they talk about politics
They also put in there billions for an FBI building so that a hotel cannot be built across from Trump's hotel in DC
Dictatorship versus democracy; communism versus free enterprise.  You’re NOT King Trump.
When Trump is gone in 4 more years, you'd do well to remember the cowardice and corruption of the Democrats that tried to stop him
Look man you are going to vote the way you vote and I will vote the way I vote. We won't convince each other to do otherwise. Though I don't listen to what Trump says, but I do see what he does.
Last thing I heard about that was that Trump never knew about that. Never made it to his desk. So it was not verified enough to make it to Trump. Might be Russian disinformation that the media loves to spread.
I bet all Democrat leaders have been on Hydroxychloriquine for many months!! Keeping it from the people shows they knowingly have murdered people to keep Trump frm having rallies, and to promote mail in balloting, bc cheating is their only hope of winning.  And they know it.
Donald Trump "requested" a mail-in ballot. Any citizen can request a mail-in ballot. When one request a mail-in ballot, they are validating that they are a) Alive, b.) Residing at a specific address, c.) Certifying that they are eligible to vote.
How does Trump do this ?  Uou make accusations but no proof by making accusations doesnt make it true
Trump Administration Refuses To Accept New DACA Applicants Despite Court Rulings
I agree, and have thought this for quite some time.  It's a shame. Trump tried by telling us at the beginning,  but ALL the so called expert went in a different direction. All for money and power.  Democrat leaders and China coordinated together on it!! I bet ya!!
Thank you sir!  Thank you for doing the work of the American people.  You and President Trump are my favorite great Americans.
There is a cure for Covid 19 and Trump called it very early! Hydroxychloroquine works!  Why have you suppressed the truth? The blood of Americans is on the hands of those who have suppressed the truth! Why are doctors who have cured hundreds being censored?
please do a whole show on why Trump is in constant contact with Putin. WHAT ARE THOSE PHONE CALLS ABOUT?!?
Americans trust Trump. Americans find your name-calling hateful! Our honorable AG Barr is not a blob. Please grow up!!
...and Trump/Putin have it figured out.
Trump's America
Also please explain how trump is a danger to this country. Is it because he will not lay down and take it like all the rest of the president have? Are you going to blame him for Covid19? If so stop there. It has been proven that Obama funded it.
Failing to vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Anything that gets Donald Trump out of office is not a terrible thing for the country.  Whatever works.
I can not wait to vote for President Trump!!!!
Nobody in their right mind would have cut taxes when the economy was decent. Yet we did. 6.6T in debt under trump
Dear President Trump,  we beg you to let us have access to Hydroxychloriquine!! Make it over the counter for the common man can walk into vf the store and buy it. #Hydroxychloroquineworks
you big bully..you chased Donald Trump away.. your scary lol
I have some jokes about trump and his goons but they are all stupid.
Watch this video of trump walking during his inauguration and compare it to the video of him in the lab this week. He doesn’t walk the same at all. Now he drags that right leg considerably. Wish I could do a side by side. #trumpgait #trumpstroke
#TRUMP BUILD THE WALL-A wall that didn't protect not one of the 100,000 #COVID19 DEATHS
When Trump says Payroll Tax Cut, he means cut Social Security. He thinks we are too dumb to realize that.
Jim Jordon is going to have a great bitch for Trump.
Remember when Obama, Comey, Rice and Hillary illegally interferred in Trump’s campaign? Remember all the lies??
I turned off the Barr hearing for awhile, and when I turned it back on, some Republican is asking the AG about Hillary Clinton investigations that occurred before he or Trump were in office?  Why don’t we re-investigate Teapot Dome while we’re at it?
Have you offered the CBP to quell the actions against Trump's boss? How sad that they appear to have fewer of their rights violated by their police than Americans in Portland.
Because it would end the pandemic. And that wouldn’t be good for Trump.
There's a new biography of James J Strang, the most fascinating Mormon figure you've never heard of, written by Miles Harvey, a bestselling author. Here's my review at  It's a gripping tale of confidence, fraud, murder, and mayhem.
Putin has dirt on Trump and Saudis have the same. They can kill their adversaries and Trump won't say a word about them. Our troops and reporters are targeted while Trump continues to ignore their actions without protecting people.
It did go down.  Trump sank it
Well Karen, there is no corruption to cover up by Trump unlike the many scandals under Obama / Biden!  Open your eyes!
We love you President Trump 🇺🇸❤ #TrumpLandslide2020
If your follow dem mayors don’t get control of the chaos in their cities. You will be handing Trump the election. I can’t believe you guys don’t see what you’re doing to your Democrat base voters. I see them leaving in mass to vote for law and order aka
Because Bill Gates stands to make money from a harmful vaccine!!! And dems need covid deaths to keep Trump from having rallies, and to keep Biden in the basement! God help us, the Democrats are the party of death!
Covid is the chinese and Democrats weapon against us and Trump.  They gotta keep death numbers up so Trump cant have rallies. Plus Bill Gates and probably Fauci stands to make billions on a vaccine that is not needed !
By who not Trump
Trump stated in a presser he took hcq as a preventative.  So yeah. Thanks for bringing this up.
I live in Texas- just north of Houston.  Drove to New Orleans last week with an overnight in Baton Rouge. Drove through both BR and New Orleans. Hundreds of Trump signs. 1 Biden. About 800 miles driven.
Right trump broke the American economy like he's done with all of his businesses.
Kinda like trump supporters at a 2016 trump rally.  You know punching and shoving non trump supporters.
Did Putin send some help? I always thought we'd see Russian troops here before Trump was done.
I'm sure Trump would love it if we used a THUNDERDOME to compete for those jobs. He's sit on a throne and preside over it, and in his mind this would seem perfectly right and good.
Shame on him. He knows full well how terrible Trump has been.
🤮 trump nuggets 🤮 ✌🏼💙
Sure is a contrast from all previous presidents in my lifetime. Too young to really recall Reagan but citizen first minded presidents sure seem out of the norm until Trump. The rest seemingly just enter to scheme more power and $$$&amp;

I mean, we knew Trump was trying to shore up the Mormon vote, just not *this* Mormon vote.
President Trump, I'm praying there is away to stop Democrats from trying to use Mail in ballots. Please reassure us there is!
Finally a true statement about testing! Turn around time!! So important yet trump denies anything to do with helping!!
Another travesty of justice and backing the racist president trump who is trying to turn America into a police state to over turn the election results!
So tired of trump’s lies and his cronies backing him up! We need to test and do contact tracing, but with trump’s denying everything we will be in this even longer! Trump is truly killing Americans!
I thought the same, but at the same time, why does someone wearing a USA hat have to support Trump? Surely non-Trump supporters support our country too... no?
Not so much. I grew up in a Dem house and bought into the BS. Started seeing through it during Carter's disaster and walked away during Clinton. I watched what they tried to do to Thomas and Kavanaugh and what they've tried to pull on Trump for the last 4 years. Not so much.
This is labeled "opinion," but other than the last graf, this reads as a straight news item.   "The foundation is looking into how many people might have seen the email and how many of the coin sets were sold, and may still decide to get lawyers involved"

Trump's hatred for those critical of him &amp; his ineptness has led to the death of 145,000+ Americans. Trump is sending federal agents into states that have not requested them. He's violating his oath to the Constitution. But you don't care about that so long as you own the libs.
While tragic, the 1yr old didn't get shot at a BBQ. He was at a playground. No suspects have been apprehended, so motive is unclear. If you think this is anarchy, I've got a house in a swamp I'd like to sell you. how did Democrats hatred of trump supersede keeping Americans safe?
Let’s see you and trump send your kids to school!
Become subject to the court, with skin in the game, then you can talk international law. I look forward to trump, Wolf, and others from this regime standing before the Hague.
I respectfully disagree. Limit to daytime protests? Sure. Have trump claim "it worked in Portland and we are now headed to a town near you"? Not a good tactic.
Problem is, the violence of these peaceful protests' are these biggest source of injustice at the moment. Trump isn't hiding anything. He's saying this lawlessness is going to end, one way or the other. Can't get more transparent than that.
So you’ll finally support your President Trump!  Welcome to the Republican Party!
The acts of a very small minority among the protesters does not remove the right of protest. I love the basis of this country, but under trump, the Constitution is being ignored. I will not leave the country I fought for, and due to inept leadership most countries ban US citizens
They were trying to make Trump look bad.
Oh sweetheart, this is a blind, ignorant foolish attempt at deflection. Who has divided our country? Trump. Who has put or retracted policies to make our country unsafe? Trump Who has violated the Constitution with sending Federal Agents into states without being asked? Trump
What a trump nugget!
That is assuming someone isn't a traitor. Once you have committed treason against this nation, all of these groups are the enemy. Trump is acting accordingly.
Trump wasn't the one that put covid positive patients in the old folks homes. That was Democrats. When are you going to get it clear in your mind and admit Democrats don't care and want people to die?

Not as offensive. I mean the Trump rally. lol
Trump works hard for our country. I feel sorry for Joe Biden who is obviously going into dementia. He doesn’t know what race he is running for, what state he is in and what day it is. He hasn’t the capacity to be our president. You are obviously unaware of today’s events.
Trump 2020!50,000 more people are dead, and there’s no end in sight. It didn’t have to be this way. ‘It is what it is,’ President Trump said when asked about the death count by Fox News interviewer Chris Wallace. The rest of us must not be so indifferent.
Trump 2020!
Actually you are.. u can blame protesters if u want as some didn't wear masks.. but the majority of this spread has come from beach goers.. partiers, people getting together for family events.. and the majority who are not wearing masks are MAGAs.. Trump's Rally's have caused...
Trump supporters ARE the working Americans and Middle Class
Biden really riding the whole "hey at least i'm not trump" campaign - which worked great for Hilary lmao

You do know this raid took place under trump right? 🤣
Trump isn’t perfect but look at his enemies: THAT should tell you what you voting for or against. Trump hasn’t been perfect. But in light of the rules he has to play by and the sheer enmity and resistance he’s faced, it’s a wonderful he’s done as much as he has!!
I’m 73 and holding on till Trump is gone
Bill Barr just tried to get his own person installed at SDNY after firing Berman whose office is prosecuting Maxwell.  Epstein died in Barr’s BOP.   Bill Barr’s dad had an extensive history with Epstein.   Trump also just wished Maxwell good luck.
And what's up with Trump's skin? Is the snake molting? Maybe this is what crazy Dr. Stella Immanuel meant when she said our govt is run by Reptilian Half-Human/Half ETs.
Will you move out of the country once Trump wins ?
What's going on with the skin on Trump's face? It looks like he is trying to molt or something. Snakes do that, right? Maybe that's what the crazy Dr. Immanuel was talking about when she said our govt is run by Reptilian Half-Humans.
&amp; the right is oblivious to the fact that trump drug his feet on Covid and thousands of people died on his watch. Hr should be held accountable suffer the consequences. Better yet, if he contracts covid, I'd like to see him take hydroxychloroquine on live tv since he swears by it
This is why voting matters.    most recent opponent was Trump sycophant  San Antonio will survive this crisis and the number of people we’ve lost will be smaller due to Ron’s leadership.
If Clinton slept with underaged girls he should go to prison for the rest of his life. If Donald Trump slept with underaged girls he should go to prison for the rest of his life. See, that’s not difficult at all.

Yep. They were bringing girls to the house from the nearby HIGH SCHOOL!!! He got rich by playing the system, lying about is resume, etc. Sickening. The pics of him w Trump are creepy.
You can still be anti-trump if you critique Joe Biden. Is this a boomer account?
There is nothing inspirational about Trump, lacks the ability to motivate, inspire hope, provide encouragement to the American people during these difficult times. All he knows is complain, stir up trouble and create division among people. He's an example of a bad leadership

The only thing crooked in the upcoming election is that Donald Trump will be in it.  With all the shit he's pulled, he should have been out of office by now
Your just a pawn... Your being controlled... Yet they are doing exactly what Trump and perhaps Russia wants.. spreading fake propaganda and information around.
She said she voted for Trump before the pardon.
What about Republican voter suppression? Or Russian interference and misinformation campaigns? Or is that still on the table because it benefits Trump? Your saccharine outrage and crocodile tears just reveal you for the lizard person you are. #GetBent
This is a low bar but it’s good to see republicans standing up to Trump.
I was great to hear 3 Presidents that are still Presidential. Not calling names and degrading trump or republicans. No calling Republicans the demons destroying America. No talking about how bad our country is. NO LYING. Take America Back Vote Democrats 🇺🇸

And sadly he became a Trump cult member.
Ha, talk like a DEPLORABLE tRump cult member too!
Whenever someone tells me they support Trump administration policies, I ask them to name which ones specifically. So far, no one has been able to articulate even one. I hear Ummm well...   Maybe it's hard to hear oneself defend the indefensible out loud.
A lot of this could've possibly been avoided if:  1: Trump took this virus serious from day one instead of politicizing it  2: MAGAs would all agree to wear a Mask and Social distance.  I know some might but the majority do not.   3. Listen to Fauci instead of bashing him.

Wait, tRump said the heat from summer would make it go away, and LIED.  Is this another LIE?  Because nothing tRump has done is helping solve this problem!  Unless you count his plan to Lower COVID numbers by Stopping testing!
you’re only doing this for the Hispanic vote. We don’t fuck with you. You want to separate our families, call us savages. Get rid of daca and deport kids by themselves fuck you #TrumpIsARacist

Im pretty sure Cain was tested prior to entering the rally if he was there with Trump. Just like every other VIP that was around Trump.
John Lewis was political. He spent his entire life fighting for equality for everyone. What did tRump put in on this? NOTHING know why? He wasn’t invited 😂 Oh wait. He spent his day trying to move the election date 😂😂 Nice try though.
150,000 American dead are indisputably China's fault, not President Trump's fault.  He listened to the experts, and against their advice, decided to ban travel.  He listened to the experts and killed his roaring economy to save lives.  He listened to the experts but took HCQ.
Did it take three days for you to compose a tweet justifying Trump’s quack “cure?”  Misinformation is a public health threat, “Elena.”
your comments about Chip are a little off base.  is the political opportunist Chip is just Trump lite.
He knows he can’t move the elections. This is another one of Trump manipulation of the media. Look at the coverage he got today and how he played it toward voter fraud. That is his message.
Think about what tRump said . .   May not be safe to vote so we need to delay the election!  But it's still ok to force kids to go to school?
It should have been Trump.
You are such a dedicated hard-working reporter. I can’t imagine having to report on President Trump every day and night. It must be a mind numbing.
President Trump has no blood on his hands, Mr. Cain was a successful businessman and, as an adult, made his own decisions.  He was a political leader we will miss.  #RIPHermanCain

President Trump is listening to the science, following the advice of experts, taking HCQ for prevention.  Mr. Cain, already battling stage 4 cancer, made his own decisions traveling to the rally (which may or may not have been where he acquired Wuhan Flu}, wearing a mask or not.
WAKE UP, REPUBLICANS!  At least this guy had the excuse of being in a coma for 3 years after voting for Trump.  What's YOUR EXCUSE for sticking by the horror of Trumpism?  Wake Up  via

Mr. Cain was a fully developed adult, accustomed to making his own decisions.  He was a successful businessman with stage 4 cancer.  It is entirely a hateful myth that President Trump or Trump supporters are anti-science, provably not the case.
President Trump has listened to the pediatricians advice for his call to open schools, are you questioning kids doctors for the best advice?  Keeping kids from school is very harmful to kids, in their social and mental acuity.  President Trump does not endanger life, Dems do.

Why Facebook and Twitter won’t fact-check Trump’s latest false claims about voting
He certainly massacred more people. Must be why you love him. War criminals are adorable aren’t they? I’m so sorry Trump refused to bomb the shit out of Syria. I know that must have hurt you.
My state right now is one of peaceful contentment 😀  And, my Trump vote will be cast in Texas ⭐️
It’s sad these people listen to the news and don’t actually look anything up. Trump is amazing!
President Trump had nothing to do with Mr. Cain's death.  He was also battling stage 4 cancer.  He was an adult who made a decision.  Honor the dead.
I don’t know what planet you are on. The local governments are allowing the rioting. They are not allowing protections. Trump is way better at your list then the Dems! He actually has results
Ok trump
The dominoes are now falling for Trump. How fast will his current supporters defect to save their own butts?  Who will be the first to go after The Federalist Society prez called for his impeachment and removal?  McConnell? McCarthy? Barr? (fill in the blank)
You already made it political bringing up Cain going to Trump rally!
He cancelled the plan because politically it was hitting Blue states where they reasoned citizens would blame their governors. They would let us die. And now want the kids to go to school. Fuck Trump. Fuck Jared. Fuck
Tbh idk who imma vote for . Biden seems like he’s no better than Trump , hell I might as well write my own name on the damn ballot 😐💀
It is safe to say that you know squat about what decisions Herman Cain would have made if President Trump was not POTUS.  Mr. Cain was also battling stage 4 cancer.

Top story: Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.  see more
If we’re to be successful in stopping Trump’s unconstitutional behavior, we have to set aside our differences and work together. We have to welcome Libertarians and Republicans willing to fight. We can debate what divides us later. The UNITED States will not fall to Donald Trump.
Funny how I never mentioned Trump or COVID, yet the MAGAts went right there. They know the truth about their master.
The UN can kiss my American ass. We fund them. We have protected the nations supporting them for decades while they spit on us and called us evil until Trump came along and told them to pound sand or support us.
No girl he needs to stay hidden and let trump dig his own grave. I would say Sept/Oct should be the only months he campaigns.

“In a rare move Republicans tell Trump he can’t do what he can’t do, very different from their usual ass kissing of a tyrant child”.
Is it wrong to just let them think that Trump has delayed the election? Like, we'll all go vote at the right time and then when no one votes for trump because they were waiting, we can just be like, "guess you lose, get the fuck out."

Trump plays the 'fear' card to inspire his base. He's always done this. The strategy here is to get out the vote to overcome the dem resistance.   In doing so, Trump builds in an excuse in case the vote is close allowing him to contest.
No other choice, Trump is the only candidate that cares about America and American citizens!
Ah, the old 'What he MEANT was' defense of Trump.  Aren't y'all tired of having to do that??

Then I'd like to know how you characterize Trump's so-called COVID pressers, sir
Vicious and true: "Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."
They even believe that Trump fixed Obama’s “broken” economy.
Who wanna expose trump supporters from my high school 🤩🤩
Absolutely!

Stop coming for me when it comes to food. Idgaf. I’m hungry and ima fucking eat. Y’all still low key fucking with Chick-fil-A, OG, Bill Miller, Home Depot, Taco Bell etc. Your employer probably supports Trump, you gonna quit your job? I’ll wait.
Imagine if Trump had said wear a mask and social distance in March.  Our economy would be sound and many people would not have become ill and died.   Trump politicized mask wearing and is still making people think covid is fake.    This is awful.
News Alert: America’s real former president show what leadership is all about when honoring John Lewis. Where was Trump? Oh we all know he’s not a real President!

There’s no bigger joke than a Hispanic/Mexican who supports Trump.   TRY to change my mind. Lmao
Oh Ok!! You put a black guy talking that likes trump and now we should believe you!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣I noticed many republicans are showing black people expecting people to believe it!! I find that disgraceful.
I refuse no vaccines for our Family
Trump is so "good" that people prefer their worst enemy over Trump.
Mr. Caine RIP. But watching my fellow citizens the last 5 months and the disconnect from reality and willing to believe lies. To see the worst in other people. I now see how the Nazi party took over Germany. That’s harsh but what does Trump say that isn’t believed?
This is why most real Americans despise tRump!  His supporters are to blind to see the truth and to IGNORANT to know tRump never speaks the truth
At the beginning of July, after Layfaette Square, the military signaled their fealty to the country over Trump. Today, after a Trump floated  the idea of postponing the Nov 3election date, Republican politians signaled the same fealty. Hey, we all want this chaos to end.
So do you march with your FASCIST friends that support tRump?
That Smell from Trump  via
Lol watch Trump win and then the libs actually have ground to stand on instead of unstable Russian collusion foundation.
So glad Trump floated that tweet about postponing the Nov 3 election. McConnell is having none of it, as are many Republicans. They must be so tired of DJT and will be happy to see him leave Washington.
Kanye literally put on a Trump hat to get a meeting with the president to push artists getting more royalties on streaming services. Plus Taylor's buddy with Kanye now, she's a liar.
Reminder that Trump just yesterday attended a fundraiser and gave a speech with crowds who didn't either social distance or wear masks.  Here's Pence today with a crowd who is neither social distancing or wearing masks.
Now lets talk trump
Fight for me Nancy please dont let Trump bonce my next stemulis chack too  IRS
What is this? Are you trying to delay the election because it is UNSAFE to vote but DEMAND kids go back to school because it is SAFE.  What is TRUE and what is the LIE?  So used to lies from tRump we dont know what to expect!  Lock tRump UP
YOUNG LADY YOUR NOT VERY SMART ARE YOU. A COUP ON TRUMP PLEASE. YOU GOT IT ASS BACKWARDS.

Trump already has the money to keep them going separate than the money the banks have. So thats two ways they can survive. But this is still a man made crash, not economic. Just need to get the democrats out of the way and watch the nation flourish.
Maybe Congress can move it up! How’s that Trump?
Dont let Trump bonce my second Stemulis chack to IRS for back childsuport fight for us nancy please fight for Me
The most moving, American thing that has happened in the past 4 years, just happened today at the funeral of Congressman John Lewis.  Trump wasn’t included as he isn’t worthy to be in the presence of such a dignified, intelligent, well spoken, articulate, compassionate group.
Trump bonce my Stemulis chack.into IRS hands for back.Childsuport What kind help that . Why you punishing us
he put the info out on the media and they are talking about it...  honest media out there are reporting the CBS and New York Mail In ballot tests which pretty much proved Trump's point... it won't work. Fraud will be rampant and easy.
When liberals come out and say "Trump makes me miss George Bush," you can immediately disregard anything they say because they're just admitting they don't believe people in the middle east are human. They are no different than the MAGA people cheering on the concentration camps.
Don’t you know...sports media are rooting against having jobs because they hate trump!!!!11111
Rep. John Lewis's funeral ended an hour ago. Focusing on his life, and especially Pres. Obama's inspiring, stirring eulogy for him is making us feel some optimism, even a bit of comfort from it. Meanwhile Trump tweets ? of election delay. Prominent Repub died of Covid-19.
You bonce my Stemulis chack you gave me right into IRS hands back.childsuport Trump do something about it
Dem Ga State  Rep Jones supports Trump for president, sad. Isn't it time to change?
So, will President Trump give the eulogy for Herman Cain?
trump is shaking in his platform shoes because he can tell this election isnt on his side anymore
Trump said ...I want him...Abbott said ok!
Come on you idiots. we all know Trump uses these one liner Tweets to just play on the media and you guys fall for it every time.  LOL!!!  We all know that only Congress has the ability.  DUH!!!
Did you read what you wrote before hitting “reply?”  Trump is wrong and so are you.
Hey, #LeningradLindsey. The case was over. Flynn pleaded GUILTY. The only thing left was sentencing. Barr tried to illegally shut down sentencing &amp; Trump’s unqualified judges tried to throw it out. Too bad, so sad - they got caught - now the big guns will stand up for Justice.
Must read on DA Vance w/Trump fam
There you have it.  Trump is supporting an Expansion of Russia and willl support Russia over the EU.
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
The Trump movement cares more about making sure America is white, heterosexual right wing Christian male more than it cares about making sure America is successful.   That's why they're prepared to destroy the very idea of what America is.
Never said OD’ing. I said side effects and if anyone actually believes Trump took HCQ needs to go back and watch the last task force brief.  He said “I would take it” and quickly said I did take it.
Those guys are all so petty. Not quite as petty as Trump, but very petty.
says Trump is “joking”’about violating Constitution by delaying election... he &amp; Trump DO NOTHING while Putin pays Taliban to murder U.S. soldiers, betraying the U.S.  Join me in supporting MJ Hegar via
I guess Putin, will eulogize trump, with remarks from david duke, Kim jong-un, Rodriguez duterte, and xi jinxin, and will be buried next George Wallace.
White supremacy makes life worse for everyone except the elite.   But we as a country have decided that's okay so long as non-white people had it worse.   Obama's election created anger that deal appeared to be broken. That's what created the Trump movement.
Rubin: Minutes after horrible economic numbers — a 32.9% annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims — were released, President Trump tweeted a statement saying we should delay the election. Here's why he did that.
Vance previous decision on the Trump’s is of concern. Is he ethical is questionable?
Re-Elect Trump in November.
What’s your point Obama/Biden depleted medical supply stocks. Trump imposed a travel ban while Democrats were against it.
Brave John Lewis had more dignity and nobility of character than Trump will ever experience in his entire life.
And the President wants to push the election. We are under a dictatorship in waiting. If you vote for Donald Trump in November you will be on the wrong side of history. We are headed towards full Balkanization of our nation. Do the right thing.
Trump is going for full fascist
Sad to hear Herman Cain passed away, his passing could have been prevented if Trump would have been honest about COVID-19.  Shame on Trump and the Republicans who are lying to Americans!

Compare and contrast:  Obama today - “This country is a constant work in progress. We are born with instructions, to form a more perfect union.”  Trump today - “Support Patio Pizza and its wonderful owner, Guy Caligiuri, in St. James, Long Island (N.Y.). Great Pizza!!!”

Haha. More of the left’s video editing skills. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Wonder what all these peaceful protesters are going to do when Trump leaves office in January 2025.
So liberals complain about trump and holding a bible, but they are okay with Obama saying this at a eulogy?
Donald Trump SHOULD resign.
During one of the worst crises in our history, Cornyn thinks it's fine for Trump to be screwing around with the press instead of leading us out of this pandemic.  I will take as much joy in November voting for  to replace Cornyn as I will voting for Biden to replace Trump
Trump didn’t even send a representative to  funeral services? Not surprised.

True.   One reason Trump brought it up... Personally they should eliminate early voting as well... (IMHO).  :)
John Cornyn again rushes to provide cover for Trump only for Trump to pin his tweet doubling down on his call to delay the election making Cornyn look like an idiot.  Let's rally behind  and vote this idiot out of office!
We call this the Trump GOP recession. They own it.
Yes. Trump and Putin both hate Merkel.
NOPE!! TRUMP 2020
Congratulations Mr. Trump, history will never forget you!
Another example of why Trump is an IDIOT. He wants schools to open but he wants to delay the election. SMH!
President Trump is the biggest democrat troll ever 🤣😂🤣
Imagine seeing Trump’s tweets and being like, “wow, what a man! I love our President!” The amount of internalized racism, homophobia, and misogyny you must have to not see how idiotic that man is.
Trump  is obese and wouldn’t be able to walk next to them even if he tried
I DO FOR TRUMP 2020!!!
There is a lesson in here somewhere.  Really sorry to hear of Herman Cain's death from Covid after ATTENDING TRUMP'S TULSA EVENT - WITHOUT A MASK!
Yes. Then when you’re walking away yell Trump Sucks!
Obama you increased by yours silence with the dictatorships of the countries like China, Iran Russia will go today to see them destroying the history of the USA and our freedom and economy. God bless the Donald Trump election.

I’m glad Trump met with Vanessas family day and heard their concerns and going to pay for her funeral, but I hope their concerns for sexual assault doesn’t get a blind eye, something is very wrong at fort hood and action needs to happen.

I know I am a disruptor, and everyone knows I thrive on conflict. I believe that disruption is what Republicans and the country needed when I ran for president in, and that is what I delivered. But I realize the pandemic creates a whole new agenda....
Trump is leading with fear. He understands that the United States leans left and because of that he wants to surpress the vote.
Trump started that bullshit!

My president is going off! Fk trump!
We all wish that were the case. But most of the party decided to die on the Trump hill.
Watch how fast the entire  flip on Trump once his ass is out of office. We know they’re two faced but the internet will prevail again.    and all the others slurping trumps semen off old socks.

We need heed the warning folks Tucker: President Trump's hope for re-election  via
The stress of campaigning is too much for the two men, both die several months prior to the election. Trump’s base still elects him on the hope that he will rise from the grave like he promised. He doesn’t. Nobody sits in office. We don’t talk about it.
Trump’s continued mental decline has  left him only able to speak in two-word phrases consisting of an adjective and a common noun. Biden is never seen without a deck of flash cards to remind him what his opinions are.
A glimpse into 2024: A vaccine for COVID-19 has finally been created, but 50% of GenZ and 80% of Millenials still refuse to leave their houses. A spry 78 y/o Donald Trump comes out of the shadows to challenge 81 y/o Joe Biden for another turn in office.

There's some whopper far right beliefs I had never heard of before (not being far right or Repugnantcan) that I can't believe any rational human being could fall for! But then these are probably the same people who buy The Enquirer at the grocery store!
President Trump is out of favor with the majority of American voters per the national polls. I hope he understands that this will be his legacy if he won't listen. The movie that will be made will show him as a narcissistic ignorant fearmongering racist .
The hypocrisy of this dimwitted president is unbelievable.  We MUST open schools.  We MUST open businesses.  We can eat in restaurants but we can’t hold the election?  Sounds like Trump is rationalizing a coup.  Be ready America.  Revolution #2?
This is a distraction. Trump will coordinate with key Republican controllled states to contest the election results. No clear majority will be established when the Electoral College meets, so the vote will go to the House. One state, one vote, trump wins with 53.

That's not why. It's funny because he very famously refused to wear a mask at a Trump rally and helped spread misinformation about the virus. He then got sick, most likely as a result of attending that rally. He also probably got countless other people sick too. Rest in piss

Sad but probably true. You do know that any action taken against those who actually DID collude, against President Trump and his staff, will be described as simply politics by the Dems and MSM. They have no conscience or morals.
It has only been politicized by Trump in an effort to avoid responsibility for not doing enough to stop it.   The rest of us just want people to be careful and wear masks from a place of love and concern.  An elderly man should never have been at that rally with no mask.
You look like you want to blame his death on Twitter replies instead of facing the truth that he died because of not wearing a mask at a Trump rally. Im also sure you called out the people on the right cheering when George Floyd was murdered. Right?
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 cancer, but died of COVID19 a month after attending Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Youre really blaming Trump for the situation in Portland hm? Lol
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
As a former Trump supporter, can you please move it up? Let’s vote Trump out tomorrow!
is about to speak....trump wants people to watch him instead.
Trump inherited a strong, growing economy from Obama. He absolutely wrecked it with his incompetence. He is, objectively and demonstrably, the worst POTUS for the economy since at least Hoover, probably ever.
No doubt. Multiplied by all the other Trump followers who did the same and you have this mess the rest of us are dealing with.  Makes me think of the Walking Dead episode where Carol kills some people for being irresponsible or something about being infected and gets shit for it.
Man we all knew Trump was gonna do this.
Facts that no one is even arguing?!   What the fuck is wrong with you people. I already said I agree with what you've said.  We asked the lady a question about TRUMP'S presidential behavior.   But for some reason yall keep diverting the topic to Obama and Clinton? 🤦‍♂️

Trump is now openly and unabashedly an authoritarian dictator. No elections until he knows he'll be able to fix the election for himself. Voting won't fix this. Time for an even greater popular insurrection.

trump Doesn’t Have The Authority To Change Election Date Alone, The Executive Branch Is The ONLY Branch That Can NOT Change Election Date And If There Is No Election By Jan. 20 trump MUST LEAVE OFFICE THAT DAY By Federal Law
Cops for Trump. Cops for Law and Order. But no cops for rule of law and the Constitution.
When you have people like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Moscow Mitch, Gym Jordan, and Matt Gaetz who have no integrity doing everything they can to help Trump who knows how things will go.

"Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain attended Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had been staged despite concerns about mass gatherings during the pandemic."
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
That’s a shame. On top of it, his family has no recourse to sue the Trump campaign because of the waiver he had to sign to attend that death rally.
I hope, if trump wants to leave, he'd be left alone to go. Then it could be determined if his US passport should be rescinded, so he could never some back. But, I agree - no retribution. It's time to move forward and leave all this stress and the trumpism horror show behind.
Nancy Pelosi you can call covid 19 the trump virus or whatever you want. This November we are going to relieve you as speaker of the house. You are a disgrace and embarrassment to this country.  You haven’t done anything for this country but makes excuses November YOUR OUT!
Hahahhahahha!  Tyrant Twitter seeks "#OpenInternot" allies and collaboration.  After President Trump signed the Executive Order to further clarify Section 230, so that we can stop the censorship.  Censorship kills people.
I agree. ALL of them should step forward at this time against the corrupt, criminal #Trump and demand his removal.
Former Presidents are speaking at the funeral of #RepJohnLewis and are doing so with kindness, caring, eloquence, and statesmanship.    Meanwhile, Donald Trump is tweeting about pizza -- Yes, pizza.
Well his boy Hermain Cain just died of that hoax  I wonder if tRump will have condolences for him?
If Trump had done his job in Feb or March we'd be back to work now. Out of control pandemics crush economies, always. It could have been controlled. He did nothing. It is absolutely Trump's failure.
I do believe that Trump poses a threat to our democracy and our national security. I am alarmed at the things he says and does and I hope both left and right recognize it.  We are all Americans regardless of our political views. Stay safe my friend!!
Herman Cain, who was diagnosed with #COVID19 less than two weeks after attendind Trump Tulsa rally has died. He didn’t wear a mask or practice social distancing. Trump is killing us all, but his followers, the no mask types, especially.
Is Trump saying it is too dangerous to vote inperson but safe to send children to school?
Trump still cannot change the date of the election. Only Congress can. That applies to every scenario you invent.
So glad President Trump signed that Executive Order to clarify and define Section 230, and close any wiggle room.  More people are tyrants than not, it seems to me.  Time to take that opportunity away from them.
He died from going to a Trump rally
Trump rallies oil-and-gas workers in the Permian Basin against Democrats ahead of the November election
This is stupid comment. Is this your answer to everything Trump says? Deflect it back to the other side without acknowledging the issue. Sounds like Trump supporters in general.
Like Trump does? You are fn kidding me. He touts a doctor who believes demon sex causes cysts and he said the virus isn’t real but now it’ll disappear on its own...that’s competent to you?
By clear wording in the Constitution, Trump cannot change the date of the election
It’s not clear when or where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June.
It is a political statement and he died on the sword of tRump's antimask message.
Only Congress can set a date for the election, which is very clear in the Constitution. Since Dems hold the house, there is no way Trump can change the date.
"Legal" means less than dog shit to Trump.
Trump is setting up his electoral loss come Nov. He knows Biden is the favorite to win and not narrowly either. He’s ready to do everything he can so he can stay in office even when he loses 🤦🏽‍♂️
For fun this morning, I posted this on Huffington Post. The hyenas quickly swarmed.  "You liberals need to give it up. If Trump wants to delay the election due to potential fraud, then be quiet and accept it. The president can do whatever he wants."

Thread by  No mechanism exists that I am aware of for delaying a Presidential election. Trump also is aware of this. Trump is  Left again. This never gets old. Trump **wants mail in voting**. He is going to keep trolling them into demandin…
Hence why Trump is against!
The face of evil; Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe'—something he doesn't have the power to do
"...I'm thinking [Trump wasn't] burdened with an overabundance of schooling."
Well JT, he thought wearing a mask was not needed . Tulsa rally is to blame and Trump
Everything that can be said about Herman Cain dying from COVID because he didn’t wear a mask at the Trump rally has already been said, which is why I will say it as well
Joe Biden should win and Trump should be gone from Office for good in November
Trump will spin it and say he advised Herman Cain to wear a mask.
TRUMP HAS TO GO BEFORE HE DESTROYS AMERICA
President Trump probably crossed the line into fascistic action (or at least suggested action) by suggesting the election be delayed.  Fascism isn't just in Germany or Italy or Spain.  It looks different wherever it is.  And it is here.  Now.  In this this President.
As disturbing as this is, I'm also hit by the argument being made by his  cronies that it's just his response to the chaos Dems supposedly created by demanding mail-in voting. Uhhh NO...

Thank you Susan. Trump 2020  Our country literally depends on his re-election.
Haven't you heard,  since Joe said he'd rather vote Trump than Biden, and gives platforms to evil Jews like Shapiro and Beanie wearing chicagoan half Asian white supremacists, Joe has become alt right nazi propaganda. Have you tried dmt?
Where did I say I was a trump supporter? Read it next time. I said “taxes went up under trump, it even happened to his die hard supporters.” A lot of people who voted for trump lamented that their taxes went up under him and we’re kissed at him about it.
Former Republican presidential candidate, #HermanCain dies from #COVID19. He attended Trump's Tulsa rally where he got the coronavirus. He refused to wear a face mask 😷. May his memory be eternal.
Do not understand why Australia would ban it . Do you ?  All political in America. Drug has had tremendous results and is safe. Here in America, President Trump supported it, so the Democratic Socialists said it was a no no!

Trump is also eager to distract from this. Cain was at Trump’s rally in Tulsa, famous for ignoring social distancing and masks, and became ill with covid19 less than 2 weeks later.
President Trump calls for delaying the elections, which John Lewis and many others have fought for the right to vote in, on the day of his funeral which he is not attending.
It’s you and your dem friends that wants Covid to be an election emergency.  All Trump is saying is that he has a solution that is better than a mail in ballet disaster.
Start following the money. Would not be surprised if it leads back to the Trump crime family. Its a money grab before they are voted out this fall.
Didn’t agree with his political views but actually I’m more pissed than anything about Herman Cain dying of Covid. This is what ignorance and cult worship has brought us to. Trump is now equal to 165 Jim Jones.
President Trump doesn’t tweet without having an ulterior motive  You of all people should know that
Trump basically being like, “don’t even have elections bros, b/c like, voter fraud” is the ONLY thing I foresaw happening in 2020.  Everything else has been a surprise.
This blood is on Trump's hands. #TrumpMurderedCain
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Cain was a fool who died needlessly subscribing to conspiracy theories and kneeling at the altar of Trump’s ignorance. Hope he haunts Trump’s wreteched ass for eternity. He didn’t deserve the fate Trump handed him.
Yeah, Herman Cain sure took one for the trump team, didn't he? Gave his life for your boss. This should go over really well for his reelection. #WearADamnMask
Because it’s all about defeating Donald Trump. They don’t care about the destruction they’re causing to this country or the people in it.
He died so he could watch Trump drink water with one hand in a half empty stadium
#HermanCain wasn't the only one who got sick after tRump's super spreader rally
I see that President Trump just eliminated the possibility of a delay in the election!!!!  The left will TDS it UNTIL the election.  Watching a movie for certain.....
I’m down for a delay! That means the constitution is evoked and Trump gets evicted by the secret service and Pelosi becomes the interim president....I’m down. Please please throw a fit and cause a delay
Between people perpetually letting themselves get trolled by Trump and, the usual ghouls dunking on a dead man while his body is still warm, it might be a good day for a Twitter break.
The trump admins response to covid has left ppl confused as to the severity of covid-19 and so they acted cavalierly with deadly consequences. It’s not funny because the deaths are true. Grateful my local leaders have used rigorous analysis of data to make decisions not gut.
One month after attending Trump's Tulsa rally without wearing a mask
Trump has Teddy's browser history as blackmail.
you are the biggest liar and twister of words I've ever seen. Trump used an ABSENTEE BALLOT. U KNOW IT. Why is it that dems are wanting mail voting not Republicans? Without corruption you lose is why.
Trump has no concept of guilt.
#HermanCaine hopped his ass on Twitter, claimed #COVID19 was a hoax, shamed others for fearing it, attended a Trump rally UNMASKED with stage 4 cancer and ended up dying as a result
So am I. I’m voting for Trump Pence 2020.
Hey Trump.. how's your economy doing now? Is it fake news that the GDP dropped nearly 33%?
Trump's timeline thus far shows us he either doesn't care Herman Cain is gone... Or he cannot say anything as he knows Cain contracted the "hoax" virus at his rally.  Is there anybody left in the GOP who has the cojones to tell Trump to grow up?

At this point I hope everyone who voted for trump is ashamed of the idotic monster they put into office. But I know most are not they're just happy they can be openly rascist with no repercussions again.
Someone deleted this one:  “Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!”
The prosecutors and investigative entities just use trump's interviews and tweets as counts to his indictments at this point. Let him keep talking/tweeting. Hopefully his handlers will keep him hopped up on stimulants so he will talk himself into prison.
And trump is responsible for his death and 150,000 others
Oh no. If Trump would have done the right thing and at least mandated face masks and social distancing he would be alive. Trump’s ego for adoration killed Herman Cain.
So. In the past 24 hrs:  150k+ dead from Covid.  Herman Cain dies of Covid. Largest economic contraction in decades b/c covid response has been so poor.  Trump whines about election, wants to push it back but can't.
Many people are saying that Epstein operated a brothel in the basement and that Trump visited it on numerous occasions
No way you can spin this. Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Not only Trump rallys but other people who publicly stated their antimask stance...preachers (who broke lockdown rules) , there was a sheriff and others. But, you are correct, in the end they were not significant enough to recognize!
yet Trump never gets it....maybe it's the demon sperm?
Its not even 10am yet and Trump is calling for the elections to be delayed and then Herman Cain passed away from COVID.
As if Trump can actually think for himself. Good one😂😂
It’s the Trump plague now.
"Clear" is a subjective term. Trump and Barr will not accept the results, no matter what they are. Even if he manages to win by voter suppression, he'll still say it's voter fraud because it wasn't a landslide.
After Trump loses most of his staff to Covid: "Doctors came to me, they said, 'Everyone around u got the china virus but you. WOW! You're the strongest person we ever met! When need to do tests, blood work, not the cognative test.' That I aced by the way. Man. Woman. Camera. TV."
Or, you attend a Trump pep rally without wearing a mask, contract the CovfefeVirus, and then you die.
Only Trump would think of something so asinine.
I fall into the never trump category
President Trump mused about delaying this year's election — which would require changing the law.

I don't watch CNN or MSNBC or any tv. I just look at numbers and the things Trump is or isn't doing. It's so easy to see that he literally isn't doing anything to control the spread of covid. He literally refused to wear a mask for months even though it's proven to help.

It actually has nothing to do with the media painting Trump as a Nazi. It's more about him not handling covid well, that's the reason old folks in Florida are flipping over to Biden. They are terrified for their lives and Trump doesn't even hold press conferences on covid anymore

The second he pulled the trigger it was a crime.
Has nothing to do with Trump  get that right first
Who’s the president? Who has the most authority and responsibility for the county? Trump was holding  MAGA hate rallies even until recently. If Pelosi was promoting socializing, trump was doing it waaaay more.
He does Trump's 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No this is NOT Trump's America.   This is DemocRats/liberals America.
Chandler should leave the reporting to the professionals. Players are going to start taking a page out of the TRUMP playbook and reporting the real news directly. Rarely pays to be the first to break the news.
Typical Trump supporter
You and me both.  I can’t understand why Trump want help us help him.  Federal law supercedes state law, right?
You can any and everything u want but the truth is the dems, liberal idiots don’t care, they hate Trump more.  Unbelievable butt hurt hatred, it has effected their thinking process, if you want to call it thinking

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I still remember when Hillary Clinton mentioned Reagan's name, during a speech, &amp; not one Republican clapped.  That's when I knew the GOP was dead &amp; taken over by the trump maga cult.
Trump
Just think he’s at least getting a bit more than he would have if President Trump didn’t put in the tax reform. Joe not only wants to take that away but he also wants to increase taxes
So Trump should let a Federal Court house Burn huh
He'll probably win because of dumbaddess look at Trump he obviously is going through stuff and doesn't need to go through being able to press a nuke button cause cotton candy is a invader of Switzerland in the milkway
A perfect sign would be with Trump head profile where the stars are

Good insight. I've always thought trump's psychosis starts and ends with insecurity.
Maybe we can get the UK  to mail in votes for Trump. That would stop the jail in fraud
You sound just like Trump do you enjoy lying to your parents enjoy watching you lie? Or maybe he loves you so much because he's getting some on the side
Tiny baby Trump is trying to act like big daddy Trump you're not president fact you're the one as guilty and your daddy
blah blah blah blah blah.  Election is 4 months out.  Aint shit gonna happen because BOTH Dem AND GOP Elites are delaying/praying that Trump loses.  If he doesn't, they'll just delay/distract/obstruct for FOUR MORE YEARS
Bottom line, who is the racist group? Who has held back the black people? Well you heard it, now everyone should know.  Demo-rats.  Next time I here someone say fk Trump I’ll stop right there.
A vote for Trump is like falling onto a lightsaber
I agree, Donald Trump will be that President!

With You Mr. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. LOVE ALWAYS.
If you support Trump, instead of hitting the like button, hit the follow instead.  Some want large number of followers, some just want a large tweeting base. Information is shared to a larger group. Either way, hitting the follow button is good for conservatives.
It’s coming down to the wire. If Nancy’s is so confident that Trump will be removed form office before the elections. The old wind bag is running out of time. 2020 has been a screwed up year for many and I know Nancy can’t handle 85K taking her down.

A normal person would not vote for Biden. If you been around these crazy people they accuse Trump of lying, separating kids, bending to Russia and it never stops.  Everyone must vote for every Republican that’s quailified. Christians can’t sit this out.  Biden must be stopped

That photo of Hitler looks alot like Fred Trump ...
I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump’s got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That’s...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump’s saying there’d be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don’t even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...
This would be my thoughts on how Republicans would try to keep Trump in office without an election.

Okay I’ll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, “whether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.” Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one’s own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

Why do I think it was Boss Tweed who said that? Trump does seem to think the Gilded Age was when America was great. No regulations, monopoly was king, rampant corruption.
my tios fav thing to call trump is lardass 💀
Who Would Have Thought: Putin Puling A Trump! Usually The Other Way Around!
Mr Trump You ARE!
Trump ain't even trying to win any votes in the valley, he doesn't even acknowledge us despite the pandemic.
Mr Trump!!!
Hey Mr Trump, See Below!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
When did Trump literally try to burn down federal property and threaten officers lives
Trump Train car parade in McAllen, Texas. The silent majority is silent no more. Patriots LET'S ROLL 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Everything has become more political including Dr.Fauci there are so many doctors President Trump could include on his agenda I guess nobody advise him to do it I do not trust dr. Fauci he has become too political siding with Democrats..
Lovely, let's help out GOP w/ ads; Trump Campaign has too many already. Speaker of the House or Speaker for AOC?
Well I would like to see these people that actually like him, anywhere I go I see people whining about Biden, it seems like people are voting for him ONLY because they dont want Trump to win again. How does it all come down to something ridiculous like that?
I understand that but there were candidates in the beginning that had potential to me and they're all out. Even YOU say you're not thrilled with Biden but dont want Trump to win, many people are saying this. Nobody is happy about the selection we have, that's the problem. Why??
Prepping for a Trump Train car parade in McAllen, Texas. The number of cars and flags have doubled this weekend. LET'S GO 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
*Donald trump has entered the chat*
I know you got a lot of bootlicking going on. Hard work. FYI, we’re still struggling down here in the Rio Grande Valley with the Trump Virus and a Hurricane to boot. Don’t worry though, we learned we don’t need you for sh*t.
Thomas Kane don't blame Trump blame the Democratic Party Party of slavery tell them to stop this s*** on the Burning Cities looting  Killing black people those people are pay by the Democratic Party BLM collect money and they send to the DNC they are responsible. Not Trump.
the military won't back Trump for sure. MAYBE a General will try something but there's "coup stops" in the command structure &amp; it would be NEARLY impossible. Besides, the CIA is so addicted to swilling metric tons of cash any threat to dollars value will be "pacified" quick-like.
Last week the Trump admin asked a judge to delay the release of immigrant kids in ICE detention. The deadline is Monday and the govt had asked for a stay of the judge's order to release kids in family detention centers because of "substantial issues raised." The judge denied it.
Dear Gov Abbott:  This is what it has come to, #deathpanels. If you don’t have the guts to do what it takes to get the #Trump Virus under control, take the gloves off and let the locals that do take control.

No, but hopefully we'll see it in a Trump Campaign ad, keep those donations going.
apparently there was a trump parade in mcallen today? must've not been that great if I didn't hear about it

It’s bad enough that I live in the new epicenter, Hidalgo County of Abbott’s Texas during this horrible trump-virus pandemic.... Hanna has come to screw with us too!
The Border Patrol has no legitimate reason to be in Oregon.  You are there to attack Black Lives Matter protesters to give Trump a distraction from his COVID failure.
Just saw a convoy of Trump supporters driving down tenth street in  honking vigorously and flying flags in the midst of a global pandemic shortly before #HurricaneHanna is due to arrive. They must really love that guy. #RGV

Democrats refused to accept the results of Trump’s election.  They openly called for resistance even before Trump took office.  We had recounts and threats , and Russia Hoax.  #WalkAway
Great that ur kissing up to trump and the 30% base...that will never get you the presidency, but I’m good with it👍🏽.
This mobs as you called them they having pay prearranged by the Democratic Party and the four quads AOC posted that letter on Twitter Twitter keep erasing it it reads Mayors keep doing the same thing you doing after election we need to get rid of trump and help Joe Biden win .
All of these riots and chaos blame the Democrats is planned executed well coordinated to make President Trump look bad and to get him out of office they are not hiding it they are saying it it's no secret but we the people are so stupid that we believe on them they make fear.
AOC advise in the mayors to standby after Joe Biden wins that's the only way they can get President Trump out of office I turning upside down these country find that later has been posted on Twitter many times don't be so stupid you guys from Fox News find the letter do something
She might just now be waking up to the realization of who these people really are - COMMUNISTS  and they eat their own. These are BIG DOGS and if you can't run with them you better stay on the porch. Trump not only runs with them HE BEATS THEM!! ( Hillary )
Now he knows how Trump has felt for the last 3 and a half years.
I live on the border we have been screaming at the top of our lungs for almost 2 years what they are doing here they used us for practice , scooping up imagraints &amp; putting them in camps without trial or anything I think Americans that disagree with trump are next.

This makes Trump look like a fascist lunatic. This makes the DHS look like a bunch of incompetent assholes who are doing a job no one wants done anyway. Our goal is to lose Trump and eliminate DHS after we accomplish all of Portland's local goals .
I new this was Donald trump idea he’s never change he never make America greater again.
Was that Trump disguised as COVID-19? 🤔 I don’t even think you can pull that off if if you made it into a book...I'm not suggesting the redacted name is Donald J. Trump, but it does fit.  I'll try the Brunel name next.
Watch "Trump Breaks Lefties By Suggesting Election Delay Until WuFlu Cured!" on YouTube
ODD, but THAT is exactly what's coming out of the WH now!  Trump has taken a page from Putin's playbook, NOT to have the Election.  Now all of a sudden Trump sees a loophole for using COVID19 to stop the Nov Election.  Sounds like republican control holding us Hostage !
did attend a civil rights activist &amp; Congressman that passed away recently. He made it possible 2 have equal rights 4 all! Unfortunately, POTUS does not have the respect 2 attend this gr8 man's funeral. I think it was because TRUMP IS NOT GR8!

This is the REAL Donald Trump that most people don’t get to see because of the slanted one sided Media!!!!
I love all these anecdotes about “oooh, big strong republican man doesn’t like trump and won’t vote for him” but they don’t make a whit of difference if we don’t ALL go vote against trump. Register. Get your friends registered. Help people get to the polls.
I still can not find anyone in the Trump campaign who can tell me whom is matching my contribution by 700% 🤷🏼‍♂️
There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.
Wrong that would be Trump

Watching this helps steel my resolve to do everything possible to rid our democracy of Trump and ALL of his  enablers in November. The parties will continue to have their policy differences, yet they can treat each other with respect and love America equally. #WeWillVote

Pending Postal Service Changes Could Delay Mail And Deliveries, Advocates Warn    So the Trump Administration messes with the Postal Service and NOW they are worried about mail in ballots?
This is a lie. LMAO. Trump has denounced white supremacists multiple times. And you all call Trump supporters dumb. There are dummies on both sides, but there are far more dumb Democrats than Trump supporters, for sure.
dude. stop. being antie trump doesnt mean you have to make biden out to be something hes not. dont be stupid.

As for the dems are mean too.  Yeah again back to that we tell kids to get over it... Hell you are telling me get over it, but heaven forbid we tell trump to get over it!
Ultimately any dumbass who went to a political rally inside an arena with zero social distancing and zero mask mandate during the Covid 19 pandemic is responsible for their own death. But Trump is complicit and negligent
When I hear that Right Wing Nut Jobs and #MAGAts say that Liberals created COVID to make Trump look bad I have to stop and think for a moment, Trump doesn't need anyone to make him look bad! MFG he does that all by himself!
he signed a pledge to support whoever the nominee is. and he has always said he will do what it takes to stop trump. running independenf would hurt that cause.
No Free world under Trump and current GOP leadership. Try something else.
Good, I didn’t vote for Trump discipline. Notice the question marks at the end obviously meant as a thought that he completely cleared up in his 5:30 press conference, but I love how people go crazy by a thought by the President on a social media platform that allows kiddie porn
President Trump suggested delaying the election because of the coronavirus, something he cannot legally do. Top Republicans quickly rejected the idea.

story but that is not why Trump hates China.  Did I forget to mention he still build hotels there?  God I hate this program when it comes to responding or having a convo but i digress
Somewhere they are hearing that what’s being suggested is not the same as absentee...what Trump is implying. I tried to educate her but her opinion is cast in stone.
voted to not hold Trump accountable for soliciting foreign intervention in our election emboldening him to interfere in the voting rights of US citizens who are registered to vote.
How many times do we have to do this?
Is that why you are running scared and doing what you do best, lying to the American people  about everything !!!  The “Trump Virus,  Voter fraud and the economy!!!
WhY is it we punish families and small businesses for bKP but he is smart? WHy is his business allow to drain our precious economy but no one else?  Why is he not held to the same starndards Everything Trump supports list and rage at others for he has done MANY times and recorded
Regardless, as I have repeated, what u as a trump support, is the preceived injustice &amp; power others in DC have, but he is no different.  He is not an outside, he is part of their club &amp; always has been, but back to bKP...
No your boss is wrong for moms. Trump’s track record proves he’s incompetent to lead.
I’d say Herman is responsible for his own death by not using common sense. But Trump DEFINITELY set the stage.

Heres a story: 2015 Obama approved millions in funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology the soon to be location of COVID-19 outbreak that was planned to be released during this election year after the impeachment of Trump failed.  Democrats and MSM cordinated this shutdown.
That was 14 years ago.  He caught COVID-19 around the time of Trump's superspreader rally in Tulsa, tested positive a little over a week later, and succumbed to the disease after a month in the hospital for it.
No it doesn't. At least not until they put him in the ground. What does matter he made the personal decision to not listen to medical professionals, chose the political road, and now his family has to lay him to rest - all for Donald J. Trump.
Oh my God. Did he tell everyone that he got it at a Trump rally where everyone was discouraged from wearing masks? A rally that never should have happened in the first place? That every doctor said was a bad idea? Thought not.

Trump is scared. He knows what will happen on November 3rd
Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.

The GOP and Trump are the threat. Trump is so tight with Putin and of course Chinas President that for all we know Trump gave China the opportunity to hack Coronavirus details.
King Trump?
All Trump talks about is mail in vote fraud! Ridiculous  Any excuse to refuse to accept the out come Nov 3 if he loses!
Trump just stated his game plan if he loses. “Litigation could take YEARS before we find out who really won the presidency”. #briefing
Oh, Annie, Mr. Trump was impeached. That's not "nothing". In addition, Mr Trump is an Unindicted Co-Conspirator in at least one case. Lastly, the "activated" AG doing your claimed investigations is himself being investigated.
The contrast between Obama’s oratory and Trump’s semi coherence and mispronounciations is staggering.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There’s way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There’s little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.
You pushback on us harder than Trump? And therein lies the problem. #DoYourJob

Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?

Weird these are indicative of what recent event...and where was this started. Damn Trump for being a business man not a politician.
This is America's first Caligula, paired with a giant FOX cult, so this is our first real stress-test on our system by totalitarians.  If we get a 2nd chance at democarcy next year, we now know exactly all the weak spots to repair, because Trump tested every law in the book.
Fucking trump
is the joke! trump is the punchline! Cornyn is one of trump’s biggest enablers and sycophants. As a constituent of Cornyn’s 🤮 I’m 100% supporting  to defeat and remove this joke from office!
Well to be fair, Trump's bumbling incompetence has stymied his autocratic tendencies at almost every turn. Not sure the same could be said about Cruz.
Former special counsel Robert Mueller's decision not to charge President Trump with obstruction of justice was an “unconscionable” lapse that “let Trump get away with lying,” said Norm Eisen, former special counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won’t do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
If damning information could disqualify someone, then Trump should have never ran and he should have been removed. People are going to bash KDH, but we got her if Biden does the right thing. #BidenHarris2020
I feel like Liz Ortecho needs to do a PSA correcting Trump that sex with aliens doesn't cause the coronavirus. #RoswellNM
Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain’s death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.
Sen Cornyn, Donald Trump has never made a joke and neither was this! And if it was a joke, it wasn’t funny!
Trump is screwing up his plan to sell out
im in texas and im not gonna vite for biden. if that leads to texas going to trump then so be it.
It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
Curious how you know he didn't get it at the Trump rally. How do you know where he got it? Are you like one of those Dogs the Germans have trained to sniff out and identify people with COVID-19?
Did the right thing in 2016 and will do the right thing in 2020. TRUMP 2020
Regardless of the perpetrators, Trump is trying to stop the violence while local governments are enabling it.
Watching the  documentary on  and it just makes me so sad that she's not our President. She's not perfect, but i have no doubt we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now due to Trump being completely incompetent.
They know - what they are hoping is that the AMERICAN people don’t know...
These other countries aren’t dealing with the Left’s real national emergency- getting rid of Trump
Can you feel that America? That’s the shifting and the waking up of some Trump supporters. Welcome! Let’s come together and beat this virus. #TakeBackAmerica #EnoughIsEnough #UnityWins
😂 Not sure Trump should be trying to go back to back with Barack Obama. The comparison will be devastating for Donald. Not that he'll notice. He &amp; his minions are the least self-aware bunch we've ever had in the Whitehouse.
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Do they not understand that the more they attack Trump, the more we love him?
NWO and Trump is trying to stop it. Affects entire planet.
On the back of black people...he has done less for them than Trump...sad

He's been at the game a lot longer.  It also says you should look at your content and delivery.  If all you do is rail on Trump you might be losing out.  Too many outlets for that and it gets tedious.

#WeWillVote. Even if that means a full HAZMAT suit. #WeWillVote Trump OUT. His utterance of delaying an election is something EVERY American who is worth their salt should vote him out of office for. To not is traitorous and certainly unpatriotic.
Excuse me, but are you the same Ari Fleischer who excoriated Joe Biden for suggesting three months ago that Trump would try exactly this?
You say this but rules and law mean nothing to trump and his thugs. How can we sit here and belief anyone who says this can’t and won’t happen?  They simply doing care about the law....and no one is holding them accountable.  Our votes might not even matter now....unreal.
This!! I watched an interesting documentary last night re the takedown of the mafia. 1 segment talked at length how they had to “prove to the court” reasonable cause for a warrant &amp; what they went thru to get that proof. Which was a lot less than what’s known about Trump!
If he hadn’t followed Trump and gone to the Tulsa rally, he would still be alive!  People that follow Trump, either die or cause someone else to die! #Trumpisthevirus
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
Delaying the election is the least of my worries lol. Trump could theoretically make state legislatures bind electoral votes to him and SCOTUS could green-light it.
The blame lies squarely with tRump, and his death cult.

Trump, no doubt
While I pray for him and his family, you forgot to mention he got it from Trump Tulsa rally
Good point! But this is what the administration wants. Whether it’s the virus or the secret police sent into our cities, this will be the way it goes until Trump is out.

Are you sure?  It's possible Putin's English is better than Trump's. ;-)
I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Completely predictable.
Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.
I bet Trump got Afghanistan’s #GDP up a bit by looking the other way as Russia paid all those bounties for dead Americans.
Last public appearance prior to contracting covid was the trump Tulsa rally.   Every cult eventually becomes a death cult.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Everything Trump touches dies.
Everything Trump touches dies.
Donald Trump is directly responsible for the death of Herman Cain.
Here’s Trump’s playbook:  Economy report is a disaster, let’s tweet out some crazy shit.
Everything Trump touches dies.
I will send a personal “thank you” tweet to any &amp; every government official I come across who denounces trump’s election delay threat. Even GOP officials... 🤢
If President Trump hadn’t held his rally in Tulsa or if he had demanded and modeled the wearing of a mask, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Everything Trump touches dies.
Everything Trump touches dies.
Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn’t wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.
Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the marquee event for the president's self-proclaimed reelection campaign kickoff.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Sad. Oh well. He gambled with his life and lost big. My condolences to his family. trump is culpable.
Everything Trump touches, dies.  Ask Herman Cain.  Oh wait. You can't. He's dead.  Mask denier, dead today from Covid.
Is the economy worse than four years ago? Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited! Let’s see those tax returns.
The economy is the worst ever! Trump inherited a great economy and destroyed it because he doesn!t know what he’s doing!

Do you think the Trump crime family will wait until January to flee the country, or will they be headed to Moscow as soon as the polls close on November 3rd?
You have encouraged me today- going to send money to Trump campaign
No wonder Trump wants to delay the election (in addition to bad polls) as this news just came out, Trump’s Achilles’ heel is the economy:
Fun fact: misleading information about an election (like saying absentee = good, mail in = bad) with the goal of suppressing votes is a good reason to report a tweet. It'd be SUCH  a shame if everybody did this and Trump faced a consequence for once
How about Congress re-schedule the election to next week? I mean, since you brought up the topic of re-scheduling elections. I don’t need any more time. I know all I need to know. Just to remove any suspense, there’s NO CHANCE IN HELL that trump gets a vote from me! 🖕

you know the WHOLE WORLD is laughing at you for shit like this. Right? You’re a fucking IDIOT.
Exactly zero surprise that Trump is trying to delay the election.  Exactly ZERO.  He's not gonna go without getting physically frogmarched out of office.
... cowards or taking an anti-Trump position? ... almost certainly both ...
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I’d agree with you. Trump doesn’t give a fuck about Federal law, so don’t act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It’s his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
This is one of the scariest things I have seen Trump tweet...and that is saying a lot.
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England’s survival depends on it.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election — But Congress Sets the Date
Yes - Trump is a savant. Nothing he does is stupid or ignorant. He is a policy genius who cares nothing for his own image and always puts the American people first....
Marco Rubio is a spineless coward and a yesman of a politician, unworthy of public office.   Not only has he debased himself for Trump, he KNOWINGLY allowed Covid to ravage Floridians in exchange for temporary political expedience.   Vote lil Marco out.
** Breaking** He can’t do it, but he’s floating the idea.
No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.
We voted during the civil war, two world wars, and he has no power to stop the election. Voting during crisis is something America has always done. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
In the past 20 years, over 250 million votes have been cast by mail. Meanwhile, there have only been 143 criminal convictions for mail-in voter fraud. Trump is absolutely trying to undermine the election with fearmongering and misinformation.

Yes, let’s not delay voting!!! After President Trump is re-elected we can FINALLY see the Rinos and Democrats involved in the coup and human trafficking arrested and brought to trial! (Hopefully arrested before the election)
I just saw BBC report that Republicans told Trump he can't delay elections. Hmm, well Congress does NOTHING, so please delay, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER SAID DELAY. Feckless idiots! Keep rioting!
Liberals: Trump is using the rose garden as a political rally.  Also liberals: Obama's eulogy wasn't political

If you’re in the second camp, I wonder how the GOP re-tools after a hypothetical Trump loss with elected officials still in fear of an unchastened, Trumpified base. Seems like Don Jr. or White Nationalist Tucker C is the more likely outcome than a Reaganite we can believe in.
The lightning speed with which Republicans denounced Trump's suggestion to move election day is encouraging.   Even to a Libertarian.

That is information we must have. We have no use for Trump’s lies, which you and republicans constantly mimic.
We certainly can not trust republicans, they have become lying minions to con man Trump.
Same, it was something along the lines of "Trump was going to get them to pay for the border wall through indirect payments, nobody said they would just cut us a check for it"
Just out of curiosity...what would it say if President Trump lost the election...but Republicans kept the Senate and gained the House back?

Good thing anyone can kick down Trump's border wall and walk into Mexico. I know Mexico isn't technically allowing us in, but if you walk in and feed the first family you see, you have a friend and ally forever. As a Texan, I have often looked to Mexican people for humanity.
I understand that some people have beautiful, kind hearts. I admire them.  Myself, maybe I am broken. Some guy supports Trump's murderous reign, I'll drop a deuce on his grave.  He helped kill many decent people. No sympathy for that devil. F him.
Cain's death makes Trump look bad. It was insensitive of Herman to die.  What about Donald's needs?

My thoughts are, why didn't the Trump administration develop some kind of council between federal, local government, and community leaders to discuss solutions for ending police brutality? I mean, he is "the great negotiator". At least that's what he claims.

Trump is not the one out there riding in the street and telling people to go out and riot or trying to defund police these are criminals that need to be brought to justice you liberals are just too stupid to see that
And Trump isn’t making these people do it they are choosing to do it in the terrorist and tearing up buildings. I’m a free thinker and can think for myself and I don’t have to be fed all the lies the liberal media tease me

Do you ever get tired of licking Trump's rear, Superbuttlick?
The republican memo said: don't defend Trump, BLAME CHINA.  And look at Ted... every day he brings up China for his Trumpdaddy's benefit. Ted never misses a chance to bow to the man who insulted his wife.
Take your enthusiasm for no lying &amp; begin with current events in the world. Beginning with trump’s announcement to run until now. That should keep you pretty busy so you’ll be able to put aside your Benghazi trauma for a bit
The Portland moms? I could see where you would be terrified of them. You let Trump shove you around. Run little guy!
Same as the old Trump.
Hey. I know you said not to  you, but I want to say what you're doing is admirable. Not a boot lick myself, but I do admire seeing you bow to that moron Trump and really lick his clean. You're born for it. Born to bow. Donald is clearly your superior, Coach Bootlick.
You didn't hear the nuclear explosion last night? Trump is bombing America and tweeting the n-word.
Yes, hard to walk with Jesus with the devil by your side, right? She should’ve been praised but we, the American people, allowed her to be used as a symbol of retribution. To discourage others who knew trump’s &amp; gop treason
Instead of being a sycophant for Pres. Trump, #TX19 needs a Rep. who is not afraid to fight for EVERYONE inside of the district.   In Texas, we know Donald Trump and Jodey Arrington are all hat and no cattle.Obama created ISIS and President Trump bombed the shit out of them.
Trump is a puppet of Putin. He cannot stand up to Putin. He is a horrid commander in chief. He will not even address the intelligence report that Russia paid bounties to kill our soldiers. He is a coward and traitor. #ThursdayMotivation #COVID #coronavirus #LincolnProject
Trump uses the rose garden and the liberal media goes stinking nuts. Hussein uses a funeral to demonize conservatives and hes the best thing since sliced bread and all is back good.  #silentmajority
Yes! The trump family would not be benefiting from the fed gov’t. Duh!
That the trump family is staying at Trump resort each weekend? Are you serious? It happened last weekend.   He didn’t golf at a Holiday Inn. He golfed at a Trump resort.
Good point. Trump can delay the election. But he cannot delay the transition of power.
There's gonna be a point where we'll have to decide between the family &amp; friends who openly support authoritarians and those who will defend our democracy.  That point is rapidly approaching as Trump's mental state deteriorates.  No one should take this, or that point, lightly.
It seems by delaying the Flynn case the Democrats and Obama administration are trying to make President Trump pardon Flynn making democrats talking points that Flynn wasn't innocent.
Never forget why we are in this mess- Donald Trump's incompetence and failure to listen to the experts. He called it a hoax. Willful negligence is murder. 150,000+ dead so far. #thursdaymorning #ThursdayThoughts #LincolnProject  #COVID__19 #COVID19 #COVID__19 #coronavirus

An evangelical Christian who voted for Trump has to make a choice. You cannot follow Trump and Jesus Christ. They are exact opposites. Which is it? #thursdaymorning #ThursdayThoughts #ThursdayMotivation #COVID #COVID__19 #coronavirus #Harris #Resisters #LincolnProject #Christian
Been pretty universal. Trump can’t change the date. The consensus is it is an overt sign of weakness and a realization his re-election chances are dwindling. Most GOP Senators have clarified this election will occur as scheduled.
This is really simple. If for no other reason, the fact that Trump is a pathological liar, is reason enough to vote against him for president. You cannot trust Liars. #thursdaymorning #ThursdayMotivation #ThursdayThoughts #COVID19 #COVID #COVID__19 #coronavirus #LincolnProject

President Trump sent a tweet suggesting to delay the 2020 presidential election.
Report the ayatollah! We report trump. You should report the ayatollah!
President Trump visited Odessa and Midland for campaign fundraisers and signed 4 pipeline permits allowing Texas to export crude oil to Mexico.
That’s funny seeing how tRump is making a fortune off the presidency. Do some research. You obviously have been watching too much FOX entertainment your losing your critical thinking skills.
The media is falling for Trump's troll on delaying the election 😎 It's the Gold Standard of trolling.
Trump and Republicans will do everything possible to suppress votes in November. So we need to be prepared. Make sure you are registered and take whatever you need for Id. And be prepared for long lines. #thursdayvibes #thursdaymorning #ThursdayThoughts #COVID19 #coronavirus
Can I suggest to look a little more closely at who’s running the destroyed portions of America? You do know we are a Constitutional Republic, right? Therefore, the reason trump lets states decide anything not directed by the constitution!
During a visit to West Texas, President Donald Trump hinted that a second round of stimulus checks could exceed the $1,200 payment amount issued in the first COVID-19 stimulus package.

You are right Liss_Sissy. Just another dumb Trump lackey. Even dumber than Brian Kemp which is hard to pull off. Why does it seem like anytime there is a really dumb politician, that he or she is a Republican. Vote blue no matter who in November. #WednesdayThoughts #COVID19

Creepy joe has worse record of holding back blacks than Trump. Do the research! His crime bill increased black incarcerations by 30+%. It made non-violent crimes for those incarcerated increased prison times higher than some violent crimes.
President Trump is expected to appear in the oil patch south of Midland to discuss America's leading role in energy.
We watch a cartoon every day here. Unfortunately, it isn't funny: Trump, the walking, talking cheeto.

President Donald Trump will visit the Permian Basin Wednesday for a campaign fundraiser in Odessa, followed by a tour of an oil rig at Double Eagle Energy.
Screenshotting this because one of trump’s are gonna flip when they see this
The FDA revokes the EUA. The FDA approves recommendations for treatments. Once the Trump admin aporoves this drug, assuming it has some efficacy, it should be used.   It’s Trump’s own admin that are in the way.
So would a door knob.
First reported by Politico, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert received a positive COVID-19 test during a pre-screening procedure Wednesday morning. He was present at William Barr's hearing yesterday, not wearing a mask and claiming he'd tested negative.
Nope. He just has to let MAGA be MAGA.   Biden has the Dems. Polls show he has the women vote. Biden has the black vote and looks like Hispanics are joining as well. All he needs is a few % of MAGA to abandon trump and he crushes trump.
If they were truly our allies Trump wouldn't have to insist NATO countries pay their 2% insist all trade be fair and reciprocal. they shouldve already been doing that. Instead they let American taxpayers and consumers subsidize them. With allies like that who needs allies.
They would take a bigger hit with Trump in office because he's demanding fair and reciprocal trade which doesn't give the economic advantages they were enjoying since WW2.
Tell me all the world leaders who want Trump reelected, none of them do. Since they're globalists, throwing their citizens under a bus is nothing to them to get rid of Trump, not so coincidentally the dems themselves have no problem destroying the economy to keep him from winning
Trump has appointed gold standard people to the fed and Trump has pulled the fed into the treasury. So never say never. Trump has a real grasp of all the problems career politicians have created and despite all the crap the swamp throws at him hes still managing to get stuff done
At least Trump is right about one thing!  #SilverLining
No it hasn't. When it comes to Trump you have TDS. so to you he can't even breath correctly
Trump to extend current DACA protections, reject new applications after Supreme Court knockdown
If you like corpses. Talk to Houston and San Antonio folks about it. Austin is a ghost town. Texas is getting flattened.  But we won’t call trump out on his complicity. And Abbott is starting to feel some personal responsibility for the crisis.   We are on fire.
Trump has done everything I could've asked for and more. As a person that voted for Trump in 2016, i say to all, I will vote for Trump in Nov. Even if it takes my dying breath to get to the voting booth
Considering the Trump admin scientists support this conclusion, I will trust them.   No demon seed will impact my decision
I can’t help but think Trump being president has something to do with it. The illusion of democracy is over.  That dipshit blew it to pieces. So welcome to the new normal. And unfortunately I am guessing it’s going to get worse before it gets better.
Alien DNA and demon sperm, man... ya can't make this shit up.  If she'd said Trump was created with alien DNA and demon sperm I might've believed it!
Until trump made fun of his wife and accused Ted’s dad of killing JFK. But at some point, Ted said, “Yep, going full MAGA”.
So the president isn't allowed to exercise and stretch his legs? He did prepare he got enough doses of hydroxychloroquine to protect the people. Unfortunately the media and dems can't have people surviving and keeping the country open that doesn't hurt Trump or his voters.
Or, and hear me out, look at Ted trying to stay relevant and jockey for a position in the potential next trump cabinet.
I bet he thanks “President Donald Trump”
Testing isn't a federsl issue its a state issue but since states were shirking there responsibilities Trump had to do the states job for them. Nice try though.
Joe! You're not doing anything! Not taking questions, not debating Trump, not helping anyone from your bunker. Sit Down and STFU!
But trump used Epstein’s pimp.... so there’s that
Works on malaria and lupus. COVID? Not so much. According to Trump’s FDA, this drug is not effective on COVID. This is from the trump admin. Full stop.
Meh... Trump lied 23 times, give or take, today.   Your problem is scale. Trump has changed the scale. Tolerance for lying is so much higher under a trump admin
President Donald Trump said that he will be accepting the Republican nomination for president in North Carolina, WRAL reports.

Twitter temporarily limited Donald Trump Jr.’s account after he posted a video featuring a doctor making false claims about coronavirus cures and mask usage, a Twitter spokesperson said Tuesday.
The trump family knowingly, and overtly, discriminated against blacks. This isn’t affirmative action; this is overt racial discrimination.   You can’t spin this
It is absolutely true. The Trump family settled with the DOJ (violations of the Fair Housing Act).
I care so little about what this platform offers that I will say whatever the fuck I want and if I’m silenced it will mean very little to me. I’d rather just call Trump a cunt and Musk a sack of shit while I have the ability. 👍🏻
Thanks to President Trump's tirelessly efforts.aa
Thank the Lord we have President Trump as commander and chief
4 More years for President Trump and VP Pence. Biden is so slow he will forget his way.
Biden failed the United States by his comments about using band as "reactionary" and President Trump having a " xenophobia." He would have killed many more Americans with his inabilities to make a command decision!
When Trump and Republicans say LAW they are referring to White Supremacy. When they say ORDER  these Trump Republicans mean they have the right to ignore any concerns pertaining to Black Americans. The Trump Administration is racist from the Head down.
Wow, I'm watching Nadler hold the live judiciary committy attacking AG Barr. It's absolutly comical. Nadler: Riots are a conspiracy theory. Barr is a lap dog for Trump. Unconstitutional federal troops for no reason. Its, a fu*king joke. Get rid of these idiots!
...and Trump's taxes
New FBI building? Next to trump hotel? In an economic rescue bill?  Feels “swampy”
Trump loves YOU ALL. He is able to use your own words to help his bid for re-election. With your help he will destroy any chance to reform policing and healthcare of he wins re-election.
So Trump is going to be in Midland and Odessa, Texas, tomorrow.  That's only a 5 hour drive from me.  🤬🤬🤬

George Washington was pretty good. Abe Lincoln freed the slaves. FDR did pretty good with WWII. Reagan defeated the USSR. Clinton brought a budget surplus (paid off the deficit).  You sure you want to stick with trump is the only....?
President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.

President Donald Trump will shift his focus to American energy dominance during a stop in Texas later this week that will include his first visit to an oil rig.
Trump supporters are attacked daily and no cares, the media only wants to reports on the virus or to question you about Russia.

Wow, Tom. Lots of replies are anti-trump. I think it’s the deep coup state cabal thingy
Who else thinks that history will refer to this as the Trump virus?
No president prior to trump has felt the need to barricade himself away from the American public.   This is telling.
Cruz accuses Democrats of coordinated effort to keep schools, businesses closed to hurt Trump

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Saturday that Republicans were set to roll out the next COVID-19 aid package Monday and assured there was backing from the White House after he and President Donald Trump's top aide met to salvage the $1 trillion proposal.
Why can’t trump get cabinet secretaries confirmed?
Counter argument, Trump getting in the middle of science caused this. Remember the very powerful light, internally?
Wait until you come to the realization that everybody in the media trying to tell you that we need to get rid of Trump, are the exact same people that are tied up in the Epstein case.
You don't get it but are entitled to your views. The reason the pandemic and economy are in horrible shape is because of POTUS. Many of the figures in your art would have nothing to do with President Trump if they were to meet him. Please educate yourself.
Trump's Merca is UGLY.
But the majority of studies have shown it is ineffective on coronavirus and can cause an increase in cardiac events.   Besides, what have you learned? If trump would stay out of the science stuff and just let the pros do their jobs, maybe we don’t end up in this situation.
Your voice is conspicuously absent among the anti-trump republicans
I am averaging close to 10 a day. I used to contribute to  (which is probably how the hot my email).   Given the tone is consistent day after day, yes, I expect they are successful with trump supporters. MAGA is all about desperation and “us against them”.
Because trump creates a news cycle every day that takes all of their attention?
Since trump is no conservative, we are taking the moral route.

Nah. Played golf with trump. Big dummy
All polls, every poll, shows trump trailing by bigger deficits than 2016. AND those polls showing a growing Dem majority in the House. AND they show the GOP losing the senate.   Polls are directional. They are not predictive. But it’s looking ugly for the  in Nov
The GOP will have to have a “come to Jesus” meeting after Trump. It looks like a Dem wave this fall which will cleanse the GOP ranks of many MAGAts. Be vocal. Help us rebuild the GOP. There is a place for all you believe.

Socialism doesn’t work. I would never support that.   Thankfully, the socialist candidate won’t get the Dem nom. Makes it easier to vote Dem this fall.   But truly, I would vote for a rock before I would vote for trump again.
You have been using the word “raciest”. I don’t know why. Maybe that’s what you meant. Maybe it was a typo.    Do I think Trump is racist? Yes. Absolutely.
Busy night for the trump campaign
Why?   Raciest: Amusing, entertaining in a sexual way.   Why would I call trump that?
Eric Trump seldom has a great idea. Be careful, Lou
Feels like an election year gambit. Kinda like Trump’s EO on drug prices. Why wait three years to do something?
Weird how they are growing their ranks! And allying with anti-trump republicans and conservatives have made them more influential.
This is a 2016 style disinformation tweet. Even Trump's most ardent "Black" and "Hispanic" supporters understand that Trump has sold his soul to Beelzebub and that this is an account to assist him, deceitfully so.
I’m sorry for your loss. I’m sure Mr Trump did not wish this young mans loss to you or our country.

While the DNC fundraising is training the GOP (by quite a bit), Biden continues to out-raise trump. Talk to me about enthusiasm!
While the RNC is outpacing the DNC, Biden is outpacing Trump. The burn rate should be especially concerning for trump. I wonder if the Biden-affiliated and Anti-Trump PACs (like     ) are a part of Trump's problem?

People like you are why Trump will lose.
He want lie. He does not have to cheat. He is an honorable man. He is a decent man.  He has served, his country, the people with dignity and fortitude thru good times and bad, he is everything Trump is not.
Sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils. It’s better then sitting at home and not voting and then complaining when Trump is in office for a second term. I’d be more concerned about the sexual predator in office.
I’ll be voting for whoever’s not Trump period. So whatever point being made is not gonna stop votes, you have two choices 🤷🏾‍♂️

He was not welcome to be in the presence of greatness, so he creates a distraction. Time we ignored Trump.
The problem with Trump is that if you don't respond with outrage he will think that he can actually do whatever he tweeted.  How do let him know that the idea is crazy without taking the bait?

Lawsuit Challenges Trump Administration’s Attack on Landmark Environmental Law
I watch Russian Television english here in Europe because I at least know it is negative and anti-american and why. Russian TV reporters present Trump as a racist and xenophobe. They also consider #russiagate a farce. I see no good relationship there.
MSM obscures his addiction (“President Trump appeared tired today, speaking slowly, sniffing”). A man prone to rages, can launch nuclear weapons at any time w/no outside approval, unchallenged by Congress, spends his day ‘self-medicated’ —stoned, high.
It takes a special kind of stupid to not see and understand the amazing things that are being done under the Trump Administration!

the video clip was about Germany. Also, Trump has been sanctioning them, funding the Ukraine military against them and building up military presence against them here in Europe. The #russiagate has already been proven a corrupt plot by Democrats, and fake.
The strange thing is that mainstream media only covered the democrats primaries. Trump also beat other republicans. Now, they polls mostly sample democrat voters so you don't get a real quality poll, it is BIASED. Like most of you. I guess u need the lies.
I followed the primaries closely. Had democrats and independents united they would have had about as many as Trump, but they didn't and Trump had double the delegates of the 'best' democrat.
When you take a historical Christian statement of belief and replace God or Jesus with “America” or “Donald Trump” you are commiting idolatry. Full stop. Dont pretend to be a Christian if you really worship and trust in a nation or a politician.

Legislators are just that, legislators. I know, many were lawyers in their previous life. But if the Democrats are serious about preserving our democracy, they need to recognize that this is a fight that Trump, Barr, et al. fully intend to win: by whatever crime necessary.  11/12
And find a way around the 5 minute rule! Yes, Dem Reps scored some "hits", got Barr to squirm a bit, but SO WHAT? To me, this political theatre, this trolling contest, suggests that the Democrats don't really have a plan on how to take on Barr, Trump, et al. Dems: just vote! 9/12
There's no question that Barr is Trump's Roy Cohn, and that Barr has turned the DoJ into a law office with one client: Donald Trump. The question is, WTF to do about it? There is no doubt as to Barr's criminality, and the risk to an election less than 3 months away is high. 4/12

Yes he does, and sadly many women don’t like Trump only because they don’t see him as “kind, nice, compassionate”... They refuse to look at his policies, and how much Americans, including them, have benefited from his policies.
Thus is the way a effing self-centered, petulant child talks: “why don't I have a high approval rating ...”. Trump's rant displays the emotional development of a five-year-old.

No, a co-conspirator in multiple coup d’etat attempts on President Trump
Prove she isn't
Because Leftist Media and Democrats (and Deep State) are engaged in massive brainwashing of the masses... they need to censor and limit any counter arguments to their anti-Trump narratives. And it’s easy for “big heart” people and under 98 IQ people. It’s frightening.
Anthony Fauci denies Trump claim that he misled US public about coronavirus
Reuters, NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, PBS, all paint the picture they want Americans to see ... “peaceful protests”...   If it supported their narrative to oust President Trump, they’d call an invasion by China with tanks a “peaceful protest”, too.
In this case it is. The reason this was possible is because Trump threw out the oversight committee. Imagine leaving an armored car on the street with no guards.

Trump RTs this, his son pronounces her video a must see. The GOP sure recognize quality when they see it.
I don’t wish anyone bad, but Trump should have never been elected President of the United States.
To be honest if this work ,which some have, a lot of people will vote for trump for saying it back 4 months ago
You do know she’s siding with trump right, she even talks about cnn
I believe that man, but do you know trump said this 4 months ago
How the hell is that trump supporters
Go trump
Thanks for helping get President Trump re-elected with your imbecilic 1619 project 😂
According to the FDA (the one Trump put together), it does.
That's soo destructive of trump to attack Fauci.  I also just watched a video of a doctor pushing Hydroxychloroquine .   This is not helpful.
Just another one of trump’s narcissistic thoughts. He actually believes his own lies.

99 more day then we can hand you and Trump pink slips. Oh that means you are fired.
You do know trump said this
There's no excuse for this. None. #petty
I sure hope the president of the United States catches and dies from the Trump Virus so he can personally see what happens when states open back up. #Trumpleadingfromthefront
Trump has 2 lonely brain cells that backstabb each other for trump's attention.
I can't locate the link the moment, but perhaps this would improve his mood: COVID-19 tests now include an ability to determine the political preferences of the viral protein itself, and all copies of corona virus analyzed thus far show unanimous support of President Trump.
Trump’s meeting with pharmaceutical execs collapses after companies refuse to send anyone  #SmartNews
Seconded.  When BBF Hannity tossed him a snowball about second term agenda, Trump managed only that "experience" is "a very important word," John Bolton is "an idiot."  And later: "We are doing things that nobody could have done."  Trump doesn't know *how* to debate, only debase.
There have been numerous “private” meetings between Trump and Putin with no other US staff present. Or if a US Russian translator present, their notes personally seized by Trump.
MSM will at best report some version of “President Trump appeared tired today, speaking slowly, sniffing, ...”. That a man prone to rages, who can launch nuclear weapons at any time w/no outside approval, unchallenged, spends his day ‘self-medicated’ —stoned, high —is terrifying.
God bless him! Hell has a spot awaiting your arrival. And Pappa Trump won’t be able to pay your way out.

Tom Cotton harbors aspirations to hold higher office one day (PRESIDENCY)!  That must NEVER be allowed to happen. He’s Trump in sheep’s clothing. He needs to be thoroughly trounced and thrown out of the Senate in total disgrace  and ignominy.
Trump by a landslide.
Fuck Trump and I’m glad he’s not going.
What happened to Trump's campaign promise. We will be winning till our heads will be spinning. Our heads are spinning because of the mess he has made in handling the pandemic and the unemployment.
Donald Trump has no idea how to run a country and is not willing to learn. Does he realize that America represents 4% of the world's population and yet has 25% of Covid 19 cases. When will the GOP learn that they were elected to serve the people and not their supreme leader.
Can never get the truth from tyrant regimes. We are too scared to speak. Much like the Chavez &amp; Maduro regime.   Fauci: Some messages from Trump's task force don’t match reports from 'trenches'
So, we’re in a middle of a pandemic, millions are unemployment with some benefits expiring this week, Trump is rambling as incoherently as ever and FLOTUS decides its time to renovate the rose garden? What in the actual fuck?

Gutfield. I dare you to tweet anything you feel trump made a mistake on.
no. trump should have taken it seriously like a grown up, like a president &amp; set a National strategy &amp; take advice &amp; review data &amp; change strategy if the data indicates it.  Gov. Abbot in Texas has now  realized this &amp; is now leading Texas in the right direction.

Obama what he wants is the black vote 4 Joe Biden a lot of mail get lost this that accurate to send it by mail keep trash constantly President Trump and divided America this what he has done since he was in office and he wants it office again that's why he's fighting for .

That photo of Hitler looks alot like Fred Trump ...
I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump’s got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That’s...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump’s saying there’d be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don’t even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...
This would be my thoughts on how Republicans would try to keep Trump in office without an election.
Did he sign the Trump's don't sue Me paper?

Bias is telling the story and then sharing their own opinion on it, but they make sure that they portray trump and trump supporters as evil. You see reporters time and time again taking the time to insult him and manipulate his words instead of reporting on him.
Okay I’ll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, “whether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.” Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one’s own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
Sadly all the GOP is in lock goose step with dear leader trump.  No one from that party will call him out.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

The Trump administration has granted  an already rogue and immoral agency, the power to detain and expel people from the U.S. without any record or paper trial. That’s the horror behind the secret detentions in hotels.

the military won't back Trump for sure. MAYBE a General will try something but there's "coup stops" in the command structure &amp; it would be NEARLY impossible. Besides, the CIA is so addicted to swilling metric tons of cash any threat to dollars value will be "pacified" quick-like.
Last week the Trump admin asked a judge to delay the release of immigrant kids in ICE detention. The deadline is Monday and the govt had asked for a stay of the judge's order to release kids in family detention centers because of "substantial issues raised." The judge denied it.
Dear Gov Abbott:  This is what it has come to, #deathpanels. If you don’t have the guts to do what it takes to get the #Trump Virus under control, take the gloves off and let the locals that do take control.
The tumultuous history of Donald Trump and female reporters | The Independent #SmartNewsNetflix series he was one of Epsteins lawyers. I do believe he may be part of the sickos. I don't want to belive it because he helped trump through impeachment scam but not looking good for him.
I forgot the source!! My apologies,
Isn't it a disease control device? Look at the numbers. The guy who promoted not wearing masks at that trump rally died recently from covid. Like come on this isn't that Orwellian it's more common sense. My 10 year old is smart enough to wear one..
So non American citizens have more respect for our country than Americans do? Amazing! It must be all those people who moved to Canada when Trump became president! Impressive!
Trump hates Einstein.  Trump hates Salk. Trump hates Gore. Trump hates Fauci.  #TrumpHatesScience
Science is the one truth Trump can't counter with "alternative facts"! #TrumpHatesScience
Once by text no reply after I indicated Trump for Texas
Completely forgot that president trump was going to be in Odessa/midland yesterday, slept through it and completely missed it, this is so sad, despacito, play country roads.
Let me guess, trump's the good guy? Hope you are against masks!
During the eulogy of a Civil Rights leader, The President can’t stop making it all about him. To call for an emergency press conference while Obama was speaking, shows just how desperate Trump is. Better throw Fox News in the fake news category for not breaking coverage of eulogy
No bc u want be president! Trump 2020!🇺🇸🇺🇸
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That’s why I’m joining #ProtectTheResults:
Thanks gov for letting us vote early! And thank you for not ducking trump balls. Tell ted cruz to retire...
Trump administration easing more Obama-era oil and gas rules
Nonsense. He has been called a racist since illegally denying blacks housing in the 1970s.
Trump has [completely unintentionally!] done 1 good thing for America. He's shown us a basic weakness in our Constitution: that if a corrupt person gets elected president, &amp; said president has the support of a majority-corrupt Senate, we've a BIG problem. BIGGER if voting rigged!
Wish I would’ve seen trump yesterday 😒
From west Texas baby! No, I dont like trump
I'm not saying Trump is theologically Satan. But he IS a megalomaniac devil.
So are all the other countries in on this too?  Did they agree to crash their economies to stop trump from getting re-elected?
Still won't kill you like Covid-19 will. How is Trump doing handling the pandemic? Fatalities would indicate he's not doing much of a job.
And you know that Trump is a racist, and will continue to support him.
Fine, I'll bite.
Spc. Vanessa Guillén's family to introduce the #IAmVanessaGuillen bill, meet with Trump
Trump finds them on "Reality" television. Trump is all about Show &amp; Ratings. [and racism, misogyny, white power, money-laundering, etc.]
I live in a solid part of "Trump Country." I don't think they care about anything except themselves &amp; using their Trump "status" as a kind of middle finger gesture to the rest of us.
(2/2) I am not sure what I am more frightened about, Trump getting reelected or a President Biden.  Petulance vs incompetence 2020
I will as long as Trump is president. Thank you.
No, Trump's idiocy is helping the Democrats cause. If he had a small modicum of empathy for the average hard working American he would have had no problems being re-elected. Face it, George W Bush had way more class and empathy than this selfish clown Americans elected as #POTUS
If America becomes Venezuela, it will all because of Trump. Mark my words.
Trump raised $7 million yesterday in the Permian... imagine if we were in a boom?!
I sick that Trump did not cancel his rally during a state wide emergency.

Trump trailing in the polls against  ....  That's it, that's the joke.
Have you met the democratic party? I'll take none of the above for 200 Alex. That party you speak of is long gone and will never return without accountability and cleansing. Trump is doing that now. Hope you see your party again soon.
I am white and was raised in inner city of Chicago! U tweet is racist! And Trump has done more for the black race in3 years then any other president save Abraham Lincoln!
U need to resign !Mr. Barr is not going anywhere and nor is Trump
Love having you here! TRUMP 2020
You might want to ask the NATO generals about that. They claim Trump made NATO stronger. But what would they know....
trump supporters are the most pathetic ass people in the world
Trump came into town earlier and I totally missed him!! #Trump2020 #Maga2020
Trump was in my hometown today. The cultism is scaring me.
Covering Trump gave me a farmer’s tan 😓
weird how some of y’all suddenly became trump supporters🤡
President Nixon used to be anti-communism, but he had clear mind of the world, he knew China will be a global player one day. So he opened a chapter for the Americans and Chinese. Today’s president trump and his administration seems to less smart than their predecessors.
Trump 2020!🇺🇸🇺🇸
Awesome!  Thank you President Trump!

I think it was a little too hot for trump out here. He looked quite shiny for an orange today.
Jk bro I don’t support Trump &amp; I’m actually living in Mexico right now. Try not to take Twitter so seriously &amp; you might live longer 😳 you just almost had a heartattack from arguing with 2 guys you dont even know on social media 😱
Midland/odessa gonna appreciate trump when the work booms and nobody gives a shit about the virus
I like trump, because his words is understandable. He didn’t use much of figure speech. #NobodyLikesTrump
What you want us to do? Jump the mf? You aint even supposed to be here to begin with, just shut up &amp; work. &amp; VOTE DONALD TRUMP! 🇺🇸
True that. Your revulsion at Trump requires slavishness toward the other side. I used to think Boot was smart.
Y’all herd it here first guys. If you’re hispanic, you cannot support Trump. No other political factor matters. 😵🤣
How long is it going to take  to reverse all of Trump dangerous policies.
What does Trump have to do with following your dreams
President Trump  passing by my work today in Midland, TX!!! #MAGA2020 #KeepAmericaGreat2020 #Trump2020 #TrumpLandslideVictory2020
Just a few sights from President Trump’s visit to the basin today. We’ll have the EXCLUSIVE 1 on 1 interview with POTUS on  at 10.
It's not everyday you get to cover the President. I talked to local Trump supporters who waited for hours outside just to get a glimpse of him.
no offense but the ppl who are pressed about trump being here are the same ones who just drink every weekend and go off of everything based on what their friends say/think.
Loved the speech! He speaks the truth! Thank you President Trump for visiting Midland Odessa today! We stand beside you all the way!!!!
It was great to have you in Midland today!!  Trump 2020!!!  WWG1WGA
Unfollowing everyone supporting Donald trump simply bc you’re annoying me

trump came to midland today &amp; you would have thought Jesus Christ himself rode bareback on a donkey for days to bring these people maga hats &amp; flags
Donald Trump is not even 10 miles from the pad I’m working on rn. He’s doing a tour on an oil rig down here. THATS MY PRESIDENT!!!
Scenes from President Trump's arrival in Midland
President Trump in Midland/Odessa Tx! Posted on the I-20 Interstate! #Trump2020        #midland #TrumpInTexas #proudtobeanAmerican #oilgas
Yep. Cause they’d definitely be fired for attending a pro-life or Trump rally
Please don’t vote for trump :(
My family got a selfie with the president of the United States! Nice to See you in Texas Trump!
And the projections for Trump tax cuts were off bc they didn’t account for increased investment or taxable revenue.  They only took current numbers and allied the lower %’s. I can do the best projection in the world and forget one variable and be massively wrong.
And tax cuts for Amazon to hire more people and invest in Business infrastructure is different than personal tax cuts for Bezos.  The same guy who vastly supports a $15 min wage btw. Tax revenue, again, increased after Trump tax cuts. Wages rose for lower class.
Sparse crowd lines up to greet Trump at airport in Midland. A confederate flag can be seen waving in the background two days after School Board renamed Robert E Lee High School!
Imagine Trump pulling up to Shack lmao
Trump is in Odessa rn and this fool has the audacity to close the highway bitch people are trying to get home 😤
Great day !  President Trump here in my home town-
Great day in Midland Texas! President Trump here, letting us know how much he supports our oil industry.  Lots of support here.  He will win Texas.  His phrase for today was “Don’t Mess with Texas”.  Well known to all Texans.
If you think trump is going to the glue factory,  it seems you need the caring for. The elite hate him because he is exposing everything. He has a trump card and I'm sure will use it at some point soon. Already exposing the pedo sickos.
Trump playing Village people "YMCA" athis speech to an all male white audience in cowboy hats in Midland Texas. Reminiscent of "Brokeback Mountain" at Double Eagle Energy.
You come to Midland? We were there to welcome you and your dad. Thank you the Trump  family for saving our country.
trump sweating his ass off in this west texas heat😹
Newsflash to Trump! Midland is becoming progressive. Just this week the local  School Board voted to rename Robert E Lee High School.
Not admissible evidence, I might add.
Blame it on Trump. He knew about the virus since November and didn't do a damn thing until he people started dying in the thousands.
Trump complaining of problem in Portland ironically as he never addressed the mass shooting in Midland Odessa. Shooter was mentally ill and obtained assault weapon legally. Local victims asked to talk to him and cruz! Crickets!
So why blame her for a status quo that was put into place long before she was elected? You might as well blame abortions on Trump when he was living there.
What are Trump supporters, Alex?
Watch: Trump delivers remarks at Double Eagle Energy rig
The oil industry was destroyed in America as Trump kissed Saudi's Ass they screwed Midland and the Permian Basin. The virus was not the cause of crash!
Under Obama oil was 70 dollars a barrel and The oil industry in Midland crashed. Trump telling Doubld Eagle Energy that Trump was good for energy industry!
Them people was sooo upset that they changed the name of a high school that they call trump down here😂😂
Trump is insane: And it's time for leading Democrats to say that out loud | News Break
to all y’all trump supporters, suck a dick. ^.^
I honestly feel like throwing up being at work today. Everyone loves Donald Trump and I hate it here. I’m a wetback so I don’t fit in.
Today (you know Donald is here in Midland) my manager said she loves trump (she’s Mexican) and she said why don’t you like him. I said “because he hates us?” And she said “if Mexicans would stop being wet backs and come the right way y’all would be fine” my entire family came
Right, on top of the fact that I would NEVER risk catching rona just to see Donald Trump of all people

Trump landing
It’s “FUCK TRUMP” Til he gets here and now everyone’s kissing ass . 😂😂
President Trump’s grand entrance off Air Force One - now I officially have a sneaky selfie with the VP and the President... with extreme social distancing 😅🇺🇸
My welo is so happy Trump is here today because he’ll be looking at his company’s pipeline, it makes me happy for him :(
President Trump coming to West Texas.
Not Donald trump is really down here 😂
My area of Texas where I live is going buck wild crazy cause trump just landed to give a speech.
and I made our way to the Double Eagle Energy oil rig where President Trump will be speaking this afternoon
Here is Trump landing in Midland. No mask even though we are a covid hot spot. Everyone on ground has masks and he greets them breaking the social distancing guidelines. Unbelievable.
Reporter’s Notebook: Trump's visit to Midland
Me looking at the videos of people hanging around the airport to welcome Trump to midland and none of them are wearing masks. Nasty
Look at the Trump delegation landing in the Covid ridden Midland Odessa area. All Texas officials on ground have masks on. Most of the Trump delegation do not. And Trump is not social distancing coming in 6 feet of Governor Abbott.
why don't yall start doing real news coverage like the child pedophilia, human trafficking news going on. Amazing y'all can find out what underwear Trump is wearing, but can't report real news.
I hope traffic isnt all wack since trump is here. Luckily i drive back to el paso today 👀
Hahaha I wish!!  Any chance Trump signed a  helmet  #PonyUp
People are really paying thousands of of dollars just to meet Trump?? 😂😂
That’s why I don’t support big business republicans. It’s why I don’t donate to Trump. He has enough money, he doesn’t need mine.  But until you stop believing the MMT bs you will keep allowing our leaders to spend our money and line their pockets.  And we will be Venezuela.
Then they’ll keep being a shit company making shit cars.  Oh, but they said they would make eco friendly cars... so they’re the good guys, we can give them money. And their CEO doesn’t like Trump and donates to DNC. So open up the gov wallet.
Trump has arrived in Midland. #Trump2020
President Trump arrives in Midland
Welcome to West Texas Sir! Trump/Pence 2020!!
Apparently the oil rig that Trump is visiting today is like a mile from my house. Glad I work at home and don’t have to deal with that traffic
if you support trump just unfollow me
I know all this traffic ain’t cause trump bitch ass
Trump land in Midland Texas to a crowd of 20 people to greet him. Very sad!
And sometimes we elect them as presidents(ie Trump).
How could America elected an antichrist like Trump?
Never paid for a woman's abortion like Trump has though.
Biden is way more transparent and honest than President Trump. I would mark your foolish tweet as a false equivalency.
Trump Daaaaaaay!
trump just arrived in midland today, disgusting af

President Trump is scheduled to land in Midland at 11:40AM. #TrumpinTexas
who’s watching trump fly in just seen a bunch of people parked on business 20 like idiots
People really took off work to go park on 191 to see Trump. 🤢
For the rest of my days I will never understand this cult for trump.
You can't legally arrest people without a warrant. Sorry, but this is Pinochet type autocracy we're seeing in Portland. President Trump is in the wrong, and his behaviors will come back to haunt him.
Covering President Trump’s visit to the Basin with  Right now we’re at the Marriott Hotel in Odessa, where the President is set to hold his fundraiser luncheon. Many attendes are lining up to get inside.
While all the police in Midland are occupied on Trump I might as well go rob a bank real quick 😭🤣
Excellent perspective from Speaker Craddick: Trump is committed to West Texas’ recovery  via  #txlege
Just got my temperature checked and was screened. President Trump should be arriving in Midland soon.
I doubt it will be by Late October/Early November but there is enough concern right now to push people to be in the middle.   If we see unemployment fall again this month I suspect Trump will see a 2-3% jump in most polls overnight.
I hope someone plays FDT when Trump arrives at the airport
Here at Midland International Airport, Trump supporters are here for his arrival in the basin. Air Force One is scheduled to land at 11:30 and we’ll have coverage on air and on
I live in Midland. Covid is overwhelming our hospital as Trump supporters don't wear masks. He doesn't have plans to visit with our frontline medical workers but he taking pictures at 100k a pic for his campaign!

If I don’t get to watch a Trump/Biden debate, then what’s this all been about? What have I been working towards?
So far they have censored conservatives with their rhetoric tactics.  Will be so glad when Trump gets to rally back.  By the way Peside Trump- welcome to Midland Texas.  My home town.  Excited to have you here.
He touts "law and order" but the sister of Odessa mass shooting victim says are streets are far from safe. Carla Byrne requested to speak wit Trump and Cruz but they refused. #MidlandOdessa
We were briefed by CIA, and FBI, since President Trump will be in Midland today for a fundraiser. I just hope to catch a glimpse of Air Force One. I’m sure that plane is bigger than the whole Midland airport.
Remember when Collins was caught on a hot mic calling Trump "crazy" yet she never calls him out in public. She wouldn't voteto impeach. She knows the truth. She's a stooge!
So President Trump will be arriving tomorrow here in the Permian basin arriving at Midland International Space station and airport. A Who's excited? #TrumpPressConference  #Midland  #odessa #HAHAHA
Great nation like India has to borrow Trump' slogan. 😂
Trump admin playbook: 1. Blame Obama                                              2. That never happened                               3. Try buzzwords like “cancel culture” 4. Word salad
Watch them change LHS  to Donald Trump high school😂
One and done president.  I even hate to use that term when it comes to trump because he is NOT a president.  He is a whiny narcicist who only cares about destroying anything that Obama accomplished and playing golf.  He DOESN'T READ SECURITY BRIEFINGS, HE DOESN'T TRY TO LEARN
You are underestimating just how much the majority of Americans detest your candidate.   You say people will crawl over broken glass to vote for trump?  You have no idea what the rest of us will do to make sure that that lying criminal bastard that stole the 2016 election is a
I wana see trump land ✈️
Trump is saving America. Thanks for your input though.
Odessa releases traffic information ahead of Trump’s visit
But it's copacetic when Trump does it?
You're thinking of President Trump.
People need to stop overestimating the power of the President. Does anyone remember civics class? Or government? The three branches have equal power. People thinking Trump can just do whatever he wants are overreacting or trying to make him more than he is.  Both sides do it.
Don't think he's a Trump supporter, sir.
you suck at your job too. How the hell are you the rep for Florida and blaming Trump for the COVID cases? Why don't all of y'all tell how y'all are lying about the cases and they changed once the cases were stopped being reported to the CDC?
Just saw some people selling trump flags on wall st. Bout to drive by blasting fuck Donald Trump.
Trump is coming to Midland Texas tomorrow where our Mayor followed Trump's no masks needed advice. We have a surging case count and people are dieing everyday! Trump killed Texans and its economy! #TrumpKillsTexas
I can agree to that. I agree that Trump can single handedly unite this country as well. Unfortunately, his opposition and the MSM negate his efforts at every turn. It's frustrating to me. Imagine him with his plateful. I'd be frustrated too and I usually keep a good composure.
That was a premeditated attack on the US. One could argue that the virus was too, but even if it was proven, when Trump mentioned it was a blatant attack on us, the left wing media used words such as racism, dictator, cruel, unworldly, disruptive, etc....
Correct, they aren't important. Solutions are important. You and I know that the left literally blames every possible negative situation on Trump.
4+ million confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 150,000 deaths, and...this.
Trump anonzwa shona here😂😂
Don't forget they are pushing shut downs and protests 🤷🏻‍♂️ But is Trump's fault 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ Unreal isn't it? But by all means, vote blue. Trump is actively doing what he can while the left just blames him. What's their solution... Hindsight 20/20 isn't going to bring a solution.
OMG....🤦🏻‍♂️ Everything is spun into "Trump's fault". Unreal with you folks that believe everything the left spews.
If CNN, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, etc said that you will die from ten minutes of sun exposure this month, the sheep would believe it. Then they would blame Trump 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
And couple that with the 1.0% raises he gave the military the rest of his tenure idt that 3.4% was really his idea.  I know all of my buddies who still serve are happier now then they were for 08-16. Vets overwhelmingly support Trump. And for good reason.
It's sad that the left followers truly believe in every single "spin" of every situation as truth. Ridiculously sad. Common sense, from any neutral person, shows the agenda set by the left. We all have choices, but somehow our choices r Trump's fault, unless it's a good choice 🤦🏻‍♂️
This has absolutely nothing to do with trump. He was manipulated into believing he was actually fighting for a legit cause. He played a stupid game and unfortunately won the stupid prize.
no, that happens all the time.. trump and pence have both been quoted, they are handed stuff all the time.. it wasnt a freemason handshake, its a roman style, grab the palm.. my preacher does it, its more endearing than a reg shake
Again Dan I’m a conservative who thinks we should cut military budget by 10-15%. Buts it’s for equipment we don’t need anymore of. The f-35 was a masterclass in gov waste and Pelosi spearheaded it.  Obama refused to give soldiers raises, Trump did give them raises.
I was in the Military under Obama.  He defunded it pretty hard. Which killed morale. Also, as we have already gone over my inability to have the VA do anything.  And buying F-35’s doesn’t fund the military. Trump got pay raises for soldiers, Pelosi is getting for herself.
Trump is going to incite a war with China. A military war not a trade war. It's the Republican plan on how to keep power. #MorningJoe
Trump's coming? Wednesday? Uhhh... wrong... no tf he is not.. get him out?! 🤨

The president of Midland Texas School Board is a Republican and penned this op-ed on Sunday calling for Lee High School to change its name! This is a must read! And a sign that Trump is over!
They also don’t take into account anything pre-trump. The vast majority of these “accomplishments” are a result of continued trends from the previous administration. Obama brings the unemployment rate down from 12% to 5% and no one cares. Trump goes from 5% to 4% and woohoo
The Right is done with Trump's racist agenda as Midland County Texas School Board voted in a 5-1 decision to change name of Robert E Lee High School tonight! This is a statement! This is the end of Trump!
To do otherwise would be to "help Trump" which is absolutely against their agenda.  The media would rather commit treason than inadvertently help Trump.
Breaking The Midland County Texas School Board just voted to change the name of Midland Lee High School in a 5 to 1 vote! Texas does not stand with the racist Trump agenda!  #TrumpleThinSkin
President Trump 🇺🇸 is coming to west texas tomorrow! That s good news 👍🏻a failed athlete and an inept doctor are not.... 👎🏻
😂😂your hilarious Peter. You must just surf news stories all day looking for ways to blame Trump for everything.
I have no real confidence about how things are going to go after Trump loses. Yes, there will be a "Rump Trump" body of people who will follow him to hell. But will he still hold sway over the Rs? I just don't know. He will take over OnAN.
Well in the case of Trump, you get him elected president.
Craddick: Trump’s commitment to energy will be on display
Trump's national security adviser has coronavirus
They should pay the price but doubt they will. What's new!  Biden hates oil and gas yet sure bought into in. We in the Permian Basin are counting on you to get us back. Trump 2020
Not to mention, you don't have to pay Taliban's. They already were at war with US Troops.... For say least 20ish years. 🤦🏻‍♂️ False news being eaten up by idiots. You'd probably shoot yourself in the foot and then blame Trump.

What's the big deal? It seems "peaceful" to me! But Trump is the evil one trying to stop this destruction of our American cities...

I understand what you’re saying about finding some common ground, and we used to be able to compromise, but the problem we have now is there is no in between. It’s Trump or socialism, and these marxist that are destroying our liberal cities.I’m not willing to give an inch to them
What's up with the thumb thing? Is Trump trying to hitch a golf cart ride to the 19th hole?

Trump hater got it. Any reason you have been home since March? And somehow you blame trump? Get help.

I feel for you if you're naive enough to believe trump will do anything for African Americans.   After all, he didn't even want them in his apartments.
And you're saying trump is coherent?  Or even smart?  You need to read his answer to Hannity when he asked trump what his vision for the next 4 years is.  Because if you consider that intelligent  or even coherent ... then you're an idiot as well.
No coincidence that thousands of Latinos are perishing from Covid and a hurricane in south Texas as Trump invests in a well rather than medical assistance and golfs with Brett Favre! #WallAgainstTrump

They won't be reserves. Trump will pull 75,000 from every federal law enforcement agency in existence leaving bare bones staff to carry out their departments' original mission.
Sorry RGV. Probably not enough Trump voters there. Good luck God bless.
Vote TRUMP 2020. Shut him down.
He's coming to Midland on Wednesday and Trump is not planning on visiting Corpus Christi. It's a blue county.
Homeless and covid raging in Texas. Trump's coming to Midland on Wednesday to tout our economy. So many homeless here!
😆 pathetic, the federal government should offer them full-time jobs , I’m sure they all disappear immediately, no need to shoot them ever again...let them live they drugged dream, we who love this beautiful country, we just have to go out and vote. Trump 2020 🇺🇸!!
Trump administration cannot handle the #Covid_19. So he keeps referring it as #ChinaVirus. Bring the nationalism and scapegoat China for the election with  What a cheap play. You are better than that. As a grown man, you need take the full responsibility.
Right, and I have a bridge I’d like to sell you over the Potomac River. These asswipes are making money at the Lincoln Project.  They hire themselves to run adds opposing Trump. And ignorant Americans deposit cash into their accounts daily.
At least president Ronald Reagan is great, he was California governor before, and he is a politician. But trump doesn’t serve any public office before he is a president. He only served his trump group. And #Apprentice.
Trump didn't realize that child separation was a bad thing. It took classy Republican, normally reserved Former First Lady, Laura Bush to speak out against it for him to stop! Melania just "didn't care"! #AmericasGreatestMistake
Crazy huh, it’s not that hard to see what is right and wrong people!! GO TRUMP 2020!!
Trump is A racist and Biden is A pedophile .. can we get new candidates ! 👏🏻👏🏻
Don't mind this guy. He is a outdated actor, a literal propaganda clown. This dude don't give a shit about our community. He is a undercover Trump lover. Probably just undercover in general.
So glad he is!!!Trump 2020!🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump was never Vice President. I was speaking on Biden, sir. Keep up with the conversation. Is English even your primary language?
Dear Ted Cruz, The Republicans are gas lighting us on tyranny. Trump's entire agenda has been us against the world!  "If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy."  James Madison

Parscale isn’t the campaign manager anymore.  Also Trump has a huge $$ advantage. People have stopped giving since he’s so far ahead. I know I have.
Dear Donald Trump, You are planning on coming to Midland Texas and give a speech. PLEASE STAY AT HOME. Since you took office our economy collapsed; we endured a mass shooting that was preventable with gun laws, and a raging pandemic. #JoeBidenJob
President Trump is visiting one our rigs and I don’t think I’ve ever seen grown men so excited!

So does President Trump.
Stop deflecting and giving mulligans to Trump. Trump is a dishonest president and businessman. If Obama broke the law he should be convicted. Same with Trump. This shouldn't be that difficult for you to comprehend.
We weren't talking about abortion, but I'm game. If Trump is so pro life why does he keep reimbursing Planned Parenthood?

Yes Texas is in play! Please don't forget the massacre in El Paso that Trump inspired!#TrumpTheDisasterSo spending money on sycophants partying unmasked at Trump resorts and events isn't working??? wow
I would love for Bernie to be in the White House but sadly that ain’t gonna happen. But we can’t have another 4 more years of Trump we can’t. This past 4 years have been a chaotic shitshow and it needs to stop.

And the rest of America yawned ... Jayapal is an incompetent joke. They defied Trump, so it will be equally easy to defy Biden.
He is laughing at this. It’s the only explanation I can come up with. Trump is using this 14th century medical “expert” to make fun of Fauci in some odd way. No one believes this. Well besides cultists.
Unless the Durham report comes out before November we will never get justice, unless Trump wins.

Someone explain why the city officials are allowing this to continue? Do they really believe it's hurting Trump? Are they willing to sacrifice their cities to hurt Trump?
So if trump is telling us flat out that he’s rigging it, how do we get around it?  Make no mistake, he’s tattling on himself here. He usually does.
This country was fucked way before trump.
No one cared that Trump sold HCQ to Brazil with some of the highest mortality rate when it was debunked but here we are again.
Twitter is such a little b*tch...  Yet they continue #Orwellian censorship with absolutely ZERO consequence. Nobody's coming to help. They own Congress &amp; Trump has done nothing.  It's US vs Them.
Of course they knew! If President Trump had not been for it could have saved many, many lives. Instead the "experts", MSM, Democrats, Trump haters and big pharma simply had to be against it's effectiveness.
Every hospital in every democrat state is lying about covid numbers to steal the extensive federal emergency funds-more than even to discredit trump
That is how Trump wins....
Rowlett/Garland Texas had a trump parade of boats at lake ray Hubbard.  More than 600 boats, all the restaurants sold out in outside seating. New photographers showed up. TOOK NO PICTURES. NOBODY GOT HURT, BEATEN OR SHOT. NO VIOLENCE-FAKE NEWS DOESN’T CARE
Does this have anything to do with a headline I saw that said Trump Admin loosening US policy on exporting drones?  I just saw the headline pop up and thought it might be important to remember...
Dude, where have you been?  Trump is trying to open schools and Biden and Dems want them closed.  What do you not get?
Well, the GOP certainly knows how to win the hearts of hard working Americans. NOT.   Time to oust Trump's #1 rump kisser and vote for MJ Hegar who will support the working class people in the state. #TexasDeservesBetter than this.  Vote for
I believe should use common sense and remember what that orangy, racial, ignorant jackass has done to this country. But I'm afraid that common sense is really hard for Trump people. Let's hope and vote!
Can you give any hints? I may have to call my credits and my mortgage company to let them know that I won't be able to pay on time. Why are you screwing us over? You have a job, you get paid, you have your home. We lost jobs because Trump wasn't prepare for this. Not our fault!!
No but HELL NO! Can't deal with Trump and his cronies who have NO common sense!
How you want to be in the same room with Trump it beyond my understanding. Everything is  COMMON SENSE and not your kind of common sense!   It's not our fault!!  ** HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?** If you still have a heart, please, don't screw us.
Why would you want to hurt the unemployed through no fault of our own?  I had finally found a job I really liked but was laid off because of you, the other Republicans and your leader Trump, who obviously couldn't care less about the rest of us.
Then i guess that couple that decided to point their gun at protesters should have been shot at? Pro-gun users do that all the time, especially trump supporters.
Think our TX Senator may be getting worried. It's about time Trump's #1 rump kisser woke up to the the changing climate and the blue tidal wave coming to Texas. #TexasDeservesBetter than John Cornyn Vote for MJ Hegar 2020
Once again, TX Senator retweeting without any comment. He thinks by laying low, he can skate by and win re-election one more time. If he has no new material, we don't need him. #TexasDeservesBetter than Trump's #1 rump kisser MJ Hegar has new material. Vote for
Christian and trump supporter... 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I understand the thinking, but Biden and Dems need to do what’s best for the people and not let Trump and  drive this narrative.     I wish we can have 4 VPs!  So many great choices!
Always the same kind of animals !
LMAO its ok, he has a couple more months talking about trump and it will be no more once he’s out of office 😂
Nah, I just choose not to converse with someone that’s immature enough to go find one extreme pic and try to throw it out as some all encompassing trump card.
But of course the unions dont, against Trump by All means. Socialists.
Why Dems know they are doing all this. Are Already laying the groundwork against Trump by saying he wont leave office as demagogue.  When it's really due 2 their trying 2 steal election as history &amp; recent events prove. Dems are up 2 old stealing moves
The federal government declared a national emergency. Which in doing so puts the coordination on them at that point. Trump even before that was trying to downplay it. So then his constituents (Republicans who control congress) follow along. It starts with him....
I dont care about biden. Whatever his problems are hes not as bad as trump. Trump also the guy who said if you don't test you won't have  coronavirus case. 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
Trump could have done this: Keep in mind he declared national emergency so that then is to coordinate response to the states. 1. Actually used DPA to mfr ppe and ventilators until there is surplus across the nation.  2. Nationwide shutdown  3. Money to citizens and small business
So the rest of us had the info but trump didnt? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
You're the one who said somehow Democrats are responsible for covid failure when trump is president and has a Republican Senate. So why dont you start...
I'm not a Democrat or Republican but please explain how they are more responsible for the COVID19 failure. I mean this is 2020. We see every tweet, press conference and rally from trump. We dont need the news or politicians to tell us. Its right in front of us.
When Joe Biden says that Donald Trump is the first racist president (it follows his supporters as well) he’s not saying that Trump hates black and brown people? And if Joe is making that claim, are his statements getting the attention they deserve?
Yep I am voting trump
Ew wtf, Black people do not like trump for 1. And 2, Texas is now a battleground state, and is actually a blue state but leans slightly red to ridiculous gerrymandering.
Trump will say anything
wtf is trump supposed to do he’s told people what to do to slow the spread of the virus he cannot make people do anything. its up to the people to do something.
funny how you are tied in Texas according to polls, but in NTX only Trump signs and flags fly. Nothing, absolutley nothing for crazy Joe Biden.
I’m with you sister!  One blue dot in a sea of red here in Texas surrounded by family &amp; friends who are all on the Trump Train but I will not be silent!
It doesn't matter if Trump wants to leave. On January 21, he will no longer be president. If he is still in the White House, he will be trespassing. It doesn't matter what he thinks.
Im not a trump supporter btw. 🖕🏾 trump
Idk man, i just came from working in austin and i saw a LOT of trump supporters :/
Donald Trump Boat Parade 2020  via   Rowlett tx Trump 2020
I’ve been quarantined from Trump since early 2016.  All good here!
idk. i understand how some people think trump has made their families lives better and brought more opportunities, like no hate. but do y’all not see the downfall he has made this country go into these past couple of months. or are y’all blind to that?
Universal Healthcare? Who is going to pay for it? With fair tax burdens you can’t have universal healthcare. We have global alliances. The US has been getting screwed for years and years on import and export taxes. All Trump did was raise them so that it’s fair to the US.
Thousands showed up for the Trump Parade on Lake Ray Hubbard. Chairman Anderson was there with SREC Member Stephen Stanley and Keenan Williams from Trump Victory. Texans are ready for a big GOP win in November! #LeadRight #Trump2020
As one 🔵 in ruby red Texas, I can say that those that are still on the Trump Train are big conspiracy theorists.  These aren’t your parents’ Republicans any more down here.  It’s eye opening and very disheartening...
Sad? Cynical?  You want cynical, look back on your dear leader's treatment of Merrick Garland's nomination.  You think if RBG needed to step down, he wouldn't fast track whichever kiss-ass nominee Trump put out there?
How did I stumble upon the Trump 2020 boat parade. I stg this is going to be the most uncomfortable dinner ever
Better than Trump is an ignorant reason. That would be the same logic that African Americans voted for Obama because he was black. There are no Democrats that can come up with anything that’s great about their party.
Trump Parade outside Dallas. At the Hilton in Rockwall, TX (small town America) A policeman I spoke to tells me, I bet there is 1,500 boats out there. People lined the shore. MSM polls may be off.
He’s just working for trump trying to take away votes from Biden so Trump will win...

This was yall second chance to elect  but once again yall blew it. Now we stuck with Biden, Trump, and Kanye West as our 3 main options. What has this world come to?
Other than the vicious attacks levied at Obama by Trump etc?  Let's not wash that aside.
The Trump presidency is a test of commerce/infrastructure verses infrastructure/governance.  The need to "get paid" outweighs the "need to do good".
and trump and multiple republicans are trying to make a change biden wants to keep all those criminals in jails he did it back in the 90s he’ll do it again he doesn’t care about this shit. and neither do democrats.
$45m? How much has Trump's golf affliction cost the USA?
I don't disrespect your opinion, btw, I'm just reflecting what I see.  My political position is to see what I see - from all angles.  As a corporate employee such "easy wins" would never be tied up in red tape.  Trump promoted his as such as leader yet failed on the easy wins ...
But I don't think most people are fooled that suddenly policies that help lower income ppl are now enacted when the polls are showing such a poor situation for Trump.
Prices didn't escalate like they have, unconstrained, under Trump.  I've only been a US citizen for two years so this is my time to object.
They are vets. Real vets know our job has always been to protect the people and defend the constitution. Both of which are under attack by the Trump administration.
Trump has proven that the constitution, and the law, are just suggestions.   By doing nothing to rein him in, our law enforcement agencies at every level, have confirmed this.
Angry answered this on a previous AMA. He said it is the Secret Service that would escort Trump out of there.

Are you kidding me? Trump’s administration didn’t send any agents in until the “protesters “ (terrorist) started attacking Federal buildings/property! I guess you think it is ok to destroy other’s property as long as it isn’t yours?

Do you know what's sad, Senator? That you don't renounce the president for sending in federal law enforcement into Albuquerque where nothing (and I mean NOTHING) is going on out of the ordinary. Trump's authoritarian crackdown is not needed. Shame on you!
Since they ant this so much that they won’t let trump stop it- how is it trump’s America, miss cha cha?
Oh I’m fully aware of that. I’m trying to get into Trump’s brain. What’s the reason to escalate these confrontations.    Most likely pushing for clips of anarchy and justify martial law.
They went apeshit when Trump wouldn't release his tax returns, but they fight like hell to keep from releasing Biden's cognitive test results?🤔
Obama added $8.5 trillion in debt in 8 years... Trump isnt done with 4 and has added $5.5 trillion. 😐
I believe in protesting. But right now this escalating will be used for nefarious purposes and will play into Trump’s plans.    I hate to say this, but people need to stay home. Don’t engage with this surge.
Hmm 🤔 so are you saying we are living in the future?  Because this is #TrumpsGestapo in Trump’s America dude...
Is'nt TRUMP the Resident right now?
No. She's talking about QAnon, a right wing conspiracy group that believes JFK Jr. is still alive and is helping Trump to identify and capture all the democrats who are cannibalizing babies in the basement of a DC pizzeria that doesn't even have a basement.
If they want to recover it, they should start up for the people and not Trump.

As well as Trump then right?
Are you paying attention you suburban wives planning to vote for biden?
Now do the same for Biden. My prediction is the DNC keeps crazy Joe in his basement and will never let him debate Trump or engage in any lengthy meaningful conversations. They know he will end up telling the truth and saying some stupid shit.
""Q"" is just conspiracy nut jobs that believe anything they are told that makes em feel good about themselves. Mostly wacky folks but the majority are harmless. Don't see the point of banning them, If you don't ban their leader. Donald Trump. He's the dangerous one
Look at those who harass Trump. Is  and  deleting those accounts. I don’t think so.
Would crawl naked on glass to vote for Trump on 11/3...just sayin..Most Americans voted for Trump
We aren't safe in Trump's America.
Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.🙄
trump is just playing along with the crazies who want to shut it all down, hide in our closets, and hope the world works out.  He floated the idea that takes their lockdown logic to the extreme of actually canceling the elections.  Its a great move, politically.
I admit that since Trump is so public, it wouldn't be easy, but it has been done before:
Thinks? Pretty much certain the way he is acting.  All five year olds, ever: If I can’t play with it, I’m going to break it so nobody can play with it.  Trump is a bully with no compassion, he will tear everything down in the tim between the election and the inauguration.
2/ This means that landlords have to pay their loans, which means they have to collect their rent.  I'm not saying any of this is right, but it is, sadly, the position Trump has put us all in.
Hehehe. We all know what bless your heart really means.  Good for him.  Trump wants fox to be state media.
Obama criticism is one thing, but to act like Trump is better for the black community when he’s letting a pandemic kill us is really worms for brains
Obama should stay out of things he shouldn't be there he's not in the government anymore he's a dangerous man and he's a traitor and I was Trump I wouldn't go there either he needs to not be in the anywhere around stuff like that uses obiden for his puppet
Please tell me he coughed on trump at least
You are ignoring that trump thinks he is above the law and his supporters are letting him be so he could do this.
Trump hasn't even tweeted his condolences.  He may not even remember who Cain is, with his dementia and everything.
Amen! 4 years is enough....unless he suspends elections Heil trump 😬

That is assuming trump will leave the office.  Economy can be repaired.  Letting a dictator take over the country only has one solution.
I live here too and more and more are seeing what is going on even if they dont want to admit it.  I dont care how we get there so long as Trump loses and gets kicked out.

I have said it once and I will say it again. President Trump has a chance of doing some really great things if he is fortunate to win a second term and can overcome the Democrats madness. We should give him the chance to do what Democrats have been unable to do for years.

It is hard to wrap my head around what the democratic leaders are saying and doing.  They are literally defending ANTIFA, and blaming Trump. It’s like the fire department risking their lives to fight a fire, then being blamed for starting it.

Oh, no, they HATE me.  They won't listen to me either.  At this point, if they are still planning on voting for Trump, they are either brainwashed or they are profiting from his administration.  Either way, they aren't changing their minds.
I think a lot of people support Trump cause they are tired of lifelong Politicians. No reason for people to be in Washington 20 years and average person having to work two jobs just to live. Democratic Party needs to find someone not a “Politician”

Sad that this is not even newsworthy. Most folks don’t even know what is happening/ MSM will just report that Trump caused it all. They are hoping for mass carnage.  Some suggest protestors/rioters are being compensated like an army for hire.
Your leaders won’t listen-they can’t blame Trump for violence if there is no violence. Get out while you can
I mean fuck Brett farve wtf this mf trump doing bro mfs dien out here
Please pray for our sons and daughters in HLS.  Our modern politics uses them as pawns, and demonizes these public servants while honoring  anarchists. The left agenda cares nothing about innocent life as long as they can beat Trump.
Not a fan of police, but I wouldn't trust Trump with the life of a watermelon seed.
Look, I'm going to be brutally honest here.  I don't care if you are a staunch Republican at this point.  I don't even care if you initially voted for Trump (I don't like it very much, but...).  If you are voting against Trump and the current ass-kissers in the White House, okay.
Okay, I've made a decision.  I'm going to stop blaming everything on #Trump.  Yes, he is the #asshat that leads them, everyone currently working in #TheWhiteHouse is complicit, therefore they are ALL to blame.  So, from now on, I will be saying "The White House" did this or that.
Brother, if you think you are immune to a beating from the cops becaue you licking the boots of Donald J. Trump you are highly mistaken.  You want to say the Democrats blocked some kinda bill to help the American people . BRO, I DONT NEED NO HELP I WORK FOR MINE.
Darryl is my favorite character from the walking dead, but I know he voted for trump 😩

And they continue blaming the cause for the spread of the virus on President Trump. I guess people are so self centered and not concerned about spreading it to others including their loved ones.
If   didn’t show these videos of Portland, the governors lies of peaceful protest, the MSM lies of moms in solidarity, and the Dem lies of Trump instigation would be the order of the day. Not one question from press corps! ANTIFA is legitimized by MSM silence.

This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
Can someone explain to me in the 40 years she has been in Washington what is one Government Department she has made better?  In 40 years of being in DC I someone to tell me 1 thing that she has done that has help the average US person. I don’t really care for Trump but he only 3.
CDC wants schools open. The “Trump is a raging lunatic murdering  our children and teachers for the economy” tribe will need a new angle to keep the fearmongering going.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don’t like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
It says a lot that trump makes grand statements on behalf of republicans who publicly have not agreed with his sentiment. He expects them to fall in line and doesn't wait for confirmation that they will.
Name one fault Trump has taken responsibility for. Politicians, Dem or Rep, don’t do that. That’s why we call them politicians.

Do people not see what trump is doing. He is stationing these military men around the country because the election is coming up and they will enterfer with the election and when it’s time to leave the White House they will protect him. Let’s watch and see !!!
So Trump has n blood on his hands, right?
So, Trump's secret police is out terrorizing the American populace in an effort to show what another president would do?  C'mon Boris, you can't be that far up Donald's butt...or can you?
Asking for Refugee status is not "begging for help".  It is legal.  It is the way most immigrants with children enter the United States. And it has been vilified by the Trump Administration.

It’s interesting, some of the similarities between Obama and Trump.  Obama was re-elected, Trump was impeached.  Obama kept many of his Cabinet members, Trump is running out of people to replace his Cabinet members.  Trump is orange, Obama is black.  “Similarities” may not apply.

No. But Trump isn’t that stupid. There has to be a reason he’s floating this. Something up his sleeve.
Sorry to hear about Cane, I thought Dr Trump’s prescription of “Hydroxichloroqin” and “Demon Sperm” would save life. 😀
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there’s that.
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. 🤣
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his “joke” about injecting people with bleach. He wasn’t joking.
I doubt it, I don’t see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can’t glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should’ve learned.

The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Trump was always asked about the bounties on soldiers in Afghanistan, but he did not raise that as an issue to Putin. Russia paid Taliban militants to kill these soldiers. When he called Putin, Trump did not press him about those soldiers. That is just horrific.

New York isn't sending their best. They are sending Con Men, Liars, Fakes, Impersonators, SnakeOil Salesman.  WTF ? Donald Trump Jr. in Twitter jail for sharing 'demon sperm' doctor's hydroxychloroquine video
Do you Church of Elon members realize that Elon aligns himself with the Trump-loving witch doctor who is insanely promoting hydroxychloroquinine as a Covid cure? Yes Elon is  world class cutting-edge engineer, but he is also a dangerous idiot.
The Right is losing the middle: Trump pushes Elon's idiot idea that hydroxychloroquinine cures Covid. Trump listens to Elon and removes data access from CDC because of Elon's idiot idea that evil doctors are inflating Covid deaths. Elon is causing harm to the world.

Trump has handed the job of Postmaster General to one Louis DeJoy, who was tasked with destroying the service of the Post Office. This is probably for two reasons:   1. Trump wants Mail in Voting to seem unreliable as he is afraid to lose because of it.  (1/3)

My Constitutional law is rusty but if I recall correctly, if the election is delayed it would not extend Trump's term and I believe in lieu of an election by January 20 the House would pick the President. I don't remember if the VP is picked by them or appointed by another.
Obama is evil...Donald Trump loves America!
No way...but here’s an alternate looney tunes scenario: Trump looses the election, resigns on November 4th which puts Pence in office just long enough to grant Trump a full pardon.  Which enables the Republicans to cover up his lawlessness and their complicity in enabling it.
Someone should do a “Trump or Cornelius Hickey” quote game
Someone needs to do a comparison of their respective ratings...bet Obama’s will blow Trump’s right out of the water....and that will humiliate Trump for sure.
OPINION: Trump, Kanye have made the office of the President a joke   📝 by   🖼 by
So is no one going to complain that Obama used a funeral to attack Trump?  No?  It’s only wrong when Trump does it?  Ahh ok. 👌
All fair. I do echo your hypocrisy point, where people champion themselves as fighting for the minorities of this country but then will vote 3rd party, making it easier for Trump to take away the right of those people. Everyone has their right to vote, but Trump must be voted out
Really? Never in a Billion years would I have guessed that possible w trump admin. 😊
I mean honestly, yes. This isnt like voting for Romney vs voting for obam, I feel like the safety of trans folks(including myself) are legitimately put at a hogher risk if Trump stays in office
I’ll just remember until TOMORROW when Trump says he doesn’t kid. Then I’ll vote against Cornyn in November, by any means necessary.
One of the worst things about all this is that I doubt most Trump voters have the capacity to feel guilt, shame, or remorse in any way. If challenged I'm sure most of them will defend their 2016 vote as "still better than Hillary."
We really should delay Election and Debates w Joe Biden until you show your Taxes Trump.🤨  #LawAndOrder   #TrumpFailsAmerica   #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots
Obviously Trump word vomits on Twitter to distract ppl from real issues: 154K US COVID deaths to date, federal agents repressing protests, detention of migrant families. The list goes on.   Don’t get distracted, don’t believe the Hype.
I can’t believe people really want 4 more years of Trump lmfao
Not to mention that states have methods to guard against fraudulent mail-in votes such as signature matching.  So basically, all the claims about mail voter fraud are absolutely ridiculous and are just ways to disenfranchise voters who would negatively impact Trump’s re-election.
Yes for President Donald Trump!
whats funny is that even if the election gets delayed, trump and pence get auto kicked out of office come January, so pres would be Pelosi but she's up for reelection too and if dems win the senate then the next president would be Pat Leahy of VT
I said it before and I will say it again, Trump is an oil spill on this planet. It will take years to clean up the mess and even then, it will never be the same.
Delaying Election Day is not a power granted to the president!!!! The date of Election Day is determined by congress and if anyone agrees with Trump’s reasoning for pushing it back, really think about why he would want to...

Think people! think what the Democrats have done to families and the like. they have destroyed our BEAUTIFUL USA with their purposely made lies and tricks. they have depressed the people with their telling them Trump is not good and they are dying from Covid19 , etc
If by “Trump was a great candidate.” you mean he is great at the shameless art of self promotion, then yes he was a great candidate. However, he is a failure as a leader. He has yet to establish an effective plan to run this country. Propaganda is his only policy.
yes, they are not being fair. Covid 19 should not dictate mail or in person voting. it should just be moved up in all fairness to everyone. Biden is not fighting the Covid 19 either. Trump is, and thats global and More important. But it is the Democrats taking advantage, FEAR
But just to be clear about me I’m not a Republican I am a constitutionalist and lean toward libertarian on government staying out of my business but I do like Donald Trump because of the things he’s done supporting the constitution and the conservative movement
There are also perfectly decent people and Republicans who do like trump for the things he’s done for the conservative movement
Remarkable how many GOP senators and governors already on the record this morning against this: Rubio, McConnell, Sununu, others. It’s easy to forget not every R is projected to lose their election, but they might lose if Trump squashes turnout by signaling the base its hopeless.
I know. Had to explain it to several friends. No wonder trump,Hitler and other dictators love the poorly educated. What’s truly frightening. These friends have been home schooling bc schools are inferior to their knowledge. 👀 they will receive a World History book for Christmas
I forgot about that bit, but in any case, Trump delaying the election hands the whole government over to his opponents, so he's just incredibly stupid in his desperate attempts at dictatorship.
PRESIDENT TRUMP is 100% right (COVID19) and is backed on this from all his supporters and voters.  Pelosi doesnt want that cuz it will mess up their framing President Trump . The WORLD KNOWS THIS , every country.  too sad that the Democrats dont have supporters that can  think !
Trump is the man who destroyed America and gave us to Russia! Economy is tanked, he didn’t even try to stop a pandemic, he has managed to bankrupt our farmers, and small businesses. Trump is a liar, a racist and traitor to our country! Trump has divided America to make us weaker.
Betcha a dollar Trump attends HIS memorial.
Ask them all, on the record....see where they stand. Only congress holds the power to delay the election.  Also remember that Trump is trying to distract from the most devastating economic contraction in history....under his leadership. He doesn’t want to talk about that.
He could probably muster some CPD agents and those sad prison guards he dragged to DC a few months ago. I suspect the sight of even one Apache helicopter would melt their devotion to Donald Trump pretty quickly.
It did...but Herman Cain was a willing victim. We watched him stand maskless next to so many others. He ignored the science of his chosen profession in pursuit of power under Trump...he paid the ultimate price.  Will you chose wisely in November? A vote for Trump may kill you.
Trump believes this only if he loses!  Trump is in trouble for lying, being a white supremacy follower, and his corruption!
Herman Cain should be any right wing COVID doubters wake up call. He knocked mask mandates, did not wear one at Trump’s Tulsa rally and likely contracted it there. Now he’s dead. If this doesn’t clear some things up you are beyond help.
That isn’t the case in the US (yet! four more years and who knows). Gen. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs *apologized in public* for his appearance in Trump’s Lafayette Square debacle. Weeks later he told Naval Academy grads: “We must guard against those who would divide us.”
Herman Cain had choices to make for himself. He chose to follow Trump, he chose to go to Tulsa, he chose not to wear a mask. We are all personally responsible for our own choices. Leaders lead with the well-being of their constituents. Trump and his administration, do not.
Ours....POTUS DICTATOR TRUMP. If he wants a revolt, he’ll get it by doing that.
For those unaware. This is the Economy. Not the trump Fed assisted, pumped up Stock Market. Everything w trump is smoke and mirrors except this, a result of his ineptitude
Dear Lord Jesus Christ who is all loving and all forgiving and knows all and sees all...can you please take this fucker Trump off the planet? Thank you.  Maybe some of you “I keep my guns to protect our nation from fascists” guys can do something.  Congress?  Anyone??? FuckYouDon

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - BBC News
Trump is rigging the election and arrest Breonna Taylor’s killers
This is the next step to introduce confusion and chaos in advance of an election that he may lose. Trump wins when there is chaos and the media loses focus on what’s really going on.
Every one please stay safe and remain calm. You think that nut job can't do the impossible. Remember he got elected in first place. When most of us thought we would keep him in the race for laughs at his stupidity. Laugh was in the end on us. Let's take Trump out smartly.
Trump is a tyrant but also why won’t Trump be more like a tyrant and declare a national lockdown and mask mandate which would be enforced by the police but also defund the police. Do you not see how absolutely insane you people are?
So, with #trump latest tweets we now are starting to see why so many people had to die from #Covid19 was so he could try to delay voting. Believe me when I say.. #VoteBiden Or we are all doomed.

I believe it was Obama who ridiculed Mitt, during a debate, about ‘80s foreign policy. Yeah, Putin just wants the best for his European neighbors. You sound like” “flexible after the election... lead from behind Obama.” Fact is, Trump also wants to lead from behind.

How does this group and other WS groups have a leader but Antifa which trump is trying to claim it’s a terrorist group, doesn’t have a leader or monthly meetings. I haven’t seen any notifications.

Hey, I’d love some internet friends to talk to! If you have any of these interests/traits please feel free to dm ☺️ -like art -are lgbtq+ -support BLM -hate trump - old white men make you uncomfortable 😣   I’m open to anyone regardless of these, and please no hate ☺️❤️
Trump doesn't need to be at the funeral services of John Lewis. He was a man that stood for the civil liberties of maligned citizens. That is obviously what Trump is not. I'm quite glad he's done away with pretentions of decency.
If Trump could realize this and even pretend to show an ounce of humanity he'd probably be a shoo in (unfortunately). Always happens after big disasters. But he just can't do it.
Because of a doctor Trump talked about that made a comment about alien DNA being used in research.
Do you support the Trump-Putin plan to withdraw US forces from Europe, or do you stand with our NATO allies?
I suppose he'll tell suburbanites they'll be wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. Just like he told those attending Trump University they'd be receiving a world class education. Those that believe his lies are children themselves.

Was it McCarthy who said in a private recording he thought Putin pays Trump and Rohrabacher?
how does trump consider antifa a terrorist group, when it’s literally just anti-fascism, but doesnt consider the KKK a terrorist group...
Your Mini-Me is already mistreating women, Trump. You taught him well. He’ll eventually move past playing with Barbies and move to sex dolls when he grows up.
Trump is all corrupted!
The country is tired of trump and his racist and white supremacy executive orders!
3 million more people voted for Clinton than Trump, it shouldn't matter where they live in the country.   Stop pretending like you respect Democracy when you clearly don't understand its most basic principle.
We got your  back President Trump
What works is what trump is not vested in. Remdesivir a very good antiviral plus steroids. It is keeping ppl off the vent if they catch it in time. I’ll repeat. Hydroxychloroquine at the dosage they have to give in hospital settings is NOT SAFE. We want to Cure not Kill.
Alien DNA and sex with demon spirits are 2020. Look at the bigger picture, Trump is touting the virtues of a foreign, black woman.
MJ is running to take over the Texas sentate seat current occupied by the trump brown nosing  she is a veteran, she is progressive, and she will fight for Texans. We deserve better than John Cornyn who is actively trying to dismantle the affordable care act.
I believe every word I hear from Trump!!! Plus back him forever!!
Oh no a scary anarchist! It's 2020, you should have a better understanding of what words actually mean. It's sad you are the option against Trump.
Sure he does. Just go visit  It's all laid out there along with his other plans. Make a nice contribution while you're there. Trump on the other hand has nothing except more tax-cuts for the rich.
I prefer clean air and water. I have nothing against business and jobs as long as they don't operate at the expense of the environment,  which is Trump's short-sighted goal.
🤔wtf does clean out Portland. Marshal law. On what grounds. You were not invited in Trump
SOOO glad I’m not in midland fuck Donald trump &amp; his klan
I do but you do not. Conversely, name one good policy from Trump.
Paid for by Trump!
In Trump's mind, it is still 1952 and the suburbs is only for white people.
Trump gon put up 2014 Lebron numbers on they ass
Ditto. Gohmert is and has always been a disaster. He’s a idiot that keeps putting his head in his own as as well as Trump’s....which is where he speaks from. These people are KILLING us! #TrumpIsAKiller
If they make it controversial they keep our economy closed in if they don’t Trump wins
You have to be incredibly stupid to still believe Trump and anything he says.
Yep and they want to say Trump is the problem…..
So what I want to know, because this seems to fit the time profile, did DoD withdrawl them now because Trump got bored of it as he has with Corona?  We need DoD officials that will defend the constitution in the FACE of tyranny, not after the tyrant moves on.
Great question. One will be approved...it’ll happen before the election. Trump will be first to tout it...I’ve performed a miracle...regardless of efficacy. It would depend on who supported it, Fauci, NIH, NEJM. It’ll be moot for months while essential personnel are vaccinated.
Ditto.  We're all making post-pandemic, post-Trump plans.  I want to see the new Dinosaur Hall at the Smithsonian.
Trump voted absentee he had to request the ballot Dems want to send every American a ballot with no request, big difference Joey boy
Hmmm, very interesting read and review regarding Barr, and why they thought he shouldn’t be AG from his previous years as one. Why would trump pick him🤔 after reading this?
Trump retreats from The People.
If you think these idiots have the solutions our country needs I feel sorry for you. Not only do they hate Trump and anyone associated with his administration, make no mistake about it, THEY HATE THE UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA! #BarrHearing #Trump2020Landslide #Democrats
Trump has 3 family trust and each has a family investment in a Dodge &amp; Cox mutual fund, whose largest holding fund was Sanofi = the French drug maker who makes Plaquenil. 🤔 but, trump IS REALLY in this for us y’all!! Woohoo!! YEAH!! 🙄please hurry, Mr. Biden
Trump IS the GOP, and they must be defeated!
Obama was SO much better than Trump could ever dream of being. 😞
Vote Trump 2020. Get these socialist idiots out of office
Are yall really fucking comfortable with biden using the same dogwhistle as trump?
“Calling Dr. Bombay, emergency, come right away!” (You might need to be of a certain generation to get it. )
The context is he called for the arrest of protesters and used the exact same dogwhistle trump has been using the whole time
Idk maybe everyone is too young to rem another scandal that 2 names we hear right now were also involved in, in the 1980’s and they walked away untouched. Barr and Trump, The Iran-Contra affair. Barr was AG then under Bush and Trump gave $4m to the 👀affair
But like fr why are both presidential candidates calling for political dissidents to be prosecuted, like wtf why would Biden propagate the same awful rhetoric trump is
Omg, yes, I despise those 3... if I was in a room with trump, Gaetz, AnD Jordan .. I’d prob have stroke arguing with them
Yeah... about that, I’ll bet trump likes a “butt salve” heard about him and little girl’s with Epstein
Then why wasn’t trump prepared? If he was “warned” if the shelves were empty why didn’t he go on day one and how do we look here? Are we prepared for an epidemic?? Check, looks good. FCK. We also “might” have many issues he should be prepared..
Barr will choose the Electors?? How can we ensure they will cast the vote faithfully? That feels rigged already!!! If he chooses them, they all get extra money to vote against the popular and for trump, and we will have what did last time! Where CL really won but EL cast against
trump or third party
Serious question: It’s my understanding Trump owns at least two handguns. I keep thinking, given his mental illnesses, if he loses the election outright, he might kill himself.  If he did... what would be the upshot politically? Culturally?  Would his base consider him a martyr?
The “study” by “Experts” that was so widely used to smear Trump turned out to be false and rigged to make Trump look bad yet not one MSM agency retracted the info reported when “expert” got busted flat out lying! Wake up people!! Stop believing everything msm feeds you.
Like yeah it’s true but I also *hate* the fact that Dems are basically running Biden on “He’s not Trump.” They refuse to give us ANY actionable change and we’re just expected to go along bc Trump is an idiot
Would Mike Pence make a terrible President? Hell fucking yes.  Would Mike Pence be a better President than Donald Trump? Yes, but so would any inanimate object at this point
#WhyIDontLikeTrump  He's a coward who pretends to be brave who dares insult John McCain, a MAN who spent several YEARS in captivity in a foreign country. Trump hid in a bunker in the WH when he heard a crackle outside. #BunkerBoy
Bill, we all saw the video where it is already happening in NYC. We just aren’t sure if it’s Trump’s goons or yours.
Trump 2020
Awesome! Trump 2020!
#Emmys2020 #MAGA2020 Your such a LIAR!  For 30 years you appeased China and sold America out outsourcing everything. Today you are copying Trump about building America again!  Thanks but no way. YOU’VE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE ALREADY!
I got hired to play bass at a super conservative church in denton around the 2016 election. The pastor openly said vote for trump and justified it as voting for the party not the candidate because of the GOP platform. I had to quit but I would be interested what their view is now
Only choice is President Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸
That’s a great picture Trump Pence 2020
Teacher: I was a reluctant Trump voter. Coronavirus is the end of my Republican identity.  via
Stop believing these dumbasses....
The numbers of COVID cases are going to come down because trump is forcing states to stop reporting cases.  Another real danger because people will believe it is safe and in reality they are going to their death. Texas reported today they were reporting differently now!
We got trump didn’t we?
So it wasn’t a police officer. That’s good, it was just a WS biker trump supporter? He loves the bikers. Recall. How many other offenses in the name of trump aka Antifa has there been at protests?
Is this how Evangelicals excuse Trump’s myriad infidelities and misogynist behaviors? Because clearly both rules &amp; police existed, and that should have deterred him.
Did they work at Trump Pizzaria?
Nope because trump asked putins help
"Hell No" I know beauty is in the eyes of the Beholder. But best beauty to be found is in the soul. With out honor and Empathy. How beautiful could your soul be. Looks fade with times. And if outer look is bad you need to have a good soul to out last it. Trump is not physically
#WhyIDontLikeTrump Because honesty is best way to be. Lies only hurt us all in the End. Trump doesn't live in reality, he is like a child always afraid of world around him. He feels by altering reality he wont feel so alone. I don't like how he holds and talks about his daughter.
Preach it Tommy Chong 🤗 if Trump wanted to be liked then he should have done right by all the people. If others never had a voice until trump then thats their own fault. Even a single marcher gets noticed.
Oh dear lord. This is what the 700 club is publishing on it’s online news as “Another Expert Confirms Trump Was Right: Hydroxychloroquine Saves Lives, 'Propaganda War' Is Killing People”
Yes, I believe it, b/c there still remain some Trump supporters who also believe. Repeating the obvious is not harassment, but justified.
Cc:  Jane is a journalist looking into folks getting aggressive trump fundraising messages without signing up
IKR. A friend sent it to me this morning. She had gotten it off the Christian Broadcast News as fact. That trump was correct. I was horrified. First never heard about hiccups being a symptom,and that Hydroxychloroquine cures hiccups. If it could only cure low IQ as well.
The BLM movement started during obamas term, donyou unironically think im arguing that biden would actively support leftist direct action, because thats not my point. Trump is noticeably more antagonistic to the cause, and his rhetoric is actively McCarthyist and fascistic
Trump put us there.
What exactly is your solution if not voting in biden to remove trump, even if the only positive thing that happens is white nationalisms growth is slowed down? Im absolutely serious, what do you recommend leftists do if you font think voting trump out matters
Oh shit! Has Burgess lightened his hair to look more like Trump?  😳😳😳😳
You mean so they can pay what trump charges them to protect him on friggen golf trips?
Its obvious that they didn’t want him talking they just wanted to berate him and Trump I don’t  see anyone on the fence deciding to vote Democrat after watching this, just the opposite people will see it for what it is Democrats supporting socialist agenda
It was ALL planned! THIS was anything BUT a hearing my friend! Meanwhile, Biden: lying, accusing Trump constantly, fake details to reporters! All this is meant to undermine our current administration! Bunch of bull____!
Barr's testimony   Like your show   I am anti Trump for sure  However the Democrats kept cutting off Barr's answers, which makes it look like they were being unfair to him  However for Barr to say that the Coronavirus was Obama's fault, is rather dumb!  Jack F
Why do we have to hear out constant accusations towards the Trump administration, and mere hatred? They won't even let Mr. Barr have a break!? Sick!
well, nurture definitely did something to jacy since her mom and sister like that too, but for example someone in my family who is a poc used to be affiliated with a bunch of guys who were trump supporters yet their political views didn’t impact their relationship
We will get through this we will defeat trump. He will leave the White House..like it or not Nov.3rd Vote Him Out!!!!
Trump says we can’t trust CDC, remember bot?
Rant about Trump all you want, but the one and a half party dictatorship of our state would gladly let us die whether the president was liberal or conservative.
Trump is partially responsible for the situation in our state, but the main culprits are from our state govt: Abbott, Patrick, the soulless Republicans, the Democrats who never really cared; they were here before 2016 and they will be here after 2020.  #TrumpKillsTexas
says, everything Trump touches dies. That encompasses a hell of a lot, democracy, the Constitution, American citizens, including the ones in the Lone Star State. #TrumpKillsTexas
Hey! What's Trump's boot taste like? Asking for a friend
Literally when every trump supporter from cleburne posts their “research”
Trump stole MAGA from Reagan anyway
Personally, I don't think Trump made America great, so the word "Keep" really bothers me and invalidates the slogan. However, "Build Back Better" sounds like a fifth-grader wrote it, which makes sense given Biden's mental capacity.  I'd give the nod to "Keep America Great."
7am received text from a friend, of same medical doc in parking lot stating she had tx 300 pts w Hydroxy. Then same friend sent me the CBN news that Trump was correct.I politely explained research&amp; please do not believe docs in a parking lot by B news. It cures hiccups is proof?
Because he is a Trump ass kisser who only wants to destroy Texas. I love my state. VOTE HIM OUT!
I agree they need to set new rules. Stay away from federal buildings. See if feds retreat to federal building! If they follow people will see the lies from Trump!
"The Fake News Media is trying to portray the Portland and Seattle “protesters” as wonderful, sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll."  LOL, no they are not. Another Trump delusion.
Trump thinks protesting is illegal. He thinks Twitter trends are illegal. He thinks not clapping for him is illegal.  So, just keep that in mind.
Another lie from Trump
Your beliefs are shaded by the people you associate with. The middle has always been for Trump and always will be. The only ones who are not for Trump are willfully ignorant liberals.
Most definitely photo shopped. Smoothing and softening. Truly trump is aging like preserved pickle soaked in vinegar
At that moment,in Texas, the guy in the mask was fully justified in shooting the guy in the Trump hat.   Republicans insist that’s true.
Is he mad about this?
Trump needs to award her the Medal 🏅 of Freedom!
Trump needs to award her the Medal of Freedom 🏅!
Trump should award her the medal 🏅 of Freedom!  🇺🇸
The reason the guys trump sent in aren’t arresting people, is because they have no legal authority to do so, they could capture people and scare the he** outa of em, why they aren’t reading Miranda rights before shoving guns in people’s faces
They’ve shown the before ~ actual people standing peacefully, trumps wana be’s inciting force and chaos.. Fox News then claims that’s the protestors.. wish people would stop saying the “forces” there t federal or military, they r hired extras by trump and Eric P. $$ to dress up
My question would be.. why would trump get credit for a vaccine? He shouldn’t!! It’d be the hard work of the doctors. Trump thought this was a hoax and it would go away, if not, maybe he would’ve been a smart man and started protocol for a mass infection control in Jan
Everyone is a star line up for one flew over the cuckoos nest.. trump can’t find anyone with higher standing?
Would you like to see the files case against trump, for the 13 year? I’ve known about her and the 15 yr since 2015, why I never liked him. Just being friends with ALOT of weirdos pointed that out. But oddily, no one EVER called Biden out the 8 yrs he was VP 🤔
I can literally see him being like “nope, we didn’t lose. In fact we won, yes we won this wonderful election  Biden fought long and hard but it just wasn’t enough” if he loses   What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?
This is what all companies should do with their office workers. Stop extending the timeline to return to offices by dribs and drabs. Accept that "getting back to normal" is a stupid goal until this thing is under control, which will not happen under Trump.
Lewis called Trump an illegitimate President due to the Russia hoax.  Why would an illegitimate Presidente go to his funeral?
Her own police chief is telling businesses “you’re on your own” They’re hand are tied. That mayor would let her city burn to spite Trump. If Trumps doing anything wrong, it’s not going hard wnough on these domestic terrorist.
The physical manifestation of Trump’s paranoia and fear.
Cornyn is up Trump's butt so far, he can't see what is best for his state.  He is an absolute disaster.
Have you seen what it looks like during a trump rally? 😂
I can't believe Trump thinks negative Tweets becoming popular is illegal.  I knew he was a special snowflake, but this is just...so bad.  #TrumpleThinSkin
It's reversed, I think. Outlets like Sinclair/Breitbart want to use the bad doctors to discredit all doctors.  It's a reverse cargo cult.
I’m calling on President Trump to declare Marshall law and take full advantage of our military to put down the insurrection know as antifa and BLM and any other militant group attacking our American law and order system the sooner we take this measures the less casualties act now
I’m genuinely surprised Trump hasn’t said he has COVID just to tout that medicine lol
Only big Pharma can succeed at making Trump look like the good guy:
Wonder if Mr Hinderocker is familiar with Avik Roy’s views on the GOP, racism and Donald Trump? He’s been very outspoken in the past. Roy is a very smart fellow.
I swear some of yall are as dilusional as you claim Trump is lol
Trump doesn’t care if kids are in school, he would’ve made sure that little 13 yr old girl was there instead in his bedroom, .. he just wants elected. Why didn’t he say anything last April? Or may??
Interesting. Is that what they think tanks are supposed to do? Is it legitimate? Did they declare the value of their time as a political donation to Hillary? Are they prepared to pay Donald Trump’s legal expenses from day one? Are they prepared to pay for the Mueller fiasco?

We agree there has been no justice! Trump should be in jail or at least removed from office for not honoring his presidential oath of office. Trump is corrupted, a liar, immoral, and a racist!
No,  Trump will STILL receive plenty of Black votes. Remember, some slaves loved their masters more than life itself.
Absolutely. Trump is seriously trying to turn America into a police state. But the fluke that happened in 2016 isn't going to be effective in 2020 because he's managed to piss off a lot of the people that voted for him the first time. Veterans. Suburban moms.
But the guy above you said everyone was at work??? That’s odd? Are they at a trump rally or work??
I fully approve of President Trump.  I Ask for every American's Freedom: To choose to NOT be vaccinated or to be.
I’m glad John’s memorial won’t be sullied be Trump’s presence.
Funny how people keep blaming Trump for the division in the country but it’s people like this that create it. “If you don’t agree with me you can’t listen to my music” seems pretty divisive
Y’all keep praying for trump, and more people keep getting caught for crimes, maybe god is listening
I wouldn’t mind being surprised by a respectful visit by Trump to show actual contrition for his thoughts and actions.  But... I don’t see that ever happening. So best he stays the hell away.
You know who needs help with childcare... the lower income ... that’s why I hate every goddamn trump supporter. They know what they are doing
I assume this means John Lewis and Elijah Cummings will boycott Trump’s inauguration again
President Trump has said No, he will not pay respects to Rep. John Lewis while in state in the Capitol Rotunda. He said all that we need to know about his character or lack thereof.
The truth is that the legacy of liberty and freedom for all rest in the hands of Donald J Trump. His heart is now the reservoir of generations of American hero’s of all races. Democrats are a nasty cesspool of evil.
Trump Vs. Biden will be like watching a first round matchup of Wizards Vs. Hornets.
In a way it's almost nice of Trump to remind everyone that along with major regular police reform the feds need to go too
Christopher Ray is a chickenshit liberal. I can’t stand him! He’s a smug little Imitation of James Comey. He refuses to pass on information thereby slowing justice down to a crawl. He needs to be fired and I hope Trump will do that after the election. Throw him out!
No such thing as honor with a JD. The Nobel Prize Committee has long since been tainted, 80% have been won by Hasidic Jews, and Obama was a pedophile in the White House. Not exactly the standard of excellence but agree Trump is a traitor.
The Trump supporter view of Trump is so astoundingly unbelievable. I check in on an childhood friend occasionally and he's always posting things about what a great Christian Trump is. It's baffling.
People are centered on COVID19 and their family’s survival right now. Senate Republicans think that sending out $200/wk vs $600/wk for unemployment will suffice. $200/wk will barely cover groceries for a family of 4. Don’t worry Trump, the Senate will lose the Election for you.
My thought process is like, if you still support trump at this point you’re a lost cause and nothing will change your mind lmao
Yes sir, Trump’s gutless governing allows others to assume power that should NEVER be in their hands...Bill Barr, Stephen Miller, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, Steve Mnuchin, and more hold power above &amp; beyond their station. These are criminals who will do ANYTHING to stay in power
Trump is a hypocrit
The talk radio catechism and the Trump catechism are one in the same these days, and the foundation of the talk radio catechism is anger with the modern world. It's not a matter of what you get that they don't, it's a matter of you getting anything without their permission.
Here's a photographic example of  's thesis from his op-ed in USAToday: these trumpistanis are feeling empowered by rejecting know-it-all scientists. Also, that looks like assault.
And trump being a racist is definitely an opinion and a popular one. Its based off his actions and his words over the past 4 years he has been president. If Trump is not a racist... the majority of his followers surely are...
And trump was supposed to be our “Fixer”. He seems to have too many Fixers. Only those in a crime family or are extremely corrupt have a “Fixer”
It’s not a “look”....they are. This is what passes for “enthusiasm” in the Trump campaign.

Curious, Does anyone know WHAT they DID talk about? What was the point of the Conversation? ... did trump need to ask another foreign country for “a favor”
Trump only takes priest, moms, and the media... ewww. When it comes to serving his Country “bone spurs” fellow pedophiles 👀 doesn’t have a clue, never knew em. Other dictators “🍭, will you be my friend?”

I’d say they don’t have control of shit. Trump has achieved his goal....enrage the protestors so the stormtroopers can show how effective they are at gassing and shooting defenseless people expressing their 1st amendment right to protest.
Then there should be an aftermath of ALL this violence,.. let’s shoot on over to one of these cities before trump instigators, and see how it was doing, oh, that’s right, people are seen singing and protesting quietly,.. nice try
Melania Trump to Announce Plan to Revamp White House Rose Garden   Heard she is going to put in poison ivy or oleander.
Exactly. Journalists need more assertiveness with both Trump and his lie-bots, Kellyanne and McEnany.
Trump is incapable of shame. If that were in his repertoire of feelings, all of his moral turpitude would have melted him into a greasy little puddle by now
Exactly! It's insane that they have the audacity to be ignorant to trump's faults in his presidency. They all treat him as if he was god sent. I remain an independent and not belonging to any party. I hope after this people will focus on presidential ideals than party ideals.
Nope... that’s what someone wants u to think so he can be ure hero cuz he failed at Covid, it’s a known if u support trump ure IQ is as high as his, so prob do believe all these stories. ~ man, woman, sign = bad people
They were peaceful before trump sent his wana be’s in there, so stfu, these are Americans. Y’all might not be,.. he’s not protecting our constitution which he took an oath to uphold, he’s violation 5 of the our Constitutional rights...I salute everyone making it through the most opinionated, sensitive times we have ever been in. #covid #trump #bodypositivitiy #offensive

President Trump was on the plane going to New York not the island. After Epstein, the good friend of all the MSM , messed with the young employees, Trump threw Epstein out of the club in Florida. Later Epstein was convicted and the press still adored Epstein. The MSM  loves Pedos

President Trump, have you been compromised? Does someone have dirt on you and is willing to release it to the public if you don't push this Covid-19 bullcrap? I am a republican and voted for you in 2016 but I am having a real hard time supporting your of late.
After reading through your twitter, nvm. Most never trump people who say that are generally libertarian, so I apologize for getting that wrong and presuming.
Falafel has been a very cruel sandwich to Trump. Very cruel. Big thanks to my beautiful souvlakis for Trump
Don’t be a drama queen Jessica Trump.
We don’t believe you. If Trump says to delay you’ll delay.
This is almost as bad as the time he used the funeral of five Dallas police killed by a BLM extremist to push for gun control.   If you wonder where the anger that resulted in Trump’s election came from, look no further:
i don’t think joe got what it takes to defeat that man trump, dude can barely hold his train of thought
Truth hurts, doesn't it?  Trump is spot on.
Like I said, a sad little man in the vein of Trump.
I didn't even bring trump into this...YOU did! So that is laughable!😂😂😂  F*ck trump...could not care less. Just admit you can't do one link.  Nevermind. Don't do it. I am totally done. This is just sad at this point. The desperation reeks.🤮
Who cares about trump? You use him as a cop out when you know you have no science or fact on your side.  Why do you not care about science or truth??? What has gone so wrong that you have lost your mind &amp; left reality behind? Why do you let yourself be so gullible?
, Trump is not making a joke. He serious and you’ll go along with him. A leader should NEVER JOKE about elections. You’re excuse is pathetic just like you. Vote
Herman Cain, a prominent Trump supporter, has died after a lengthy hospitalization due to COVID.   Trump’s touching tribute:
Wrong. That was in 2006 and he was cancer free in 2007. That’s 13 years ago. Ignorance, stupidity, idiocy and Trump killed Cain. And by not wearing a mask Cain is responsible for causing others to not wear masks and dying. Republicans are gullible, stupid, selfish people.
Of course you don't see any outrageous claims.🙄  That's what makes it impossible to have any kind of serious discussion with you. Better to stop here than waste anymore time.  BTW, if you're talking about trump, he's done outrageous on a daily basis, so don't even start.🤦🏼‍♀️
The GDP is down 33%. The worst since 1947. What policies has Trump and the Republicans enacted again that actually work?
Now if only he was a little smarter to wear a mask and not support trump, he’d still be here:)
I will be voting in person for  I don’t care how long the line is I will vote. I don’t first USPS any longer. I don’t trust Trump or anyone appointed my Trump.
Trump failed him. His republican party faild him. Conspiracy theorists failed him. The KKKult45 failed him. The country did not fail him. Get that straight
If you tweet about Trump's tweets but remain silent on despicable people like this, you are a hack and just as miserable and insufferable as this trash human is.
Cain's tweet right before Tulsa rally: “Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!”
Herman Cain has died from Covid-19 which he got at Trump’s Tulsa Rally. He didn’t wear a mask.
I am waiting for the next modification to social distancing and wearing a mask. Possible modifications: 1. You can remove your mask while trash talking about Trump. 2. You can shorten your distance if you are trash talking about Trump, (keeping mask on is optional, see 1)
Eh.  That’s just him blindsided mid-testimony by an irrational Trump Tweet.
Will Trump attend his funeral or will the Cain family forbid it?
Rename Rikers.  Trump Family Prison.
Because Trump told the Antifa and BLM idiots to riot and spread the virus. Also, blame the idiots partying on July 4th. Considering the total US population, this number isn't bad at all. Roughly 1% if the total population. Do your math, before you open your piehole.
I hate Trump more everyday. I don’t usually hate a person. It takes a lot to make me hate you.
Anyone who touts their IQ is a tool.  You're simply trying to buy credibility just like trump with his cognitive test.
Trump suggesting we delay the election this fall is something Frank Underwood would have done. You can’t make this shit up.
Too bad she spent so many months pandering to Trump....maybe people would listen to her
I called this yesterday. Trump will also declare martial law and himself President for life. It's coming....
Trump's Brown Shirts in their own words.

She's right. Pulling the troops out of Germany at the cost of billions is a gift to Putin. If a WW breaks out befor 11/3, Trump will declare marshall law, cancel the election and deploy federal troops all over the country. Declare himself dictator and democracy dies.
Yes we are all screwed! Trump is our only hope, Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump and U.S. COVID-19 Cases: A Timeline | NowThis  via
I will use a bit of common sense.  Epstein has the dirt on many.  Almost all are Democrats. They killed him,  because he would have the dirt on them all.  Here's the piece,  so if this dirt existed on Trump,  they would have included it,  and successfully impeached the man.
You can have your own opinions but you can't have your own facts.
President Trump’s policies and leadership has done so much for AMERICAN families and USA as a country, we will #VoteForTrump again! #Trump2020 is a must ! Democrats are rioters &amp; looters, politicians justify destroying our neighborhoods! What common sense person will want that?
Dude it’s the Examiner. It’s a Murdoch owned rag. Of course it favors Trump and Republicans. Try a reputable news site next time.
This makes no sense at all. Taking troops out of Germany and putting them in countries who pay even less to NATO. Putin tells Trump to do it and he does it.
‘Trump’ is a losing monopoly
Sure thing Louie...now tell me why the taxpayers should pay your medical expenses...If Trump wants to shield businesses then shouldn’t taxpayers be shielded from what your hatred of science has caused.
37% is NOT MOST OF AMERICA. I guess you took math at Trump University.
He wouldn’t have gotten tested this early if hadn’t been scheduled to fly with Trump.
The racist Trump is saying no POC can live in white neighborhoods as long as he is POTUS.
Who owns stock? Trump? Ivanka and Jared? What Republicans? Loeffler? Perdue?
But Trumpers are sending our tax dollars more and more to church schools...is that OK? Are church schools allowed to close and still get money? I wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t manage to get even more money like Trump and DeVoss want if public school money is pulled.
Just more evidence of how right wingers hate science. They refuse to believe anythung they can’t control or blame. Trump claims he knows more about epidemiology than anyone else and Paxton is just dismissive of any scientific knowledge.
If I were the Kistner campaign I would simply *not* put out an internal poll showing me down 9 points in a Trump district 📉
So the media and the FDA both just decided it was more important for trump to be wrong than to save lives? It’s not possibly because the drug doesn’t work at an effective enough level (or at all) to be worth the risks?  What is your tinfoil budget? $400? $500 a month?
Dems hate this drug they know it will save life’s and it will make Trump re-elected
How much stock does Trump own in Kodak? How many Republicans own stock in Kodak? Final question, who stock did Loeffler dump to buy stock in Kodak?
Dems=hate=bullies=suppression=loss of Freedom vote TRUMP 2020
There is no"safely return to work" while the plague rages on.The GOP/Trump's failed policies, ignoring of science and experts has landed us here Ted. You doubling down on that tells us all we need to know.The masses are expendable.The donor class are all that matters. You bastard
I will be so glad when Trump loses. When he’s out, people like you go out with him.
No, dear. You are woefully uninformed. Obviously no source will convince you. Trump has lied to us, verified, over 20K times in 4 years, yet you defend him. Your allegiance is misplaced. But it is yours to give. So wear a mask and socially distance.
Right, because Antifa and BLM riots, that created the recent spike, is still  somehow Trump's fault...
To Destroy our great President Trump from being re-elected #WhiteCoatSummit
The Constitution clearly states the current potus SHALL relinqish power on January 20. Period.  So, when biden wins, no matter if trump refuses to leave the WH, trump is no longer president. We couldwrite P-R-I-S-O-N on the wall outside the WH and leave him in it.
Fk barr! He’s just a mini-trump
Twitter, Facebook Delete Viral Video Promoted By Trump On COVID-19 And Hydroxychloroquine
and while you're there look at all the videos of Biden and Hunter and how they made millions and millions off of the American people - TRUMP 2020
And lies just as much as Trump and you.
You don’t really mean what you just tweeted. You’re just trying to be politically correct. Try to score points for Trump and the Republicans. It won’t work.
The “media” will lose the election?.....  Every one wants Americans back to work and schools open, but if it can’t be done safely then it can’t be done.  Pretty simple when you take your desire to support/defend trump out of it.
Nor Florida. DeSantis isn't allowing a true accounting and Trump is preventing the CDC from receiving the statistics from hospitals. Why is that do you suppose?
People LOST their jobs by NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. They lost these jobs because of the INCOMPETENCE OF TRUMP and the Republicans REFUSAL TO REMOVE AN INCOMPETENT LEADER. No waiter or waitress wants to work for 2.13 an hour plus tips. There are no tips right now. Business is down.
Did he deny responsibility like Trump does?
Stella Immanuel, Trump’s New COVID-19 Doctor, Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine ⁦ re-tweeted this nut job, his Dr.
If you support Trump supporters 🖕🏾U and Block me now.
He’s smug, prone to panic (like when Trump took out Solameni) and has weird crushes on liberals. I prefer Laura Ingraham.
Funny quote: “Suggesting the president go on TV is like pushing against an open door,” #election2020
And let me guess, somehow it's Trump's fault.
And what's wrong with supporting  and being a Stargate fan? If this guy is a Trump supporter then be it, he's got the same right as everybody else. So it looks like you're the hypocrite
Republicans are punishing the people. We didn’t quit OUR JOBS. We weren’t fired for doing a BAD JOB. We LOST OUR JOBS because of Trump and his incompetence. We LOST OUR JOBS because Trump handled Covid-19 badly and the Republicans remain silent.
Trump's 🇺🇸 really sucks.
It is a shame you here taking away a drug you know can save lives just because you want the left to win an election by blaming Trump the deaths, when it’s people like you. I hope you can sleep at night.
We the people don’t trust democrats who hide #Hydroxychloroquine !!! When President Trump said from day one! Shame on you all!
I wish trump would bring these doctors into the Corona Virus Task Force #coronavirus #corinavirustaskforce #StellaImmanuel
THEY REMOVE THE VIDEO BECAUSE THIS PROVES PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CORRECT AND HE WAS TRULY HELPING AMERICANS TO SAVE LIVES WHILE MEDIA, PHARMA AND FAUCI AND THE DEMOCRATS POLITICIANS HIDE FOR POLITICAL GAINS AND LET PEOPLE DIE! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
THEY REMOVE THE VIDEO BECAUSE THIS PROVES PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CORRECT AND HE WAS TRULY HELPING AMERICANS TO SAVE LIVES WHILE MEDIA, PHARMA AND FAUCI AND THE DEMOCRATS POLITICIANS HIDE FOR POLITICAL GAINS AND LET PEOPLE DIE! #Trump2020LandslideVictory
President Trump was correct from day 1. And media and Fauci made fun of him! Shame on them! #Trump2020
Yeah..and trump is an ice cream sundae????  Get a grip nina.
My friend and me say the same thing!!!!  It's like living in a blender if trump bullshit.
Trump.
What a bunch of BS and propaganda from The Fake News Network.  Living in Trump’s America, how that working for you?
If that's what you think, then you're totally clueless. This has been going on for long before Trump took over.  I guess you were just too blind and ignorant to see that.
4 more years of Trump. Say no to Creepy Joe Biden.
Trump has lied 20K+ in just over 4 years. What ever he has on you, it must be career ending.
Ummmm ... yeah, they’re on YOUR side. And if people are stupid enough to vote for Joe Biden this will CONTINUe. Trump is taking out the Antifa trash.
It is the truth and you trying to say the opposite is evil! So many people have died because of ppl like you lying about #Hydroxychloroquine ! Shame on you and all left! Just to hurt #Trump you killed people!
#POTUS #TRUMP SAID FROM DAY 1 #Hydroxychloroquine SAVE LIVES and DEMOCRATS and MSM promoted the opposite just to hurt our economy! SHAME ON YOU ALL!
No I won’t. I don’t trust Trump at all.😳
This is the task heath force for cover Trump needs not Fauci!
Trump is coming to visit an oil rig but not the Covid-19 ravaged RGV which was recently hit by Hurricane Hannah.
So, in other words, Trump can't handle a crisis. We all knew that would be the case.
Of course Trump won’t go and we all know why.
Good. He has no business there. Trump is the antithesis of everything good and right about the honorable John Lewis.
He'll probably call himself "forced out" and birth a group of "trumpians" who are "real Americans" who's goal is to live to his ideals and put him back in power, meanwhile trump will likely be on his beach in Florida tweeting about injustice and how America will crumble alone.
It will be tacky. Everything the Trump’s do is tacky.
Imagine being a coward like Marco. Afraid of an old man like Trump. Shame on Marco.
Every time Trump says something nasty, which is multiple times a day, you’ll condemn him? Speak out against him? 🙄
You’re so delusional, first you blame Trump a man that has nothing to do with Pharmaceutical s contrary to the democrats who receive billions from pharmaceuticals as campaigns contributions! Second the policies of the democrats literally destroys USA economy not Trump!
Liar. You want folks to sacrifice their lives for the stock market. Your god is pissed at you Ted. Oh and by the way, when can we expect Trump to address the bounties on US service members heads? Ever?
A&amp;M didn’t leave bc we needed tu’s $.  The last straw I believe the LH network was the final straw in what most considered narcissist &amp; greedy.  The SEC shares it’s network &amp; revenue between all schools.  It just feels good, think about it! Everything Trump does is for others.
Hey Ted.....it's been 30 days and still not a word from Trump about Putin's paying for the assassination of our US service members. What gives? You don't care or what?
Bounties.  Covid. Unemployment. Treason. Trump.
Let's see Trump go on  Rachel Maddow's show.
Let's start by asking candidates about their own personal actions, teddy.  Like tRump's response to Putin's bounties on American soldiers' lives.  Traitorous and deprived.
Shocked it’s taken this long to be discussed.  UBI was a given the moment Trump went stimulus instead of ceases all tax payments for a year.
Yes, definitely. History is on Trump’s side. Americans tend to like incumbent Presidents to remain in office. Biden is in the mold of Dole, Kerry or Romney who tried and failed to unseat a popular President. Trump’s on par with Obama eight years ago. I think he’ll win easily.
Oh pleaaaassssse... Trump is inciting? LOL
I don’t support either. But here we are with still no answer from a trump supporter on why you support him, the same goes for Trump, just openly a pedophile and people are considering voting for him🤡
Without Trump we would not be America anymore
I just don’t want to see y’all giving them ammunition against you like that. I personally believe the spike is from all the idiot Trump supporters who don’t wear a damn mask but they ARE  blaming the protesters on their threads. I don’t want protesters blamed!
Trump all the way
Riots? GTFO. The TRUMP GESTAPO is hurting protesters and NAZIS LIKE YOU APPROVE OF IT! Shame on you.
You can’t bitch about silencing whistleblowers when Trump does it all the time and you remain silent.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Exactly. We have to vote out Trump and those who enable him. I will never understand why 90% support him and why they’re so full of hate.
GET RUSSIA and CHINA OUT OF OUR ELECTIONS !! trump wants to win by getting help from russia and China because he can win NO OTHER WAY
If I see on Snapchat that y’all are hanging out with multiple friends that don’t live in your household in the middle of a worsening global pandemic, I’m just gonna assume you’re a Trump supporter because you’re either ignorant by choice or you don’t care about human life.
Trump supporters. Are they all just stupid?
Maybe they should GTFO of Portland, stop gassing people and shooting rubber bullets at them. Stop kidnapping them off the streets. The Trump gestapo is the problem.
Take it,  Please take it! And share it with the Trump fan club! Please!
By giving the Medal of Freedom to the racist Limbaugh. The Liar in Cheif has rendered it a CrackerJack prize now. My gawd Trump is a vulgar clown.
Love her. We need more leaders like her and less like Trump.
This is a joke, right? Trump is a criminal. A mob boss. The only hope lies in us voting him out of office 100 days from now.
Republicans act like the extra 600 a week is too much. Many lost health insurance. Paying into COBRA is expensive. Trump won’t open the ACA exchange. I guess they what people to die. Go hungry.
Trump needs to send in more feds to deal with those scumbags protesters.
Another example of the Trump Party motto....”All for Me..None for Thee”. You must have lots of mirrors in your life so you can always be with the only one you care about.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Let's be clear, the deployment of Trump's Gestapo is a political gamble the Naked Emperor is losing.
Go f yourself. You're golfing with Trump while Americans DIE? You're a POS too!
I have a Trump joke.  That's 5 words.
Bunker Boy? You mean Biden right? Trump has been traveling around the country. He was in Rapid City, SD recently at Mt. Rushmore for Independence Day. Maybe you saw that. He also spoke in Oklahoma. Where has Biden traveled to?
#DescribePoliticsIn3Words  ALL BUT TRUMP.
Here's something pretty cool: In one week, Mary Trump's book "Too Much and Never Enough" sold more hardcover copies than "The Art of the Deal" has in the 33 years since it was published. 11:11 AM · Jul 23, 2020
I’m sure Trump’s deal was better. He simply removed barriers from purchasing US prescription drugs from Canada and other places. He didn’t CONTROL the prices. He reduced red tape and allowed market forces to truly work. America has been subsidizing the world for a LONG TIME.
So Joe Biden (richer than average American) is going to hell too? Pretty sure God judges us by our actions. Trump paid off the mortgage of a family who helped him when his car broke down. Trump regularly handed out $100 bills to his hotel staff. Didn’t have to run for president.
Obviously prayer is foreign to you. You pray TO Jesus. No one is praying to Trump. LOL
When the WH is opened to tours and Trump resumes his rallies, we`ll talk about it.
Bullshit. Trump did notning more than sign pieces of useless paper.
It's time to find out who these individuals actually are and out them publicly. Show their faces and name their names. The country has the right to know who Trump's Brown shirts are.
Never Trump zealots think that if Biden wins the GOP will suddenly re-embrace them and liberalize.   It’s not going to happen. We’re not going back to the pre-Trump consensus and we’re certainly not handing the keys of the party back to the people who betrayed it.
You are just plain sick!  Trump “selfless “?!!! You believe THAT and you are plain looney!!  It’s just indecent to say that!
You think trump isn’t serious?
Death panels in the RGV and now a hurricane. It’s brown people so Trump nor the Republicans care.
Trump's re-election campaign has purchased over 500 #Facebook ads that spread disproven claims about voter fraud. Federal regulators need to investigate and act!
WHERE is General Milley while trump admin is trashing our Constitution by harassing peaceful protesters?? WHY isn’t  upholding his OATH OF OFFICE?? For that matter,  , WHY ARENT YOU ??
Yea but Trump will profit personally no doubt.
The Trump administration tells them NOTHING. The FBI and the CIA do. Wray and Haspell tell them. Trump and his goons refuse to tell them anything.
I'm glad I ignored the advice of  and cancelled my outdoor plans today even tho I was outside the #Hanna cone. Fortunately for me, I don't hate Trump so much I can't understand simple tropical science. Saved myself from a huge scientific blunder.
Jeff get off the drugs. What your obsession of bashing Trump on the head. We already know you were under the desk shining Obama balls in the Oval Office and you can’t wait to do the same thing for Biden if he wins.
Yes: I think his campaign manager has a lot of work to do to corral Trumps mouth &amp; thumbs &amp; do serious damage control.  Trump had us on our way, then C19 followed by BLM Riots.  Biden represents the riots, that would be our entire country if he got elected.  Scary thought!
This is why they served(unlike Trump and almost all in his administration) to protect free spoech and the right to protest.

I hate trump, but andrew Jackson was pretty open with his racism. Nixon and Reagan were just as bad racism wise too.
Make no mistake friends.Trump's messaging waiver on Coronavirus has nothing to do with the mounting deaths. It's his sinking poll numbers.He still could care less if you live or die as long as he retains power.Deeds not wordsThe tRump Virus is responsible for Killing Americans!
So fall in line and hope they don't fuck us over next time cuz Trump bad. If we don't push back and hold them accountable they're always going to use this same situation to blackmail us into voting for their shitty corporatist candidates.
where's the photo of BillClinton? He's mentioned directly in the docs, Trump is not.  Nice distraction. But it's not going to work.   Mueller was the head of the FBI that knew, and ignored these child victims. Comey as well.   All during the Bush &amp; Obama administrations.  🤔
OMG Bailey, you and I used the same gif today, however I used it describing Trump when he announced he wanted to postpone the election 🤣😂

Quid pro quo? Favor for favor? Putin helps Trump win elections, in return for this? “Russia if you’re listening?”
The election should get delayed but certainly not a Trump event, or the opening of schools or the economy. 😉

President Trump signaled his interest in preventing an eviction crisis as a federal moratorium expires Friday on millions of apartment units.
Very interesting how this move comes days after trump said he had a call with Putin.   Either way, US troops in allied nations are for strategic purposes and quick responses, not for protection.   This move will once again hinder the US if a matter were to arise in the East.
If the Republicans keep lame ducking it, I'm not going to cast a vote. Today's hearing, along with a few more political disappointments from them has me questioning my choices. 30y Republican voter. I proudly voted for Trump, was considering it in 2020, but now. Fence sitting.

I am an independent thinker and form my opinions on facts.  We have a moral obligation to turn this country around and handouts are not the solution. Trump did not create this mess in 3 years of office. To suggest that is bordering on ignorance.

Thats not an uncommon belief. I'm disappointed in the Democrat party, out of a diverse field of smart, capable, intelligent, intellectually simulating candidates, they keep propping up decrepit, incompetent old white criminals. So, pinching my nose, I'll vote Trump 2020...bleh.

Biden might be your choice, but honestly he's not improving. If I could vote for a more competent President this election cycle I would. But Trump is all this country has. Without him we will be fed to the wolves. just to make an example of us for 2016. God bless. Stay safe.

Poll: Biden leads Trump in battleground Arizona
Kanye would have to be running as a Independent. He’s running as a Demo.  Which means whoever wins the Party Nominee Vote goes against Trump.  To split the vote would mean they all advanced and the votes got split 3 ways for the actual presidential election.
Do y’all even know what splitting the vote even means? I swear y’all think everything so ‘clear’?  Last time we saw a split vote election was with Ross fucking Perot in 92. At this point if you think he’s worse, or will auto lose to Trump. I think you’re the real racist. 😛

I am really sorry that Trump rejected you as his campaign manager. I think it was a good decision though, after seeing you screw up McCain’s campaign. Good luck to you.
Not all!  Some are still avid Trump supporters.  The staunch republicans would rather vote Trump than put a dem in.  The sad thing is Today's Republican party is not the republican party of my father or grandfather. He has them brainwashed.

an airport is the perfect place for #MAGAtts to quietly wear masks with the blue lives matter flag and trump paraphernalia. it’s an open invitation to get your ass whipped.... that reminds me, i need some advice on how to throw a jab. asking for a friend.
When they stood by and did nothing while Trump mocked Senator McCain! That was the first step on the road to Hell!
5. The only way Trump wins is if people don’t vote
Things have never been worse. Trump is a disgrace to the Republican Party. He continues to fail us and lie to us.We aren't safe in Trump's America.
Just ask Mr Cain oh that's right he can't stop play Trump maybe if you experienced what so many common people have and is you'll speak differently or maybe not.🙄
trump is just playing along with the crazies who want to shut it all down, hide in our closets, and hope the world works out.  He floated the idea that takes their lockdown logic to the extreme of actually canceling the elections.  Its a great move, politically.
I admit that since Trump is so public, it wouldn't be easy, but it has been done before:
2/ This means that landlords have to pay their loans, which means they have to collect their rent.  I'm not saying any of this is right, but it is, sadly, the position Trump has put us all in.
It’s apparent Cain allowed Trump surrogates access to his twitter account.
Obama should stay out of things he shouldn't be there he's not in the government anymore he's a dangerous man and he's a traitor and I was Trump I wouldn't go there either he needs to not be in the anywhere around stuff like that uses obiden for his puppet
Please tell me he coughed on trump at least
Trump hasn't even tweeted his condolences.  He may not even remember who Cain is, with his dementia and everything.
Amen! 4 years is enough....unless he suspends elections Heil trump 😬
Hmmmm, interesting thoughts.  Trumps dream...heil trump
Heil trump.....
Heil trump....
Heil trump

We needed to remove Trump 3.5 years ago.
i also don’t believe you can be pro-Trump who is known for his fascist views and be Christian. i don’t think my God would ever support people treating people the way trump does and they still get away with it.

• It was cool for Joe Biden to "blackmail" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquires about it.  • Twenty is too young to drink a beer, but eighteen is old enough to vote. • People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery
While Trump ignored the Coronavirus pandemic, his idiot son tweeted nonsense.
Bruh, you dressed up in the same suit combination as Trump.  You loss me already!
I have said it once and I will say it again. President Trump has a chance of doing some really great things if he is fortunate to win a second term and can overcome the Democrats madness. We should give him the chance to do what Democrats have been unable to do for years.

1st, I wouldn't do something that would send me to prison for the rest of my life.  2nd, I take personal responsibility if I do things wrong.  I would never take anyone down with me.  3rd, Trump needs to freaking go to prison for the rest of his life BEFORE he takes down the U.S.
Really cause I’m hoping trump has a plan and just stays !!!!!!!
It is hard to wrap my head around what the democratic leaders are saying and doing.  They are literally defending ANTIFA, and blaming Trump. It’s like the fire department risking their lives to fight a fire, then being blamed for starting it.
None of them had any interest in Barr’s answers or digging for the truth, as this was a demonstration of political theatrics meant to chisel away at the Trump Admin.

There is truth to what you are saying. There are for profit prisons. Obama shut a lot of them down, Trump opened them back up as soon as he came into office. Also a felon must be “off paper” to vote. It takes a lot to get off paper. It’s a form of voter suppression

Schedule has him golfing. In the meantime,  149,400 deaths from #Covid_19
No. Because if they support Trump then it is very clear what they think of me. Life is too short for that.
Sad that this is not even newsworthy. Most folks don’t even know what is happening/ MSM will just report that Trump caused it all. They are hoping for mass carnage.  Some suggest protestors/rioters are being compensated like an army for hire.
Your leaders won’t listen-they can’t blame Trump for violence if there is no violence. Get out while you can
Please pray for our sons and daughters in HLS.  Our modern politics uses them as pawns, and demonizes these public servants while honoring  anarchists. The left agenda cares nothing about innocent life as long as they can beat Trump.
Mine are cheaper now than 3 years ago, so Pres Trump must be doing something right.
Thank you President Trump! I am required to take multiple prescription medicines daily. Any help with lowering the prices is gladly welcomed. One medicine I take has to be obtained from Canada bc of all the US restrictions &amp; cost. Maybe now a US co can benefit from selling it.
Not a fan of police, but I wouldn't trust Trump with the life of a watermelon seed.
Look, I'm going to be brutally honest here.  I don't care if you are a staunch Republican at this point.  I don't even care if you initially voted for Trump (I don't like it very much, but...).  If you are voting against Trump and the current ass-kissers in the White House, okay.
Okay, I've made a decision.  I'm going to stop blaming everything on #Trump.  Yes, he is the #asshat that leads them, everyone currently working in #TheWhiteHouse is complicit, therefore they are ALL to blame.  So, from now on, I will be saying "The White House" did this or that.
Brother, if you think you are immune to a beating from the cops becaue you licking the boots of Donald J. Trump you are highly mistaken.  You want to say the Democrats blocked some kinda bill to help the American people . BRO, I DONT NEED NO HELP I WORK FOR MINE.
Darryl is my favorite character from the walking dead, but I know he voted for trump 😩
You are, undoubtedly, part of the problem because none is as blind as he who will not see. Money for HBCUs and an unemployment rate inherited from the previous administration is apparently enough to keep you out of the "suburbs" Trump wants to protect.
Great interview of Trump’s diversity person. You exposed him well.
Nope. It's that Trump Koolaid that the keep drinking
Sean notice that all of these Democrat idiots are running to the same beat " That Trump will not leave if not elected". Only a child could come up with an idea like that. Had to come from Pelosi who is already on record as saying. These folks are so childish it's scary.
fuck anyone who comes in 30 minutes before close, stays 30 minutes after close, and doesn’t tip; also fuck donald trump

I really would like to know if Trump’s son is going to school face to face when school starts.
do you ever get tired of lying every time you get behind the podium. You said Trump hasn’t changed?? So I guess saying the virus is going to disappear is the same as him saying things are going to get worse. Now all of the sudden he thinks mask are patriotic?👀
And they continue blaming the cause for the spread of the virus on President Trump. I guess people are so self centered and not concerned about spreading it to others including their loved ones.
If   didn’t show these videos of Portland, the governors lies of peaceful protest, the MSM lies of moms in solidarity, and the Dem lies of Trump instigation would be the order of the day. Not one question from press corps! ANTIFA is legitimized by MSM silence.
Keep your head up, things are getting better! Help Trump MAGA!
lmao probably 😭 i just remember people talking about trump saying that
All smoke and mirrors by your team.  Love how they Run around starting fires and then try to blame Trump. Americans are on to their idiotic strategy.
Trump has no idea how this process works, Jake.
Do what I do. Cut them out of your life. If they still support Trump through all of this, then they don't support you.
They’re well on their way... and I’m not saying this jokingly. It is both sad &amp; frightening.  People need to open their eyes &amp; acknowledge this fact, set politics aside &amp; let Trump (or whoever he appoints) do whatever is lawfully necessary to get the situation under control.
Pres Trump has a decent arm. Nice form! Bet it was great fun &amp; an honor for the kids that were there.

Name one fault Trump has taken responsibility for. Politicians, Dem or Rep, don’t do that. That’s why we call them politicians.

President Trump should cut off all law enforcement funding immediately or whatever funds they receive that's within his discretion.

Do people not see what trump is doing. He is stationing these military men around the country because the election is coming up and they will enterfer with the election and when it’s time to leave the White House they will protect him. Let’s watch and see !!!
So, Trump's secret police is out terrorizing the American populace in an effort to show what another president would do?  C'mon Boris, you can't be that far up Donald's butt...or can you?
Asking for Refugee status is not "begging for help".  It is legal.  It is the way most immigrants with children enter the United States. And it has been vilified by the Trump Administration.

The most annoying thing about this continued behavior is once it's all over, they'll say "we thought we were doing the right thing &amp; helping to steer trump in the right direction by appeasing him in this way." No shame &amp; no accountability.
Send your kids to camp, they said. It will be fun, they said. Don't worry about some silly virus, they said. It's a Soros plot to make Trump look bad, they said.I mean everyone is doing everything for their advantage. I mean this election sucks. Tbh I'd rather have Trump than Biden. Theyre both the worst.

That is correct. Trump does need to fire Fauci and get Dr. Judy Mikovitz to head the task force. This is part of the plan to get rid of Trump and take over the country.

Last thought. Fauci acknowledges errors (not lies) and corrects Cuomo notes mistakes, examines, adjusts  When did you last hear Trump admit he made a mistake? ABOUT ANYTHING? Always fake news, deep state, enemies. Nothing about that worries you? He NEVER admits an error?  NEVER??

Take a deep breath. Do you honestly believe the vast majority of physicians are so antiTrump that they would ignore a "cure", sabotage results, jeopardize lives.....really?.. That's crazy. The OPPOSITE of "Trump delusion syndrome" or whatever they call it.

Besides, those golf balls won't hit themselves!  And Trump can't handle seeing someone legitimately good who actually accomplished for others acknowledged.

Actually, it would have been like any other year. Politicians getting away with crimes and pedofiles running free. This virus would have been treated like H1N1 under Obummer. Swept under rug until it got too big to ignore like last time. Only difference is Trump won.
If you vote for Biden: you promote sexually assaulting women and inappropriately touching kids. Biden is the Dems version of Trump. If you vote for Trump you promote sexually assaulting women and rape.
not all trump supporters are racist, but all trump supporters are complicit in racism.
E-mail frm Cornyn today:  “David, … Yet another new poll has Joe Biden leading President Trump HERE IN TEXAS. ...” TX is close; down ballot voting for Biden win could displace Cornyn. John Hogg (D) is running for TX-11 to replace Conaway (R) who is leaving.
why are these people always Trump supporters?  Smh lol

He is for Americans in all aspects. Juan, mabe your the wolf in sheeps clothing. Trump has done more for this great nation in the past 3.5 years than anyone else has in the past 40 years. Chew on that for a minute and tell me if it's true or not.

Biden tweeted: "We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."

You are really going there?  How many women have accused trump of rape?  30+?
Last I looked most of our mass shootings in America were by white men quoting President Trump and White Supremacists. Get the facts and prove me wrong. So are all Christians bad? Of course not! But by your logic "you just can't tell"...
Under Trump we already are, with high death rates, overwhelmed hospitals, federal soldiers in the streets fighting citizens, threats to not respect an election, and the rest of the world building "walls" to keep Americans from entering their countries. Feeling GREAT yet??
Now to see the Trump supporters try to portray these peaceful, diverse, committed moms, dads, vets, young, and old as "rioting thugs". Amazing, truly inspiring
Trump's America; brought to you by the GOP...
Dude you’re trippin hard. When did I say I idolize trump can you tell me where I said that? Lmao you are the one who spewing hate to people you don’t even know. I’m neither left nor right buddy. I care about the children go get your fact sheet and check before you start assuming.

simply just saying trump isn’t racist
Listening to your music, I’d vote for trump just to stop that insult to music. Jk, I still wouldn’t vote for him or Biden.
Why do I need to hide? I don’t fear any of these Twitter phonies. I don’t endorse trump or Biden. We need a younger government who knows what’s going on.
I’d vote for Koko over Trump and Biden
Right. I’m clueless. All these years in politics and she hasn’t done shit. She’s no better than Trump.
I never said Trump was innocent, he needs to go too. But Biden is exactly like he is. If you endorse Biden or Trump, you endorse sexual assault on women and children.
These people who committed murder should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  President Trump needs to take over these cities and show these thugs what law is all about.

Okay so Obama is more equipped? 😂🥱please look up everything Obama did in his term and think again. I don’t praise the man for $1200 all I’m saying is it’s gonna be real funny seeing fuck Trump when u out spending that money.
I understand he’s not my favorite guy in the world just making a statement that he is so hated because the media and the world make it so half the Americans who say fuck Trump have no real valid reason to but thank you for the opinion.

Well again, I’m not arguing the fact that Trump won. As far as a re-election goes, 3/4 presidents that lost the popular vote were not re-elected for a second term. History doesn’t look bright for Trump.
I’m not doubting the fact that Trump won the election you dunce. I’m stating that the information in the meme is horrendously wrong. Spreading fake information and trying to pass it as facts is what causes such a divide in society. Fact check your stuff before you post it. 🙄
Wait wait wait, we already discussed that the left isn’t the minority. Again, 72 million Americans didn’t vote for Trump, almost 9 million more than those that did. Trump supporters are the minority.
This IS Trump's America
A President swears to “Protect this country and its citizens from all enemies, foreign and domestic.” Mr. Cal Thomas (2003) once seemed to conjoin the power to spy, wage war, and torture with the President’s Oath to protect us.   Now, Trump is protecting us from us. Anything goes
If you look in previous tweets, I’m well aware of what the electoral college is. Again, I’m only providing evidence that majority of voters didn’t vote for Trump.
Over 72 million Americans didn’t vote for Trump while less than 63 million did. By definition, this makes Trump supporters the minority.
I mean you could literally google 2016 Presidential Election and it’ll show you the results. But here’s the chart if you really need to see it. She won the total vote by 2.1%. I’m simply stating facts that the people that voted for Trump are the minority of America.
There’s nothing to argue. I didn’t bring up Trump once. I’m not arguing Trump.
I’m aware of how the electoral college works. I’m simply stating that the majority of American voters didn’t vote for Trump. That is a fact. Another fact is that the president that loses the popular vote has only won the presidency 5 times. 1/2
Can you prove that they cheated? I’m just simply looking at facts. Facts show that Hillary won the majority vote from American voters by 2.1%. By definition, Trump supporters have always been the minority.
For real, we have to remember that the majority of voters in 2016 didn’t even vote for Trump. His supporters act like 90% of America backs him.
Yo, Trump supporters, don't worry about wearing masks!  They are just damn, dirty libtards supporting the masks!  Who cares if you drop dead???

Gutfield. I dare you to tweet anything you feel trump made a mistake on.

That photo of Hitler looks alot like Fred Trump ...
I finally understand Trump's strategy. Downplay Covid so his base will go out and vote in public (and prob get sick). All while anybody with a brain (not his base) will try to vote by mail and that's why he is destroying the USPS. It was obvious but took me a while to get there.
Wow, Trump’s got himself quite a recessionary gap AND COVID is still blazing across the country. That’s...stunningly bad.
This is all just a fight where neither side wants to concede anything to the other. Shameful politics have turned into this.. Trump’s saying there’d be fraud, which could be true, and that if they can riot, they can vote in person; thing is though, why deny a safer form to vote??
why are trump voters so fkn wet for him like I don’t even think ppl who voted for Obama were all in your face about it year round...
This would be my thoughts on how Republicans would try to keep Trump in office without an election.

Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally
The fact that Trump is again moving to end DACA in the middle of a pandemic is no coincidence. He's used the cover of the pandemic to go around Congress &amp; the courts to enact a white supremacist wishlist of anti-immigrant polices that separate families, gut asylum protections.
Media will take the bait, and Trump knows this. It distracts from the GDP numbers and COVID deaths  Doesn’t mean he’s not calculating a way to weaponize the FEC
Trying to summarize for my students why Trump can’t do this himself but knowing in my mind that he’ll somehow find a way to get the FEC to delay the election results and now I feel like drinking heavily and it’s only 9:35 AM

At what point is it fair to say that being a senator is not a lifetime position. It is evident in her mannerisms that she trembles and shakes. She may not have the stamina for the job, she certainly has demonstrated that she won’t stand up to Trump. It is time for someone new.
Sucking up to Trump is not part of your job description, but it is all that you know how to do.
Your job is not to create violent theater to distract from  COVID failure, but that seems to be all that  can think of.  Your job includes dealing with Hurricanes and pandemics, but that fails to interest Trump or Chad.
What you actually mean is that you will attack Black Lives Protesters until Trump loses the election or Putin hacks it for him.  You are a tool.

Bias is telling the story and then sharing their own opinion on it, but they make sure that they portray trump and trump supporters as evil. You see reporters time and time again taking the time to insult him and manipulate his words instead of reporting on him.
Okay I’ll rephrase. Trump only cares for those who make large sums of money while ignoring Americans who struggle to get by. Most of those people are stuck in those situations due to systemic inequality, which people like Trump want to maintain. Better?
The only thing they might be right on is, “whether Donald Trump is reelected or not, the US and India will strengthen their cooperation to contain China.” Or as I would put rightly, stand up to their belligerence.

Maybe something akin to this: "As attitudes toward one’s own party [decline], individuals become motivated to see the opposition party in a more negative light as well" (Groenendyk, 2012). Trump is so awful that the only way to stay Republican is to hate the left even more.
An atty for the Trump admin said 78 immigrants have been sent to ICE family detention centers and 79 have been released in the last week. But an atty representing immigrants said none of them are the families who have been there for months and the subject of recent court hearings

This is so sad. And she's from Brownsville, about an hour drive away. People might just be numbers to the Trump and Republicans, but they're someone's loved ones. You all are heartless.
Mr. President Donald J Trump please pay attention to another doctor's Physicians who seeing patients dr. Fauci it's not telling you the truth there is some physicians in Washington right now they want to talk to you I am a nurse RN I send doctors prescribing hydroxychloroquine .

You'd learn a lot more by closing staying quiet &amp; admitting the true reality of things. Stop being dishonest middle America sees whats actually  happening come Nov your disappointed ego will see Americans prefer President Trump over those that condone violent &amp; destructive mobs

Oh and Republicans &amp; Donald Trump. Fuck those putos too.
President Trump has also secured a record $73.1 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs and signed the VA MISSION Act into law in 2018, which revolutionized the VA healthcare system and restored much-needed accountability to the agency.

I honestly want to know what educated person can believe this LOSER of a human being (Trump) with NO knowledge of science or medicine. Who? Please - I fail to comprehend your stupidity or ignorance or complacency or sheep-like behavior??
Trump be like.....
Count. Because the crappy trump response  which is killing people. You vote for stripping snap/Medicaid to the poor.  You cheer when housing for the people gets budget cuts. Republicans think the poor don’t want to work because of free $$$ they are getting,But you want fetus born
Never said it’s ok, but I don’t have a right to desire. I don’t have to go through the pain and/or harm to health, when there are issues. I believe make assholes should mind their business. It’s not your body. You people are such hypocrites! Here you are loving Trump’s death...
He was joined by Second Lady Karen Pence at the Washington Monument, and the pair crossed the finish line on the South Lawn of the White House, where Sharpe was greeted by President Trump.
You could show people wearing a name tag that says “HI! I’m with Antifa” actually in the process of setting people on fire while holding a newspaper dated from June and Democrats would still call Antifa imaginary, call them peaceful and blame Trump.
The Trump administration has granted  an already rogue and immoral agency, the power to detain and expel people from the U.S. without any record or paper trial. That’s the horror behind the secret detentions in hotels.
The trump was only doing his job. What he was elected to do. In November the good citizens will do our job, and remove him from office.
The Trump administration will not expel a group of 17 unaccompanied immigrant children detained at a Texas hotel under a policy that has immediately sent back thousands at the border citing coronavirus concerns.  w/
All those people just left to die. All because they hate president Trump. 😢
You sound like  Papa Trump...
President Trump a Shear he tried to get all of this people from out of this country more than 3 million people from DACA he send it to the Congress but Democrats did not accept that so that bill didn't pass by democrats so blame Democrats on Democrats they playing games with PPL

It’s amazing the fantastical illusions MAGA supporters have of Trump.  They believe in this absurd view of reality. It is both comical and frightening at the cult like obsession with Trump. Trump has political cult-like  hold of a modern day Jim Jones/Charles Mason/David Koresh.

Exactly. No actual estimate of when power will be restored and no one answers the phone at their end who can give an update ... where’s the Dr. Fauci in their end who can give us answers cuz we’re stuck with No actual updates and a Trump-like response
But I thought trump was going to drain the swamp. Another campaign promise unkept?
Fuck trump
Trump seems to think that America is a country of one, (himself); instead of a country of many. We are a nation of immigrants and united we make it strong. Not divided like Trump has made it into. We need a change in the wind.
Another Trump failed project! Where is the money?
What MR TRUMP Has To Look Forward Too (With His MAN BOOBS) In Jail!
Imprison minorities?? Her voters are democrats, not dumbass conservatives!! That kind of bullshit will work non them. Trump does it all the time. They love it, dems aren’t that stupid.
Living in this covid hot spot and dealing with the damage hurricane Hanna is causing to my home. Plus it’s still raining hard and several levies already broke, and to top it off, Donald Trump hasn’t resigned. This really sucks. “I WILL REBUILD.”
Always out in front👏🏻👏🏻You seem to be thriving under the return of the Articles of Confederation that is the Trump administration. The rest of us not so much.
stop arguing with trump supporters and bootlickers and start preparing for the fact that this all probably won’t end until we have another revolution or another civil war and they’re a bunch of pussies so we’ll win full stop
Do not vote Democrat again they don't want help from President Trump they threatened to take him to court if he brings help they Democrats want everything to burn down after election they will stop. AOC send a letter to Mayers who stand against the police she said burn It Down.
That's why you and all you party is hoping for and that's why you want me mail ballots easy to cheat that's why we want President Trump to drain the swamp too much cheating Joe Biden has been in office 48 years or more never accomplish anything
So they are with hold our own money to force us back to work , take a hard look at south Texas we were doing well untill our governor took trumps advice the whole area is now infected , flooded &amp; hurricane battered &amp; trump is golfing yet again.

I'm Hispanic and will defend my country. TRUMP 2020! American protests: Demonstrations, violent riots expected to continue throughout the country
Remember how so many people spent their days pointing the crimes of George Floyd to say he wasn’t the saint the left was painting him to be? These same people paint Trump, a man with more crimes than the average Joe, as a hero &amp; a saint sent by God. It’s preposterous.
It’s amazing how a bullshitter believes their own bullshit knowing that it was trump who brought out the worst in America  in less than 4 years.
Teddy is busy fighting the culture wars in hopes someone will make that walk to the WH and convince Trump to step aside.
We are in the middle of a hurricane here in South Texas vast power outrages &amp; flooding is also a trump virus hot spot &amp; you tweet trash .America deserves better Spanky .
Why do I think it was Boss Tweed who said that? Trump does seem to think the Gilded Age was when America was great. No regulations, monopoly was king, rampant corruption.
my tios fav thing to call trump is lardass 💀

Lovely, let's help out GOP w/ ads; Trump Campaign has too many already. Speaker of the House or Speaker for AOC?
Well I would like to see these people that actually like him, anywhere I go I see people whining about Biden, it seems like people are voting for him ONLY because they dont want Trump to win again. How does it all come down to something ridiculous like that?
I understand that but there were candidates in the beginning that had potential to me and they're all out. Even YOU say you're not thrilled with Biden but dont want Trump to win, many people are saying this. Nobody is happy about the selection we have, that's the problem. Why??

I know you got a lot of bootlicking going on. Hard work. FYI, we’re still struggling down here in the Rio Grande Valley with the Trump Virus and a Hurricane to boot. Don’t worry though, we learned we don’t need you for sh*t.
Thomas Kane don't blame Trump blame the Democratic Party Party of slavery tell them to stop this s*** on the Burning Cities looting  Killing black people those people are pay by the Democratic Party BLM collect money and they send to the DNC they are responsible. Not Trump.
the military won't back Trump for sure. MAYBE a General will try something but there's "coup stops" in the command structure &amp; it would be NEARLY impossible. Besides, the CIA is so addicted to swilling metric tons of cash any threat to dollars value will be "pacified" quick-like.
Last week the Trump admin asked a judge to delay the release of immigrant kids in ICE detention. The deadline is Monday and the govt had asked for a stay of the judge's order to release kids in family detention centers because of "substantial issues raised." The judge denied it.

All of these riots and chaos blame the Democrats is planned executed well coordinated to make President Trump look bad and to get him out of office they are not hiding it they are saying it it's no secret but we the people are so stupid that we believe on them they make fear.
AOC advise in the mayors to standby after Joe Biden wins that's the only way they can get President Trump out of office I turning upside down these country find that later has been posted on Twitter many times don't be so stupid you guys from Fox News find the letter do something

The  crunched the numbers on Trump's memo that would exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted when congressional districts. It found that CA, FL and TX would each end up with one less seat if undocumented immigrants aren't counted.
Without sounding like some crazy conspiracy theory person I suspect they've all taken dirty money to get re-elected. Like foreign dirty money and they don't want it getting out. Others, Trump has kompromat on.
He doesn't understand his political career is toast. That 33% isn't going to win him statewide election. He's gonna get primaried by Patrick and will lose that. Why he doesn't get on the right side of history stumps me except he's terrified of Trump.
Because they will shut it down and that would upset Trump. They aren't traditional GOP'ers anymore. They are Trumpists.

Let’s not forget that Trump is rAcIsT though, right? Right?

Republicans to Trump: You can't delay 2020 election
Trump killed Herman Cain
Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?
Trump
Absolutely, and one of the many reasons Trump perpetually tries to disparage Obama - a bitter, jealous, resentful and pathetic man who cannot hope to ever come close to demonstrating the class and character of the President who preceded him.
Trump's promise of lofty GDP growth post tax cuts passed Dec 2017 were BS.  Only 1Q 2018 did GDP growth exceed 3%, has averaged 2.2% 2Q18 thru 4Q19 pre pandemic, and now -5% 1Q2020 and a record -32.9% 2Q2020 (a record low)!  Vote him out!!!
Pompous Pompeo as usual, blowing smoke up everyone's **s!  Attributing an authority to a corrupt and unscrupulous AG which he clearly does not possess.  Trump and his debased administration are desperate and think nothing of violating and skirting the Rule of Law.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden  via
2015 Obama approved millions in funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology the soon to be location of COVID-19 outbreak that was planned to be released during this election year after the impeachment of Trump failed.  Democrats and MSM cordinated this shutdown.  #TRUMP2020
Trump needs to stop calling them the “silent majority.” The term “silent but deadly” is much more fitting and accurate.
Question. Who allowed it and why can’t Trump appoint more medical experts to have a voice?
Weird these are indicative of what recent event...and where was this started. Damn Trump for being a business man not a politician.
Fucking trump
is the joke! trump is the punchline! Cornyn is one of trump’s biggest enablers and sycophants. As a constituent of Cornyn’s 🤮 I’m 100% supporting  to defeat and remove this joke from office!
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won’t do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
If damning information could disqualify someone, then Trump should have never ran and he should have been removed. People are going to bash KDH, but we got her if Biden does the right thing. #BidenHarris2020
Regardless of the perpetrators, Trump is trying to stop the violence while local governments are enabling it.
Trump’s attempts at sincerity remind me of Pitt football injuries. (If you get this, we can be friends.)
Watching the  documentary on  and it just makes me so sad that she's not our President. She's not perfect, but i have no doubt we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now due to Trump being completely incompetent.
They know - what they are hoping is that the AMERICAN people don’t know...
These other countries aren’t dealing with the Left’s real national emergency- getting rid of Trump
Can you feel that America? That’s the shifting and the waking up of some Trump supporters. Welcome! Let’s come together and beat this virus. #TakeBackAmerica #EnoughIsEnough #UnityWins
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Do they not understand that the more they attack Trump, the more we love him?
NWO and Trump is trying to stop it. Affects entire planet.
There is a lot at stake in this election. It isn’t about Trump vs Biden. The Libs are undermining our current ststem government. You need to wake up.

is a liar! What happened to the values of the Corp? Everything Trump turns bad and dies.
He's been at the game a lot longer.  It also says you should look at your content and delivery.  If all you do is rail on Trump you might be losing out.  Too many outlets for that and it gets tedious.
I wonder if we need to shut down social media until this Donald Trump presidency has passed
You have no symptoms  so why are you taking the drug? It’s to make trump happy.
Herman Cain’s blood is on Trump’s hands.  I am a Republican and we be first in line for early viting to help elect Joe Biden.  Let’s take back our great country!!  #WeWillVote
Trump doesn't do funerals, because they are not about him.
With the combo of COVID and voter suppression tactics expect long lines and long waits. Lawn chairs, coolers and patience will be needed. Attending the biggest and best Trump elimination party ever! It’ll be yuge!!  #WeWillVote
Plus will give more time to biden to fix his dementia. Funny how I typed Biden and then trump and it auto corrected Biden spelling but not trump
Trump supporters are the middle class
#WeWillVote. Even if that means a full HAZMAT suit. #WeWillVote Trump OUT. His utterance of delaying an election is something EVERY American who is worth their salt should vote him out of office for. To not is traitorous and certainly unpatriotic.
Excuse me, but are you the same Ari Fleischer who excoriated Joe Biden for suggesting three months ago that Trump would try exactly this?
If he hadn’t followed Trump and gone to the Tulsa rally, he would still be alive!  People that follow Trump, either die or cause someone else to die! #Trumpisthevirus
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
Trump Has A Texas Sized Meltdown And Says Democrats Will Get Rid Of Cows
Wait...y’all don’t wanna talk about the Steele dossier? What changed? I thought the Steele dossier was key to Trump-Russia collusion. Are we not discussing that any more? 🤔
The only Tweet that Donald Trump has made in the last hour was an endorsement of a pizza joint.
While I pray for him and his family, you forgot to mention he got it from Trump Tulsa rally
Good point! But this is what the administration wants. Whether it’s the virus or the secret police sent into our cities, this will be the way it goes until Trump is out.

Trump is best at triggering liberals 😉
And it is incredibly offensive that Trump would suggest delay on the day of Rep John Lewis’ funeral, a man who fought so hard, his entire life, for voting rights.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won’t oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.
Donald Trump is directly responsible for the death of Herman Cain.
Here’s Trump’s playbook:  Economy report is a disaster, let’s tweet out some crazy shit.
I will send a personal “thank you” tweet to any &amp; every government official I come across who denounces trump’s election delay threat. Even GOP officials... 🤢
If President Trump hadn’t held his rally in Tulsa or if he had demanded and modeled the wearing of a mask, Herman Cain would still be alive.
Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn’t wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
Sad. Oh well. He gambled with his life and lost big. My condolences to his family. trump is culpable.
Is the economy worse than four years ago? Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited! Let’s see those tax returns.

you know the WHOLE WORLD is laughing at you for shit like this. Right? You’re a fucking IDIOT.
Exactly zero surprise that Trump is trying to delay the election.  Exactly ZERO.  He's not gonna go without getting physically frogmarched out of office.
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I’d agree with you. Trump doesn’t give a fuck about Federal law, so don’t act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It’s his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England’s survival depends on it.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election — But Congress Sets the Date
Yes - Trump is a savant. Nothing he does is stupid or ignorant. He is a policy genius who cares nothing for his own image and always puts the American people first....
** Breaking** He can’t do it, but he’s floating the idea.
Make no mistake. This is Trump's version of "There goes the neighborhood".
No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.
So it begins.
In the past 20 years, over 250 million votes have been cast by mail. Meanwhile, there have only been 143 criminal convictions for mail-in voter fraud. Trump is absolutely trying to undermine the election with fearmongering and misinformation.
Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud #SmartNews 😢🤣🤣☺️He Can’t 🤣🤣☺️🤣
Trump has the blood of 150,000 people on his hands.
And here we go. Trump suggests delaying the election.
What? Only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat with Mail in voting. There are number of cases of mail in voting fraud. That’s the reason why Democrats are pushing for more shot downs so people do not go and physically vote. Trump is right.
Trump has decimated international education. For the thousands of people who have made a career out of this until now, we liked America better before he tried to make it “great.”
I have a master’s degree, too, and I just lost my job. If I decide to apply for the new contract- adjunct, and they decide to hire me-it will be a 30 percent pay cut plus no security-after 22 years of service. Trump did this with his Xenophobic rhetoric and policies.
Don, Someone has been behind every fn one of them. They're neither Blue or Red they are grey. Trump is the only one not owned. We need him for 8 more. First 4 don't count. I reclaim his time.
I LOVE Trump!
At some point in the future after Trump has coronavirus and it has swept through the ranks of Republicans who refuse science we will be told “there will be time to discuss the issue of masks in the future, this is a time to deal with the issue of governance!”
You are wetarted. Trump is fighting to rid the world of the scum of the earth, which is you. What are you hiding, covering for. People like you lie because you are guilty.
Trump has Fed chief investing in stocks.

Displaced workers pay taxes too! The Republicans caused them to be unemployed when Trump botched the response to COViD-19 pandemic.

Screw Twitter. It leads to pontification and resting on laurels and sound bites.  The New Wave is coming. We need to seriously give time and some money to TRUMP and the GOP.  This is a fire we can put out at the polls. Deportation for many, jail time for most, trees of treason?

Regardless of who is behind the violence Trump is trying to stomp out violence in these cities while local governments are throwing fits. It’s a losing battle for leftists regardless.
Fauci hasn’t been consistent nor has he been credible. Trump wanted to close the borders in February to prevent spread and was called a xenophobe but democrats.
I’m not sure the “they’re actually secret white supremacist instigators” argument for the violence in Portland is the right way to go for Democrats.  Even if true, that means Trump is doing everything he can to stomp out white nationalists while local government does nothing.
Why does the right constantly give the left a voice?  PLEASE explain??  Can we not just do our own thing and dictate what we want and control the narrative? You are giving these people cred.  Shut them up like Trump does.  Follow his lead.  #Trump2020
Germany is literally buying Putin's oil. How is Trump doing his bidding?

Again, I don't practice in conspiracy. What I do know is Comey, Hillary, Obama are all free. Trump, Barr have the power. Barr has activity been a bad AG - but they have nothing. Trump is scared as crap about Manhattan tax case because if he loses jail is possible.
Well my view is that Trump has not been good for America. He uses the divisions as a political maneuver. I hope the country makes a change and we at least can put President Trump into the history books. We need both parties to function correctly. But at the moment the GOP is mia
I think that is justified only because how Trump vilified Media and good journalists. You reap what you sow and he has sowed discourse since he came down that esculator.
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
Like Fox News? Again I traffic in facts not conspiracy. The media reports what President Trump says. I have seen CNN report what Trump says and have seen the same video on Fox News. CNN didn't doctor the video they just report on his actions. And I make the final judgment.
I agree with them. President Trump at his core is not a good person. He does have these views and values and you can simply roll back the tape since he's been President. His ban had nothing to do with a systematic approach to controlling the outbreak, it's him and his team biases
Well I don't peddle in conspiracy theory. I traffic in facts. President Trump dismissed this virus back in December and continued to do so all the way until April. So I place blame and responsibility where it's due - however you have the right the believe what you chose.
#1 -This has to be on top of the list of people to indict. #2- Reverse Pardon on Roger Stone and get him in prison #3 - Michael Flynn, for the ❤️of god get this guy in jail  Top dog - Arrest Trump and charge him with all the items in Mueller report plus all the extras
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Donald Trump withstands news conferences, without a pre-approved list of sympathetic reporters, teleprompters, &amp; without an advance list of questions✔️  He was interviewed by Chris Wallace, &amp; answer tough questions✔️  You should be able to, as well✔️ Time to DEBATE TRUMP✔️
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Considering all the laws the AG has broken its fair to assets some type of punishment. The Trump Administration and the AG had thumbed thier noise to the Dems in Congress, so I can't join you in sympathy.
We should all be watching this hydroxychloroquine narrative closely. I feel like Trump is trying to use the "I've been telling you" narrative... Dangerous human being, that man.
Something I honestly never thought I’d see on a news chiron: “Doc shared by Trump reportedly believes in alien DNA, demon sperm and hydroxychloroquine”. We’re doomed.
Thats funny, I recall defending trump on multiple occasions
Ima fw you later bro, you seem to only want to defend Trump at all costs and are not open to persuasion
Your argument at this point is "Trump didnt hear it" which goes against the millions of people that SOMEHOW did
Trump is back at it pressuring governors to open their states in spite of surging cases and deaths across the country. When the situation gets even more dire, will  blame the governors once again for “opening too soon”?
You just had to bring out the ad hominen huh? Either way its impossible to debate with you because your reasoning is invalid and flawed. I respect for not just saying Trump 2020 like a dumbass though good day to you my kind sir
It’s an embarrassment. It’s a wonder that there has not been a revolt of POC who are done with our shit. Trump opened my eyes &amp; now I can’t unsee it.  I promised my 3 daughters that trump would not win.  That that wasn’t who we were. I was wrong.And if -- big if -- we manage to get Trump out of office AND avoid fracturing the country in two, it will always remain possible that it could happen here. Again.
I wonder how the Republicans are feeling. Saying that they didn’t need masks and Corona is made up and now Trump is trying to stop the election because of corona? Genuinely curious about how they feel rn.
is hiding in the bunker with Trump. And  is an idiot who cares nothing about our children, teachers, school staff or the families. If Abbott would come out of hiding and Paxton weren’t such an idiot, they would allow for distance learning.
You'd look like Trump
and what about trump not engaging Putin about Putin bounty on our Soldiers. Very disgusting and unpatriotic of an American president not looking out for the safety of the Soldiers serving in harms way
There 3 things Trump excels at: Lying, ripping people off, and bringing out the worst in others.  Trump’s a leader for the corrupt soul.
I Follow Trump Just To See Which Of My Followers Likes His Tweets 🤷🏾‍♂️
Where is  in all of this?  Is he hiding in the same bunker with Trump? Damn it, he needs to govern and not hide.
Did you turn off the tv when AXIOS reporter told trump did he bring up the Russian bounty on killing our troops and trump said he didn't  mention that Putin, question, did that make u sick to your stomach. tic toc tic toc.
Anyone else think President Trump’s tweet was designed to make the leftists shit their pants?
CNN would not promote HCQ if it were a 100% cure for Alzheimer’s if President Trump touted its effectiveness.  They cannot allow him any praise.... Orange Man Bad....always...
In the being of the pandemic I said Trump was actually doing his job when he sent out those first stimulus checks. But I take it back completely. He thought by shoving a grand in our face that we would forget about him calling the virus a democratic hoax and he delayed reaction
Project Lincoln should book this guy to take part in a video. Calabresi is now a Republican voter against Trump.
Miracles never cease. Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus  encountered Jesus. It took Calabresi just one tweet-threat from Trump to demand re-impeachment. You can only support the racism so long before you realize he's a wannabe dictator.

Donald Trump is a fucking LUNATIC. This news conference about mail-in votes is insane. He's so concerned mail-in ballot will be hijacked or defrauded...BITCH HOW...HOW...THERE ARE MILLIONS, DUMBFUCK, PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW YOU FUCKING IDIOT. He's afraid he's losing

Here's the full story on the family of Vanessa Guillen meeting with President Trump today
With the Clinton it was widely tested in blue states with illegal votes and would of won. But they did not count on the rest of the country to come out and vote for Trump like we did and did not see we where sick and tired of the Obama bull sht.
This is the NEWS that Trump wants you to ignore. Hence, that election-stopping threat tweet earlier.

Trump meets with family of Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen  via
The family could ask trump to give the eulogy, I mean Cain did attend his last rally, didn’t wear a mask or self distance from others. Trump style!! Not saying it’s where he got the virus, but some of trumps people had it. Maybe not, if trump talks, it will be a rally about him.

President Donald Trump to the family of Spc. Vanessa Guillen: "We're going to look into it very powerfully."
Does that mean Pres. Trump will be President until it’s safe for We the People to Vote, in person. It may take a year or more for conditions to return to a safe level for that to happen. Pres. Trumps second term can start after 2021-2022 election. Love to Win, Win, Win.
Update, 1 p.m.: President Donald Trump is meeting with the family of Spc. Vanessa Guillen now at the White House.
I read and tweeted this article on my timeline. Here's why it makes sense:  As a narcissist, he'll save face with his base by pulling an LBJ rather than face a devastating electoral loss. (To be sure, Trump isn't completely going away even if he resigns.)
Why Trump Might Quit.   There is logic behind saying to hell with reelection.  It is late but not too late to pull an LBJ. [Please read the article before commenting. Thank you.] #wtpBlue

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
That, too, isn't working. Trump isn't a student of history; he only understands media's effects to a certain extent. The visuals on his Gestapo is devastating to his polling and the GOP.
Steve, we both know that they are too chickensh!t to answer. For instance, Rubio will quote-tweet Scripture any minute; others will claim they never heard Trump say it. Still others will claim that what you heard is not what he meant.
Trump this morning is waving  the flag of defeat. He should resign - but he won’t. Trump’s going to burn all his bootlickers ontge way out.
Except that this toxic narcissist knows he's going to lose. James Carrville predicts that there's still room that Trump could resign.
'Things could get very ugly': Experts fear post-election crisis as Trump sets the stage to dispute the results in November.

you might want to start working to revoke those emergency powers Trump gave himself over a fake caravan.
What I like about Trump, among many things, is he is draining the swamp, even as the swamp monsters try to crawl their way back in.
Trump’s election delay statement has already hit the BBC breaking news wire
24 April 2020  “Biden says he thinks Trump will try to delay the presidential election”
While Trump is retweeting about postponing OUR election, which he can’t do, read about the human cost of Trump’s incompetence, inaction, lies, and profit making.  This is but one story of over 150,000 who’ve tragically lost their lives. Trump and his party bear the blame period!
Have we had enough   ?  You’re way late on the impeachment of Bill Barr, now you’re going to have a rogue *President challenging the election before it happens.   Bring a 2d impeachment for Trump, and force Trump’s Senators to “acquit” Trump again.

Compare this to the normal death rates (pre-Covid). Then, contrast it with the birthrate (again, pre-Covid).   Finally, collate the Covid data with all of it. It's a catastrophic decline. And, Trump wants less immigrants.

🇻🇳 A pandemic strategy Trump ignored is helping Vietnam combat Covid-19. Now it’s one of the only places in the world with zero reported virus deaths, although it’s tackling its first cases in more than three months. #wtpBLUE #ONEV1
Let's set up a Commission post-Trump first, and discuss its merits after.   The Democrats will lose in 2024 if they don't take meaningful action.
It's also why we need a Nuremberg-style truth and reconciliation commission after Trump.
Neil, the new strategy that guides US forces in Europe post-Berlin Wall is a combination of light and medium-heavy (mech) plus airborne infantry.  Our continued presence in Germany is a bulwark against Russia since World War 2.   It won't go away, in spite of Trump.
President Donald Trump took sweeping digs at “crazy left radical Democrats” on a trip Wednesday to the fracking fields of West Texas, launching unsubstantiated claims that a Democratic administration would destroy everything.

As a voter that’s my mission, to take trump down. I don’t need any help from any media outlet. I have watched, listened, read tweets and texts to figure out for myself his inability to do his job. They call bad doctors “quacks”, so i guess #45 is the “quack” version of President.
The stupid won't magically disappear when Trump is gone.
Facebook is blocking it also..they dont want that info getting out..the dems are pushing the virus..keep everyone home..allow mail in votes so they can get Trump out of office..because the know Biden can't win fairly. We the people know whats up-and-coming

As l’m watching replay on cspan of the Barr hearing, there’s NO amount of money the Trump campaign could have spent that would’ve showed the country the evil intentions of the democrats! If l was a democrat, l would hide with Biden! Demon possession is real folks!!
The questioning by the Democrats today was just as I thought. It was all about stopping the investigations. Impeaching Barr and beating Trump at the polls will do it, they think. But it won't. Today was showtime, flex your muscle day for the Democrats. They failed miserably.
Latest Lincoln Project ad: 'It's Trump's virus now'
They need to it's time to evolve...I have a question for you Trump why isn't the yiur cabinet is made up of only white people and one black person?
in no way a trump supporter, mainly I just look to harass  but POTUS did send condolences upon the death of Lewis on 7/18. just saying. 🤷‍♂️
Newsflash--Obama/Biden is not a choice in this thread. He was not talking about them.  Also news--I am not a Trump supporter, but I'm scared to death that Biden might win and he's even worse.  More corruption to continue the existing corruption.
Antifa could literally break the doors down, march in there and start beating on them. And they would still deny their existence. Or say they were hired goons from a secret police force sent by Trump. 😑😑
Mark my words: if trump ever toes the rubber at a Yankees game, this throw will have better mechanics
I watched the whole thing. It is very informative and encouraging.  But it makes me have greater doubts than ever about politics and fake news. That they would rather people die than agree with Trump is scary.
That was Trump’s point. Take away the salaries from the teachers that refuse to work and pay the American people that have to do it in their place. But I get your point. My wife and I both work.
Whatever. Trump wants to pay the American people to homeschool if so required. I can get on board with that now that I see who’s really been teaching our children.

As far as the Heart disease goes, why aren’t we outlawing fast food and sodas? Bc of how much money there is in big pharmaceuticals. It was president Trump that just signed a executive order that lowered the cost of of insulin and Epipens.
Your exactly right the democrats did absolutely nothing when Trump wanted to shut people coming in from other countries. He also said that hydroxy was a possible cure and everyone laughed. He did his part it was the dems that did nothing at all.
Trump is right if you hate the US...leave!!!
After the elections, I fully expect Trump and the Republican controlled Congress to pass legislation to rebuild those businesses that were destroyed by the anarchists. The owners deserve to be made whole again.
It is amazing to me that liberal democrats are willing to kill the American public, so that they don’t have to admit Trump was right!!
If the polls showing Biden with a lead over Trump in several states, there is no need for mail in ballots. You Democrats have already stolen the election from Trump.
Obama Granted Clemency to Terrorists and Traitors, But We’re Supposed to Be Angry at Trump's Pardons
I really expected for trump to be irrelevant by now. We should of been passing everything by veto proof majorities. Has our system collapsed?
apparently i made my aunt cry all day after she called me to argue abt blm but all i said was “fuck trump” 💀
For awhile now, I've seen headlines/heard politicians question: "What if President Trump doesn't accept the election results?" - This question comes across as fear mongering / reminds me of tactics some Republicans used when President Obama was in office. Let it stop.
Are you under the impression that I'm a complete Trump supporter?  Here's the problem: "R or D is your only choice, and whichever you are, you have to be all in"  I'm neither R nor D and I've never been all in with any one politician or political party.
Here's another:
Only reason I’d vote trump (be the first time in ages I went to an establishment party), would be because Biden is a puppet and the puppeteers on the left scare the shit out of me.

Thanks for pissing off enough Americans to allow Trump to win in a landslide👌🏼
I think the Democrats will tire of the riots and protest going on, will throw Biden under the bus at the convention, elect Hillary to run against Trump again. She will move back toward the center. Any way you slice it, Hillary will be the Democrat nominee for President.
So you are pro life but you don’t give a damn about the kids in cages. Your pro life but the 146,000 who have died with the COVID isn’t bothering you. Well I call bullshit. When you love trump even thou he has been terrible President.
If trump says we should not do mail in ballots then that is exactly what we need to do. Always do the opposite of what the brain says. Just makes since folks.
I hope that the first thing our President does on January 21st is pick up a sledge hammer, walk outside and knock a big hole in that offensive wall that Trump put around the Whitehouse.
Wowwww.... so very liberal of you. How kind... let me explain TRUMP will be your POTUS for the next 4.5 years.
TRUMP has a plan... it will rock the nation. Liberals fell for the BAIT! Lol
Oh hell! I guess that, just like Trump, I need to start having compassion for the more than 145,000 souls lost due to our greed. I’ve got 100 days to make people think I care.
I still this Biden running for President is a sham and and a setup for Hillary Clinton. She looks and talks too comfortable. I think she swings her party back toward the center, but still far left. She wont debate Trump. She will make wild promises she can't keep.
Texas loves you  We literally drove through a neighborhood with Trump flags everywhere yesterday. If the China virus hadn’t affected our family so much financially I would have one as well!

That's correct!  Frightening similarities between Trump and Hitler. True.  Left has made those striking similarities known, but ppl said it's too much, inappropriate. So, we do more checklist of Fascist Characteristics: (It's Scary if ppl are "blind"and refuse to see)
Your account appears.solely meant to stoke fear in people. And you're lying to them to do that! Liar Trump himself is doing, thinking if you scare people they'll vote for his violence towards them. destructive.  Majority of Protesters.peaceful.  Federal agents violent every day!
The minute Biden is sworn in nobody will listen to trump. So tired of this story.
For those old Trump Tweets, coming back to show his hypocrisy, we say:   "There's always a Tweet"   Because there are so many Trump Tweets hyper-critical of OBAMA's Administration.  Now we find Trump himself Is Doing Exactly what he criticized Obama for, only many times worse!

You can bank on it. The Democrats are planning on stealing this election, not from just Trump, but from every local, state, and Federal contested race. The Democrats must know they have this in the bag or Biden wouldn't be there.
"Community Policing" -  Trump administration.  Sick shit when those being "policed" are "Walls of Moms", "Walls of Vets", and "Walls of Ordinary people carrying umbrellas and leaf blowers"

Here's a couple from the "CARAVAN" the Trump GOP got Fear-Mongered Into Believing Were "Invading". Later, The baby would have been taken away and put in a separate cage with other babies.  I wonder if they were ever reunited? Trump and his administration does *not* know either 😭
They're not big on "thinking"  They're more into feeling whatever Trump Manipulated them to feel. It's usually FEAR &amp; ANGER.  They got so scared of an "invasion" by "Caravans"of violent "Mexicans" They did this 👇 later they took her baby away and put in a cage somewhere else

Ever heard of slander and not all comments are protected under freedom of speech. Like I said I am sure they have committed crimes. I would have to look into it. Purporting a false plot that government is being sinister while Trump is being heroic could be inciting riot.
Trump is obese because he is a corrupted glutton. And while most people stuff themselves, digest and dump it out to a deuce or a triple Trump is on blood thinners.
I don't want to knock Trump too much as I am unilaterally opposed to the sapping and murder of Americans outsourcing to Communist China and all that that globalist Bohemic iceberg portends. And I realize that there's a limit to the faults and vices of others even on Social Media.
Same here. I find it's still very difficult to watch 9/11 memorials yearly and documentaries on it.  I'm looking forward to Trump and his Sycophants spending their twilight years in courts, Tribunals, and Congressional testimonials answering to Investigations done in truth/facts
I was on early in the Republican primaries but then started becoming a more active Twitter user for HRC (over Trump, who I had researched by then, and despised!)  So, we both got started on 2016.  Be as active as you want to be and take breaks as needed   #PortlandProtest
It get is. I feel terribly sad for Portland and the other cities which are targeted by Trump simply because they have elected Dem leaders.  But I'm so PROUD of the "walls" (all of them now) especially the "wall of moms".  Now the "wall of Vets"  It's time to stand up! Courage!
With Trump, Cruelty IS The Point
I actually pinned the Fox news clip where Trump had called in on the phone and said this!  One of the Lincoln Project vids also has a short clip of that very call in. Trump said the economy, the country, needed to CRASH, before it could be maga.  He's a dangerously stupid man
Shittttt. Where was Obama when Houston flooded?  Nobody cried about that. From someone who didn’t vote for trump or Hillary last election, I can say y’all cry too much. Victims everywhere.
Trump sets "fire" to the USA then goes golfing as the nation "burns"
My mother, an apolitical devout Catholic, viewed Trump through the “Orange man bad” lens   That was until she noticed images like these. She played close attention to things he would say specifically about God and prayer, as well as the unborn.   These images have impact.
Oh they covered the deaths. They attributed them all to the trump rally in Tulsa. I remember when news was fact. So long ago.
Mariners might sign him, though.
Did you see the pitch?  Wow. I mean,
Why do I feel like the Republicans enjoy being in the minority. When Trump was elected you had the majority, but what was accomplished?
There is nothing, NOTHING more important to the Democrats than to control the narrative of Fox News, and they are doing it. Almost 24/7 coverage of the Democrats effort to make Trump unelectable, while limiting Trumps achievements to a few minutes on talk shows. Please R/T this.
Trump's competition... Lmao
Theres a gathering of people on Highland waiving trump flags.   Sure would be awful if someone reported that theres not a mask on any of them.
I have a Donald Trump joke, but it's stupid.
If and when President Trump nominates and gets placed another Conservative on the Supreme Court, that will effectively close the door on liberals  running to this Court and their allies for a positive verdict whether lawful or not. Interpretation of the law will once again reign.
Another conservative appointee by President Trump will mute his vote. We just have to bide our time.

Anything's possible.  The story is that Putin (Russia) has actually paid some of those bounties ($100k per Soldier) they've placed on their heads for the Taliban.  But you're probably aware of that.  This appeared in Trump's Presidential Daily Briefing   Trump, MSM - nothing
This story is Nicole Wallace blasting Trump for his tweet using the word "housewives" instead of "women"   It's not bad Actually, but still 🦗on huge stories about, for example, Russia paying bounties to Taliban in Afghanistan for killing our troops!
I see. Yes, it is MSNBC. I understand. I too am very skeptical of big media - they aren't asking the toughest Questions and seem to have "breaking news" that's a non important (Distraction?) many times.   asked "Big Question" - twice - of Trump and  🦗crickets

I don’t see Biden caring anymore than Trump does. For people at that level winning is simply about gaining the power to push your agenda. You and I care about average people because that’s what we are. If you ever hit it big, don’t ever forget you were one of us.
Try reading before you respond. I said he panders to the population that pushes that agenda. Also, I didn’t ask why they won’t vote for trump. I asked why no one supports an independent or 3rd party. You people are illiterate and respond to shit you can’t comprehend.

I see a lot of republicans that say they’re voting Biden because Trump doesn’t support their Christian or conservative values. I want to ask those people a question, why did you not take part in the primaries?  There were other candidates.  Bill Weld etc. genuinely want to know
You’re Christian yet you will vote for someone who panders to population that wants religion gone. You sound misinformed. If you people don’t like trump, throw your vote behind a libertarian or independent. You must value politics more than your god or freedom.
All this talk about cheating on mail in ballots? Well that’s just hoping you use a machine because it is easier for Putin to change the vote. It is that simple. Last thing we need folks. A vote needs to be accurate and honest. This is America folks. Screw trump.

There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.

Ultimately any dumbass who went to a political rally inside an arena with zero social distancing and zero mask mandate during the Covid 19 pandemic is responsible for their own death. But Trump is complicit and negligent
When I hear that Right Wing Nut Jobs and #MAGAts say that Liberals created COVID to make Trump look bad I have to stop and think for a moment, Trump doesn't need anyone to make him look bad! MFG he does that all by himself!
Ted Cruz Hits GOP Panic Button: ‘Texas Is In Play’ For Democrats In November   The Republican have done absolutely nothing for Texas just for Trump and themselves. Send kids to school what about the Teachers and Bus drivers. No make Trump happy
Guys it’s time to wake up. Trump has lost his marbles. All he is worried and concerned about is his re-election while over 1000 people are dying in this country due to his his mismanagement of this virus. Work with your fellow Senators to kick the moron out.
Black people in Minneapolis is crying out for greater police protection!Dr. Fauci works for Democratic politicians since he predicted in 2016 (of which we have documents to show this)that pandemic during Trump’s term in office ! How did he know this!
If Trump had not insisted on holding his little house party/campaign micro-event Mr. Cain would be alive.   Fact.   Trump killed the pizza man.
voted to not hold Trump accountable for soliciting foreign intervention in our election emboldening him to interfere in the voting rights of US citizens who are registered to vote.
How many times do we have to do this?
No your boss is wrong for moms. Trump’s track record proves he’s incompetent to lead.
I’d say Herman is responsible for his own death by not using common sense. But Trump DEFINITELY set the stage.
got ppl retweeting shit supporting Trump. nice lil block button being handed out.
Yes, President Trump, declare this Sunday at precisely 3:00 pm ET every American take a knee and vow to end racism. Let’s see how fast the liberals go ape-shit over it. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Is there a way to measure the impact of the trump administration throwing out the pandemic playbook prepared specifically for a situation such as this? #CNNTownHall

There is absolutely no strategic gain for the US and only a strategic gain for Russia in our pulling out of Germany.
Heres a story: 2015 Obama approved millions in funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology the soon to be location of COVID-19 outbreak that was planned to be released during this election year after the impeachment of Trump failed.  Democrats and MSM cordinated this shutdown.
I am not “pissed”.   Voting for a Trump again.
No it doesn't. At least not until they put him in the ground. What does matter he made the personal decision to not listen to medical professionals, chose the political road, and now his family has to lay him to rest - all for Donald J. Trump.
Oh my God. Did he tell everyone that he got it at a Trump rally where everyone was discouraged from wearing masks? A rally that never should have happened in the first place? That every doctor said was a bad idea? Thought not.
Trump is already that.  Get on board and support #TRUMP2020

The GOP and Trump are the threat. Trump is so tight with Putin and of course Chinas President that for all we know Trump gave China the opportunity to hack Coronavirus details.
Great article and spot on!  Good to see more mental health professionals speaking out about the grave danger of a Trump second term given his prolific pathologies.
Trump just stated his game plan if he loses. “Litigation could take YEARS before we find out who really won the presidency”. #briefing
I am voting for Trump.
That put things nicely into perspective.  Well done!  This will place Trump (deservedly) into the annals of the world's most prolific mass murderers.  Trump should be pleased he will have surpassed his fascist forerunners.
Oh, Annie, Mr. Trump was impeached. That's not "nothing". In addition, Mr Trump is an Unindicted Co-Conspirator in at least one case. Lastly, the "activated" AG doing your claimed investigations is himself being investigated.
The contrast between Obama’s oratory and Trump’s semi coherence and mispronounciations is staggering.
Let’s not forget that Trump is rAcIsT though, right? Right?

Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?
Absolutely, and one of the many reasons Trump perpetually tries to disparage Obama - a bitter, jealous, resentful and pathetic man who cannot hope to ever come close to demonstrating the class and character of the President who preceded him.
Trump's promise of lofty GDP growth post tax cuts passed Dec 2017 were BS.  Only 1Q 2018 did GDP growth exceed 3%, has averaged 2.2% 2Q18 thru 4Q19 pre pandemic, and now -5% 1Q2020 and a record -32.9% 2Q2020 (a record low)!  Vote him out!!!
You said this is Trump’s America, didn’t you?
Idiot Trump is only doing all of this to completey Disrespect John Lewis And his Honorable Legacy. One of which Trumps will only be as Racist Criminal Fraud Liar Moron Lunatic Idiotic Discase to America and its Biggest mistake and Regret.
Pompous Pompeo as usual, blowing smoke up everyone's **s!  Attributing an authority to a corrupt and unscrupulous AG which he clearly does not possess.  Trump and his debased administration are desperate and think nothing of violating and skirting the Rule of Law.

Trump needs to stop calling them the “silent majority.” The term “silent but deadly” is much more fitting and accurate.
Question. Who allowed it and why can’t Trump appoint more medical experts to have a voice?
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won’t do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
Regardless of the perpetrators, Trump is trying to stop the violence while local governments are enabling it.
Trump’s attempts at sincerity remind me of Pitt football injuries. (If you get this, we can be friends.)
They know - what they are hoping is that the AMERICAN people don’t know...
These other countries aren’t dealing with the Left’s real national emergency- getting rid of Trump
Bless his Heart!! Fuck Trump!
Can you feel that America? That’s the shifting and the waking up of some Trump supporters. Welcome! Let’s come together and beat this virus. #TakeBackAmerica #EnoughIsEnough #UnityWins
😂 Not sure Trump should be trying to go back to back with Barack Obama. The comparison will be devastating for Donald. Not that he'll notice. He &amp; his minions are the least self-aware bunch we've ever had in the Whitehouse.
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
My girlfriend told me Trump’s sending emails to his supporters telling them to make sure they are signed up for mail in voting. Smdh this dude is something else
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
anything to say about this idea of Trump's to postpone the election... Feels silent from you... Just sayin'
Do they not understand that the more they attack Trump, the more we love him?
There is a lot at stake in this election. It isn’t about Trump vs Biden. The Libs are undermining our current ststem government. You need to wake up.

Plus will give more time to biden to fix his dementia. Funny how I typed Biden and then trump and it auto corrected Biden spelling but not trump
#WeWillVote. Even if that means a full HAZMAT suit. #WeWillVote Trump OUT. His utterance of delaying an election is something EVERY American who is worth their salt should vote him out of office for. To not is traitorous and certainly unpatriotic.
Excuse me, but are you the same Ari Fleischer who excoriated Joe Biden for suggesting three months ago that Trump would try exactly this?
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
Trump Has A Texas Sized Meltdown And Says Democrats Will Get Rid Of Cows

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Trump Rally - they bragged about no masks required - June 20.  tests positive July 2. Today he is gone. #rip #coronavirus
RIP Herman. How did that trump rally without a mask work out for you?
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won’t oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.
Here’s Trump’s playbook:  Economy report is a disaster, let’s tweet out some crazy shit.
Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
He will if he doesn’t wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
Is the economy worse than four years ago? Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited! Let’s see those tax returns.

You know, Tom, a few months ago, I’d agree with you. Trump doesn’t give a fuck about Federal law, so don’t act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It’s his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England’s survival depends on it.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election — But Congress Sets the Date
Yes - Trump is a savant. Nothing he does is stupid or ignorant. He is a policy genius who cares nothing for his own image and always puts the American people first....

Trump has decimated international education. For the thousands of people who have made a career out of this until now, we liked America better before he tried to make it “great.”
I have a master’s degree, too, and I just lost my job. If I decide to apply for the new contract- adjunct, and they decide to hire me-it will be a 30 percent pay cut plus no security-after 22 years of service. Trump did this with his Xenophobic rhetoric and policies.
At some point in the future after Trump has coronavirus and it has swept through the ranks of Republicans who refuse science we will be told “there will be time to discuss the issue of masks in the future, this is a time to deal with the issue of governance!”

I think Biden doesn’t have to worry about anything.  The people will rise up.  Only 33% of Americans voted for Donald Trump last election and I predict that goes down to 29%.  That means 2/3rd’s of this country will rise up.  You can count on that!
Again I disagree with some of your opinions but you are always consistent. Starting to think I need to listen more to your opinions. Thanks for being a voice of reason for the Democratic Party. It’s hard to find these days! Trump should hire you because you offer balanced opinion
Sounds like Kushner and the Trump crime family to me.
Trump releases all his convicted friends so they don’t snitch on him. This administration is loaded with crooks and it’s only obvious to people w good common sense. It’s a shame what Donald has done to his bleach drunk supporters.

Regardless of who is behind the violence Trump is trying to stomp out violence in these cities while local governments are throwing fits. It’s a losing battle for leftists regardless.
Fauci hasn’t been consistent nor has he been credible. Trump wanted to close the borders in February to prevent spread and was called a xenophobe but democrats.
I’m not sure the “they’re actually secret white supremacist instigators” argument for the violence in Portland is the right way to go for Democrats.  Even if true, that means Trump is doing everything he can to stomp out white nationalists while local government does nothing.
Why does the right constantly give the left a voice?  PLEASE explain??  Can we not just do our own thing and dictate what we want and control the narrative? You are giving these people cred.  Shut them up like Trump does.  Follow his lead.  #Trump2020

stand by while  an obvious Russian asset does nothing to defend our troops as Putin is putting boutiesvon our troops heads! This veteran says it’s time to hold Trump accountable!
refuses to acknowledge that Trump failure at pandemic response! He voted 12 times to not even hear evidence and hold a Trump accountable and now stands by as Texans die due to incompetence. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
#WhyIDontLikeTrump  #tRump wants the riots, he wants the Federal Police and he wants fear - so that he can present himself as the "President of Law and Order". In order to win the elections, every means is right for him. He and his  enablers are a threat to our democracy.
Now show a white trump supporter in a black neighborhood.  The reactions Would not stop at harsh words.
Lock Trump up!
I’m visiting my elderly mother in Wisconsin.  She and all of her neighbors believe all of this bullshit.  It should be a crime.  They think everything is fine and they are all in their 80s and believe the masks are there to harm them.  Trump signs everywhere.
You don’t need to worry unless he tells you he’s Trump’s wingman. Because then, then you’re fucked.
Portland city government is a joke.  A real circus.   Do your jobs or Trump will do them for you!
Why would I have to be?  Tje actual citizens of Portland have been and they know.
Was that gibberish supposed to make sense?  Try reading this from Sen. Ron Wyden.
Obama is as good as we got. Bush Sr, Jr outside the wars decent men. Can't say that about Trump.
I'm sorry. Donald Trump cares nothing about the people or parts of this country that don't serve his political agenda. Something I would never say about Bush Sr or Jr, Reagan or even Nixon. Trump is a unique beast, and he has destroyed so much of this nation's fabric
Trump and his family have made $32m on Tax payers. Obama has created more jobs that Trump. Did you know since 2017 none of Trump economic years has topped Obama? I can provide sources if need be.
I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
Again, I don't practice in conspiracy. What I do know is Comey, Hillary, Obama are all free. Trump, Barr have the power. Barr has activity been a bad AG - but they have nothing. Trump is scared as crap about Manhattan tax case because if he loses jail is possible.
Well my view is that Trump has not been good for America. He uses the divisions as a political maneuver. I hope the country makes a change and we at least can put President Trump into the history books. We need both parties to function correctly. But at the moment the GOP is mia
I think that is justified only because how Trump vilified Media and good journalists. You reap what you sow and he has sowed discourse since he came down that esculator.
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
The “study” by “Experts” that was so widely used to smear Trump turned out to be false and rigged to make Trump look bad yet not one MSM agency retracted the info reported when “expert” got busted flat out lying! Wake up people!! Stop believing everything msm feeds you.
Like Fox News? Again I traffic in facts not conspiracy. The media reports what President Trump says. I have seen CNN report what Trump says and have seen the same video on Fox News. CNN didn't doctor the video they just report on his actions. And I make the final judgment.
I agree with them. President Trump at his core is not a good person. He does have these views and values and you can simply roll back the tape since he's been President. His ban had nothing to do with a systematic approach to controlling the outbreak, it's him and his team biases
Well I don't peddle in conspiracy theory. I traffic in facts. President Trump dismissed this virus back in December and continued to do so all the way until April. So I place blame and responsibility where it's due - however you have the right the believe what you chose.
#1 -This has to be on top of the list of people to indict. #2- Reverse Pardon on Roger Stone and get him in prison #3 - Michael Flynn, for the ❤️of god get this guy in jail  Top dog - Arrest Trump and charge him with all the items in Mueller report plus all the extras
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Donald Trump withstands news conferences, without a pre-approved list of sympathetic reporters, teleprompters, &amp; without an advance list of questions✔️  He was interviewed by Chris Wallace, &amp; answer tough questions✔️  You should be able to, as well✔️ Time to DEBATE TRUMP✔️
There was not 50 days of violence and destruction.  The protests were actully winding down when Trump sent the Thugs in
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Considering all the laws the AG has broken its fair to assets some type of punishment. The Trump Administration and the AG had thumbed thier noise to the Dems in Congress, so I can't join you in sympathy.
He established a council to restore black neighborhoods, he once dated a black woman, he granted clemency to Alice Johnson, he upgraded MLKs birthplace to a national park, he promotes HBCUs...Trump isn’t racist.
No kidding I felt the same way. Who knew that he would be such a GREAT President. If he could run I would vote for President Trump a fourth term. 🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

You need to be more concerned with Trump working with Russia to “rig“ the election. As you know the fraud is Trump not mail in ballots

Look, I'm anti NATO but that doesn't make me pro Trump.
he signed a pledge to support whoever the nominee is. and he has always said he will do what it takes to stop trump. running independenf would hurt that cause.
No Free world under Trump and current GOP leadership. Try something else.
Good, I didn’t vote for Trump discipline. Notice the question marks at the end obviously meant as a thought that he completely cleared up in his 5:30 press conference, but I love how people go crazy by a thought by the President on a social media platform that allows kiddie porn
President Trump suggested delaying the election because of the coronavirus, something he cannot legally do. Top Republicans quickly rejected the idea.
Trump has dragged this economy straight into the gutter. We will be like that movie The Book of Eli if we are forced to remain under this idiot.  He is awful.
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.

That was 14 years ago.  He caught COVID-19 around the time of Trump's superspreader rally in Tulsa, tested positive a little over a week later, and succumbed to the disease after a month in the hospital for it.
To what exactly, because I damn sure know it wasn't to the 600 dollar unemployment amount. Sure it was some other piece of Trump pork that needs to be removed.
I understand your stylistic objections to Obama.  I have a similar hostile response to oleaginous politicians like Cruz who insult your intelligence; and that’s even before Trump turned Republicans into the nihiliststic Trolling for Liberal Tears Party.

Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.

All Trump talks about is mail in vote fraud! Ridiculous  Any excuse to refuse to accept the out come Nov 3 if he loses!
Trump just said if we have mail in voting we will be the laughingstock of the world.  We are already the laughingstock of the world because of him!  He said you have to be really stupid not to understand that. Oh my God he is really an idiot!.  😲
That's kinda like true, only a few stay near the border, and the ones that stay near the border often aren't the criminals Trump is so scared of.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Finally because Herman Cain was killed by Trump Virus, he mentions the more than 150,000.
You know what's going to be sad? The fact that three former Presidents prior to  will probably show respect and condolences to his family and be willing to pay their respects to him on behalf of the nation and Trump couldn't do the same for John Lewis. That's sad.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There’s way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There’s little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.

Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain’s death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.

It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
trump knows he can’t change the election,he’s trying to cause confusion so people give up because they’ll believe his lies! Americans have to be smarter than that! Look at the facts! I have applied for my mail in ballot! This is NOT a new system! trump and his family used it!!!
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
Imagine not buying into the GOP strategy of everyone open schools so economy will be better in Oct so Trump can claim He Alone Can Fix It.
Curious how you know he didn't get it at the Trump rally. How do you know where he got it? Are you like one of those Dogs the Germans have trained to sniff out and identify people with COVID-19?
Did the right thing in 2016 and will do the right thing in 2020. TRUMP 2020
Typical trump.
Calling it the "Trump Virus" implies that he started it, and is responsible for the damage is causes. It should be referred to as "Wuhan", "Chinese", or "Democrat" virus.
He literally died because he went to a Trump rally and didn’t wear a mask he would still be alive had he not done that and Trump actually took Covid seriously but ok
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Makes me cry every time I hear him now. What a contrast between his moral leadership and Trump’s complete lack of it.

This!! I watched an interesting documentary last night re the takedown of the mafia. 1 segment talked at length how they had to “prove to the court” reasonable cause for a warrant &amp; what they went thru to get that proof. Which was a lot less than what’s known about Trump!
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He’ll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
Delaying the election is the least of my worries lol. Trump could theoretically make state legislatures bind electoral votes to him and SCOTUS could green-light it.

And every warning has fallen on deaf ears. And when state leaders actually try to do something useful to help, the Trump bunch cry out unconstitutional. It is so sadly stupid that anyone cares about those idiots.
Trump, no doubt
Trump 2020.  He does what is has promised.  Salute to the pres.  now if only the Republicans in Congress would step up their act.
I live in a suburb of Dallas. A blue collar suburb. We have quite a few low income housing complexes here. I live in an eclectic neighborhood of many races. My home values are fine and seeing an increase as opposed to going down. Trump is wrong.
In the last 24 hours Trump promoted segregation, the GDP is down 33%, he is pulling Troops out of Germany (you're welcome Putin) AND he wants to delay the election.    "Make other countries feel sorry for us" should be his new campaign slogan.
Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?

What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
Are you sure?  It's possible Putin's English is better than Trump's. ;-)
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.

Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.

... cowards or taking an anti-Trump position? ... almost certainly both ...
Yes, vote for Biden to turn us back to the conditions that created Trump in the first place just so he can say he supports these progressive policies, only to do nothing about them.  We had one chance to crush facism in this country, and you centrists dropped the ball.
This is one of the scariest things I have seen Trump tweet...and that is saying a lot.
Just another sellout Black azzzh01e being paid to suppress Black support of President Trump what a disgrace
Marco Rubio is a spineless coward and a yesman of a politician, unworthy of public office.   Not only has he debased himself for Trump, he KNOWINGLY allowed Covid to ravage Floridians in exchange for temporary political expedience.   Vote lil Marco out.
Trump seems to think he can delay elections. Throw this guy out of office already.
I think we all knew that was coming next from trump. He is more authoritarian and delusional every day. Early voting for the Nov election starts 13 Oct in TX. #NovemberIsComing
This dude is the  “rapid response” director Lolololol   Hard to believe Trump is polling so badly with online representation like this
Nah, Trump supporters are NOT that way at all
It’s up to Congress not Trump
This is called Projection!! They call him a “Racist” daily. With Zero proof!! They project what they are!! Who got Criminal Justice Reform done? Opportunity Zones? Record funding to Black Colleges? Trump did! He is the worst “Racist” ever!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  #MAGA
Biden tells donors: I’m going to get rid of most of Trump’s tax cuts ‘and a lot of you may not like that’
cannot believe anymore that United States of America has so many idiots in Congress. 😀 Hopefully, an exposure by Trump presidency is a big time Wake up call.  We  shall Judge on Nov 2020, how America has Wake up or still America are in deep sleep. God helps.
I disagree, to every Trump supporter, the election is November 15th now.
Hey  as your constituent, I'm curious to know whether you believe it is appropriate for President Trump to float the idea of delaying the election.  I'll hang up and listen.
I wonder who will replace you in a few months. I wonder why y’all never stay long. Trump talks about bring in more jobs but he’s fired more people in his administration than has ever been in all administrations combined so who be  number 9,997.
Must be true. Look at Trump
It been very enjoyable to watch the #Mars2020 launch, so tired of corona and Trump 24/7
Just what PUTIN desires. Trump has to listen to his boss man.
BLM GROUPS HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EXCEPT FURTHER DISTANCING ALL THE YEARS OF PROGRESS MADE BY ALL PEOPLE BLACK AND WHITE WHO STRIVED FOR A BETTER AMERICA. BUT AMERICAS LEADERS WHO HATE TRUMP FORMED" SYSTEMIC RACISM" IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN AMERICA AT ALL COST. WAR!
This is odd logic as it's QUITE EASY to confirm the violence going on in democratic states, it's pretty laughable really how everyone ignores it cause they hate the orange man so bad, theyd willingly become vassals like good sheep so they are spared. Bad trump bad!!
Demagoguery: ‘Conservative’ Warns Us That Trump Wants to Be a Dictator
Opponents spinning wheels   They say he serves Putin, risks Germany.  Then mock Trump 'he only moved them to Poland' like its a fake draw down well if the troops R still nearby how can one argue that it puts Europe at risk?  when you get to be prez YOU can decide where to deploy

"45"? Secret fans of Trump, are they? Bawahaha!
I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.
If you're ever in far north Dallas, there's a house on the Dallas side of Coit between Arapaho and Campbell with Confederate flags and a giant Trump sign. Can't miss it. 🤮
I'm in west Plano and I've seen three Trump flags. No yard signs for either candidate but I'm sure that's due to HOA restrictions. We aren't putting any Biden signs in our yard; 2020 is so crazy that we don't want to be a target.
Isn’t president trump still in office for ALL of his transgressions? Or we’re not ready for that convo
Do you not realize who Ronald Reagan was? He was just as racist as Donald Trump if not worse
No, you're not the only one, Monica. This is just one of Trump's peculiarities that I do not like or understand. Another example, if he knew HCQ cured Covid-19 way back in March, shouldn't he by EO mandated it's usage and saved many of the seniors' lives?
The test he took was a dementia test, and said the questions about months was the hardest... Trump has an equal amount of scandals. Just know, I hate Biden just as much as you do if not more, both are horrible for the country and all around horrible people.
Bluer areas are near the border more than ever now cause Trump's put them through so much shit.
Our country is divided but not defeated. We really need to pull together and tell Putin that we don’t want a country like his and  run Trump out of our white house
Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
The wall, what he's doing at the border, which is effecting nearby towns like Laredo. Also, rural Texans benefited the most from Obamacare, which is a pretty bad system, but not as bad as Trump makes it seem. etc.
Sure thing boss.
Sad selfish sick sociopaths. I do not receive unemployment benefits but people shouldn't have to go to work and die for non of your funky jobs let Trump and Pence do a honest living.

Kamala Harris Claims President Trump's “Secret Police” Will Steal the Election
Exactly what Russia wants! Trump is making deposit for some election assistance
Absolutely I am better off now than 4 years ago and if those people feel all Trump supporters are racist then they need to step back or sit down and have a true conversation with me.  But I know most are TDS sufferers so that won’t happen.

How do you see the future of America? Are you praying that Trump will save you? He’ll be gone in four years. Then what will you do? Find another savior? Or finally wake up and start saving the country yourself?
I just chipped in to boost voter turnout with
That’s why Trump thinks people will cheat on them... It’s how he does his taxes.
Trump's already taken care of that. 155,000 dead Americans and counting. 40 million lost jobs. Trillions in new debt. No strategy, no plan, promoting fake cures. Now go inject your Lysol.
Every day I read profiles that include the word conservative yet the timeline is constantly begging the government to do something. Do you realize that means you’re not really a conservative? The only thing I want Trump to do is do his job. Jail lawbreakers. All lawbreakers.
Now do Trump.
If God's in control, he hates Trump
If Trump wins this election, either by fair or dishonest means, the dollar will crash and we will be done for as a world power. Standard of living will drop. Alt-reality will be here to stay.
The more and more these undocumented people riot and protest, only makes me vote for Trump even more.
Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's wet dream.  He bows in submission to Putin, giving him ANYTHING he wants.    One of Russia's greatest wishes has been the withdrawal of Americans from our European allies.  Putin's slave (Trump) is withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.
So long as you act (in your daily life) like your views and your values don’t matter, guess what’s going to happen? They’re going to be ignored. People are filled with frustration over all the evil stuff going on, yet the knee-jerk reaction is to beg Trump to do something.
I'm assuming your talking about trump not being able to hold a coherent conversation.  He starts talking then rambles on and on all over the place and says nothing. #NobodyLikesTrump #VoteBlue
I fully expect him to end a press conference with a thumbs up and say "Vote Trump 2020"
Imagine paying the same for Trump’s roundtable as he paid for stormy Daniels’ silence.
She’s trying to talk shit about us for hating Trump but then she ends up blocking us! Makes sense
Trump’s acceptance is not required.    Of all Trump’s tricks, his best is to get his opposition to defend a corrupted system. By saying he won’t automatically accept the results of the election, his opponents commit to defending the election results if there is interference.The man who murdered Garrett Foster was named Daniel Perry. He was a fascist who worshipped Trump.  #GarrettFoster #RestInPower
trump did?
Donald Trump lowkey an asshole tbh something about the dude gives me bad vibes
Not a Biden supporter, not a Trump supporter for sure.  Wasn't a big fan of Obama or George W. But got damn I'd take those two back in a heart beat over what we got now.
ok but like rush the White House like y’all did Area 51 to see Trump shit on himself gun girl style
Trump: yes
I see the article I read it but it's all fake &amp; trump made them do it. (sarcasm) sad that I have to label it
Some good news! Public charge is one of the main reason immigrant families fear applying for government programs, but its good to hear that Judge George Daniels is protecting immigrant families in the time they need help the most!
&amp; to think one time I dated a trump supporter, how embarrassing
Last I checked it wasn’t April 1st. Stoping joking around Trump. lol #biden2020
Never in our nation’s history has an election been postponed, let alone has a delay been proposed by a sitting president. It’s evident, now more than ever, that Trump is a threat to our democracy.
The army knows about the bounties put on their heads by Putin. Trump has done nothing. They will not play along.
some guy added me on snap and the first thing I see on his story is “all lives matter, trump is a g.o.a.t., covid is a hoax, etc all in one post ? papa you gotta go, i’m concerned for you 🤣
Hmmmm I think it would be more fair to criticize individual states, as stated have a great deal of autonomy in the US. (No, I'm not a Trump fan)
Herman Cain died from corona virus be caught from going to this very rally. God people aren’t just against trump just cus he’s a republican he’s legitimately making his followers ignore reason and facts.
and #trump's dad should have pulled out, or his mom should have 🪠🚽
Cain was part of the the corrupt Federal Reserve System, and his 9-9-9 was a gimmicky selling point that would have likely increased the national debt.  The extent to which I see some NeverTrumpers acclaim him suggests to me they would support Trump if only he was a nicer grifter

Must be a repuke.  You have no faith in the working people.  The cheaters and low lifes are people like tRump.  Can't even show his taxes.  Go ahead build the FBI building near his hotel.  Don't help the people who need help. What is wrong with you.
That is true. That's why there are a lot of Bernie and Trump supporters I suppose.   But I mean at that age children are especially susceptible. Children mimic.  It's what they do. We unlearn stuff when we become adults.

Yes,  Democrats care about people. Trump, Mnuchin, Pence never have.
Ask a Trump supporter why they support Trump and I promise you they can’t even come up with 3 solid reasons
I don’t know who needs to hear this but just  because someone happens to have a differing opinion than you...   ...😱doesn’t mean they’re an actor from a different country trying to make sure Trump gets re-elected. 😱
I can’t believe this virus handed Trump the ability to really pull through and trust experts and probably do a lot of good and he just ignored it. He could’ve been the hero he wants us to think he is but he just fucking DIDNT.
Trump really ran a ad that showed buildings on fire, looting, and protest claiming that to be Biden’s America when that’s his America rn.😂🧐

Funny. Trump was taken to court &amp; sued for not letting Black people live in his housing. Obama actually attended a church every week. Trump golfs every week. Obama wasn’t perfect—but he didn’t kill hundreds of thousands of people in the US b/c he closed down a pandemic team.

That's how I feel about Trump. Ugh.

Aren’t the states meant to stand on there own in the writing of the constitution also a action in New York State cannot be the same action in New Mexico due to population medical facilities etc. If trump had written rules from the office he would be called dictator.
why did you whiff on the opportunity to ask trump to legalize sports betting in all 50 states you coward. it was right there for the taking and you blew it!
If trump thinks being sick isn’t an important statistic and only death toll matters then he should pay for all the funerals that are happening due to his negligence. And if not, he should pay for the hospital bills for those who are sick.

and yes protests and rioting are different so please explain to me how and why the police (who are under trump) are getting away with these crimes of killing and injuring civilians.
this is occurring under trump though. trump also has evidence of being involved in a sex trafficking ring (predominantly minors), while also being openly racist calling covid 19 the “chinese virus”and banning hospitals from releasing covid numbers. i’m not for biden but come on.

It Trump crazy!!!
Yeah, Trump and the Republicans  would NEVER do that right?🤣🙄
trump: "we need to delay the election because the mail in votes won't be counted accurately"  also trump: fucks up USPS so that mail votes cannot be processed adequately  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
So the WH sent NOBODY to attend the service for John Lewis?! And you still support this VOMIT in our WH?! Will Trump and you be at the service fir Herman Cain??  Of course WITHOUT a mask?!! A POX on you!!  Curse you!!
Trump raises idea of delaying election
That’s the go to defense. Until Trump reiterates it the next day and says he “ never jokes” .
If you guys can, plz listen to Obama’s Eulogy for John Lewis. He did a wonderful job and without naming Trump he destroyed him. Americans are smart and they understand the theology of George Wallace being applied by Trump in 2020. Hope, to see the landslide victory of Joe Biden.

Hey trump, therapist call what you’re doing... Deflection
Heard about Herman Cain? Will you at least now soften your stance, stop blindly hugging that trash Trump in our WH, stop the disinformation about masks?  Even now? Or ... ?
LOL 😂   Trump knows full well it won’t be delayed... took news attention off a number of issues today and put focus on mail-in voter fraud...  Items off screen now.. - terrible 2Q GDP... -8% Q over Q - 1.2 mil unemployment claims  - Rep Lewis funeral w/ former presidents there
JFC they even made him as orange as Trump for the pic.😳
There's also a pretty big difference between a protestor willing to put his life ‘on the line’ for a cause... and a molotov cocktail throwing asshole willing to put *your* life ‘on the line’ because he doesn't like Trump.
Definitely wishful thinking on his part. Just like a vaccine is, though I hope it happens. I was never a supporter of the Trump/Fauci approach. I preferred the Sweden approach that kept everything open. I believe this new virus was unstoppable but not as dangerous as advertised.
Decency that transcends partisanship Trump won’t even unveil Obama’s portrait.
Faucci getting First Pitch and his approval ratings gnaws at Trump. I hope this sound of homage haunts him for ever.

Great man. He was a formal GOP presidential candidate in 2012. Liberals and the media destroyed his chances and also accused him of rape. He’s also President Trump’s strong supporter
I would like the WH reporters to ask Trump to name one thing he has done that has not helped Putin. It the one predictable thread running through his presidency.

I watch Russian Television english here in Europe because I at least know it is negative and anti-american and why. Russian TV reporters present Trump as a racist and xenophobe. They also consider #russiagate a farce. I see no good relationship there.
MSM obscures his addiction (“President Trump appeared tired today, speaking slowly, sniffing”). A man prone to rages, can launch nuclear weapons at any time w/no outside approval, unchallenged by Congress, spends his day ‘self-medicated’ —stoned, high.
It takes a special kind of stupid to not see and understand the amazing things that are being done under the Trump Administration!
This is a better discription of candidates and delegates won. This is a few months old already. Trump has about half rep. Delegates and Biden not even 25% of his party.

Yeah, cause it’s Trump &amp; his supporters who are actively destroying the USPS. 🙄
the video clip was about Germany. Also, Trump has been sanctioning them, funding the Ukraine military against them and building up military presence against them here in Europe. The #russiagate has already been proven a corrupt plot by Democrats, and fake.
The strange thing is that mainstream media only covered the democrats primaries. Trump also beat other republicans. Now, they polls mostly sample democrat voters so you don't get a real quality poll, it is BIASED. Like most of you. I guess u need the lies.
I followed the primaries closely. Had democrats and independents united they would have had about as many as Trump, but they didn't and Trump had double the delegates of the 'best' democrat.
When you take a historical Christian statement of belief and replace God or Jesus with “America” or “Donald Trump” you are commiting idolatry. Full stop. Dont pretend to be a Christian if you really worship and trust in a nation or a politician.
Anyone is better than trump.  I think Biden is a good man.
Rudy - It is a shame that at the end of your career people will remember you for your insane tweets and behavior rather than the good deeds you have done, because you had no guts to stand up to a corrupt human being, Trump.
OK, you don’t have school-going children. Then why don’t you send your daughter to Uncle Louie Gohmert’s place for a long weekend?! You can all hug and then can have a Mask-burning party, with Trump in the background. Bast—d! Filth! Curse you!
The man insulted your wife and family and you stand with him.. Mitt Romney the only Republican that ain't scared of Trump!!
Everything is in superlatives for you. Your are pathetic. Your narcissism is sickening. You’re actually the WORST person to ever occupy the WH. We’re praying for your end. Perish! Shame we lose good people daily. God, when will Trump end?!
I swear I want to get rid of Ted Cruz cock sucking ass more than Donald Trump mayonnaise eating ass!!
I wish you keep your integrity and honesty to improving immunity and enlightening all about it, instead supporting anything that Trump agrees to blindly. You are much smarter and more human than that
Just because Trump does, it’s not expected that you’ve to support. You are a scientist. I’ve known about death of a few due to heart attack for trying HCQ. Pls stop promoting it. It may cure, but side effects r dangerous. Fauci is in the US, but even other nations don’t allow

Legislators are just that, legislators. I know, many were lawyers in their previous life. But if the Democrats are serious about preserving our democracy, they need to recognize that this is a fight that Trump, Barr, et al. fully intend to win: by whatever crime necessary.  11/12
And find a way around the 5 minute rule! Yes, Dem Reps scored some "hits", got Barr to squirm a bit, but SO WHAT? To me, this political theatre, this trolling contest, suggests that the Democrats don't really have a plan on how to take on Barr, Trump, et al. Dems: just vote! 9/12
There's no question that Barr is Trump's Roy Cohn, and that Barr has turned the DoJ into a law office with one client: Donald Trump. The question is, WTF to do about it? There is no doubt as to Barr's criminality, and the risk to an election less than 3 months away is high. 4/12
3. Removal of a prosecutor investigating Trump family crime 4. Lying about the Mueller report 5. Spreading lies concerning Russian election interference, vote-by-mail, suppression of Black voters 6. Investigating Trump's political rivals 3/12

I certainly hope so Kathy. Probably no one else has done as much damage to overall tenor of debate in world's "greatest deliberative body", maximizing polarization, political cynicism, disaffection: all of the ills that ultimately set the stage for Trump. Simply because he could.
Because it’s clear the entire issue page is gone because as literally every campaign in history has done, they’re refocusing for the general election. Has nothing to do with Trump. Doesn’t take a brainiac to figure that one out.

The same doctor who believes ailments are caused by sex in dreams with demon spirits...and our medicine comes from alien DNA... this is who Trump trusts over Fauci? Makes perfect sense to me. Good luck.
Yes he does, and sadly many women don’t like Trump only because they don’t see him as “kind, nice, compassionate”... They refuse to look at his policies, and how much Americans, including them, have benefited from his policies.
Thus is the way a effing self-centered, petulant child talks: “why don't I have a high approval rating ...”. Trump's rant displays the emotional development of a five-year-old.
Trump said this 4 months ago before this was popular
Sen Schumer;  How many times do you want me to tell you that President Trump doesn’t make the decision for anyone to be tested for COVID. It’s Upto the the respective State Governors to decide. For your test you want Trump to decide? OR you do it in NY OR DC

In this case it is. The reason this was possible is because Trump threw out the oversight committee. Imagine leaving an armored car on the street with no guards.

Anything less than the current disaster is acceptable. Just wait until Trump's idiocy affects you...your tune will change, Romney.
I think a lot of people support Trump cause they are tired of lifelong Politicians. No reason for people to be in Washington 20 years and average person having to work two jobs just to live. Democratic Party needs to find someone not a “Politician”
Kristie, The only time the Dems open their mouths at all is when it is an Anti-Trump smear.  The Dems are power hungry for a New World Order BUT they will NOT have the opportunity unless God Almighty allows it! Trump WILL win re-election!!!!!!!
This is what Trump does. Puts the shittiest person possible in charge of an agency then destroys it from within. See Betsy DeVos, Department of Education.

And they continue blaming the cause for the spread of the virus on President Trump. I guess people are so self centered and not concerned about spreading it to others including their loved ones.
As Eric and I said before this came out .. Trump had his best week of of consistant critical thinking messaging on the big issues ever.  Best favorability ratings (likely not registered voters) in months. Focused, consistent messsging on the big issues works!

Aah - you took the blue pill.  Not very effective claims on a day Trump suggested delaying the election and falsely claimed that the country had universal mail-in elections (something other than absentee ballots). Sorry, can't return a "nice" try, your response is just a.... try.
She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.
I feel like trump is doing that for votes. Not because he cares... 😕😕
Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.

Fool us once in 2016, shame on them.  Fool us twice in 2020, shame on us. We live in crazy times, but everyone should know by now Trump isn't above the lowest forms of cheating. He's a zero sum gamer.
Trump and Barr are openly laying the ground work to contest the election. Barr's even raising the specter of "foreign interference" with suspicious ballots. We've been down this road before - this time Barr's sending out the signals for help. Trump's not going quietly.

Literally they are actively trying to defund both even more right now
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that’s cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ⅓ on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
I know, but that message doesn't get the same sort of backlash. Lord knows it *should*, but saying that sort of thing won Trump an election.   Also, Barr know that if there's no election by January 20, it'l be President Patrick Leahy.

Meanwhile I found this pic of you at a Trump rally maskless with your culty friends!
We love and support you Trump!! Some of us know the truth!!
This is an issue because Trump's polling numbers are terrible. He's  trying to use the expected rise in absentee ballots due to Covid-19 (no one knows what the # will be) to shovel conspiracy theories. This time he has Barr helping to peddle the theories.
We will never see trump in pictures like these

In Florida—supposedly Trump’s home state—there is no such thing as “absentee voting.” Any registered voter can request a mail-in ballot.
I would have said Trump before this month but the economy and Corona are tanking his numbers with the "people who don't study or know shit about politics but still vote" demographic.
Each quarter, President Trump donates 100% of his $100,000 salary to various charities.  Note: His salary is $400,000 per year.
if you dare, make list of things you hate about Trump then check it for truth. How much do you love the politicians that lied to us all for decades?
Wasn't paying attention during first three years?
The only issue for Trump is poor polling numbers. So, he's trying to take advantage of the rise in Covid-19 related absentee ballots to push conspiracy theories. This time he'll have Barr helping to shovel instead of Roger Stone.
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
C'mon, Bill.  Surely, by now, you know President Trump is trolling the Democrats and the MSM just to get them riled up. And, they are taking the bait.  Besides, there's gonna be a red tsunami on November 3rd.  🇺🇸
A Pence rally.....lol man let me know if I'm wrong, but did Presidents and VPs have rallies like this when they were supposed to be working before Trump? Before him, I'd never heard of Presidents having rallies.
It’s interesting, some of the similarities between Obama and Trump.  Obama was re-elected, Trump was impeached.  Obama kept many of his Cabinet members, Trump is running out of people to replace his Cabinet members.  Trump is orange, Obama is black.  “Similarities” may not apply.
You and trump are the frauds.
Also, even if he didnt (which, again, the evidence and timeline points to) many did:
Perhaps President Trump should suggest that ALL VOTING BE DONE BY MAIL! Then the Dimocrats would insist that ALL VOTING BE IN PERSON!!!!

Trump won’t be delivering his eulogy. I’m not sure he’ll even attend the funeral.
Another lie.  Health  policy experts say Trump’s deal will likely offer patients only minimal relief and may take months to implement, if they're implemented at all.
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there’s that.
Trump says Trump is trying to delay the election. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Tomi please Trump said the virus is a hoax  . Trump waited to long to to something about it . And the real ass kicker is he tries to make Fauci the scapegoat for his ignorance ,I’m sorry but get your complaints ready for Biden .thats my final thought
Even this despicable excuse for a human agrees that Trump is full of shit when it comes to his election bitching.
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. 🤣
I’m more furious than sad. This black man towing the Anti Mask line for Trump and Trump ain’t going to even give a f—- about him. Less than two weeks after being at the Trump Tulsa rally he contracts Coronavirus.   You really hate to see it. I’m so angry. Sorry for the rant.
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his “joke” about injecting people with bleach. He wasn’t joking.
It's not. Trump reads polls. Re-election is all that matters to him.
Wow. Trump was leading
I doubt it, I don’t see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can’t glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should’ve learned.
You don't want to give relief to the American people. You want to protect Trump's interests and the interests of your donors. Spare us.
They got caught. Thus disproving it’s widespread and undetectable as Trump says.

Just imagine if Trump handled COVID competently. He'd reap political rewards. Now he displays what his sole concern has always been -- re-election.

Yes it is so vote for Trump!
The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.
Donald Trump pays zero attention at all though I’ll have to say there’s not too many people out there that can manage and fully understand what’s going on in a company which does retail, steaming video, and corporate IT.

The interview with Jonathan Swan strongly suggests that Trump is in thrall to Putin. Eight phone calls to Putin in short order and no mention of Russia supplying the Taliban with arms and paying them to kill American soldiers? Something is rotten in the White House.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

Given your OP-ed from April excoriating Biden for suggesting Trump would do exactly what he did today (try to delay an election) , I'd say your crystal ball is awfully wonky...

I agree. I never said our past presidents weren’t bad. I think they were but like you said no president has been so openly racist homophobic and ignorant its dangerous to have a president that’s acts the way he does so like I said not voting is essentially voting for trump imo
Think again. A cough or sneeze actually disperses the virus up to 12 feet. But enjoy the covid and trumps witch doctor
Trump don’t care he’s rich people steadily getting laid off because of his slow actions at the start of this virus
Yes. The (looney tunes) Nobel Peace Prize for Obama in 2009 was a “thank god, you guys aren’t totally insane after all” moment. By 2021, there are two scenarios: a rampant Trump, or a hobbled Biden Administration. America will be deeply diminished in either case.
Ultimately, trump is so predictable now. All we have to do is think of the worst possible action/statement he can make... and sure as shit..  9 times out of 10.. he’s doing it.
There is going to be a point where people start to make a calculation and break from Trump... hopefully this might be what Chad is doing here
Hey yall dont forget, conservatives are not hateful. This is me and a Trump loving 16 year old. He asked me if we could switch hats. And of course said, "Yes." I am gay and he supports me. This is why I am conservative.
For those of you who still have questions about the November elections being delayed in November, the NYT has published a great article answering questions. The firewall is five free articles per month so even w/o subscription you may be able to read.
It looks like  finally found the Pizzagate party he was looking for. Trump's own lawyer.
Does #Directive51 allow Trump to delay the election? I'd rather do that than allow the Dems to steal an election with voter fraud.  After 2016 #ObaMAGAate we know there is nothing they won't do.     via
How many votes kept the Dictator-in-Chief in power and not even have a trial about his abuse of power?  Now he's suggesting a delaying the election? (pffffff) You dont want election day to be a federal holiday and the POTUS wants to delay it!
President Trump is still in office, so I don’t comprehend what you mean? Unless you’re referring to Pres Obama who illegally spied on Pres Trump during the campaign.
A statement without corresponding evidence is an assertion. Prove Trump has never made such a misstatement...
You left out the Demons and Witches f-ing us while we sleep.  A terrible happening which she just happens to have the cure for, the alien DNA injections.  Hey, if Trump supporters want to let her inject them w alien DNA, it's fine w me.
Obviously. We are all in agreeance. Now back to the facts. Who is guilty?! Yes we know the Clintons. I guess we will see about Trump. Nothing yet.
Trump's goal is to dominate the news. It doesn't matter how or how outrageous. The more the better.  Stop repeating it. Just stop.
Where is trump name?
Pres. Trump ends housing rule, tenants may now face eviction amid COVID-19 pandemic
Anything to see here?
perfect choice considering his past as well but having trump as a president for another 4 years shouldn’t even be an option. Anyone not voting is a vote for trump in my opinion but to each their own I can see why people wouldn’t want to vote but I still think it’s very important
I’ve got news for Trump. America has WAY more decent people, inclusive, talented people, than the shitty, evil, corrupt, racist tribe he subscribes to. We out number him &amp; We Will Vote! Pack your bags Orange Asshole #NobodyLikesTrump #WeWillVote
I don’t think his people are smart enough. He should do something for the Bernie supporters at times in the 2016 race Trump said things to make them them; As the election gets closer I’m sure he will talk about Biden being establishment and talk about trade and other issues
Yeah so  was the guy who didn’t even think we should look into Trump’s actions that led to impeachment so his claims to care about our democracy ring pretty fucking hollow.
Thought there was asymptomatic exposure. I am not sure where you live but we are not the same as trump. We don’t get tested, we don’t get immediate results, and we aren’t full of shit like you are.
Nah, he just makes up countries like Nambia. Trump transcripts are gibberish.  Also willing to bet your assertion is incorrect.
the thing is like this works though moderate republicans just want trump w/o the uh more erratic parts of his admin
Can’t he stay in the Trump Hotel? 🤷🏻‍♂️

It's not demon sperm.  It's demon semen.  For Trump, saying it that way rolls off the tongue better
Donald Trump want me go home
Trump suggesting the election should be elected is the perfect example of instances where Republicans need to push back on this. This is America dammit we are having an election in November! #Election2020
He did but Trump had an announcement to make at the same exact time the eulogy was going on
treasonous trump the shithearted incestuously inclined traitor won't let anything happen to dersh because he could tell more about his sleaze than even the guy with nixon tattooed on his back.
😂😂😂😂😂you see nothing wrong with trump words OK 11/03/20 can’t get here fast enough!!!
These men were/are real leaders. They are nothing like Traitor Trump.
We haven’t heard the last of this
I just need to like all these tweets saying Trump will win.  Finna drink these tears
Of course not. #FakeNews makes it all better for you. You want to debate things regarding Trump but fail to see how #FakeNews has been playing you for a chomp all these time. Now I know you never knew this was never revealed by your #FakeNews  sources🤷‍♂️
barr won't let treasonous trump the shithearted, incestuously inclined, traitor, rapist, pedophile, coward, and conman be implicated legally in anything. barr has to fall with or before dump.
Not much on Trump, and he cooperated with the FBI when they were looking into this case. But maybe you know why Ellen's tv set looked a lot like the temple on Epstein island
so just let trump get re-elected??? No
Not wishing death or anything but I don’t think trump will be alive in a decade
Apparently Trump has told Rudy that he will be pardoned. Otherwise he would not dare stick his head up.
Trump is truly insane, that’s murderous madness.
How’s that saying go, not everyone that voted for trump is a racist but every racist voted for trump.
Nancy your are talking about that group of people!  The working class are Trump supporters
So, if you are I’ll with Covid symptoms and can’t return to work, or if you have been laid off and can’t afford your rent, Trump can dial up his “ICE machine” to descend upon you with rubber bullets and pepper spray.  He will cage our children if you protest about eviction.
OMG SAME I WAS SO SAD WHEN I UNFOLLOWED HER BC I LIKED HER SM BUT LIKE FUCK TRUMP YA KNOW
These people must have all gone to tRump University. BankruptRus
I don't get the adoration of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He got cozy with the Kennedys for political clout, cheated on his wife and got the maid pregnant, and is known to be an awful person for other reasons, too. Just because he dislikes Trump doesn't make him a hero.

Peter Strzok said "no way he gets elected but we can't take that risk"  which meant there was a definite plan to prevent Trump from winning. If it failed they wanted Plan B to stop it. Why are Strzok &amp; others not in jail yet? When Democrats go after Repub's they don't waste time.
Trump was so unpopular it made no sense he won but let's not let it happen again. Also let's take back the Senate. Vote Blue.
Y’all say all this and then tell folk vote or die when their options are Trump or Biden 🙃
Imagine what would happen if we had a Senator from TX who didn’t spew lies to dupe Trump’s cult.   Why did Trump repeatedly call you Lying Ted Cruz?
Turn off Fake News....Trump is getting ready to drain the swamp like you cannot imagine....Coming FISA indictments=START to #ObamaGate  failed coup conspirators are going down...Goodbye Hussein, goodbye Hillary and ALL of the rest of the TRAITORS. Enjoy the show!

That’s complete nonsensical lies, but Trump is so delusional he may even believe his own lies.
Well that’s true, but only because Trump thought he has been campaigning this whole time instead of actually being the president...
Sorry if this offends you, but Obama is trash. Total scumbag.
But then you conveniently ignore the lawless Barr that is making a mockery of justice. Looking forward to see you gone, almost as much as seeing the fat ass of Trump booted out.
And here I thought Trump's Tweets were going to be the dumbest crap I'd read on Twitter today. Scooter here is making a late push...
Trump went to NJ and didn’t quarantine. He golfed with Favre and sent out pictures. Trump set the example.
I care ABOUT our POLICE! If you think this Republican is voting for trump,... Guess Again; Look out the window into Trump's America! For God's sake it a NIGHTMARE!
It’s the lawful thing to do, when the government is a lawless corrupt DOJ with Barr, giving special treatment to those that coverup to protect Trump.

I don't think 11 Trump hotels would be a "large hotel chain".
Owner of a large hotel (Donald Trump) Jeffrey Epstein  Alan Dershowitz  Maxwell Ghislaine Prince Andrew Bill Clinton  Bill Barr Both redacted and interacted co and conspirators should be prosecuted.
Remember how they tried to make us feel bad for Dick Cheney's equally evil but more cowardly daughter cause her lord Trump turned on her? Respectability for them, corporate war and exploitation for everyone else
if you watch filthy rich, you'd see that trump cut ties with epstein over a decade ago. he used to be in the club, for intel. you can't get information on people if they don't trust you to share it.
After watching the speakers today sending off our patriot   I know our nation is better and stronger than Trump and his administration. Our VOTE MATTERS - every citizen 18 and older has the obligation to cast a vote on November 3rd.
That is the question but I do think trump has put the gop on the midwest track.  Probably won't help in 2020.  But if the electoral college projections are to be believed Romney 2012 plus Florida 31 plus ohio 17 and iowa 5 is  mid 260s
“All these damn Trump bots!! 🤬🤬”  Y’all wanna tell em or should I?
Please do illustrate what this has to do with Trump, dummy. Yeesh you people are fucking ridiculous.
Its amazing how much they will defend Trump and make an ass of themselves in the process.
It time to throw in the towel Trump, Resign before the American People throw you out of office
She might not since her term ends January 3rd. I like &amp; respect Speaker Pelosi, but if trump's enablers continue to do their best to destroy the country...
I’m pissed off I’m not a Democrat I know other conservatives that don’t like this tweet I know other Trump supporters that don’t like it
Trump does not care and he never will.
Openly rooting for a pandemic that destroyed our economy is a real good look for this pud  and the rest of  folks. Well done. Must be nice not worrying about a job or paying bills. You really owned Trump.
Trump the clown!
Hahahaha it’s true a lot of accounts going after trump because this guy was his lawyer on the impeachment trial , but not even one word about Clinton , or not even mention that Dershowitz has always been a democrat
Yea it was fun for a while but that kid madly in love with trump cant reason with stupid cant argue with ignorant.
We now face a huge increase in unemployment and the lowest GDP in history. This is as bad or worst than the GREAT DEPRESSION! All caused by Trump!
Reminder , he has always been a democrat , just changed to trump impeachment team because he said it was a total hoax (it was ) always was non sense that impeachment , but he is against trump he even campaigned against trump , you can’t make it up #ClintonCrimeFamily
I think Pelosi should impeach Trump on his failures with Coronavirus.   But we know she won't do that.
Trump doesn't understand science or economics. #TrumpHatesScience
Anyone else catch the part where Trump isn't a wannabe dictator because he hasn't tried to curtail free press or try to arrest political opponents...  Sometimes I feel like Trump thumpers simply refuse to pay attention, bc it's the only way to say this shit with a straight face.
Eeee he is a Democrat and the one mentioned on the documents is Clinton , no trump . Sorry you can’t make it up
True but the safer choice is biden imo hes the more likely to get trump out of office and for that reason alone he has my vote tbh
Save lives from the Trump Virus! The Trump virus and Trump’s  late response and saying the virus was gone and telling people to go back to normal has caused record number of cases and a rising death toll!!
Dearest Joe, PLEASE HAMMER HOME that IF trump's SO determined to send children to school with NO SAFETY measures in place, then why is he so determined to undermine &amp; delay the election? Open Schools. VOTE! He's scared shitless! My name's Beverly; I approve this tweet!
i'm not gonna spoon feed information when everyone has the same access to the internet as i, but here's something to start  #KeepTexasRed
Buying stamps is not going to help save the USPS. The postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, is a Republican newly appointed by Trump and he is following Trump's orders to slow the mail.   DeJoy is more loyal to Trump than he is to America.
150,000+ dead americans, 30 million unemployed. You have to be unpatriotic and hate america to vote for trump. Clearly isn’t fit for office.
It's very sad that trump promised the Guillen family financial help to bury their daughter.  We ALL know that was a damn lie.
And you know Trump personally to make such an accusation?
- Trump writes an epitaph for Herman Cain. Makes it about himself. On brand.
TRUMP's determined to SEND KIDS TO SCHOOL, so WHY DELAY THE ELECTION? He's terrified his corruption is UP! My name is Beverly &amp; I approve this tweet.
lol, yall can impeach Trump 100x wont change a thing, or stop him
trump has done more for the black community than any other president other than abe. libs are making them feel oppressed for why? they're not. he's created millions of jobs, stocks and 401k have sky rocketed, he's providing other opportunities like low income areas, nasa, korea
The reality, however, is that no single physical barrier can completely stop smugglers; even CBP officials acknowledge that! The smugglers have also started tunnels under the wall! So much for Trump’s wall that he bragged was impenetrable😂😂😂😂!!
Apparently Trump partied with Nicole a lot like this pic
He used to be better, but he's become an abject weasel when "interviewing" Trump surrogates. He just lets them yammer on, spouting the conspiracy theory or lie du jour, without challenging obvious falsehoods. That is not journalism...
Nah joe biden weird af too but theres no way trump is the better candidate so out of the two evils hes the better choice.
So far Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, Clinton are listed.... waiting for Trump to show up
The hype is real! Can’t wait to see which puppets are getting roasted all night and tomorrow morning! Expect to see Bill C., Hillary, Trump, Melania, Prince Andrew, Weinstein, Musk, Bill Gates, Bezos, Piers, Murdoch, Rothschilds, etc. on there. About time they all got arrested.
i don't trust liberals nor lefists. the riots are out of hand, they're destroying america. biden doesn't know what he's talking about ever, i mean i just watched a clip where he said "we should re-elect trump" ... nuff said.

You’re sick kid seek help i swear trump wont see this. You’re bent over backwards defending him and all up in my profile as well 🤣
Not as needy as You are to get Trump out of office. 😘 night night Toots
Only a Trump or  would praise  like this upon his death. Respect should be earned, not expected like Trump expects it.  While praise should be freely given, it must be sincere, not just lip service for an egomaniac.
I attend Trump rally and I have never seen KKK or Nazi flags.
Sandi, I find it very odd you promote yourself. If all roads lead to Trump, the evidence, PROVE IT. The Clintons have blood on their hands and incriminating evidence in stacks. Being in court as a crappy journalist means exactly that. Congrats on getting a glimpse of a pedophile.
If you’re going to be all over my media atleast drop a follow you fan. 🥱 type in “times trump has lied” and come back in a few hours once you read all 20,000+ lies they have recorded from him. #bot
Mr.President Trump，You are great ！
President Donald Trump promised that a wall on the border would radically change undocumented immigration and customs enforcement. The president's wall isn’t as sturdy as he promised: Smugglers have been using a commercial saw to cut through it!
Without Republican checks and balances Trump has a lot of power to use towards those cheating ends. And an equally corrupt lunatic in Barr.
I don’t worry about President Trump’s tweets!  That’s how America knows the truth of what is going on.  He keeps in touch with Americans, which is much more than I can say about the democrats.
This is Trump's equivalence of burning the place down because he knows he's going to lose, so he might as well take down-ballot Republicans with him. This is what a malignant narcissist does.
Trump has not removed Fauci because of the appearance, Trump knows Fauci is not being forthright on Hydroxy..it works, pandemic would be slowed to a crawl..but can’t let that happen until November..
Trump clearly would have done same in 2016 if he lost, he would have dragged it out for as long as he could get away with.
Ah, taking those same creative liberties with reality that your orange dream supreme is so fond of taking. That's okay, puddin' pop. Next time, I'll use much smaller words and speak slower for you. Anyone who can honestly continue to support Trump at this point ain't too bright.
From the doctor Trump called "an important voice": “Yes, I’m a demon buster. Yes, demons sleep with people,” said Stella Immanuel. “Yes, if you pray for them they get better.”
I dont waste my time with #bots go read the book or find an article you literally made an account to protect your lord and savior trump 😂 grow up kid
Trump’s praise genuinely makes me less interested in watching the playoffs. I was planning on take off from work early on Saturday to watch the games and I don’t know if I’m going to do that anymore.
Trump: It’s a liberal HOAX
Trump is not the one oppressing voters, that would be your party. Mail In elections would take our vote away.
I never really understood what Republicans were about until “the Trump “ took office. Now it all makes sense. If you want to be controlled in any way,your on the right, if you want to converse and gather opinions and debate the best outcomes your on the left.
Remember when Obama ran for president he said he would always be transparent? He lied. Trump is brazenly transparent and dems are too blind to appreciate it.
32.9, 60, 0 - 32.9% drop in the GDP; 60 seconds - yesterday, an American died every 60 seconds from the coronavirus; 0 - the number of times  stood up for our troops in his latest conversation with Putin. This is Trump’s  cc
The Democratic plan is no platform and I honestly don't blame them. Trump is burying himself daily without a target.
and what has #tRUmp done for his Afro-American...or any of them for that matter❓ Ask the young black woman at the mission is she better off now than she was 4 years ago❓ Even just 4 months ago❓ #VoteTrumpOut ‼️
A bunch of low lifes. Well everyone has a bottom except trump
Sorry to say this but this was the only mistake Trump period. Trusting this democrat RAT to be on his team.

I don’t think our society would be able to handle a Trump re-election 🥴 not in this tense ass social climate  Oh my.
Biden and Hillary have both absolutely nailed on the head the many problems Trump brings to democracy, but are discredited because they’re “just playing politics”
When are you going to stop writing pulp fiction opinion articles that you spin as being fact?  When are you going to realize that republican voters for trump are majorly underrepresented in sample polls compared to democrats?  When are you going to realize it's the media and folk
Real Republicans are not anti science. Uneducated idiots are anti science. Some of them seem to vote Republican because they think that Trump represents them. But no, Trump despises them, as he despises all other people. Give us back the real GOP. Intelligent and thoughtful.
A president is not supposed to try to push millions of people‘s buttons that’s not a presidential Trump said he could be presidential if he got elected. It’s not going to be funny if he loses to Biden
President Trump suggested this week the next coronavirus relief package could include a direct cash payment for American families that's potentially higher than $1,200.​

It wouldn’t matter. US congress sets the E day at a national level; meaning it has to be on the same day for everyone. States have no control. Undermining would be a crime. There would surely be court battles but I’m pretty sure; in the end, Trump would be removed by Inaug Day.
He pushed the idea that not wearing masks in public spaces was okay. Then he caught COVID at a Trump rally and died from it. He deserves zero sympathy
Both will have an asterisk by their awards. Just like their hero the impeached President Trump.*

It’s “impeached”. Why are all a trump supporters so terrible at English?
Haha a former president can’t be prosecuted by the senate, he can be prosecuted now.Haha it’s the opposite of Trump, who if he wasn’t president would already be arrested. If Barr has anything on him he would have arrested him. Not long till trump is arrested though. :). Fun fun

And replace him with who? The base will go nuts, scream about backstabbing RINOs, and they’ll lose even more spectacularly. Trump is the Albatross the GOP has superglued to its own neck.
I felt sorry for Trump at first. I really had never heard of him and didn't know anything about him. I had some hope even though I knew he would be a bad president, but I had no idea he was such a bad person. Now I feel nothing but disgust and loathing.
“Covid is fake”. It’s people like this that are going to say the election results are fake if Trump loses lol    hillary was right about ONE thing, the basket is real, deplorable do exist.  But just as many on the left.
Sadly that wouldn’t be a first for Trump.
It’s pretty silly. People listen to Trump and think voter fraud is a big deal. But it like never happens and even when it does it’s never a difference maker because it’s so minuscule
What specific crime? Still waiting on a trump fan to name a crime. Nobody can yet haha
Trump closed polling locations?
The consequence of lying all the time is that no one believes a damn thing you say.  NO message Trump puts out will him any good,
How much money has Trump paid himself through both campaigns? 100 million.

I think Trump tweeted today about postponing the election cuz he can’t stand NOT being the center of attention, to detract from John Lewis’ funeral with former Presidents in attendance. #TrumpsJealousOfObama
Please enlighten me... being honest, I don’t get what Trump was saying with his tweet. It seemed very odd to me, and not in a good way.
I can tell you all one damn thing, Obama’s political speech at the John Lewis funeral today didn’t chage my mind one bit: I WILL BE VOTING FOR DONALDJ. TRUMP! #MAGA
Trump ain’t coming to my house
This Republican politician was so proud to not wear a mask, and then caught COVID from a Trump rally event. Then DIED from it. #COVIDIOT  #covid #MaskUp #trumpsfault
Not sure self sabotage and immolation will get the results.  I mean trump can play the covid 19 martyrdom card.  I would have won if that damn virus.   But working to destroy the party is not good for the legacy
The sound of Freedom!! Trump 2020!!!!
The only reason they don’t go after Trump is because he has an R by his name and because he is white!
Wow. To see the way Trumpers frame things is repugnant. O stood and talked about issues Mr Lewis fought for his whole life, &amp; highlighted the Trump tragedy that he had to witness in his final years. John would have been smiling. He would have been proud. Tucker is scum.
Diagnosed with Covid 9 days after attending ⁦ Tulsa rally - no ⁦ it wasn’t the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2006.  Must you ALWAYS go to such extremes to defend Trump.

Once upon a time both of them I would've voted for thing is Trump knew that. He made sure they put their names behind him because his base is loyal. Same way he made governors praise him early on. So later he has a soundbite. Meanwhile 151,000 Americans dead. #TrumpFailedAmerica

Trump has done more for black people and HBCUs than John Lewis did in his 40 years of race baiting and Obama ran a crime riddled administration that we’re still trying to get to the bottom of but oh he is so elegant while telling his lies 🙄🤡 #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

I’m his boss, a constituent (not Trump), and I say, “NO. “
Saying that choosing between Biden and Trump is choosing the “lesser of two evils” is a dangerous and reckless assertion. It implies that the two evils, while different, are equal. They are not equal. There is a very clear right and wrong choice. Please speak intentionally.

Yes. The (looney tunes) Nobel Peace Prize for Obama in 2009 was a “thank god, you guys aren’t totally insane after all” moment. By 2021, there are two scenarios: a rampant Trump, or a hobbled Biden Administration. America will be deeply diminished in either case.
Ultimately, trump is so predictable now. All we have to do is think of the worst possible action/statement he can make... and sure as shit..  9 times out of 10.. he’s doing it.
There is going to be a point where people start to make a calculation and break from Trump... hopefully this might be what Chad is doing here

Yeah so  was the guy who didn’t even think we should look into Trump’s actions that led to impeachment so his claims to care about our democracy ring pretty fucking hollow.

You’re sick kid seek help i swear trump wont see this. You’re bent over backwards defending him and all up in my profile as well 🤣
Not as needy as You are to get Trump out of office. 😘 night night Toots
Only a Trump or  would praise  like this upon his death. Respect should be earned, not expected like Trump expects it.  While praise should be freely given, it must be sincere, not just lip service for an egomaniac.
I attend Trump rally and I have never seen KKK or Nazi flags.
Yeah unlike Trump who doesn’t give a shit
Come on Isaias Mar Largo is right in your path, show Trump what you think of him.
Sandi, I find it very odd you promote yourself. If all roads lead to Trump, the evidence, PROVE IT. The Clintons have blood on their hands and incriminating evidence in stacks. Being in court as a crappy journalist means exactly that. Congrats on getting a glimpse of a pedophile.
If you’re going to be all over my media atleast drop a follow you fan. 🥱 type in “times trump has lied” and come back in a few hours once you read all 20,000+ lies they have recorded from him. #bot
Mr.President Trump，You are great ！
President Donald Trump promised that a wall on the border would radically change undocumented immigration and customs enforcement. The president's wall isn’t as sturdy as he promised: Smugglers have been using a commercial saw to cut through it!
Without Republican checks and balances Trump has a lot of power to use towards those cheating ends. And an equally corrupt lunatic in Barr.
I don’t worry about President Trump’s tweets!  That’s how America knows the truth of what is going on.  He keeps in touch with Americans, which is much more than I can say about the democrats.
This is Trump's equivalence of burning the place down because he knows he's going to lose, so he might as well take down-ballot Republicans with him. This is what a malignant narcissist does.
Trump has not removed Fauci because of the appearance, Trump knows Fauci is not being forthright on Hydroxy..it works, pandemic would be slowed to a crawl..but can’t let that happen until November..
Trump clearly would have done same in 2016 if he lost, he would have dragged it out for as long as he could get away with.
Ah, taking those same creative liberties with reality that your orange dream supreme is so fond of taking. That's okay, puddin' pop. Next time, I'll use much smaller words and speak slower for you. Anyone who can honestly continue to support Trump at this point ain't too bright.
From the doctor Trump called "an important voice": “Yes, I’m a demon buster. Yes, demons sleep with people,” said Stella Immanuel. “Yes, if you pray for them they get better.”

Trump: It’s a liberal HOAX
Trump is not the one oppressing voters, that would be your party. Mail In elections would take our vote away.
I never really understood what Republicans were about until “the Trump “ took office. Now it all makes sense. If you want to be controlled in any way,your on the right, if you want to converse and gather opinions and debate the best outcomes your on the left.
Remember when Obama ran for president he said he would always be transparent? He lied. Trump is brazenly transparent and dems are too blind to appreciate it.
32.9, 60, 0 - 32.9% drop in the GDP; 60 seconds - yesterday, an American died every 60 seconds from the coronavirus; 0 - the number of times  stood up for our troops in his latest conversation with Putin. This is Trump’s  cc
The Democratic plan is no platform and I honestly don't blame them. Trump is burying himself daily without a target.

Sorry to say this but this was the only mistake Trump period. Trusting this democrat RAT to be on his team.

Biden and Hillary have both absolutely nailed on the head the many problems Trump brings to democracy, but are discredited because they’re “just playing politics”
You R right about Fox News Mr. President. If not 4 you, none of these cable news stations would B worth crap. Fox has hired some of the biggest Trump Haters around. They take pleasure N reporting the worse Trump polls of the day. Keep on keeping on Mr. Prez.
When are you going to stop writing pulp fiction opinion articles that you spin as being fact?  When are you going to realize that republican voters for trump are majorly underrepresented in sample polls compared to democrats?  When are you going to realize it's the media and folk
Dems keep saying Trump didn’t do enough to stop the virus but I have not heard one idea of what they would have done.  Just complaining no solutions
Real Republicans are not anti science. Uneducated idiots are anti science. Some of them seem to vote Republican because they think that Trump represents them. But no, Trump despises them, as he despises all other people. Give us back the real GOP. Intelligent and thoughtful.
A president is not supposed to try to push millions of people‘s buttons that’s not a presidential Trump said he could be presidential if he got elected. It’s not going to be funny if he loses to Biden

It wouldn’t matter. US congress sets the E day at a national level; meaning it has to be on the same day for everyone. States have no control. Undermining would be a crime. There would surely be court battles but I’m pretty sure; in the end, Trump would be removed by Inaug Day.
You need to listen to what the Democrats want to do. Socialism is coming if Trump loses. More violence in states, and it will infiltrate into Republican controlled states. Higher taxes and less jobs, when the Democrats allow you to go back to work.
He pushed the idea that not wearing masks in public spaces was okay. Then he caught COVID at a Trump rally and died from it. He deserves zero sympathy

Haha a former president can’t be prosecuted by the senate, he can be prosecuted now.Haha it’s the opposite of Trump, who if he wasn’t president would already be arrested. If Barr has anything on him he would have arrested him. Not long till trump is arrested though. :). Fun fun

And replace him with who? The base will go nuts, scream about backstabbing RINOs, and they’ll lose even more spectacularly. Trump is the Albatross the GOP has superglued to its own neck.
I felt sorry for Trump at first. I really had never heard of him and didn't know anything about him. I had some hope even though I knew he would be a bad president, but I had no idea he was such a bad person. Now I feel nothing but disgust and loathing.
JOKE OF THE DAY. Trump says Let's change the election date. The election is fixed. Trump are you talking about GOP and yourself campaign of VOTER SUPRESSION not funny
Trump this is AMERICAN
“Covid is fake”. It’s people like this that are going to say the election results are fake if Trump loses lol    hillary was right about ONE thing, the basket is real, deplorable do exist.  But just as many on the left.

Hey Aggie girl, Just had to say, "whoop" and "Gig em". We're all Ags in my family! Of course my whole entire family are Trump supporters..except me! Thought I was the only Aggie Biden supporter.  Nice to have company.
It’s pretty silly. People listen to Trump and think voter fraud is a big deal. But it like never happens and even when it does it’s never a difference maker because it’s so minuscule
I’m sorry you’ve lost family but don’t blame it on Trump in any way. That’s the easiest thing to do. You need to listen to more people other than Pelosi or Biden, if you can understand him, and listen to news other than CNN or MSNBC.
What specific crime? Still waiting on a trump fan to name a crime. Nobody can yet haha
Trump closed polling locations?
The consequence of lying all the time is that no one believes a damn thing you say.  NO message Trump puts out will him any good,

Please enlighten me... being honest, I don’t get what Trump was saying with his tweet. It seemed very odd to me, and not in a good way.
I can tell you all one damn thing, Obama’s political speech at the John Lewis funeral today didn’t chage my mind one bit: I WILL BE VOTING FOR DONALDJ. TRUMP! #MAGA

The only reason they don’t go after Trump is because he has an R by his name and because he is white!
Wow. To see the way Trumpers frame things is repugnant. O stood and talked about issues Mr Lewis fought for his whole life, &amp; highlighted the Trump tragedy that he had to witness in his final years. John would have been smiling. He would have been proud. Tucker is scum.

Once upon a time both of them I would've voted for thing is Trump knew that. He made sure they put their names behind him because his base is loyal. Same way he made governors praise him early on. So later he has a soundbite. Meanwhile 151,000 Americans dead. #TrumpFailedAmerica

Ummm, you seemed to have misspelled Donald Trump. Let me help! Ready?! D. U. M. B. A. S. S.
Shifting blame to the media is a lame, copout on holding Trump accountable
That is Trump Republican logic. Which is why their party is the party of dishonesty, nonfact, and anti science.
I see now. A little research. The owner of the pizza shop was targeted by people after a Trump flag was seen flying from his shop. The owner made it onto one of the FOX News Channel shows. Guess Trump saw it and wanted to support the man. Mystery solved.
Very good message. Tell other Republican governors and Trump to do the same.
Hey, Chuckie. It’s not Trump’s response to the coronavirus that’s the problem; it’s Democrats. Fauci has known since 2005 that HCQ is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic against SARS-CoV.   Here’s the link to back it up. Stop the charade!
Tx Gov Abbott finally did something that I agree with: Early voting will start even earlier this year. Maybe he's hoping that people will vote before the remaining trump supporters bail, but I don't care. Gonna vote early again this year. 😁
I got news for you.  YOU are exactly the problem.  The Obama’s of the world will use your own ignorance to get you to vote for a man (Biden), who has vowed that nothing will fundamentally change.  The system that Trump is abusing is what needs to be changed...

I have voted mostly red in my life but Trump has changed everything in politics, lately.... The right and left have both changed with him.
I haven't decided on Jorgensen yet. I actually liked Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang. Biden is a lame duck but not horrifying. If he picks Harris for VP, I'm out. Trump infuriates me with his bean-selling, p***y-grabbing nonsense. It's slim pickings, IMO....

Before I even watch Adams can kiss my ass. I blocked him. He apparently believes in one party government forever. Because if R lose White House or senate( which guarantees Trump removal) we have socialism forever
Just because you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, it doesn’t mean you have to do it again. We can all learn from our mistakes. Also, many people are on the same boat. It’s ok.
President Trump dont pay any attention to the once bullied bullies. People use to hate Clinton until Bush, same Obama, and now you. We all feel. The fact is people are scared for various and a combination of reasons. Nobody ever makes all the correct or wrong choices.
In the unlikely case that the election is delayed... Trump should not be the one in charge, but Congress.
Imagine if this was Trump, they Dems would burst into flames.
Oh look. Koch-funded Dark Money Shadow Operatives are trying to whip votes for #coronavirus conspiracy theorist trump toadie, Crooked John Cornyn.  Look elsewhere, Cole.

He also deserves to still be alive. He is not because of Trump... PERIOD!

It is important to notice that the Biden campaign is painfully careful not to publicly mention too many reversals of Trump's agenda beyond the obvious (Paris, WHO exit, etc.)  Not to give all too much ammunition  to the Trump campaign.

Let me just say this thread is not to disparage gay or straight men that wear makeup nor men that wear makeup for TV or film. I’m sure y’all understand I’m talking to those misogynistic men that talk about the “man’s man”, yet Trump does not fit their aesthetic ideological tenet.
I grew up seeing you guys claim men wearing makeup are “pansies” and all types of other derogatory names.  I’m just curious, how you guys claim Trump is so manly, while still wearing heavy bronzer? Not saying men can’t wear makeup. I’m just pointing out the machismo hypocrisy.🤷🏾‍♂️
I don't doubt it. Only because he supported Trump. The utter stupidity of some people....sheesh.
You assume that trump has ever regretted anything in his life. Why would he? He has no sense of shame and all of the horrible shit he's done has paid off brilliantly. He's the most powerful man in the world rn and is making money hand over fist.

My Goat, Raccoons, &amp; I are eating God Father Pizza now in order to thank Herman Cain who, the only black presidential candidate who was on lead until the clown or sexual harassment showed up &amp; he lost the lead.  I hope his best friend Dr. Donald Trump showed up in his funeral.
I feel this deep in my soul. I have a 9 yr old who watched the service with me. I told him, “that is the man that was President when you were born”. He asked me why he wasn’t anymore, and we talked about term limits. At the end he said, “Mom, he’s WAY better than Trump” SO PROUD
Yep, President Trump was proven correct again!
Your ego Obama is  are at a man funeral and use that to use political slurs about the Pres &amp; a/as dishonest as they come,you allowed Trump to be spied on yet you call him out for not wanting voter fraud.WE want all CITIZENS to vote
Imagine what would happen to the economy &amp; energy industry if Dems win in Nov: -Radical Green New Deal would pass -Our energy industry would be decimated -Americans would still be out of work  -Household energy costs would jump to roughly $65,000 a year

She will have to face that her son is a huge Trump supporter.
When have it stopped? I'm just waiting for November when they start hollering election fraud when Trump gets trounced to see what they will do?
Fair point. Although imagine Crenshaw’s different tone if Obama has said such a thing. Or if Obama defended (!) Russia’s paying bounties to kill US troops as Trump did in the Axios interview.
She supports trump and inserted herself into a conversation i had with another coworker the other day. So i told her we had nothing to really talk about. So she's been passive aggressive the last few shifts and today i had enough time to finally go off.
Yes, I get into it sometime, but some trolls, will waste your whole day, when, I'd rather be Supporting Trump. The trolls, will start working more, the closer to election. Just pick your battles. #MyOpinion
Obama did great until he turned it into an “I hate Trump” rally. Using a funeral eulogy for a campaign attack isn’t ideal for me. Not the time or place. But I’m with you on the rest of it.
Trump Suggests Delaying The Election Causing Democrats To Freak Out, But...  via
I disagree Geraldo, Russians bounty to Afghanistan GI’.s, “Subject made the Daily briefing” Trump to read, the fact it “made the briefings it was reason for concern“ Trump job was to get to the bottom of the matter, instruct the most effective US military to counter the Russians?
Life is Hard. It's harder when you're stupid and go to Trump Rallies without a mask.
I will bet a million dollars if Trump attended Herman Cain funeral the left will cry about social distancing.
If Trump was the CEO of any business other than   etc., he would be fired. If it were a Trump business, he would have his job but he would be filing for bankruptcy AGAIN... America doesn’t need this winning.
My dad is a hard read right now. He hates when all his friends and family consistently dunk on Trump at gatherings(pre-Covid) but he’s pretty quiet lately.

If he agrees, ask him how much money he thinks he would make if the DNC offered him $1M per net EC vote for a Biden win.  Shut out Trump -&gt; $538M.

If you support someone that means u agree with their ideology. Trump followers holla they back him because he's a business and good for the economy. Well we seen before this mistake he wasn't a good businessman and he's a racist pos. He have the right to be who he is

This drives me crazy. Trump IS focusing on all the things he listed.
That would be fine. Hillary conceded in a phone call to Trump on the night of the election.
It really would. I pray for everyone in this entire world. I pray for trump too. For him to make wise decisions. I pray for evil people and for dictators and for every person that has done me wrong.
Where has this man been while trump has been saying he might not accept the results of the election if it doesn’t go in his favor???
Trump probably sent condolences to Ben Carson's family.
You mean the Trump virus correct?
He's not going to try. It's another one of the lefts false rumors. The kefts wants to delay it not Trump. If we've learned anything these past 4 years is that what ever the lefts say is the direct oppose or just plain out right lie.
GOP Senators might want to listen to Calabresi. As flawed as polls can be, I sure haven't seen one indicate that Trump is helping any Republican win right now.
What a bunch of phonies. No wonder Trump stayed away.
don't forget about Donald Young...he was murdered... These Democrats will destroy us all to get rid of President Trump and cover their tracks
Trump has seen the #BlueWave on the horizon
You two have it WRONG. President  Trump  was asking  a question  so he could point out that mail in voting is not needed!!
FYI: Joe Biden's Cold War Criticisms Of NATO And Germany Sound A Lot Like Donald Trump
Amen! You are so right! Trump will win in HISTORICAL LANDSLIDE NUMBERS for the 2020 election. People have had their belly full of the Democrat BS!!!!
Why would Trump ever leave the Golf course when he can have others fail to lead the country?
Declaring a national emergency doesn't give him unlimited power. He messed up. We agree on that.... but ALL OF THEM DID. You should be pushing to have everyone in congress and the governors voted out just as much as you are pushing for trump to be. Be consistent with your anger
Trump is telling his supporters to vote in person. He knows ballots get lost in mail. He doesn't want his lost. Also setting up for the inevitable Dem surge after mail is counted, to claim foul. Also setting up for the inevitable "don't vote or you'll get covid" shaming by media.
here’s who’s responsible (that’s my belief) for Herman cain’s death &amp; too many others we don’t even know:  donald trump. He also knows that, which is why he makes everybody sign a liability waiver. He has no guilt or shame &amp; doesn’t give a damn.
Cool. So do you think trump could declare a national emergency because of the riots and violence right now and just send the military into these states/cities to put it down and the governors would just say "oh ok then"... no.
What a site to see! After visiting Double Eagle Energy's rig site, President Trump departed on Air Force One. As he was leaving, B&amp;L Pipeco Services rolled in loaded trucks to deliver a production string of casing.
At some point GOP folks need to count their losses and borrow themselves sense. A dead man isn’t valuable to trump, neither is trump valuable to a dead man. Protect yourself, stay alive and all else can be figured out after the pandemic is over. Stop play Russian roulette
Many people will dance in the streets when that happens. I for sure will be buying people drinks when Trump passes away.
i mean, in 2016 republicans settled for TRUMP to avoid CLINTON! people, get it together. let's get rid of this jackass. there is no valid excuse to do otherwise.
#VoteInPerson #Trump2020  #KeepTheFaith  Thank you President Trump for standing strong for the #SilentMajority who do not want the libs to silence our voices or the voices of the unborn. We cannot allow the #CancelCulture to overcome the righteous.
And as I said, ok let's say we agree and trump didn't do anything... why aren't you just as angry at congress for not stepping up at that point and doing something?
This won't work. Trump appointed a postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, to specifically slow the mail. The goal is not to increase revenue or efficiency. The goal is to sabotage mail-in voting no matter what.
To sum up - Trump is threatening to contest the #November3rd election results are if he doesn’t win. Try to keep the results in court if he can. Setting up, in advance, the election will be rigged if he doesn’t win. If this doesn’t concern U, U R not an American
No. Shan’t.   Journalists have afforded Trump a comfort zone for his lies and abuses, so don’t get defensive when your profession shares the criticism of a failed presidency.   You claim to be the Fourth estate, then act like it.
not sure. the are trying to put trump out but they've also been responsible for the election of hundreds of racist trash republicans.
Thank you   Trump is destroying every good &amp; decent thing about America. He’s dividing families, &amp; friends. He is the most corrupt, self-absorbed man on the planet and we can NOT survive another 4 yrs. #WeWillVote #RidenWithBiden
I can’t believe we had the damn cure and Trump let Herman Cain die.
I'm voting for Trump.  I firmly believe that he is the one to bring this economy back.  I believe he can bring back jobs to the US.  The pandemic was the worst of the worst the left could do to this country to stop the vote. That is all it is. They are evil.
Trump Kim contest the election all he wants to. He is still going to lose.
Rubio used that tactic when Trump publicly called for China to investigate Joe Biden “I think he did it to get you guys. I think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it.”

Obama stands in judgement of President Trump and blames him for everything but the reality is, if Obama had done his duty, if he had stood up and changed equality for black America they wouldn’t need to be protesting now. This should have done when he was president.
Black trump supporters blow me💀like yk he don’t like niggers right?
Exactly. Why hasn’t Trump brought in other qualified doctors, who actually treat patients on a daily basis, to discuss these things with them. Why just keep taking advice from “scientist” who DO NOT TREAT PATIENTS 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤬🤬😳😳
Trump supporters don’t read the Constitution.
Both are very irresponsible! Trump shouldn’t have held a rally but to say that’s where Herman Cain got the virus is just as irresponsible!! This is the left trying to blame something else on the President!
Completely irresponsible to say it’s direct consequence from a President Trump rally!
And then he asks who is paying you to support Trump??!!!!  That man is a jacka$$.
You were fantastic!  The interviewer, UNREAL!  You tell him actual facts about all of the positives achieved under Trump admin, particularly with black community and he essentially said you were lying.  The things you stated were EASILY VERIFIABLE FACTS!!
A political tactic by Biden’s handlers. They are trying to stir up voters to believe Trump is trying to manipulate votes, when in actuality, they are trying to get votes from illegal citizens.

Nice, so once again it is Trump’s fault!  Hey you moron, it’s been going on fo years...long before evil President Trump came along.  It will be truly fixed once people understand personal accountability.  Nobody can go in and fix someone else’s effed up family.

You are such a sycophant.  Trump calling it the China Virus when it has a NAME- COVID-19.  Trump let this virus get out if control b/c he got "bored".  This whole fiasco is on the R's. ALL OF IT! You said &amp; did NOTHING --. We the People will not forget this for a LOOOOONG time.

Please start a Twitter account of Healthcare professionals against JoeBiden.  We are in agreement nurses don’t blow in someone’s nose and bring a critical patient’s pillows from home.  Please have President Trump take a compensatory test and Biden as well.  Trump 2020!
I dont blindly follow Trump smart guy. Trump isn't a politician which is why I voted for him as the success of leftist Operation Dumb Down for people such as yourself.
Senate Republicans are expected to roll out their $1 trillion plan Thursday, but deep divisions remain over a payroll tax cut President Trump wants.
BTW anyone without substantial amounts of being a piece of shit instantly knew the answer and would not be afraid to speak it.   No they did not deserved to be punished, and neither do these peaceful mothers, and more than anything why the fuck are you ok with the trump gustapo?
but never an actual trump, of course.
Even if legislation passes both chambers, it would need the signature of President Trump, who's opposed the removal of historic statues elsewhere.
yes, because trump is trying to leave it that way.
"I came here to be free, I'm voting for Trump, if only I can get past these Robocops in my way..." Trump campaign leans into Goya controversy in new Spanish ads

Here are some of the items President Trump touched on in his Wednesday coronavirus briefing.
The agreement is part of President Trump's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, under which multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being developed simultaneously. #Vaccine #COVID19 #Coronavirus
You'll have to ask Ghislaine Maxwell the first question, and Trump's concentration camps have migrant children instead, not any better in my estimation.  And it's "descent" not "decent".  The difference is, Trump is not a decent president.
Watch live: Trump Wednesday coronavirus briefing
The White House issued a 13-page statement expressing “serious concerns” about multiple provisions of the bill, including the renaming of some military institutions.
Watch Live: President Trump could send federal agents to Chicago, Albuquerque
Or 1.8 million lives saved from covid, 2 million was what we were told. So statistically Trump saved 1.8 million Americans. Has to be an American record. That is literally an awesome job. Thanks Mr. President
From what I can tell it starts at anything Trump disagrees with.
People always tell me that the left blames problems in the US on Trump for no reason like... he isn’t our president???
What ever is left after Trump gives it all away to Putin..
President Trump says federal agents could be deployed elsewhere as he makes law and order a central element in his struggling reelection campaign.
This is too much especially for a social studies teacher mentioning the president. Wow!
Biden, Obama discuss Trump's COVID-19 response in socially distanced conversation
Trump's COVID-19 briefing was 'exactly what Americans needed to hear,' Dr. Saphier says
When they asked for help in the past all trump did was steal PPE from blue states, so why let him know you are getting more stuff to stealI doubt it. They are determined to follow this clown right over the cliff. There are posts by his cult all over Facebook still arguing against wearing face masks, and lots still touting using trump's drug (hydroxychloroquine). Just unbelievable
It backfired, because Texas and Florida are red states, and we're being decimated because of idiot governors who want to please trump
OH NO JOE! Biden Blames Trump for Avoiding “Intercourse with the World” ...  via
Trump's in free fall. He's seeing his numbers going further down every day.  His campaign will try to come up with something that will appeal to more people, but with him, a loose cannon, they have an impossible job. We need to pay close attention because he's getting desperate
OH NO JOE! Biden Blames Trump for Avoiding “Intercourse with the World” ...  via  Who could possibly vote for this? MUST LISTEN
Abbott was more interested in pleasing trump than in protecting Texans. With his wishy-washy policies, he's really thrown us under the bus. I knew we were in trouble on Mother's day and all restaurants opened and i saw parking lots full. And his ambivalence on masks . Failure
Imagine being ugly and a trump supporter..... like girl pick a struggle 🙄

Guess trump was given the wrong information when he was saying everything was looking a lot better. I don't think his "wishful" thinking is working out
I see all the trump cult out in force defending the use of that useless drug. I see it all over Facebook. One thing you can say about his entire cult is that trump appeals to the poorly educated and the stupid (he said that) and with all these clowns, you can't fix stupid!
Ted “I like Trump more than my wife” Cruz
donald trump, who is president of this country, is both an economic and national security threat to the entire world.  He's killed 150,000 Americsns, 40 million people unemployed, and the economy is in the toilet
Yes, and that sure didn't work out well. And he's trying to shift the blame for Cain's death on China, instead of saying that the trump virus spread to Cain because he refused to wear a mask

This idiot should be holding trump responsible for this pandemic in this country. This is the "TRUMP VIRUS"
You idiot! You should be holding trump RESPONSIBLE. He totally  bungled the response, called it a hoax, refuses to mandate wearing masks. This is the "TRUMP VIRUS"
trump has no sense of humor! He isn't kidding
wow Texas is on the map📍Joe Rogan is moving here, Elon Musk is opening the new Tesla factory here, and Trump just came for a republican Party and sign some bills.  what’s going on.
Y'all spent $7 million to see Trump in Odessa when you should have used that to donate to  feed/shelter the homeless  get COVID-19 tests to those who need it  support BLM and LGBTQ+ movements  support your neighbors who can't pay rent this month due to unemployment  🤦🏻‍♂️
Wearing my mask, I would rather risk dying of Covid-19 by voting in an election office than to let Trump delay the 2020 Presidential election.
Are you shitting me? It’s ok to call out Biden for this but not trump for his shit on the same level?
I voted for Hillary, but a lot of people did not vote. By not voting, we "earned" trump.
Most Trump supporters don't belong to a "party".  I don't give a damn about a effin party.  And if ppl are not going to vote for him over this tweet, they're too stupid to be voting.
Trump tells Vanessa Guillén's family he doesn't want Fort Hood soldier's murder to be "swept under the rug"
This is absolutely true. It's not disrespectful, it just states facts. There is a pattern: follow trump by refusing to wear a mask and you are putting yourself and others at risk
Again, if “triggering libs” is your basis for being involved in politics or blind allegiance to someone, you should 100% keep your unamerican ass out of it. There’s a fat chunk of decent republicans against trump.
“It also comes as he is trailing significantly in the polls to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who predicted in April that Trump would seek to push back the date of the election.”
I don't expect everyone to think the same, I just miss being around others with shared viewpoints.  P. S.--This is also in response to my hometown's seemingly uncritical excitement at having Trump visit. I get it; it's the president. But this is not just any president.
It would, but they won't. They are going to continue to cling to trump and will go down with his shipwreck in November, that is, the ones who survive
Cornyn has become a toadie for trump. Too stupid to understand that when the trump shipwreck goes down in November, it's going to take a LOT of these sychophants with him
And look at all the people he knowingly exposed. How many people are going to have to die to prove a point for trump.
Lots, and it's still happening. At the trump fundraiser in Midland, Texas, the vast majority didn't wear masks.
trump held a quasi rally here in Midland, Texas, and the vast majority were not wearing masks. Hope that hydroxychloroquine works for them
Trump nomineee hearing pulled amid furor over Islam remarks

This is the fucked up part of this. I was genuinely being nice after being called ugly for what my own opinion is and y’all always talk about trump being a racist, but at the SAME TIME I’ve had ppl call me and cracker and a Cheeto ??? So do y’all hate your own selves as well?
President Trump hears from local Oil industry leaders at luncheon
Trump is a pos but the mf is pretty funny sometimes😂😂
Proof? A lot of people once they do some reading and research come to like what trump does.
Was I talking about Obama ? No I was talking about the options that we have to keep our industry going. Trump is a racist and a rapist just like every other president and Im pretty sure just like all the presidents to come, with the exception that Obama wasn’t a racist
So great to have President Trump in Odessa, Texas today!!!! There were American flags, a prayer, and the Star Spangled Banner!!! Proud to be an American!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸#Trump2020
I live in the permian basin (oil field), and I am surrounded by a sea of trump supporters. And lot of them still think COVID 19 is a hoax, believe everything trump says, and are deeply racist. It's like living in hell

I know. We're in trouble here because Abbott is much more interested in pleasing trump than in protecting Texans
I feel ya, I’m settling for trump just because I want us to have a very strong economy.  Also I don’t think Trump’s cabinet will let him be reckless with our important allies, hopefully.
Must be two different oil fields.   Bc I just know that shit not boomin like y’all said it would under trump.   If Y’all really think the president controls the global oil industry. Your ass shouldn’t have dropped out of high school and went to the oilfield.
Here in Texas, cases skyrocketing. So are hospitalizations and deaths. And in Midland, where trump is holding a campaign, almost no one wearing a mask. We are all getting ready to go over a cliff

President Trump signs 4 pipeline permits during visit to Midland
No but you did imply he isn’t racist even though if trump said those things you’d be screaming it. Calling corona the “Chinese virus” is just as racist as calling West Nile virus the West Nile virus because that’s where the outbreak began.
Latino trump supporters be like “yo no sabo”
“Bothered” by low income housing? I had to re read that. But Trump “cares” about his “people.” That would INCLUDE the less fortunate. This is embarrassing.
I completely agree. Also have u looked into the good Trump has done for America or is the good out weighed by the bad ?
all im saying is all the bad bitches hate trump
Census head wasn’t told about Trump district drawing order
President Trump is now finished speaking and signed four new permits this afternoon. Trump is now heading out from the tent.
So what you’re implying is that Biden isn’t racist? Even though he had a hand in deporting 5 million people while he was VP? The same guy that said if a black person doesn’t  vote for him they “aren’t black”. And there are people “less fortunate than me” that vote for trump.
And for those “trump keeping my parents pockets fat” folks, does it really feel that good to undermine the hard works of your parents while giving all the credit to a man who doesn’t know you exist or cares if you live or die? Shut up and do something with your OWN pockets.
Don’t waste your energy arguing with these trump praisers (they’re beyond supporters now) just let them do that cause then who will they praise when he’s out the picture? The next person. Will you oppose the next person? Most likely. So just focus on you and what you can to help.
Alright we’re home...rant over. I’m just gonna call in to work until Trump is out of Odessa. 🥴
Fuck Donald trump and anybody who support his philosophies
What’s one thing. And cite your source. I’m just curious. I’m Hispanic, my parents immigrants from Mexico. Does that label me as a white supremacist? And I’m also curious, since trump supporters are white supremacist in your logic. Does that make Biden supporters pedophiles?
So cool our President took time out to acknowledge the young people in our community. Thank you President Trump!!!  MAGA 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
They follow trump.
They don't care. They are going along with trump's response: just ignore it
Like I’m not trying to start drama but can someone explain why hating Trump is popular?  I’m not a Trump fan by any means but why can’t people see both perspectives of political influences?
Trump just said what we all know is true:   People who live in the suburbs don't want low income housing built near their Neighborhood.  That's why suburbs are a thing in the first place  Suburban Lifestyle Dream

Last time bush came to Odessa the boom was down and that bitch boomed right after ,cmon trump
Let's be clear: the Republicans weren't for the AFFH rule in 2015, which is why they're using Trump as cover for repealing it now. Don't let them revise their way around this in 2020. "Oh, we supported the Rule, it was only that meanie Trump who did away with it!"
someone please explain why y’all love trump so much? i’m genuinely curious.
It disgusted me to see that Mexicans were the majority of Trump supporters in downtown Odessa.

you haven't personally seen or heard him do this, so your only basis is what the media has reported. Be a free thinker...its so much more liberating than having someone tell you, show you, or instruct you how to think. And im pretty sure Pres Trump would agree with me on that.
Seems like the crimes and burning of buildings was on a daily rise until Trump stepped in. So sad you have not stepped into the light. You live and dwell in the darkness and can not see the light.
Who is Donald trump? I’ll tell u he is disgusting n pathetic! N hes racist he tryed to build a wall to divide us !!!! Look what USA has become since he came President ‘2020 bro we our supposed to b one’ USA is supposed to fight off other states not fight its self !

Hey Permian Basin, remember when President Trump bragged about being responsible for low gas prices, and that if it wasn’t for him oil would have been $125/bbl. Whatever he tells you tomorrow, he will abandon you the day after if it suits his interests. He is not our friend.

The problem is exacerbated because trump cult see this, and spread it all over social media. My Aunt posted this b.s. 3 times today on Facebook. I reported it 3 times to Facebook. But the damage is already done, it's already being spread far and wide
Y’all tweeting and tagging Trump saying I can’t wait to see you like he’s gunna tweet back and say “can’t wait to see you too” lmao
Local leaders react to Trump’s visit to the Basin
The worst thing about this? The Supreme Court’s decision was also a step-by-step how-to guide on how to get the case back into their chambers and get the decision the administration wanted.  And Trump couldn’t even do that right.

“The ultimate conspiracy theory was declared by the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who warned that he was certain Trump plans to delay the election this fall,” Turley wrote.
“Some within Democratic Party circles hold fervently to the idea President Trump will arbitrarily decide to postpone the election,” scolded columnist Byron Williams of the Winston-Salem Journal. “This belief fits neatly into a narrative ascribed to the president. As they see it,.
“Former vice president Joe Biden’s unfounded accusation Thursday that President Trump wants to delay November’s election was not only clearly over the line but also unmasks how low the supposedly moderate Biden will go to win,” wrote Henry Olsen in the Washington Post.

Each Trump tweet is a trial balloon.
And COVID from Trump’s rally killed him. What is your point?
Herman Cain allowed Donald Trump to kill him.
Donald Trump should resign.
“She’s not ready to be awaken?” Good one! All of these new codes using poor spelling and now incorrect grammar too? It must be the way they teach at Trump University.
Just to be clear, I'm definitely be voting for  don't even understand any sort of convo around possibly not voting for him. I don't think we'll survive Trump another 4. I'm going to start transitioning my Twitter handle. Just not sure about it.
These are Democratic controlled cities that are burning. Trump is not taking away rights at all. These are criminals and he is enforcing law. Protecting Federal buildings from burning has nothing to do with “states rights”.
It’s because Trump is for it.
Conventional thinking was to keep Germany from becoming the dominant military power in Europe. Putin/Trump may wish to reconsider.
Nothing disappoints me more than women supporting trump😔
You're confused, Lindsey?  Ike, Reagan, Clinton, JFK, LBJ, Ford, Truman and both Bushes have fed buildings named after them. The guy who puts his name on everything can't stand the thought of not having one of his own.
establishment dems be like "yeah we forced out the only candidate actually fighting for the changes this country needs but now its this shithead or trump so just settle for him or its your fault when trump wins :)"
Agree. Looking from their point of view, they have to get rid of President Trump or spend their life in prison or possibly get the death penalty.

It’s shocking how many people who call themselves Christians can support Donald Trump. I’m not worried, but maybe you should be.
I, for one, support Trump's move to withdraw some 11,000 troops from Germany.  I don't think boots on the ground are necessary.  A steady campaign of drone strikes and carpet bombing should be adequate to break their spirit and win the day.
Trump doesn’t give a sh*t about you. The only thing Trump cares about is himself. And ratings...he is obsessed with ratings.
People are dying! You could die! Especially if you refuse to do the simplest of things to protect yourself. Do you think Trump is going to reward you for not wearing a mask?
Fact: Covid-19 is NOT a global conspiracy contrived to make Trump look bad (he needs no help with that)and hurt his chances at re-election.
Thanks 🇺🇸👍😎
At this point,I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump started renting out the Lincoln bedroom to Vlad.Kills 2 birds with 1 stone-he &amp; his bestie can have endless slumber parties &amp; he can make even more money on the side. Honestly, would not shock me in the least. This is where we are.
Wait, why wouldn't it let you play against Eric Trump?

This is a joke. Did we really expect honest answers to questions posed? All we get is talking points pushing Trump’s agenda.
Yes, heads of our state just who are you listening to?  We the people who voted you in want to know why we are being kept from this medicine for a cure? Need to know we do have a right to try law because of President Trump.

So Trump is supposidly in cahoots with the Russins and Biden is in cahoots with the CCP Chinese. But Trump has screwed the Russians so often he can't be there man any more. So vote Trump!
Why are you not leading the news story every night with the corruption &amp; illegal actions of Obama &amp; his administration? All you do now is exaggerate Covid, bash Trump, &amp; prop-up Biden. The riots are not protest. Your avoidance of real stories is amazing.
Who is making wearing masks political? That’s right,Trump and his supporters.  They want to tout this drug for its effectiveness citing 1 flawed study but ignore scientific proof that masks help slow the spread. They are complicit in the deaths of Americans. And they don’t care.
I think enthusiastic for Trump supporters translates to a crazed and fanatic following of his cult.
It’s the voters, not just her. Chicago voters dislike Trump to the point that even if it helps their city they will fight him. Short of Trump handing everyone 1 million dollars, they will fight him.

I mean...he’s right. Who would’ve played the blues? No blues, no jazz. No jazz, no rock. No rock, no trump pregame music.
No sh*t it says Biden, I was being facetious because Donald Trump is beyond dishonest...20,000 lies and counting. Sorry that went over your head. I’ll try to dumb it down for you next time.
Sadly yes I do. I live in a retirement community and it is filled with flags and Trump supporters
You have to hand it to #Trump . In an attempt to win re-election, he politicized #Covid and 150,000 people died. Now, again to win re-election, he’s demonizing BLM, and he’s turned small protests into a genuine crisis. He’s never met a situation he can’t make a whole lot worse.
The quotes indicate I think you are part of a bigger plan to angle for libertarian ways. To me, libertarian equals isolationism and chaos. Otherwise, you would join against Trump instead of adding to the problem. Also, GFTFO with your dictionary 🤣

“He’s not a war hero.He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”July 17, 2015,Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.Trump was referring to Senator John McCain,a former Navy pilot who was tortured during his 5 1/2 yrs as a POW during the Vietnam war.
You helped answer the questions, how does Trump get away with all the lies and why has he not paid any price for them?
No sweetie, they said describe Biden not Trump.
There are riots in Portland involving criminal activity. To say Trump wants to fight “moms” and “veterans” because he’s trying to help stop these riots is a disingenuous statement.
Genocide? That is a grossly false statement. And if we remove him, then that qualifies as going down as the greatest generation? Another ridiculous statement. You don’t have to support Trump, but to not support him for these reasons is asinine.
I wouldn't want to be in the same room with Trump &amp; discuss anything. Ever.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It is as if these idiots don’t realize that Trump is president for four years. They want us to think that Biden is some how the current POTUS and trump will bring change to that. Shit gets worse if trump stays that is the facts. All she cries about expands under him.
This is an utter lack of class and character. But it’s no surprise that the RNC tried it. Just donate one cent to Trump’s campaign instead of buying their garbage. It’ll cost them a lot more than a penny to process.
I don’t mind ads... but don’t put Trump ads on my music app! Can we have ONE place where we aren’t asked if we think he’s making America great? HE’S NOT and I’m gonna change music apps if you keep advertising for him 🤮
My latest. Includes #Trump and colonoscopies.
they outnumber the fed. Agents. Cant cover every city. Why hasn't trump gone after those high level radicals like soros responsible for this terrorism. Because they want this to go on.
DHS will be remembered as the Brown Shirts of the Trump admin.
Yeah...ok.
Oh I getting so tired of these vulgar, loud mouth and stupid liberals but I know the day after Trump is re-elected the pandemic will be over and these edits will be hiding in a closet.
Not for giving Lincoln Project more attention then they already have b/c this is the post-Trump opponent but I definitely cackled.
“Selfless” has never been used to describe Trump with good reason. Try again.
if elections are cancelled then trump wins by default.
Take it from a historian. We don't owe anything to Confederate monuments | Timothy Snyder  you call yourself an historian. I doubt it. Dont know what books u read but they must be anti american history.
Biden: "Trump is the first racist president!"  Woodrow Wilson: "Hold my soda water"  Andrew Jackson: "Hold my Tennessee whisky"  Sally Hemmings: "Yeah, we know, Thomas."
Literally record setting stock market runs under Trump and booming economy. Lowest minority unemployment in history. Then a historic pandemic hit that no President could predict. So you say no ones life is better and it’s Trump’s fault. What BS.
Trump is an idiot.  Just sayin.
Left wing media: did you see Trump steal that ball from that kid!?
The only problem with this article is that it only starts with the pandemic. Trump has been undermining environmental regulations for the past four years.   No president has rolled back or interfered with U.S. environmental law more than Trump. Not even close.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause fuck trump and his gestapo goons
“It is much cheaper to wage war in your own country”- Donald Trump empathizing with money
“The last administration left us nothing. We started off with bad, broken tests, and obsolete tests,” Trump asserted, prompting Acosta to jump in and ask: “You say ‘broken tests’ — it’s a new virus, so how could the tests be broken?
He’s sending Federal troops to ABQ? Dude, I grew up there. That’s like sending a SWAT Team to Santa’s Village. #Trump #TrumpGestapo #ImVoting4BidenBecause #TrumpIsUnwell
I’m sick and tired of Trump supporters calling out other people for the same things that Trump, himself, has done. Enough! I respect people’s right to an opinion, but don’t call sh*t out if your party, or president, has done the exact same mother f*cking is thing. Holy sh*t!
If people are going to hold Cuomo accountable then they should also hold Trump accountable. That is all I’m saying.
And I agree.The way they was handled was terrible.But many of the people criticizing Cuomo don’t have a thing to say about Trump’s response.I’m just pointing out the hypocrisy. And like I said before, at least some people are owning their mistakesTrump says he is not responsible
People are calling out Cuomo for a poor response to the pandemic...it is apropos that one mentions the abysmal response by the president.  The same people complaining about Cuomo are the ones supporting Trump. Not that big of a leap.
And I love that Trump’s supporters like to trot out the ol’ free speech defense...while simultaneously complaining that people are being disrespectful to America when they exercise their free speech by kneeling.  The irony and hypocrisy is palpable.
Trump Commits Two More Impeachable Offenses This Week Alone #SmartNews ....are we really surprised
Remember when Trump said it was under control...that it would disappear...and blamed Obama for “bad” tests for Covid-19....when Covid-19 did not exist in humans.  I’m sorry, are facts getting in the way of your narrative??? 😂
Did people in power make mistakes concerning Covid-19? Yes. Some corrected those mistakes, while others continued to spread lies and misinformation.  Guess which category Trump falls in?
Scientists and doctors have been saying for months now to wear a mask. Trump is a little late to the party.
It was a partial ban,not total.And the virus was here by way of Europe in the early stages.He didn’t ban anyone from Europe did he?Y’all keep pointing to 1 thing, ONE, that Trump did.He could’ve saved many more lives by wearing a damn mask.He is the reason there are anti-maskers.
Unlike the actual facts about Trump: paid Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about their affair...stole money from kids’ cancer charity...tried to coerce foreign interference in an election...shall I go on?
Yes, I recognize that it has been happening for a long time. Thank you for acknowledging that. You can see by my qualifier “especially,” that I know it’s been going on for awhile but It has gotten...wait for it...especially bad during Trump’s administration. Do you get it now?

I am scheduled for a colonoscopy this week. I am certainly not looking forward to it.  But…  At least I’ve finally found something that is almost, but not quite, as distasteful as listening to an interview with #Trump.
Wow.  Looks like Operation Censor Trump Voters is in full effect
These are lefties doing this. How is this Trump??
why in the world would anyone want to come to your horribly managed state &amp; then lock themselves up for 2 wks? Just implement a travel ban cause this in essence is what this is. But, I bet you were against Trump implementing a travel ban weren't you?
The US has openly condemned Chinese virus. Trump even mocked China by calling it a Chinese virus. Trump is also working with other countries to put pressure on China. Now Trump has closed their Houston consulate.
So when the city council votes to disband the police department resulting in 20% immediately leaving it’s Trump’s fault? Let me ask you, would you risk your life daily possibly orphaning your kids for a city that spits on you?
Come now, trump is a foot taller.
Don’t feel ashamed. The Chinese Government has stolen IP from the US for the last 30 years. Most US Presidents tolerate it to keep good relations. Trump simply called “BS” and told them to pack up and get out.
Let me get this right, you saw Trump one time sit during the National Anthem and you consider that equivalent to players intentionally kneeling before millions?So was Trump!
America and Texas support teachers and children. I know  is unable to understand. Cornyn supports Trump, Putin and Wall Street! #ShutItDown #DoItRight #SaveLives #TrumpGenocide
Seems convenient that Trump is actually mentioned as doing nothing. Same as Clinton.  "They were there with 2 young girls but he was always a gentleman."  I feel like we are all getting shammed.
Absolutely, Trump uses people all the time.
He never kicked him out of Mir a Lago.  That is a story Trump says.  He said he was a great guy up until 2004 when Epstien outbid him on a building and got in trouble.  Just because Trump says it now does not mean its true.  He tried to get rid of Berman.

The Republicans don't want it to be made easy.

Hmmm I’m sure if trump did it you’d be okay with it though 🤷🏽‍♀️
You obviously don’t know what John Lewis stood for 🤡. As if trump wouldn’t make a speech at a funeral about himself and how he’s the greatest president ever.
Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn’t want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis’s name! EVER!
You know what, forget I. I shouldn’t be insulting someone because I’m very privileged and was born into a wealthy family. If you think Donald Trump, despite the fact that he made our country a freakshow, will be a good President, vote for him. It’s your right.

President Trump, I respectfully disagree with your desire to delay the election.  I agree that the potential for fraud is high with mail in voting.  We need to come up with a solution to combat fraud, but not delay the election.  In person voting w/precautions against Covid.
Did Herman Cain receive the medication?  You guys are fools. The president is unhinged and has yet to broach the subject of Cain's death!  He doesn't care if you, your children or your parents die. He does not care about honor or country. He cares about Trump!
I came here for the ratio.
Trump is only tweeting it to distract from the news that the US is in recession. The Trump Recession.
I am PISSED OFF and I’ve been no fan of Herman Cain’s politics!!  What an appalling waste that he would die for Donald Fucking Trump!!
What are you talking about? Didn’t you see the quotation marks? That was what Trump said in his ad, that we won’t be safe in Biden’s America and he will keep us all safe, but the irony is that absolutely nobody is safe in Trump’s America as showcased by the horrors occurring now.
No. Trump is now threatening to postpone the election.

Donald Trump is too nice to Russia and Venezuela! When we get a real man, not an effenminent homo, in the office, he’ll make sure those countries don’t fuck with America again!
Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.

Yup and that’s why they love Trump so much because he made their racism okay, and they were so mad that a black man was in power they did and continue to do anything to disparage him and his family. They finally have someone in office who echoes their racism.

Obama was never a true American citizen. Maybe Trump was right — again.
Speaking of Cain. Why hasn't Trump responded to his death? He is the one responsible for it after all. Had it not been for that unnecessary rally Cain would still be alive. Makes Trump an accomplice to        ,  I will let you fill in the blank.

Fucking  might be useless, but he is up for reelection.   Cornyn,  by the way, laughed it off ad another trump joke.
Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That’s the only reason you’d hope to delay. Because you know he’s going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?
Trump's America

Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?

Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?🤪😜🤪😜🤪😜
BREAKING NEWS: Cain, who called the coronavirus a hoax, spoke out against wearing masks, and most likely contracted it from a Trump Rally, has died from...  The coronavirus.
Another reminder that people need to take this shit seriously. Herman went to that Trump rally, strutting around without a mask, likely contracted the virus there and now he's dead because of his decision.
seems to be agreeing with me!  Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‘INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT’ vote
Anyone in Congress who, when asked, doesn't emphatically state that Trump can't delay the election needs to lose their seat.
They don't hate the drug, they hate Trump.  If Obama was in office the wonders of this drug would be leading every news channel in the US.
At the same time, his potential VP is threatening Trump voters with harassment
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
People are falsely claiming that if the election gets postponed that Pelosi with act as interim come Jan 20th when Trump's term is up per the Constitution, but this is false because literally every member of the House is up for reelection. Their terms are up same day, same time.
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don’t think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‘Trump Respects The Constitution’, it is ‘Trump cannot garner the required support to do a coup’.

About a week ago, I saw a meme of Trump with a bowl of mashed potatoes on his head.  Wish I had kept it.
It sends a clear signal to Putin that he should help get Trump re-elected and, in exchange, Trump will do whatever he wants him to.
Six...that’s how many conversations Trump has had with Putin since March when we learned that Russia put a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  And he didn’t bring this up in any of those conversations.
Is there a push to undermine President Trump?  Why won't the Republicans put on their gloves and fight fire with fire.  The Democrats are running roughshod over the Republicans.  I don't want socialism, government controlled healthcare, raised taxes, etc.
So, instead of quietly shifting troops to other areas, which would help a longtime ally save face, Trump makes a big, blowhard announcement the day after he had a meeting with his handler, Vladimir Putin.  Also, it's been three weeks since Bountygate. Not a word.
This is Trump’s America!
Could be on purpose, call it an experiment and you have ethics rules and such.  Great way to undermine that idiot Trump's plan
Those of you who are bystanders and cheerleaders of trump's corruption should make your break now.  Endorse Biden.  Change your legacies from "complicit traitors and criminals" to "merely useful idiots".  It's too late for the ringleaders.

That’s a job approval, I’m just saying that as a state we voted him in. And he’s in west Texas aka trump company.
I don't recall  ever suggesting, “Let’s rolling #hydroxycholoroquine out to the public!” He was just discussing some of the data he read about the benefits of said drug.   I don't have a #bias against Trump, so I can look at things objectively.

So basically if you make a good appearance on TV and seem to agree with Trump, he wants to consider them an expert. He doesn’t even vet these people to make sure they are credible. He counts on his supporters being dumb.
Guess he’s anticipating Trump’s incarceration.

Yes, sick of Trump and supporters.
Its going to be tough, but I believe if we all stay vigilante and not yield to the thugs at the ballot box ( they will be there), we will save our DEMOCRACY and send trump where he belongs.Either Russia in exile or prison.
Caught the last couple of minutes of the trump rally.  What I heard trump saying is   "Nobody likes me,  Everybody hates me,   Think I'm going to eat worms"

Trump has a lock on most ignorant president in history.
It’s about time!  I have no children but I wouldn’t send mine to school.  Trump wants everything opened and back to where it was pre-pandemic so he can campaign on how well he handled everything.  He doesn’t care about the people that will die to make him look good.
Pretty sure I'm taking the next day off. I'll be up late waiting for them to reluctantly declare Trump the winner. Biden will win a handful of states, and they'll Harper on that all night.
Trump abides by the rules now news has to ask "are the masks really safe?"
Hey Chuckles the virus is here and 150,000 people possibly more are dead. Trump has no plan. He golfs every weekend while people keep getting sick. When will you see his incompetence? If he was a Democrat you would be screaming for his head. Your hypocrisy is showing.
Trump's is the most corrupt administration in the history of this country.    Anyone who supports trump is either a criminal or a fool.  Or both.
President Trump continues to criminally withhold and redact those files. With Trump's new file-release deadline in 2021, the JFK Act remains the defining, still unspeakable aspect of the 2020 election.
Covering their butts.  When you hang out with people in the gutter, you don't bring them up, they take you down to their level.  Republicans are in the gutter with trump.

Is the reason Trump doesn’t want mail-in voting so bad because he knows voter suppression won’t be as effective or????
Yep, which is why Trump should have been removed from office.
The Dems and Never Trumpers want Trump out so badly, they'll hold the entire country hostage to get their wish.  They absolutely do not care about anything else. Period. Dead people, lost businesses, people living in the street mean nothing to them.  Nothing.

Why doesn't  's account reflect that it is restricted?  Suspend him, and everyone who tweet false and dangerous information about covid.  People are dying. Why do you help trump spread information that's killing them?
But confirmation bias is a thing and people who are desperate to believe Trump can do no wrong will believe any white coat who will provide a modicum of aircover to continue to push this theory. /End
How can you be so blind to what is really happening to our country, it isn’t President Trump, it is the radical left. Open your eyes.
Not taking anything approved by Trump's FDA.  Ever.
please look into what these doctors are saying about the cure that Trump said from day one.  Be our hero!!!
Maybe, you should see this an a learning opportunity. You are NOT a good president Mr. Trump. Maybe if you DON’T act like a self-serving, callous, racist, wannabe-know-it-all, people wouldn’t criticize you so much. Just a thought. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Trump as usual working very hard to hide his innocent and beautiful tax records.
So now you're NOT a Reagan Republican.... got it.... they dont want you anymore either....Yeah i read a very little of the report and if he followed the domestic plan it might not have gotten as bad. Even with the states being closed people were protesting to reopen and the states were losing money so they opened sooner so some of it really cant be all on trump right?
So idk how reality is anti trump.
Isn't vox anti Trump? Even when he does good, they either twist it or dont write anything about it. I could go to google and look up either, "Why is Trump a racist?" or, "How is Trump not a racist?" and get thousands of articles going either way. I could also look up

Will any reporter ask you or Trump about the bounties his BF Putin put on American soldiers’ heads?  BTW-How is an officer throwing an object at protesters first, then gets hit when it is thrown back assault on the officer but not the protesters?

Yes, Trump has to go. I will swim through a flood to vote his ass out. Whatever it takes.
Yeah, I realized it wasn't that peculiar being that he was over 70 and had cancer. It's just unfortunate. Folks are being dickholes about it, though, because he went to a Trump rally. They won't say that protesting in large groups is just as risky. Hypocrits.

Don, Someone has been behind every fn one of them. They're neither Blue or Red they are grey. Trump is the only one not owned. We need him for 8 more. First 4 don't count. I reclaim his time.
Screw Twitter. It leads to pontification and resting on laurels and sound bites.  The New Wave is coming. We need to seriously give time and some money to TRUMP and the GOP.  This is a fire we can put out at the polls. Deportation for many, jail time for most, trees of treason?
Opponents spinning wheels   They say he serves Putin, risks Germany.  Then mock Trump 'he only moved them to Poland' like its a fake draw down well if the troops R still nearby how can one argue that it puts Europe at risk?  when you get to be prez YOU can decide where to deploy
I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.

How could anyone have any respect for a president Trump? He just doesn't give a damn about our troops. It's all about pleasing Putin.
Trump is a traitor. He will protect Putin anyway he can. Trump believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies and that's very troubling and un-American. He didn't even bring up the fact that Russia is arming the Taliban in the meeting with Putin. That's disturbing.
He should just drop out and let Trump win

There is no doubt Trump will lie. He will lie and attack the VP pick no matter who that person is. Nothing Trump does is based on facts so that's nothing new. I am sure Kamala is prepared to handle the child president. She isn't scared of him like some of these men around him are

Trump is still pushing hydroxychloroquine because he is making money off of the drug. He never does anything just to help Americans. It is always about him. If you support someone like this, you're un-American.  Period!
Just one problem.  Greeks sexual preference of children back in ancient history has followed them to our century.  Trump hinted at the "oldest" human trafficking organization.  Tom Hanks verified it. Ain't no mountain high enough.....  We'll get them ALL. BHO

Its really bad form to stage hearings on Barr  with the election in NOV.  He knows it, &amp; he figures 'what can you do to me?'  Plus Barr confident that enough voters agree with Trump  on the crack down &amp; not with nightly violent protests.  Trump's wrong on lots but not on this one

Trump's actions says everything about him so his tone means nothing.
This is coming from the Congress that's always on recess throughout the year.  Republicans don't give a damn about Americans dying or struggling during this pandemic. Trump made this pandemic worse by doing nothing and Americans have to suffer for it. Republicans are pathetic!
If you want to chip away at Trump's political strength  better to focus on which 'needs' &amp; vulnerabilities within voter segments that he seemed to connect with more successfully than those who challenged him.
Arlan, this only feeds the 'if people only knew' school of anti-Trumpism.  We forget how extensive &amp; shocking was coverage of Trump in spring of 2016, as he, nevertheless, beat all GOP rivals  now we get the disgruntled rebellious relative's inside story  preaching to the choir
He wont be just lying for Trump. Barr has to cove up his own crimes.

Like all ppl supposedly “pro-life,” this group won’t do the real work for life. If it supported full health care for all women, abortions would plummet. But they won’t do it.  I’m catholic and will definitely be voting for Biden. Trump represents deceit, lies, and death.

In 2016 I had serious issues with Hillary &amp; her team.  Remember she supported arming Ukrainians to fight Russians, just for ex.  I know Trump is bad but I will need to believe that Biden is not going to be also bad, in an assortment of slightly different ways than Trump is bad.

Trump's also incestuous.
There are many women who want and can be houewives. But he is lumping working women and housewives together into one group. They are a separate breed and both should be treated with respect.  I'm doubtful that trump respects women regardless of whether they work or not.

ODD, but THAT is exactly what's coming out of the WH now!  Trump has taken a page from Putin's playbook, NOT to have the Election.  Now all of a sudden Trump sees a loophole for using COVID19 to stop the Nov Election.  Sounds like republican control holding us Hostage !

That was 14 years ago.  He caught COVID-19 around the time of Trump's superspreader rally in Tulsa, tested positive a little over a week later, and succumbed to the disease after a month in the hospital for it.
I understand your stylistic objections to Obama.  I have a similar hostile response to oleaginous politicians like Cruz who insult your intelligence; and that’s even before Trump turned Republicans into the nihiliststic Trolling for Liberal Tears Party.

Actually, a large percentage of mail in ballots are improperly completed, and must be disqualified. Trump is right, but for the wrong reason. Nobody is trying to "fix" the election.  Voters goof it up. Kinda electoral Darwinism.
Anyone who thinks the GOP after Trump will regain its sanity, think who preceded Trump. The GOP did settle on the normal Mitt Romney in 2012, but not before whirlwind romances with Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry; Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Trump fits right in.

My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Finally because Herman Cain was killed by Trump Virus, he mentions the more than 150,000.
You know what's going to be sad? The fact that three former Presidents prior to  will probably show respect and condolences to his family and be willing to pay their respects to him on behalf of the nation and Trump couldn't do the same for John Lewis. That's sad.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There’s way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There’s little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.

Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain’s death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn’t leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.

trump knows he can’t change the election,he’s trying to cause confusion so people give up because they’ll believe his lies! Americans have to be smarter than that! Look at the facts! I have applied for my mail in ballot! This is NOT a new system! trump and his family used it!!!
Crying Chuckles whining as usual about President Trump, crying and using his best scare tactics. What a buffoon.
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.

The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Makes me cry every time I hear him now. What a contrast between his moral leadership and Trump’s complete lack of it.

Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?

Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.

Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE
The wall, what he's doing at the border, which is effecting nearby towns like Laredo. Also, rural Texans benefited the most from Obamacare, which is a pretty bad system, but not as bad as Trump makes it seem. etc.
Sure thing boss.
Breaking: Trump drops pants for Putin AGAIN....
Because a black man started it &amp; Trump went crazy
Getting help would be an admission (his brain) that he needs it &gt; in HIS mirror he still looks much the same...so he still does everything himself.....not trusting anyone to create that awesome Trump winning look ha....   * that cheap bronzer is quite the puzzle tho....
trump was in texas and none of yall wanted to recreate november 22nd, 1963? what a shame.
Damn third world country thinking they're smarter than us ! HUH?  Buddy we've got TRUMP...the Mr. Pillow Man....and now a true ringer - The Alien Demon Seed Witch Doctor - we don't need no stinkin' masks here....we kick ass #1
How do you see the future of America? Are you praying that Trump will save you? He’ll be gone in four years. Then what will you do? Find another savior? Or finally wake up and start saving the country yourself?
Donald Trump is the worst person in the history of our country. Must be spawned from #DemonSperm.
Trump's already taken care of that. 155,000 dead Americans and counting. 40 million lost jobs. Trillions in new debt. No strategy, no plan, promoting fake cures. Now go inject your Lysol.
Every day I read profiles that include the word conservative yet the timeline is constantly begging the government to do something. Do you realize that means you’re not really a conservative? The only thing I want Trump to do is do his job. Jail lawbreakers. All lawbreakers.
Now do Trump.
If God's in control, he hates Trump
If Trump wins this election, either by fair or dishonest means, the dollar will crash and we will be done for as a world power. Standard of living will drop. Alt-reality will be here to stay.
The more and more these undocumented people riot and protest, only makes me vote for Trump even more.
Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's wet dream.  He bows in submission to Putin, giving him ANYTHING he wants.    One of Russia's greatest wishes has been the withdrawal of Americans from our European allies.  Putin's slave (Trump) is withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.
So long as you act (in your daily life) like your views and your values don’t matter, guess what’s going to happen? They’re going to be ignored. People are filled with frustration over all the evil stuff going on, yet the knee-jerk reaction is to beg Trump to do something.
I think Trump is a great choice.
I fully expect him to end a press conference with a thumbs up and say "Vote Trump 2020"
Imagine paying the same for Trump’s roundtable as he paid for stormy Daniels’ silence.
She’s trying to talk shit about us for hating Trump but then she ends up blocking us! Makes sense
Trump’s acceptance is not required.    Of all Trump’s tricks, his best is to get his opposition to defend a corrupted system. By saying he won’t automatically accept the results of the election, his opponents commit to defending the election results if there is interference.
Well, the cult conspiracy vote is a very important segment of the Trump electorate. He's gotta go where his strengths are.  "Trust the plan." McGruber! 💥🔥💥
Trump literally can’t walk down a ramp or drink a glass of water with 1 hand
America has completely lost its mind. Either you're smart enough to be really worried, Or you're just too [fill in the blank] to care. Every single day with Trump is Russian Roulette.
Nope, just telling the truth. The truth hurts  doesn’t it. Mr. Trump
Actually Trump pulling troops out from Germany is not that big a deal and might in fact be good. *closes app*
I didn’t call Trump a racist. I’m not asking you to not call me racist. You could call me a cunt for all I care. You are entitled to your opinions. Some will hurt, but only the ones that have personal history. But that’s my own burden to carry.
Shoot  why not sooner if it's so important?  How long have you had the authority to do this?  One would think that it would have been done long ago unless this is a purely political move.  I'm not a Trump supporter so not saying it has anything to do with him.
The same reason the in-depth investigation into the Trump family’s fraudulent tax schemes was met with a collective yawn. How does he get away with this??
It looks like a world in which Trump enablers have been knocked out of the majority in the Senate, and I'm all in for that.
We agree. So endorse Biden.  It's the only patriotic option. We cannot survive another 4 years of this. Mary Trump knows it. We know it. You know it.
Trump is flying to West Texas, which is the center of the universe for global warming denial - literally the cryptonite behind the entire anti-science genetic sequence of the Republican party. Great place to re-energize their lunacy.
The Bots on Twitter are saying #NobodyLikesTrump  Which means nothing because 95% of America Loves Trump!
Be careful GOP you may turn off women on either side of aisle l think this is a time in history that l say tread carefully painting everyone as a progressive liberal does not fly with Trump in office such a strong fiscal conservative with great character
Oregon governor talked with Pence about getting Trump's Gestapo out of her state.
Trump is losing  Texas 🐘 Florida 🐘🐘 Michigan 🐘🐘🐘
LMAO!!! #CongressmanCOVID has the #TrumpVirus ! Plz tell me someone sent this to Trump??
Sorry 😐 ask Trump Base that Question reason he is office is White Evangelical You are Pro Life  that is reason he has that bloc btw he is not a conservative purely a White Nationalist
I think Trump has the name of really really good doctor who can cure him

God Rules Not Trump
It took FOUR YEARS to finally see Trump as an outed con? Yall... that's frightening. Not going to lie.
Corrupt Donald Trump is just a Trojan Horse for Vladimir Putin.
GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP.🙏😇🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
PLANO NOW  ...Representative John Lewis Funeral  ...President Bush &amp; President Clinton - Attending  ...President Obama - Attending  And Delivering Eulogy  ...President Trump - Declined To Attend:  Thanks
You're supposed to be on Twitter vacation!.. 😉   Every guy I know hates Hillary with a fury, but when quizzed knows nothing about her. Same idiots will insist that Trump has been treated unfairly.... thanks for your work here!
Imagine if Trump had a “Handler” leading him around...
You have no credibility period even his Maga fans know he is liar 🤥 cmon now l am conservative btw but you hope the Dems will return to prior party not happening nor will the  GOP sorry not voting for either guy this year but I certainly  wish you well on Trump he is toast
'They didn't run the plays': Ex-officials say Trump administration didn't use pandemic 'playbooks'  I don't know how he could have been more clear?? He had Dr Fauci and Dr Birk up there everyday for about a month telling us what they knew for us to do!
We took away my Mom's keys and then my Dad's.   It meant more driving for us, but it kept everyone safe.  When it's time, loving family steps in.  That's the problem for Trump - he has no loving family &amp; his supporters don't like him either.
"Never Trumpers have gained a new significance as part of the political coalition that could help defeat Trump’s reelection effort, and may just prove to have longer-term governance implications,"  and  write:
Trump is Ambition🐘🐘🐘🐘
He never respected President Trump. He never had the decency or etiquette to show any respect to our Commander and Chief so I think President Trump has done the right thing!Don't blame Trump for coronavirus deaths. Majority of Covid + people that die are obese with DM2 and hypertension, COVID- 19 just finished them off.
POTUS continues to erode public faith in elections. Does Trump work for the SVR/FSB? or is he an agent for the GRU? Obviously directed by Putin. Or - he could just be a kook.
I signed up for mail-in voting, but if Trump screws with the USPS and I can't trust my mail in ballot will be counted or delivered, I don't care if I have to drive 100 miles, stand in line for a week, wearing a mask, in temperatures below 0, I'm VOTING on November 3, 2020.
Don't believe Trump's team makes many, if any, mistakes. Sorry, not sorry! These criminals will not be able to walk down the street.
2015 when tRump decided to run
Lots of Trump/Putin calls of late....coaching sessions perhaps. 🤔
2020 has unveiled that there's a lot more racists in America than you originally thought.  Trump has brought back out all the racist termites out of the woodwork that otherwise wouldn't feel emboldened to spread those beliefs.  He makes xenophobes and bigots feel comfortable.
They’re going to test a straight-jacketed trump with face guard, because polls show  MAGAmericans like them some crazy
As if YouTube didn’t just censor licensed doctors from sharing vital Information to the American public, it’s not science the Trump “cult” is in denial of its the mainstream media and big tech.
Forget the hypocrisy and think about it this way. Repubs got wiped out in 2008 when the incumbent at fault for the mess wasn't even on the ballot. Consider how many more rats are deserting the Trump ship versus Bush.
It won’t matter, she has it all documented and secure as a backup plan.   If she dies it will ALL come out.   Hey will have to choose who to pin all this shit on.  We will never know all.  As you can bet both parties are involved.  I just think Trump has made too many ppl mad.
But may he still RIP...I just wish he had followed science instead of Trump.🙏🏻
This is FALSE. It’s floated around last 1 1/2 years. Maybe 2 years. Trump loves WOMEN, period. We’ve known that forever. STOP LYING!
You are correct.  I misstated my facts...over 80% of immigrants come in via air...however it's only 40% that overstay their visas and become undocumented immigrants.  I am not a republican nor blind trump follower so I can admit when I am wrong..
Trump knew and Definitely knews what he was doing. The pandemic was an Excellent excuse for him to throw the Election off.The worse it got and the more he denied it being real (which he knew it was) Was all trickery. If he made thing bad enough people wouldn't  be able to vote.
They have to do this in order to get him to do anything. Trump runs on hamberders, diet coke, stimulants, and, most importantly, flattery.
Sort of like "collusion" and "conspiracy". Trump folk sure do like their obnoxious semantics arguments
Only Congress can write immigration law. That’s in the law books. Activist judges are demanding that the Trump admin break the law as it is written.
Trump Murdered him!
New theory, Trump is only hiding tax returns because he can't let his kids find out they have no real money (Ivanka knew and locked down Jared's fortune).
And your a dispicable liar. Herman Caine had stage 4 cancer and had chemotherapy. Those are the kind who die from COVID. It was HIS CHOICE TO GO TO THE RALLY. NOBODY FORCED HIM. He DID wear a mask. Who cares what you want to make up so Trump looks bad. You look bad for lying.
I think it’s Trump and GOP.  He hired Acosta.  Epstein died on his watch.   The Netflix doc showed Trump.   I think August is going to be pretty interesting...
The guy that cut the deal with Epstein to keep Epstein free...Trump appointed as Labor Secretary.  Epstein died under Trumps watch.   He wished Ghislane well.  And then there are all the pics.   All roads lead to Trump.   Beautiful August it will be.  👍🥳🥳
I will say, your criminal record gets brought in to this privilege. I’m not 100% certain if it was for this or for the Known Traveler Number because we did them close to the same time, but finger prints and background check was even done before you qualified.
These are documents of sworn testimony, I’d trust them over a Leftist any day of the week. And three times on Sunday. Bill is named in them and he’s on the flight log, but gee no Trump anywhere. Idiot.
Trump rebuilds our military while our Democrat colleagues tear it down. One day we may need this might and while the liberal hippy Americans cower in their safe places, Trump will take care of business rightfully👍🏼
Hiding in mar a Lago. Just cannot be there with trump, they are both too fat to fit
Also, anyone who thinks that Donald Trump is going to take down an elite sex trafficking ring is absolutely delusional.
Trump raised the audacious idea while continuing his all-out campaign against mail-in voting. He sought to contrast mail-in voting with “good” absentee voting, even though they are the same thing in most states.   Yes Stupid Trump Does It Again
You guys hacking again? Trump delivers for Putin.  #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump  Tick Tock
Donald Trump is the reason why a lot of kids just like myself will not be having a senior year. His lack of leadership and acknowledgment of the virus, ignoring the health officials appointed to him, refusing to wear a mask, hollding rallies during a pandemic, and continuesly
No way are they going to release anything on Trump I am sure Barr has taken care of that until after the election
What did they teach you and Trump at UPenn?
I understand the point you are trying to make using your religious beliefs. I don't think you are pro Trump. I think you're trying to be pro-kindness.
Are you 100% sure Trump isn't a puppet? 🤔
Maybe DL as well. Lot’s of personal information necessary
Yeah this is a Q issue. It’s kinda funny how they support trump and his pedo friends who took advantage of young girls for years. Sad.
It’s rather safe. It’s the same as getting the Known Traveler Number for traveling, etc. If it’s good enough for that, why not good enough for my vote? Do it once, it’s good for a few years. Reapply every so often?
The only thing Duceys done is hide under his desk waiting for instructions from daddy trump .

I know people where the signature didn’t quite match, or the info didn’t quite match, even though it was legitimate, and it was regected and they had to go in to verify it was them. Mine have always matched. You can track your ballot as well.
We didn’t need all of them back in 2016 to win. Best believe that Trump is only adding to the base that got him elected before.
Of great interest in the #GhislaineMaxwell first set of documents is mention of an individual (name redacted) who offered modeling jobs, which led to them being trafficked. Miss America? Trump Model Management was formed in ‘99. Only an observation. Hotel magnate also mentioned.
you get the ballot via mail after you verify registration for that election cycle via the personal information. Then you fill out the ballot. You have to sign it and provide a phone #
Personal info no one would know unless you were majorly hacked. SSN, b-date, name, address, etc... a few more things I can’t remember. To prove you are you. Then they send the ballot. They have your signature on file as well.
Are you sure Trump isn't a puppet? 🤔
1st time, you go in with DL and maybe even Birth certificate and/or passport. I can’t remember. That’s what was years ago. Now, it’s registration with verification of personal information via a website.

I just say, be informed. Really be informed. If you agree with Trump’s policies, vote for Trump. If you don’t, then don’t. But sadly, I feel like he’s already planning on losing and therefore blaming voter fraud. Be informed. Understand the likelihood of fraud actually happening
He is taking it one day at a time with all you dip shits.  The Pres  TRUMP
At least Obama released logs.   Hell who knows what corrupt trump is doing.
Oops... typing too fast. A few typos, but I think you get what I’m saying
Trump should give Americans the proof that votes will be bad, fraudulent or somehow wrong! State voting commissions do NOT HAVE proof. Trump’s dementia is starting to effect him. Sad. He should drop out.
I honestly don’t remember. I registered years ago. But with the information they expect with each voting cycle, you’d have to be majority hacked with identity theft before anyone could impersonate you. MAJORILY! Easier to get an ID than go thru this
YES WE ARE!!! President Trump!
You held it up for 2 months....  Now you're all in a big hurry to use the bill to fund the (White House addition) included in the relief package..  Tell me senator, what does a new FBI bldg, next to Trump hotel, have to do with coronavirus???
Giddy Kitty Trump Kitty.
No wonder you filled the bill with unnecessary PORK. The FBI BUILDING. Do you honestly think Americans are interested in building a new building in the same place so no hotel developer can put a real hotel next to Trump’s. Big payday for Trump. You are a bunch of goons.
Loule
I don’t like trump but let be far
BTW, I’m in IT. Don’t you think it would be easier to hack an electronic voting machine versus conspiring to commit mass mail-in-voter fraud? Which do you think is safer? Believe me, mail-in would be safer!
When trump killed Muslims?
Trump should give Americans the proof that votes will be bad, fraudulent or somehow wrong! State voting commissions do NOT HAVE proof. Trump’s dementia is starting to effect him. Sad. He should drop out.
Unrelated wish list items???  Like a new FBI bldg in downtown Washington DC?    You know... the location near Trump hotel?   🤔
Then do you think if war start between you and your Pakistan trump going to send troops and help you ? 🤣
Exactly, Trump is in there and it is redacted or it’s somewhere.  Fact.
In India there is more then 100000 problems why the fuck to try and discuss your problems instead you hop trump win so he can support India ?
Trump should be impeached, again, for even suggesting a delay in the election.
Had Trump not stopped travel it would have been much higher! Quadruple geniuses Pelosi and Schumer criticizing his every move.  The rioting sure isn’t by Trump supporters but glad you are acknowledging that they are rioters. Now will Democrat mayors and Governors do something?
It’s only a handful of states that send out mass mail-in-ballots. Not sure which states. But you have to see if those states alone would swing an election to validate your conspiracy theory. Those are the only possible states that fraud is likely to occur.
Senate majority leader, it is time for you to get out of the way of Trump and keep quiet on the edge of the swampy, OR you can get busy passing legislation the House passed months ago. Know why?? It is obvious you want to show little production from the pitiful Senate.
I respectfully disagree since my state allows us to register in advance and mail in our ballots. Can’t speak for all state, but you also can’t call ALL mail-in-ballots fraudulent. You have to be rigistered and eligible to vote.
I'm with you Amy. 100% Trump

You totally have Trump’s number.
Thanks, Trump
Your reply sounded like you were talking about the mail-in-voting. I tried to say that even Trump’s own studies that he funded came back that the mail-in-voting was a 6 in 1 billion chance of fraud. Not enough to sway an election. Read for yourself
Sorry Lyndsey, it is your fella Trump that began the politicizing of courts. Just watch Yrump and Barr.
You know I was thinking if Biden would say China if You got information on Trump show us the emails. The other side would be outraged, But should they be?
And you are definitely a blind, Trump follower. Should have known better than to waste time trying to explain.
The Trump Kiss of Death.
Trump at Herman Cain's funeral TRUMP: "I knew Herman, he died of the #TrumpVirus but so have 154,442 other Americans ... meh ... I'm really ahead in the polls but we should delay the election cuz #NobodyLikesMe "
“Politicizing a funeral...”   Trump politicized masks and thousands continue to die because of it. You can’t even parody this stuff anymore.
See Cenk is still  trying to overcome his embarrassing election night antics when Trump overcame Hillary’s 98% certain victory.  My favorite video of all time.  LMFAO
So we will have to worry about your tweets until you become president? What if trump stomps you like you know he will? Will your tweets still be worrisome? What a dumb tweet
You have no morals at all. When your out,I pray your investigated and held to the same laws you and trump family though didn't apply to you people. Republicans are without morals and know,if they loose power this election it will be 10 yrs before we trust them a little again.
Trump can't delay the election. But his tweet is terrifying           (by Erwin Chemerinsky)
You mean if Trump showed up, the ultimate conman? He would be an uninvited interloper bragging about himself  President Obama said what John Lewis could no longer say. He was invited. He honored John and made it all about John and John's legacy.
You have no problem with trump funneling payments,made just below the amount to have to report to IRS,In 48 separate payments. Hes paid his own companies and JR's 😿 Millions of dollars funneled through her company and parscals company got 39 million. Why small payments,no trace?
He doesn’t look at the big picture or the long term approach. If he did, maybe he wouldn’t have gone bankrupt 6 times.
Must Read Article  Insert: The Trump campaign is now pulling the plug on all of its advertising while it tries to figure out what’s going so horribly wrong with its strategy
My sentiments  exactly! Trump 2020+
I could go on, but honestly, help me understand. I don’t see anything good about his policies or his ethics. I’m not a fund all the illegals, either. He’s a bully. Honestly, with his approach, all of his “winnings” are not sustainable.
Trump Giddy Kitty #Trump #catslovetrump2020 #POTUS #FLOTUS
Yes and that generation will be out voted soon enough.  It is coming.  Fact.   Everyone actually knows it.  That is why Trump is saying is you vote for Biden, things will never be the same.  Regardless we are as a nation due to the younger..headed that direction.
He’s blantantly trying to defund government funded entities and fund them with capitalist companies. It may be the right thing to do... not sure, but then open it up for competition. Not just his “friends”.
Trump cheated in the last election so of course he is trying to cheat this one too.
Mr neither. I read about it but never actually saw it. Here you go
He could have done this in March.  Too late Donnie. People are jobless. People are hungry. People going homeless.  People are dying.  Trump delivers for Putin. Putin wants Americans dead. #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump  #VOTE
The Republicans and Tricky Donny Trump setting up the post office for failure and to stop mail in voting to try and keep their jobs in Washington and so he can manipulate a te-election this is CRIMINAL
He’s the epitome of white privilege. How do you think he understands what the real working man is going through? He doesn’t believe in Science? But he wants Science (vaccines) to save us from Covid?
Her ads in Arizona are disgusting and typical Trump style. I voted against her once and I will vote against her again. Kelly will do a good job.
Help me understand how you think Trump is helping? I see a country in more turmoil now than I ever recall in my life. He’s all about capitalism, but at all cost. He’s not a man of the people. How could he be? He’s never had to earn anything on his own.
Not that I need to explain myself, but Trump’s conspiracy theories are not based on real, viable facts. You don’t have to be dem or rep to see that. Find the proof. If you find the proof of all of Trump’s claims, please show them to me.
3 days to go for this years promise of a plan and still waiting on the unveiling of the PHENOMENAL healthcare plan promised in June 2019! 👇🏼

Biden is not really a step.  It will take a long time to undo the damage Trump has done.  Biden is a start.  Voting for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.   Trump is honestly more than 2 steps back, than the direction you want the country to go.

They should pay more taxes.  Biden is a start.  Trump is reverse.  You work your way up.  Never will get there by taking 2 steps back.
Yeah, and like being trump’s campaign manager is something to brag about...or admit to.
I call bullshit!! My SOCIAL SECURITY card came by mail my tax returns and payments are made by mail. Trump’s letter for the stimulus check came by mail. Wasted taxpayers money but it came.
The only trump book worth buying is Mary Trump’s “Too Much and Never Enough.”
Hm, interesting timeline:  June 20 - Herman Cain among those “fed up” with wearing masks while attending Trump rally  June 29 - Herman Cain gets test results showing he had COVID-19, and is immeciately hospitalized.  July 30 - Cain dies of COVID-19 having never left the hospital
So if you voted trump you can’t protest against human trafficking 😂
Exactly what President Trump is doing.  Expose the deep state, send them to Gitmo, reverse decades of regulation that were meant to hinder small businesses, and implement a new digital dollar backed by Gold (....wait for it - should be October).  Even more is coming!
Puh -leeze! ALL of the parents I know are terrified to send their children to school without changes in how the learning is provided &amp; proper social distancing measures in place. Biden supporters are NOT radical, but rational thinkers. Everything tRump is just wrong for everyone.
Why? Is he going to deliver it to PUTIN? Trump delivers to PUTIN.  #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump
You mean like how Herman was safe in Trump's America after he was made to sign that waver? Right.......................... You are pitiful excuse for a man.
Ya a fake impeachment I guess when you get your ass handed to you I guess you must try every dirty trick, it must suck to try all that fake bullshit since the left are sore LOSSERS BOO HOO, YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO TRY IT ALL AGAIN ARTER TRUMP WINS AGAIN. LOOOOSSSEEERRR
Lol.  It’s hilarious how you cultists cling to that one story.  How about Trump making Acosta a member of his cabinet?
We need a law that prevents low IQ individuals to seek the presidency!!! Individuals such as Orange 🍊Man= Trump!
No do Acosta being a member of Trump’s cabinet.  Now do “I wish her well.”  If you don’t think Epstein killed himself (I don’t) do you even realize you’re accusing Bill Barr of covering up his murder?
Yes I agree.  But Eisenhower was a war hero.  And Trump is a crook and a disgrace to humanity.
Watching Obama’s Lewis speech.  Trump is a racist, I needed to be reminded.
#TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump Trump delivers for Putin.
I hear ya seester. Things are crazy. I don't wish ill will on any person, but I do wish Trump supporters would wake up and smell the coffee or the science, or we'll continue to see the death toll rise. They wouldn't eat spoiled food if a doc said it was bad, why not listen now?
Why does most of DC get to go to John Lewis's funeral yet we can't be with our families when our loved ones die?!? It's all political! You know you can't beat Trump at the polls! Just wait until November!
Excuses for Trump losing. But it just might be he is a loser and nobody likes him.
Oh, you mean the Trump virus?  The one you ignored for months? The one you said would go away? That virus?
That says so much about you, not Trump.
October surprise is a rehash of the supposed spying on trump in 2016. Possible indictments coming for Obama and Biden plus dozens more. Do you think that with everything going on anyone is going to care?
Does he know your Putins delivery boy? Trump delivers for Putin  #TrumpDeliveryBoy  #EvictTrump
I noticed that trump mentioned CA, WA, and NV today, but not AZ, TX, and FL. 🤔
you’re one of those people (stupid) who support trump no matter what he does! Wake the f*** up!!! Get off my tv!!!
Right, so thats happened for 4 more years.  Plus 150k dead.  What will the vote for Trump buy you next?  You will not get m4a.
Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response  via
All of the above will happen with Trump, plus among many other things.  Covid whoknows what is next.  The choice last time already killed 150k.  Next time it will be in the millions.Yeah, what about Melania and her trip as a mail-order wife for Trump?
Delay the election? Victor Davis Hanson explains why President Trump doesn't need to alter the system
YOU are the one not understanding. And obv haven’t read the thread where I started off by saying that an absentee ballot you need to request and the mail in voting Trump is speaking of you do not. Many states have strict rules over WHO can get an absentee. Don’t be rude
No, I feel sorry for us as a nation.  I'm including his cult, they have lost too.  He was damaged all of.  Internationally, we are suffering due to his inept leadership.  We and generations after us will pay for his 4 years of terror.  Trump and the GOP have given us PTSD.
So, do you get paid to lie and apologize for trump, or do you do it for free?
Trump retweeted one of his supporters yelling white power.
That's a rapid response?   Snide remark about a puppet show.  Trump should be running for president of his third grade class.
Wishing his family peace and comfort.  So many have tragically died for no other reason then trump's stupidity.
USPS will be lucky to make it.  trump does not want mail-in ballots.  He will do whatever it takes.
I'd like to see Andrew Cuomo and trump in a cage match.
The power to remove Trump from office.
“To some degree” is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
I miss when we had REAL Presidents.  Pres. Obama, Pres. Bush and Pres. Clinton.  Now we have cheeto trump...killing us.
TRUMP is the only person to give up his salary.   We have 446 former members of Congress who receive government pensions who are lobbyist on both sides of aisle.   Does that make any sense? NO. We even have people in prison who receive pensions.   We need to end this madness.
But she called it a republican hoax, right? Of course she made fun of trump, everybody makes fun of trump. He's a clown. We elected a man with no political experience, no previous employment, no military service, as POTUS. A vainglorious braggart and bully.
Larry, there's always a tweet. “Leadership: Whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen, you’re responsible.” Trump 2013
So, Dems forced Trump to hold his last rally and made Herman go to it without a mask? Can you find that clip of Nancy saying it will go away like a miracle? All those libs discrediting Dr. Fauci? Calling the virus a hoax? I'll wait.
If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about “mail in voting”, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.
I guess Trump is right and the campaign is going fine.
Trump has never, and this is true, owned a pet, let alone a dog. Think about that.
Yes, we will crack open some trump vodka, grill some trump steaks, stare for a moment at our diploma from trump U, then catch a trump shuttle to Atlantic City to gamble at one of his fine casinos. Like that.
Oh, you think he was happy? Lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator? Other than a tax break for the wealthy, tRump hasn't kept any of his promises. Turns out he wasn't too busy to gold and Mexico didn't pay for the wall. Economy in the toilet and 150,000 dead. Whee!
Pretty sure we all knew that. If you didn't before, Trump was playing that card pretty strongly (🤭)about a month or so ago.
Cannot wait to vote Trump gone on 10/3
My worry is also that now Trump has installed one of his flunkies to run the USPS. Do I trust him to get ballots where they should go? Nope!
I love them. Such pretty ladies!!!  Dogs are the best.  My dogs have really been supportive during this time.  Here they are when trump is on TV.  Keno turns his back and Jamie hides in her bed.  (I may have made this up.)

trump still wont pay respects to Civil Rights Leader John Lewis. trump is a disgusting and corrupt president.
That's Donald Trump. Instead of celebrating a civil rights leader like John Lewis he would rather celebrate stupidity in Herman Cain. All is had to do was wear a mask but when you listen to stupid you do stupid things and his stupidity took his life.
Don’t get me started on the millions of $ grifted by the trump family in the past 4 years.  He’s a failure and a farce.  #Biden2020
tRump wants to delay the election but he does not have the power to do that. Can Congress move election day sooner? Let's say in SEP. Let's end this madness of a blatantly inept regime. Or we are still stuck with the sycophants in the Senate who would block the move?
I can’t stand Trump and cannot wait until he’s gone - but on this he is correct. If you want to vote absentee, you must request a mail ballot for each election cycle. If we were to use mail in ballots, they would just be mailed to all registered voter at their last known address
I love America, and for that reason I would NEVER vote Trump
I can’t stand Trump, but there IS a difference. An absentee ballot must be requested by the voter. Mail in ballots would be mailed out to all registered voters.
My vote didn’t go to Trump in 2016, but the man thought I “listened” to and supported him because I follow him on Twitter.   He’s the President of the United States.  Regardless of what I, or anyone else, think(s), his opinions matter and are being misrepresented ALL THE TIME.
It's tragic. I am sorry he listened to trump.  I wish his family peace and comfort.
I'm in Texas things are not coming down. #pressconference #trump # #COVID
Total failure by Trump
“The doctor even admits its should be taken with caution. BUT YOU PUSH IT AS A CURE!! You’re full of $&amp;*(*#$$!”  And I could not stop laughing, because I’ve never heard a retired “professional,” talk the way he did. He HATED Trump, and I showed, it really did. Terrifying.
We are with you Governor. Let’s make America great again and allow the honorable Mr Donald Trump 4 more years to get this country running again
This is BS, just because he was a Trump supporter.
Trump's West wing #AddAWordRuinATVShow
Trump is trolling Mr. Turley.  He does this all the time.
Herman Cain at the Trump rally.
I feel as though crediting a president with jobs is like crediting him with low gas prices and the stock market (both of which Trump has done). However, he has no real effect on any of those things. Can you genuinely say your standard of living is better now than it was in 2015?
Obama was never a true American citizen. Maybe Trump was right — again.
“Pretty good” - only 160+ who should NOT be dead. If folks like you &amp; Trump would stop lying about masks &amp; hydroxychloroquine. And, why is it always “Democrats” or “Liberals with you?” How about Democrats, Independents, doctors, nurses, and MOST Republicans?
Speaking of Cain. Why hasn't Trump responded to his death? He is the one responsible for it after all. Had it not been for that unnecessary rally Cain would still be alive. Makes Trump an accomplice to        ,  I will let you fill in the blank.
Something about trump should be trending.  How about #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpIsKillingAmericans  #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpIsNotWell   Any of those?

Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That’s the only reason you’d hope to delay. Because you know he’s going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Trump is such a petty, small, jealous man.
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?
Trump's America
is trying to distract from John Lewis's funeral.  Because trump is a petty little man who will always be overshadowed by greater men. And women.
Honestly, now that Trump has his high donor flunky running the USPS, I no longer want mail in voting - because I do not trust that Dems will receive their ballots or that those ballots will make it back to be counted via the USPS.
Everyone calm down. Trump has no control over this. If he does somehow causes a non-election then the right people are in place to remove him within 48 hours.
He went to one trump rally too many.
Trump had nothing to do with that. Propaganda!
Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?
I think 1 way would be to have Secys. of States loyal to Trump refuse to certify the results?
I remember my oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.  Trump and every elected Republican who supports trump's assault on the Constitution is the enemy.
I cant wait to see all the Trumpers trying to call bs on the election.  Clowns.  I'm ready for them to feel the pain I've felt having to deal w/ Trump's sorry ass for the last 4 years.   Literally the WORST president ever. EVER.  (Yes I would have taken Hillary over him, stfu)
You think Donald Trump supports Democracy?   Have you been asleep these past three years?
The moment Trump rerouted data away from the CDC to the partisan HHSC is precisely the moment the COVID books started being cooked.  With respect to seeing the Coronavirus numbers, Trump has blinded us as a nation.  #ImpeachTrump    via
Hi, I'm planning on voting in person, is that still allowed? Or do I need to sign something promising to vote for Trump? Is that how democracy works now?
Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Apply that logic to red state management; for instance Gov Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, Herman Cain chose to go to the Trump rally and he appeared to be having a wonderful time. RIP, Mr. Cain.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?🤪😜🤪😜🤪😜
BREAKING NEWS: Cain, who called the coronavirus a hoax, spoke out against wearing masks, and most likely contracted it from a Trump Rally, has died from...  The coronavirus.
He committed suicide willingly for Trump. Nobody made him go, as far as we're aware.
Another reminder that people need to take this shit seriously. Herman went to that Trump rally, strutting around without a mask, likely contracted the virus there and now he's dead because of his decision.
seems to be agreeing with me!  Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‘INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT’ vote
Anyone in Congress who, when asked, doesn't emphatically state that Trump can't delay the election needs to lose their seat.
They don't hate the drug, they hate Trump.  If Obama was in office the wonders of this drug would be leading every news channel in the US.
At the same time, his potential VP is threatening Trump voters with harassment
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
People are falsely claiming that if the election gets postponed that Pelosi with act as interim come Jan 20th when Trump's term is up per the Constitution, but this is false because literally every member of the House is up for reelection. Their terms are up same day, same time.
Trump suggests delay of election:         Good suggestion because: 1) Resolving pandemic. 2) fraudulent mail in voting. #1
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don’t think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‘Trump Respects The Constitution’, it is ‘Trump cannot garner the required support to do a coup’.

If we have learned anything so far, it is that Trump is perpetually full of shit. But Democrats are not prepared for an event where Trump/Republicans see the writing on the wall and tell their voters to stay home, purposefully staging the results to make them look fraudulent.
Too bad we can't just pretend there's no trump..  Donald Trump’s Campaign Is Pretending There’s No Pandemic
Remember when with no proof they said Obama would try this? Now we have proof that Trump will try it. Vote accordingly.
And Trump held a party.  No masks. No social distancing.  It's a new day and #TrumpKillsTexans
Naturally, the media and ppl who suffer from an extreme case of #TrumpDerangementSyndrome jumped to immediate conclusions.  I don't have a #bias against Trump, so I can look at things from an objective POV; plus I don’t scream at or demonize someone for not sharing my opinion! 🤷‍♀️
No. The only way they can be reelected is if they remain complicit with Trump in some half baked attempt to have a Putin style election, which the American People wont stand for. THUGS!

Because that one epidemiologist agrees with Trump.  And Dear Leader can never, ever be wrong.  I mean, what's the point of joining a cult if one must apply critical thinking skills?
This is the doctor the President, his idiot son and all the conservatives were retweeting yesterday.  She *literally* called it a cure.
They made a perfect case once again for why we MUST vote for Trump and all Republicans running for Senate and House seats.

So you missed this video being pushed by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Breitbart and a host of other conservative outlets?  Sure...

Are they going to talk about the money Trump enterprises is skimming from the RNC?
Yeah, when Trump crushes Biden!
Fauci has more than kept his cool. Very few people could manage better in the Trump Circus.
About a week ago, I saw a meme of Trump with a bowl of mashed potatoes on his head.  Wish I had kept it.
It sends a clear signal to Putin that he should help get Trump re-elected and, in exchange, Trump will do whatever he wants him to.
Six...that’s how many conversations Trump has had with Putin since March when we learned that Russia put a bounty on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  And he didn’t bring this up in any of those conversations.
Is there a push to undermine President Trump?  Why won't the Republicans put on their gloves and fight fire with fire.  The Democrats are running roughshod over the Republicans.  I don't want socialism, government controlled healthcare, raised taxes, etc.
So, instead of quietly shifting troops to other areas, which would help a longtime ally save face, Trump makes a big, blowhard announcement the day after he had a meeting with his handler, Vladimir Putin.  Also, it's been three weeks since Bountygate. Not a word.

Reality? Hahahaha! If you were REALLY in reality, you'd know that Trump didn't cause any deaths. But Gov. Cuomo sure did. I would venture to say that Nancy Pelosi contributed to the death toll, as well as Mayor De Blasio.
So basically if you make a good appearance on TV and seem to agree with Trump, he wants to consider them an expert. He doesn’t even vet these people to make sure they are credible. He counts on his supporters being dumb.
As do I. Which is why I push back on “Doctors” like this woman spreading untested stories, and then those being amplified by Trump
Then they’d have to FIRST prove to a court that the FISA was improperly filed, and get a positive ruling on that,and then they’d have to further prove that Obama/ Biden KNEW it was, and ALSO prove that there was “spying” on the Trump campaign at all. Not enough time for all that
was never the same after all the teeth were chipped, cracked and broken, because Trump made him chew marbles to teach him a lesson about opening his mouth.
Mr. Trump, do you understand ANYTHING about science or even just basic math and numbers? You brag about the 55+ Million Covid tests performed in the US. Admirable. However, on a tests-per-capita basis (do u understand that?) we are currently 21st in the world!

Yup. In his own words. Trump IS a racist.
Maybe, you should see this an a learning opportunity. You are NOT a good president Mr. Trump. Maybe if you DON’T act like a self-serving, callous, racist, wannabe-know-it-all, people wouldn’t criticize you so much. Just a thought. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Any idea why President Trump drives so many white female lesbians into a psychosis that they feel they must act on in public?Funny how Democrats cherry pick the constitution. Last I heard Democrats thought it was an outdated document that needed to be brought into the real world.

All I can say is look at the company that he was with! Howard Stern has demons among him, and he is a pervert! I can judge for myself what is evil, and what is good! I sent Trump a warning also, but weather he read it is another thing. I hate the evil in the hearts of men!
Curiously that is how long I have been free from demonic oppression!  If u r talk about Trump I really don’t care! What man on this earth is qualified to make things great! That other puppet is not any better! No one sees liberals for the evil they are, or the curses they bring!
Trump is the problem.  And the GOP earned this awful burden.
if Trump says we’re getting stimulus checks bigger than 1200 then we’re getting checks bigger than 1200! Last time I checked Trump is in charge! Not the Democrats or the GOP! #Trump2020

Upon losing the election, Trump's fade into irrelevance will be one of the most amazing transitions ever. Most of us will simply be done with him. He'll claim to be a martyr and that the system is rigged, but his tweets won't matter anymore.

Why leave out that he traveled a lot before and after the rally and could have gotten it from traveling? Must suck to think Trump Trump Trump 24/7.
There's no doubt Trump will claim illegitimacy in the election if he loses. But that election will be on 11/3. He can't change that date or dismiss the results.

“To some degree” is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
TRUMP is the only person to give up his salary.   We have 446 former members of Congress who receive government pensions who are lobbyist on both sides of aisle.   Does that make any sense? NO. We even have people in prison who receive pensions.   We need to end this madness.

If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about “mail in voting”, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.

Oh, you think he was happy? Lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator? Other than a tax break for the wealthy, tRump hasn't kept any of his promises. Turns out he wasn't too busy to gold and Mexico didn't pay for the wall. Economy in the toilet and 150,000 dead. Whee!
Pretty sure we all knew that. If you didn't before, Trump was playing that card pretty strongly (🤭)about a month or so ago.
Cannot wait to vote Trump gone on 10/3
My worry is also that now Trump has installed one of his flunkies to run the USPS. Do I trust him to get ballots where they should go? Nope!

As opposed to $30B for military hardware, $2B for a new FBI HQ that just happens to eliminate a potential competitor to the Trump hotel?
That's Donald Trump. Instead of celebrating a civil rights leader like John Lewis he would rather celebrate stupidity in Herman Cain. All is had to do was wear a mask but when you listen to stupid you do stupid things and his stupidity took his life.
Don’t get me started on the millions of $ grifted by the trump family in the past 4 years.  He’s a failure and a farce.  #Biden2020
tRump wants to delay the election but he does not have the power to do that. Can Congress move election day sooner? Let's say in SEP. Let's end this madness of a blatantly inept regime. Or we are still stuck with the sycophants in the Senate who would block the move?
I can’t stand Trump and cannot wait until he’s gone - but on this he is correct. If you want to vote absentee, you must request a mail ballot for each election cycle. If we were to use mail in ballots, they would just be mailed to all registered voter at their last known address
I can’t stand Trump, but there IS a difference. An absentee ballot must be requested by the voter. Mail in ballots would be mailed out to all registered voters.

Trump's likely hoping he'll contract the virus so he can claim health issue and drop out, or die a martyr.  I frankly don't give a shit, either way.  Although, it would be entertaining to watch Trump's kids fight over who gets to pull the plug.
Because you know trump is going to lose. That’s the only reason you’d hope to delay. Because you know he’s going to get thrown out in a landslide loss
Trump is such a petty, small, jealous man.
Can Congress really do nothing to defend the Constitution and our democracy and remove the deranged lunatic trump?
Trump's America
is trying to distract from John Lewis's funeral.  Because trump is a petty little man who will always be overshadowed by greater men. And women.
Honestly, now that Trump has his high donor flunky running the USPS, I no longer want mail in voting - because I do not trust that Dems will receive their ballots or that those ballots will make it back to be counted via the USPS.
Trump can't have dirt on all 198 Republican Representatives and 53 Republican senators, can he?  Are they ALL really THAT corrupt?
I think 1 way would be to have Secys. of States loyal to Trump refuse to certify the results?
I remember my oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.  Trump and every elected Republican who supports trump's assault on the Constitution is the enemy.
You think Donald Trump supports Democracy?   Have you been asleep these past three years?
Hi, I'm planning on voting in person, is that still allowed? Or do I need to sign something promising to vote for Trump? Is that how democracy works now?
Keep clinging to trump.  See how far he can drag you down.  All Republican politicians need to be jailed.
Apply that logic to red state management; for instance Gov Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, Herman Cain chose to go to the Trump rally and he appeared to be having a wonderful time. RIP, Mr. Cain.
Sorry, but the Republican leaders, largely educated and successful people, are literally killing the less informed by taking the stance they take on the virus, masks, etc.  Cain was as much a murderer as trump and the rest. He told those who listen to him not worry.  He can rot.
Stop wearing Trump's ass on your face and realize that it's his failed reaction to the pandemic that caused 150k+ Americans to die.
Great idea.  While he's at it, try all the other treatments Trump's suggested; lysol (I believe lemon scented works best), sun lamps or tanning booths. Can someone tell me if there is some kind of special oxygen pumped into the White House that contains crazy juice?🤪😜🤪😜🤪😜
BREAKING NEWS: Cain, who called the coronavirus a hoax, spoke out against wearing masks, and most likely contracted it from a Trump Rally, has died from...  The coronavirus.
He committed suicide willingly for Trump. Nobody made him go, as far as we're aware.
seems to be agreeing with me!  Trump suggests delaying election, warns mail-in ballots to result in ‘INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT’ vote
I remember his big, maskless smile at Trump’s Omaha rally.
Trump's words are indistinguishable from those of third-world dictators. He MUST lose by a wide margin in November
Maybe they will cancel mail-in voting. I am will Trump cancel until we can vote in person. We closed our country down because of this virus why can we cancel the vote until it is over.
Always trying to devise ways to cheat!
Ultimately, I don’t think he moves the election or the worst-case scenarios come to fruition. But the reasoning is not ‘Trump Respects The Constitution’, it is ‘Trump cannot garner the required support to do a coup’.

I mean you could just be ideologically opposed for voting for someone with sexual assault accusations. I don't blame anyone if that's their reason for not voting. Trump just has even more, and one of them is going to win the presidency, and one of them is more dangerous.
I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.
I'm not going to be using write-ins or voting third party but I do not understand the whole "a third party vote is a vote for Trump" thing. Sure, it isn't an effective vote AGAINST Trump. But its a vote for who you voted for. Seems like a stupid lib take to me.
The problem with Trump's mental state is, for his co-conspirators (VP &amp; Cabinet) a feature, and not a bug.
45 please stop texting me and the emails. I would vote for a lump of coal bf i vote for you. #trump

The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if trump or those in congress purchased Kodak stock last week well before announce they would be tagged to make drug ingredients. It's up 400%.  Something smells rotten and it ain't in trash can. 😡
He's combining some fundraising Wednesday with his first trip to an oil and gas rig and to his first visit as president to the Permian Basin.

The doctor featured in the video has made other troubling claims, including medicine is being made by using alien DNA and sex with “tormenting spirits” is responsible for gynecological problems.
He pretended to be a trump supporter to get into a meeting with trump which he used to free many wrongfully imprisoned people
“doesn’t fit THEIR agenda” 😂😂 as if Trump doesn’t have an agenda? why couldn’t he get a more reputable doctor to make these claims then? throws credibility out the window when what this woman has said in the past is put into the context..
The Trump administration is dismantling DACA. We've had ENOUGH.   Send your senator a letter demanding they defund ICE &amp; pass permanent solutions without hurting people by supporting HR6, the Dream and Promise Act. Join the fight with

Followers, I hope you ALL know how critical it is for America to re-elect Donald Trump in November!!! If we don’t, America as we have know it for 244 years will turn to communism!!!! Can’t believe ANY American wants that but it’s obvious that Democrats do!!!

Fellow conservatives:  Don't be afraid if the Democrats win the White House and the Senate; they don't have any ideas anyway. They are running on the following platform: "Elect us! We are lame, but President Trump is crazy."  #ProcessThat

Trump loves to repeat this lie constantly - he hasn't lowered drug prices, they've gone up. Whats more interesting is  when repeating this lie, the years since his claimed last drop in drug prices varies between 46 and 54 years.
They will leave as soon as Biden is sworn in. After that moment, Trump and his cronies hold no power

Trump knew Hydroxychloroquine worked in the beginning. Maybe not a cure but has been effective at treating many patients. Sad their hate cost lives
Seeing trump ads trying to pain biden as a radical leftist is one of the most obvious plot "twists" of 2020 so far. They have only one game plan.
Really not sure why all these idiots are commenting about Biden or Trump on this tweet. Like seriously, go find a tweet not about a missing child, to troll. Normal people actually care about Madeleine enough yo have the respect to not spam this post with irrelevant remarks.
I live in Texas, and may I just say this is absolutely accurate!? It is horrible in this state, and I didn’t need to be. Abbott just needed to please Trump.
Seriously? People wake the fuck up. Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory that there is a cure for Covid and Twitter took his tweet down. Trump is fucking insane. You think not? Come on use your brain😡

Trump's head is going to explode 😂
Oh look, the “not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump” people. Splendid.
Democrats &amp; their news media are lying to Americans by: calling riots “peaceful protests” or not even covering the riots at all.  Democrat leaders are allowing their cities to burn &amp; not charging rioters to make Trump look bad in order to win in 2020.   And the media is helping.
👉 FIGHT BACK! Never negotiate with a terrorist, especially a POS Marxist terrorist  (BLM &amp;Antifa)... these clowns are almost as fascist &amp; violent as Hitler’s Nazis. If not kept in check, they’d murder millions without losing any sleep.  👉 Thank God that Trump is punching back.
Idiots.   Why bring a trump flag to a black lives matter protest? going against the movement makes you a racist and holding the flag is bringing your political party down with you. I am for trump for economical reasons. But this will only hurt the chances for him winning.
Kidding me?  We almost launched nuclear weapons.  And I am only half joking - we are trying Trump
you ever vibe with someone then find out they’re a closet racist, homophobic, misogynistic, ableist, fatphobic, transphobic and a trump supporter? i wanted to like you so badly, you piece of shit 😔

Can you guarantee us, the American citizens, that Trump will not use his "federal officers" to keep himself in office after he loses the election?  I pray you are confident that that will NEVER happen.
Can you assure us that Trump will not use his "federal officers" to keep him in the presidency after he loses the election?  If you can't, God forbid.

He’s made dumb comments on here before that leaned towards maga. He also follows Trump but he follows Biden too so idk. He def seems conservative tho
Idk if it’s 100%, but I think he’s made some comments on here before that we’re leaning towards maga. He also follows trump but he follows Biden too so idk
Gonna make it awkward when trump resigns and asks pence to pardon him.
Who could've seen it coming? Trump's allies marvel over his relentless coronavirus incompetence
Guy I hate to break this to you as you appear to be young but these radicals only live to create choas and destruction. It is who and what they are. Trump has nothing to do with it really. They just want to destroy the world.

No it is not. He will utilize all his resources and do what he has to do. Their is already a blueprint that was created by Donald Trump.

I think I understand what the protesters are trying to accomplish, it is not working, and all they are doing is playing into Trump’s plan.  They are giving him all the excuse he supposedly needs to start to create Martial Law, then where will we all be?
Not a caption, but you know Trump spent 30 minutes washing the "commoner" off of his hands.

B.s. in January Trump tried to ban travel from The source, and you people went public telling people to act as usual, go to festivals, visit china town. Cuomo forced covid-19 sick into old folks home. Mass murdering thousands.
Absolute brain-washed disillusionment. We do NOT have a 2 party system in America! BOTH Joe &amp; tRump are OWNED by the SAME damn billionaires. Why do you think  have done NOTHING to fix this country? Becuz of the $. I'm putting my vote to actual use. #VoteGreen2020

Never underestimate the general public’s mass stupidity in most political matters. Or the determined “evil” plans/intentions of the politicians. All this privatizing BS now is yet another personal grudge of tRump -bc Bezos uses #USPS
Cry me a river. If they would work for their constituents instead of being trump lapdogs and shills, they might be better off. Once you mess with a skunk, it’s hard to get the smell off.
Another HUGE reason we need to re-elect Trump in November in order to get conservative Supreme Court &amp; other Judges. I pray that ppl who consider yourselves Christians will WAKE UP &amp; realize you cannot vote democrat if you are a Christian! Look at democrat politics!! WAKE UP!!!
“The Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed this week, saying Chinese agents tried to steal medical and other research in Texas. ”
I concur. Portnoy did a great job without the sneaky gotcha BS that “real journalists” now rely on.  Trump needs more interviews like this and Biden needs to sit down with
biggest problem with attacking Biden is that Trump has no integrity, scruples, or character. Therefore, Trump has no credibility when it comes to judging another person’s integrity, scruples, or character.
Same thing here in Texass w/our limp dick  They have their heads so far up tRump’s ass that all they can see is the $$$$ he gives them to fuck us all over &amp; their delusions of grandeur for continued power from their GOP loyalty. Kill us all.

Here is a joke.  trump.
Plus the way they did not ask for Big Cat’s opinion or insight on doing the trump interview after saying he would be such a big part of the company and would be included in these types of decisions
The truth is that leadership starts at the top. When you have someone like Portnoy meeting with a highly controversial and racist person like a Donald Trump it should be very alarming because it just shows how much a scumbag Portnoy is.
I feel the same way. There's no way Dave could turn down an interview with Trump, but he should've told Big Cat.
Doesn't matter if watch or don't watch. May not matter if you vote or don't vote.  How many people can you convince to vote Trump that wouldn't may be all that matters...

“Chaos in Portland?” But I thought it’s mostly peaceful people trying to get bread?  Is the  threatening nationwide riots when Trump wins?  Flash: we know Trump is going to win &amp; we know you’re going to riot. Dems didn’t accept 2016 loss, why would 2020 be different?
That was the whole point here. They way you are acquiring your drugs so cheap is because your government threatens to not honor patents. Trump said no more stealing of intellectual property. Your cheap drugs are going away. Now you will pay what we pay.
Are you F'n kidding me about distrust China. I am sure there are scores of countries who can and will say same about trumpmeriKKKa, trump and all on his cabinet. They have no reason to trust him, you or anyone else associated with trump.
People aren't going to take you seriously if you just randomly assign all good to democrat governors and all bad to Trump based on... . . . . ...nnnnnothing.
Sorry, just trying to keep up here... So 150 days in, if the state is doing poorly, it's Trump's fault and NOT the governor's fault... But if the state is doing well, such as NY, that would be to the credit of the governor and NOT because of Trump.Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
Today Trump offered to temp extend unemployment until a deal can be reached, Dems in the House killed it. DEMS killed unemployment, where is that in the media?

It’s interesting, some of the similarities between Obama and Trump.  Obama was re-elected, Trump was impeached.  Obama kept many of his Cabinet members, Trump is running out of people to replace his Cabinet members.  Trump is orange, Obama is black.  “Similarities” may not apply.
You and trump are the frauds.
Also, even if he didnt (which, again, the evidence and timeline points to) many did:

A bad day for Trump!
President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
The  found in an analysis of more than 200 Portland arrests that even those accused of breaking the law during the liberal city’s nightly rallies don’t neatly fit into President Donald Trump’s depiction of protesters as “anarchists and agitators.”
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there’s that.
Donald trump could never do you hear me. NEVER. #JohnLewisMemorial
You know Trump Bad when Bush looks like a old friend .....that I didnt vote for! #JohnLewisMemorial
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. 🤣
How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his “joke” about injecting people with bleach. He wasn’t joking.
I doubt it, I don’t see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can’t glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should’ve learned.
Should of happened over a year ago when Trump said he was going to what about the rest of the conspirators in the coup are those BASTARDS blocked yet 🤔

If our media appreciated the wisdom of Charles Schulz they'd know the parable of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. But hope does indeed spring eternal in the hearts of journalists covering Donald Trump.
Yes, we must! We simply have to get rid of tRump and every treasonous republiCON up for re-election! We have to take the country back from the racists, the haters, the white supremacists, the fascists and idiots who, collectively, are driving us to ruin and even to death!
I wonder what Superspreader Trump will say about this?  Trump, now has one less vote.
I did not vote for him and have no opinion on Mr. Cain as a person.  I did not like his politics.  No one should be attending Trump rallies, with or without a mask.

It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies

The Trump Administration had cobbled together a farcical ceasefire among America, Taliban, and Afghan forces in 2018. Devoid of tactical or strategic sense, the attempt to hang the political hide on the campaign wall hid behind the fig leaf of troop withdrawal.
This information was passed on to the Trump Transition team in 2016. The raw, battlefield intel of Russian Bounties was passed on by Afghan/ CIA interrogation teams in 2018. Subsequent intel was Flash Traffic in 2018 and again in 2019. Think about that.

A la Trump's incompetence in the face of a pandemic exponentially increased its deadliness and spread by hundreds of thousands, pushed an already flimsy economy over the edge, and has shot up unemployment and underemployment in a historic manner:
They are open they just cut to skeleton staff &amp; no one tips cause customers/owners often don't give a fuck about us workers.  The pandemic has exponentially been made worse by Trump, thus my point.  Maybe if we had responded right the first time that wouldn't be the case.
12% unemployment. Cant find a bartending job anywhere because we're the worst country in the world to respond to the pandemic. Everyone under 50 I know is struggling to make rent and buy groceries. Worst economy since 1930s...  But yeah sure Trump's good for the Texas economy.

There is only one reason that Democrats want vote by mail.  The public apathetic toward Joe Biden so nobody would goto any effort to vote for him.  But if all they have to do is stick something in the mailbox maybe they would vote. Trump supporters would walk across fire to vote.
The GOP Senators, that support Trump, are out of touch with reality. The voters must decide to keep them or vote for other candidates who will bring change to fight the pandemic and economic reform.

Trump just said if we have mail in voting we will be the laughingstock of the world.  We are already the laughingstock of the world because of him!  He said you have to be really stupid not to understand that. Oh my God he is really an idiot!.  😲
Trump just stated his game plan if he loses. “Litigation could take YEARS before we find out who really won the presidency”. #briefing
Oh, Annie, Mr. Trump was impeached. That's not "nothing". In addition, Mr Trump is an Unindicted Co-Conspirator in at least one case. Lastly, the "activated" AG doing your claimed investigations is himself being investigated.
The contrast between Obama’s oratory and Trump’s semi coherence and mispronounciations is staggering.
That's kinda like true, only a few stay near the border, and the ones that stay near the border often aren't the criminals Trump is so scared of.
My how does trump make this shitty former President look noble.  Beautiful words no doubt but Bush did bad things to our country.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.
Finally because Herman Cain was killed by Trump Virus, he mentions the more than 150,000.
You know what's going to be sad? The fact that three former Presidents prior to  will probably show respect and condolences to his family and be willing to pay their respects to him on behalf of the nation and Trump couldn't do the same for John Lewis. That's sad.
Yeah, Washington Examiner. A Trump ass kissing periodical.
I feel the same way about the people behind the Lincoln Project. There’s way too much gloating, snark, and back slapping over their efforts to bring Trump down. There’s little contrition from them over the foundation they built to attack Democrats with equivalent zeal and venom.
You pushback on us harder than Trump? And therein lies the problem. #DoYourJob

Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?

You said this is Trump’s America, didn’t you?
Idiot Trump is only doing all of this to completey Disrespect John Lewis And his Honorable Legacy. One of which Trumps will only be as Racist Criminal Fraud Liar Moron Lunatic Idiotic Discase to America and its Biggest mistake and Regret.
Complex issues like this are what Homeland Security is supposed to coordinate. But sadly, Trump put an ex-lobbiest in charge of keeping our country safe. 🤮

Trump needs to stop calling them the “silent majority.” The term “silent but deadly” is much more fitting and accurate.

This is America's first Caligula, paired with a giant FOX cult, so this is our first real stress-test on our system by totalitarians.  If we get a 2nd chance at democarcy next year, we now know exactly all the weak spots to repair, because Trump tested every law in the book.

How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won’t do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.
If damning information could disqualify someone, then Trump should have never ran and he should have been removed. People are going to bash KDH, but we got her if Biden does the right thing. #BidenHarris2020
Ad hominem attacks, how surprising. So the people who listen to a liar like Trump are woke and the people listening to reputable sources of info are sheep, huh? No wonder Trump loves the uneducated.

Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cain’s death. Trump Tulsa rally had no social distance, no masks, no Covid-19 safety measures! And Cain was there.
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
LOL, have you ever thought about the idea that maybe people who aren't Republicans or Democrats support him for that very reason? Trump isn't truly right or left, and I think that's actually his appeal to lots of people.
Sen Cornyn, Donald Trump has never made a joke and neither was this! And if it was a joke, it wasn’t funny!
Trump is screwing up his plan to sell out

Texas is fine.  We all know these covid numbers are propaganda to derail Trump.
im in texas and im not gonna vite for biden. if that leads to texas going to trump then so be it.
It's possible following Trump's bad advice on masks and snake oil cures might have infected him somewhere other than the big room full of thousands of screaming unmasked idiots, but the chances of his dying of an unrelated cause after a month of hospitalization for COVID is nil.
trump knows he can’t change the election,he’s trying to cause confusion so people give up because they’ll believe his lies! Americans have to be smarter than that! Look at the facts! I have applied for my mail in ballot! This is NOT a new system! trump and his family used it!!!
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
You misspelled Trump. #VoteTrumpToSaveAmerica2020

The most amount of money you’ve ever received in your check thanks to trump. Obama isn’t even a citizen, he’s gay, and Michelle’s a man. He is also a part of the Jeff Epstein scandal and is a part of the lawsuit Hillary is going through for all them emails.
Curious how you know he didn't get it at the Trump rally. How do you know where he got it? Are you like one of those Dogs the Germans have trained to sniff out and identify people with COVID-19?
Did the right thing in 2016 and will do the right thing in 2020. TRUMP 2020
Idk im not for him. But Obama during his term deported thousands more than trump. And the ice facilities the way they are now is because of Obama. Not to mention Obama bombed countries left and right. Trump is brining light to the child trafficking pandemic and this is

Typical trump.
Calling it the "Trump Virus" implies that he started it, and is responsible for the damage is causes. It should be referred to as "Wuhan", "Chinese", or "Democrat" virus.
Bless his Heart!! Fuck Trump!
Can you feel that America? That’s the shifting and the waking up of some Trump supporters. Welcome! Let’s come together and beat this virus. #TakeBackAmerica #EnoughIsEnough #UnityWins
He literally died because he went to a Trump rally and didn’t wear a mask he would still be alive had he not done that and Trump actually took Covid seriously but ok
😂 Not sure Trump should be trying to go back to back with Barack Obama. The comparison will be devastating for Donald. Not that he'll notice. He &amp; his minions are the least self-aware bunch we've ever had in the Whitehouse.
There are 154,000 Herman Cain's thanks to the Trump Virus.
According to Trump tho, the economy has never been better... sooo....
The protests are not about Trump. Trump is not a police officer nor has he directly killed anyone. His response to BLM is the only reason he even comes up in the conversation. I know what the President is saying, I know what his supporters are posting. It's just one narrative.
he has always said he will do what it takes to defeat trump. there was a pandemic going on and he didnt want people to vote during the pandemic.
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
He attended Trump rally with no mask, got covid and died. Just devastating.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
Gotta see the irony here dude!  The Left's Coronavirus mantra is "We can't re-open the economy, kids can return to schools" so Trump is just getting on board the "can't" train to show how stupid the thinking!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Do they not understand that the more they attack Trump, the more we love him?
NWO and Trump is trying to stop it. Affects entire planet.

This!! I watched an interesting documentary last night re the takedown of the mafia. 1 segment talked at length how they had to “prove to the court” reasonable cause for a warrant &amp; what they went thru to get that proof. Which was a lot less than what’s known about Trump!
If he hadn’t followed Trump and gone to the Tulsa rally, he would still be alive!  People that follow Trump, either die or cause someone else to die! #Trumpisthevirus
My only problem with people saying "Trump can't postpone an election because it's in the constitution" is that it's also in the constitution that Congress makes appropriations and that didn't stop him from declaring a phony national emergency to get around it
And now we know why they met.  Because it is true.  TRUMP IS/WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT THE USA HAS EVER HAD.  He’ll be gone soon, and prosecuted, as will his entire, lying, dishonest cabinet.  HE GOES TO JAIL, AFTER HE GET ANNIALHATED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.

In the last 24 hours Trump promoted segregation, the GDP is down 33%, he is pulling Troops out of Germany (you're welcome Putin) AND he wants to delay the election.    "Make other countries feel sorry for us" should be his new campaign slogan.
Yes, Trump has to go. I will swim through a flood to vote his ass out. Whatever it takes.
Yeah, I realized it wasn't that peculiar being that he was over 70 and had cancer. It's just unfortunate. Folks are being dickholes about it, though, because he went to a Trump rally. They won't say that protesting in large groups is just as risky. Hypocrits.
Sue? We’re voting for Trump, even Joe knows it.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
Not because of politics, because of stupidity that's lead to thousands of deaths.  He contracted COVID from Trump's super-spreader Tulsa rally where nobody was wearing a mask. How many others did he infect? How many healthcare workers and their families did he put at risk?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on!
Trump will not win this fight.

What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I didn't agree with Hernan Cain's politics but it is sad that he died from following Trump.
Are you sure?  It's possible Putin's English is better than Trump's. ;-)
I know that there are many non-white people that love be in the suburbs. I do not believe that Trump was addressing them. His idea of suburbs is white and middle class. You only have to look at his history renting to people to see that.
Trump talking about trying to delay the election (he can't), because he and his ilk are distracting against the fact that the economy is in the shitter.
Media only mainstreams white on black shootings, and completely ignore the black on black shootings, THOSE LIVES MATTER TOO. A black Trump supporter in Milwaukee was shot dead yesterday, the media ignored that.
Completely predictable.
I wasn't old enough to vote against George Wallace in 1968. Voting against Donald Trump in 2020 is the next best thing.
Trump and his cult of psychotic goons 100% own this death.
I bet Trump got Afghanistan’s #GDP up a bit by looking the other way as Russia paid all those bounties for dead Americans.
Last public appearance prior to contracting covid was the trump Tulsa rally.   Every cult eventually becomes a death cult.
Cain by all accounts was an intelligent man. While there is plenty of blame to throw at Trump, he is mostly to blame for believing/supporting a corrupt and soulless con man.
Scenario:  Trump can always count on GOP governors. Some will demand safety for their constituents. Next their Sec. if States who control the election polls will support. Pressure Dem Congress who of course won’t oblige. Then campaign against Dems for risking lives.

Herman Cain also called COVID a Hoax. He just died from it. Donald Trump may not be handling it well, but he is very clear that it's real. Are you saying that Trump is a liar and in the pocket of the Chinese communists?
Very sad bc this dude should still be alive. This is what happens when the disinformation of the trump administration and his supporters resonates in their minds.
He's a liar. He cares more about his image than this nation. He suggests slowing down COVID testing to make numbers look better. How exactly you rank Trump higher than Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Truman, and Eisenhower is astounding.
No, he can't, but he can work to get a contested election thrown to the House of Representatives, where despite having a majority of Democrats, each state gets one vote. There are more red states than blue states so that would throw the election Trump's way. VOTE!!!!
He will if he doesn’t wanna disappoint Trump. He might end up like Herman Cain, though.
Trump must leave.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Absolutely they will care. I despise Donald Trump with every fiber of my being, but I care about this. There are records of communications like this. This is easily provable.  Just need details on how/when your son notified them. How did he notify them?
I'm really trying to see things from multiple perspectives. Trump is not the first president to express concerns about NATO Ally defense spending. While I definitely don't agree alienating our allies is a good plan. I recognize there's more to this than just serving Russia.
Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the marquee event for the president's self-proclaimed reelection campaign kickoff.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Yes, vote for Biden to turn us back to the conditions that created Trump in the first place just so he can say he supports these progressive policies, only to do nothing about them.  We had one chance to crush facism in this country, and you centrists dropped the ball.
You know, Tom, a few months ago, I’d agree with you. Trump doesn’t give a fuck about Federal law, so don’t act superior to us who are a little panicked right now. He trolls then he acts. It’s his MO. Float an idea and do it.
Arguing after the fact that there was interference is wholly different than a leader that is in power arguing for the suspension of an election. Trump's own intelligence groups acknowledge this as fact.
This is one of the scariest things I have seen Trump tweet...and that is saying a lot.
Just another sellout Black azzzh01e being paid to suppress Black support of President Trump what a disgrace
Hopefully you are fully aware of the importance of a strong, healthy and vibrant U.S. economy and culture.  Whilst enjoying your popcorn, pray for a Trump victory. England’s survival depends on it.

Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election — But Congress Sets the Date
Where is The Taxes ? Amazing what the Trump’s will do to hide them...
Yes - Trump is a savant. Nothing he does is stupid or ignorant. He is a policy genius who cares nothing for his own image and always puts the American people first....
Awesome Trump supporter
Marco Rubio is a spineless coward and a yesman of a politician, unworthy of public office.   Not only has he debased himself for Trump, he KNOWINGLY allowed Covid to ravage Floridians in exchange for temporary political expedience.   Vote lil Marco out.
** Breaking** He can’t do it, but he’s floating the idea.
Make no mistake. This is Trump's version of "There goes the neighborhood".
No, I try my hardest to not be racist, but I think that Trump believes that all white people in the suburbs want low income housing kept away. We have a very vibrant multi-ethnic/cultural community in the suburb that I am in. 45 doesn't have a clue what the suburbs look like.
We voted during the civil war, two world wars, and he has no power to stop the election. Voting during crisis is something America has always done. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Did I miss something? Didn't Trump get help from Russia in 2016?
So it begins.
Trump seems to think he can delay elections. Throw this guy out of office already.
I think we all knew that was coming next from trump. He is more authoritarian and delusional every day. Early voting for the Nov election starts 13 Oct in TX. #NovemberIsComing
In the past 20 years, over 250 million votes have been cast by mail. Meanwhile, there have only been 143 criminal convictions for mail-in voter fraud. Trump is absolutely trying to undermine the election with fearmongering and misinformation.
Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud #SmartNews 😢🤣🤣☺️He Can’t 🤣🤣☺️🤣
Trump has the blood of 150,000 people on his hands.
And here we go. Trump suggests delaying the election.
This dude is the  “rapid response” director Lolololol   Hard to believe Trump is polling so badly with online representation like this
Nah, Trump supporters are NOT that way at all
It’s up to Congress not Trump
What? Only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat with Mail in voting. There are number of cases of mail in voting fraud. That’s the reason why Democrats are pushing for more shot downs so people do not go and physically vote. Trump is right.
This is called Projection!! They call him a “Racist” daily. With Zero proof!! They project what they are!! Who got Criminal Justice Reform done? Opportunity Zones? Record funding to Black Colleges? Trump did! He is the worst “Racist” ever!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  #MAGA
Biden tells donors: I’m going to get rid of most of Trump’s tax cuts ‘and a lot of you may not like that’
cannot believe anymore that United States of America has so many idiots in Congress. 😀 Hopefully, an exposure by Trump presidency is a big time Wake up call.  We  shall Judge on Nov 2020, how America has Wake up or still America are in deep sleep. God helps.
I disagree, to every Trump supporter, the election is November 15th now.
Hey  as your constituent, I'm curious to know whether you believe it is appropriate for President Trump to float the idea of delaying the election.  I'll hang up and listen.
I wonder who will replace you in a few months. I wonder why y’all never stay long. Trump talks about bring in more jobs but he’s fired more people in his administration than has ever been in all administrations combined so who be  number 9,997.
Trump could if we don’t mail in ballots early, filling them out correctly, and if we are not willing to wait in lines many hours. This vote is a patriotic one requiring sacrifice. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Trump has decimated international education. For the thousands of people who have made a career out of this until now, we liked America better before he tried to make it “great.”
I have a master’s degree, too, and I just lost my job. If I decide to apply for the new contract- adjunct, and they decide to hire me-it will be a 30 percent pay cut plus no security-after 22 years of service. Trump did this with his Xenophobic rhetoric and policies.
Don, Someone has been behind every fn one of them. They're neither Blue or Red they are grey. Trump is the only one not owned. We need him for 8 more. First 4 don't count. I reclaim his time.
I LOVE Trump!
At some point in the future after Trump has coronavirus and it has swept through the ranks of Republicans who refuse science we will be told “there will be time to discuss the issue of masks in the future, this is a time to deal with the issue of governance!”
Must be true. Look at Trump
It been very enjoyable to watch the #Mars2020 launch, so tired of corona and Trump 24/7
You are wetarted. Trump is fighting to rid the world of the scum of the earth, which is you. What are you hiding, covering for. People like you lie because you are guilty.
Love the NBA but they’re the most hypocritically professional sports league. Speak up to Trump, but hush up for their communism leaders #puppets
Trump has Fed chief investing in stocks.
So true. Republicans need to control Congress or Trump is toast
Displaced workers pay taxes too! The Republicans caused them to be unemployed when Trump botched the response to COViD-19 pandemic.
Just what PUTIN desires. Trump has to listen to his boss man.
Trump administration installed a lackey to purposefully slow everything down
BLM GROUPS HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EXCEPT FURTHER DISTANCING ALL THE YEARS OF PROGRESS MADE BY ALL PEOPLE BLACK AND WHITE WHO STRIVED FOR A BETTER AMERICA. BUT AMERICAS LEADERS WHO HATE TRUMP FORMED" SYSTEMIC RACISM" IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN AMERICA AT ALL COST. WAR!
This is odd logic as it's QUITE EASY to confirm the violence going on in democratic states, it's pretty laughable really how everyone ignores it cause they hate the orange man so bad, theyd willingly become vassals like good sheep so they are spared. Bad trump bad!!
Screw Twitter. It leads to pontification and resting on laurels and sound bites.  The New Wave is coming. We need to seriously give time and some money to TRUMP and the GOP.  This is a fire we can put out at the polls. Deportation for many, jail time for most, trees of treason?

I don't care if Trump is pulling some soldiers from Germany out of spite.  Doing so is long overdue, whether Deep State approves it or not.    US had kept the training wheels on NATO's little bicycle for decades too long.
That was the economy Trump inherited from the previous administration but screwed the pooch by not having a national strategy prepared to fight the global pandemic. #TrumpDepression #32millionUnemployed #151000Dead #FailureInChief

If you're ever in far north Dallas, there's a house on the Dallas side of Coit between Arapaho and Campbell with Confederate flags and a giant Trump sign. Can't miss it. 🤮
I'm in west Plano and I've seen three Trump flags. No yard signs for either candidate but I'm sure that's due to HOA restrictions. We aren't putting any Biden signs in our yard; 2020 is so crazy that we don't want to be a target.
It’s never Trump’s fault.  Just ask him.
Isn’t president trump still in office for ALL of his transgressions? Or we’re not ready for that convo

. White House not doing enough to protect Trump from coronavirus, top doctor warns
No, you're not the only one, Monica. This is just one of Trump's peculiarities that I do not like or understand. Another example, if he knew HCQ cured Covid-19 way back in March, shouldn't he by EO mandated it's usage and saved many of the seniors' lives?
The test he took was a dementia test, and said the questions about months was the hardest... Trump has an equal amount of scandals. Just know, I hate Biden just as much as you do if not more, both are horrible for the country and all around horrible people.
Bluer areas are near the border more than ever now cause Trump's put them through so much shit.
Our country is divided but not defeated. We really need to pull together and tell Putin that we don’t want a country like his and  run Trump out of our white house
If you listen 2 Mary Trump's Interview &amp; read her book it speaks volumes of what a mad man we have in our Oval Office. It's crystal clear he's lying about the Bounty to protect Putin. Without ? Trump is THE biggest TRAITOR this country has seen in a long time.

Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
This Trump?! 😂 Y'all are drowning in hypocrisy.
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
Trump supporters tend to be the most hateful. And the things y’all believe in and support are also real hateful, so are you gonna block yourself or..?
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE

How do you see the future of America? Are you praying that Trump will save you? He’ll be gone in four years. Then what will you do? Find another savior? Or finally wake up and start saving the country yourself?

Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's wet dream.  He bows in submission to Putin, giving him ANYTHING he wants.    One of Russia's greatest wishes has been the withdrawal of Americans from our European allies.  Putin's slave (Trump) is withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany.
So long as you act (in your daily life) like your views and your values don’t matter, guess what’s going to happen? They’re going to be ignored. People are filled with frustration over all the evil stuff going on, yet the knee-jerk reaction is to beg Trump to do something.

Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn’t leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.

What a useless crock. Hold Trump and yourself accountable.  YOU are responsible for the worst COVID response on the planet. You defended this president's incompetence. Now he's back to fake cures...f*cking ridiculous. Resign.
How does an otherwise universally-accepted smart individual, business leader and visionary essentially meet his untimely death because he actively chose to shill for Trump?   How?

Trump’s acceptance is not required.    Of all Trump’s tricks, his best is to get his opposition to defend a corrupted system. By saying he won’t automatically accept the results of the election, his opponents commit to defending the election results if there is interference.
Anyone thats part of this New world order thats about to happen. They will be the first to speak out against Trump. They even invite each other on their talk shows. All of this is being set into place due to the richest people in the world wanting it to be set in place. Get ready
Im not hating on that fact. Im hating on the fact that we are constantly lied to! Those are nor their kids. Facts. If people knew the truth about what is facts as of right now. Trump would win 4 damn sure. Im not apart of anything, but my own thoughts. Play a lot of chess too!
The same reason the in-depth investigation into the Trump family’s fraudulent tax schemes was met with a collective yawn. How does he get away with this??

Racism did not end with Obama and started back up with Trump. Trump only gives racists a platform to be racist without the sheets.  Good news is there are more people are not tolerating that hateful shit
Given the views you’ve expressed about the judiciary and women in 9”office, etc, I’m curious - how was it that it took Trump’s nomination to make you leave the GOP? I’d have thought you’d have left long before that.  Serious question, not snarky.
Just now seeing this and don’t know what’s worse- that Trump is intellectually deficient or feigns as such?

Yup and that’s why they love Trump so much because he made their racism okay, and they were so mad that a black man was in power they did and continue to do anything to disparage him and his family. They finally have someone in office who echoes their racism.
Texas ♥️💯🇺🇸Trump
I’m on a “moms” group on FB just to spectate. They’re saying how the doctors that Trump retweeted shouldn’t be ignored as they’re doctors after all. Yeah, well, Josef Mengele and Harold Shipman were both Doctors. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Matt, this means you and Trump use hand sanitizer before and after touching each other?
Yeah still red, but the republicans here are just fed up with him. Texas has gotten the worst of what Trump has to offer.
WDYM, you guys never shut up, nothing about you is silent. Also, Trump supporters are the minority...
President Trump is a builder, the first four years, he built a few bombs and set them off and built one big bomb that he'll set off in a few years, which will turn America into a failed country, a failed experiment. Trump's only made things worse.
Okay.  Still worked out great for me.  Trump kind of fucked things up but most figured he would eventually.  Maybe not this bad but ....

It’s kinda like a drinking game. If Trump says something really stupid, we have a sip of wine and send  $100. If Trump tweets something really scary, we have a shot of Jack  Daniels and send the Lincoln Project $200. We have sent the $200.
Herman Cain was a grown ass man who knew better. Just because you don't like taxes, is no reason to believe that every reputable health organization on the planet is lying to you or that Trump is in anyway competent.
Trump &amp; Republicans are in NO WAY trying to prevent anyone from legally voting! We just want ppl who are legal citizens to vote &amp; only vote 1 time in an election for the candidate of their choice. To keep inferring we are preventing ANY LEGAL voters from voting is RIDICULOUS!
Why is Trump claiming that he's gonna lose the election if it's mail-in? Come on dude, don't give up already, manifest that shit lol.
I already had this part highlighted if anyone disputed it. Trump can’t say HE voted absentee, when Florida doesn’t even have anything but vote-by-mail in that regard.
They’ll move to the post office, then the highways... and cnn will nod their head and continue to blame Trump.
aggie moms for trump mouth breathing without their masks
Trump Tweeted, for all to read, that he would have to "ask" if he could delay the November election because of feared voting fraud. Why didn't he ask before he opened his mouth? Now, his base is prepped for a fight because of "voter fraud". #Trump #VoterFraud #Election2020
When Obama became president. right wingers could not believe he disrupted their all white boys club. From when he won they conspired to prevent it happening again, to stop equality at any and all costs and trump made being overtly racist ok again. They've taken us back to 1950's
Trump wants to stop mail in ballots. Having been in military and served overseas THE ONLY WAY I COULD VOTE WAS BY MAIL IN BALLOT. So if trump tries that he is denying service members their constitutional rights, the rights they are defending.
KBTX recognizes this post does not provide enough context for the situation and does not further the conversation in a productive way.  This article provides more information, stating the president does not have the authority to delay Election Day.
I don’t follow trump. But it’s a smart idea to keep informed of both sides and especially the policies being implement by the president reguardless of political views to see how you are going to be affected
Damn. Can you imagine if everyone who disliked trump voted for Jorgensen instead of Biden? 🥺
Trump wants to make sure that he’s the only one term President that served longer than 4 years ☝🏻🇺🇸
We will NOT delay our election. Election Day is sacred, and everyone’s right to vote shall be upheld, defended, enforced, and protected. You do not scare us, Trump, for you cannot stop our votes.
Hillary Clinton and a bunch of dems never accepted President Trump’s election &amp; most likely won’t accept it when he wins again in November!
FWIW KBTX, I’m not in agreement with these other comments; Trump says unsubstantiated allegations (feels like) everyday now.
Herman Cain, inspiration to many, including a young conservative me, died literally so President Trump could continue behaving as if COVID is not a big deal.  His socials continued to tweet how it's a hoax as he was in the hospital.  Stop this now, GOP voters. No more should die.
Only the “experts” who disagree publicly with Trump “know better”  Other experts have their videos deleted from all social media.
So Herman Cain died of Covid? Trump, you killed another person, with your fucking ego which needs constant adoration. Trump is a mass murderer.😡😡😡
After Barr hearing all Trump administration officials sould only respond to congressional inquiries in writing. Democrats should never be allowed power again...
No, it’s the height of stupidity for you to buy into an absurd and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory and truly believe Trump is anything but an incompetent, narcissistic, tantrum throwing baby. It’s amazing how trump supporters are blind to the signs everyone else can plainly see
Ma’am you have seriously lost your mind. You really believe the whole world is orchestrating a conspiracy to get Trump out of office by faking a pandemic somehow. I hope you eventually hear how crazy you sound.
And tRump will not learn thing one from this lesson.
Oh my god. You people are brainwashed. You can’t see that trump is terrified of losing the election? You think it’s acceptable we let him stay in office despite the fact that over 50% of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic ?
He was one of the “blacks for trump” mfs who attended the trump rally in Tulsa......I’m not even gonna say anything

I mean you could just be ideologically opposed for voting for someone with sexual assault accusations. I don't blame anyone if that's their reason for not voting. Trump just has even more, and one of them is going to win the presidency, and one of them is more dangerous.
I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.
I'm not going to be using write-ins or voting third party but I do not understand the whole "a third party vote is a vote for Trump" thing. Sure, it isn't an effective vote AGAINST Trump. But its a vote for who you voted for. Seems like a stupid lib take to me.
The problem with Trump's mental state is, for his co-conspirators (VP &amp; Cabinet) a feature, and not a bug.

She is my precious niece and I have never been more proud.  Seeing her being attacked makes my blood boil!!  They are nothing but thugs and tRump made them his thugs. Infuriating!!!
He has living children who are vocal about being against Trump.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Florida Republican knows Donald Trump is embarrassing the nation  via
I have lost a number of friends because of my anti-trump stance. hum let me change that to acquaintance for friends will stand by you regardless. even though they have "unfriended" me, if they need me I am there for them.
I think I understand what the protesters are trying to accomplish, it is not working, and all they are doing is playing into Trump’s plan.  They are giving him all the excuse he supposedly needs to start to create Martial Law, then where will we all be?
Not a caption, but you know Trump spent 30 minutes washing the "commoner" off of his hands.
Folks, I only have a few “followers “, you have many!!! Get the word out that if Trump is not re-elected America will go to Hell!!!!
B.s. in January Trump tried to ban travel from The source, and you people went public telling people to act as usual, go to festivals, visit china town. Cuomo forced covid-19 sick into old folks home. Mass murdering thousands.
Absolute brain-washed disillusionment. We do NOT have a 2 party system in America! BOTH Joe &amp; tRump are OWNED by the SAME damn billionaires. Why do you think  have done NOTHING to fix this country? Becuz of the $. I'm putting my vote to actual use. #VoteGreen2020
indeed, and certainly none without many billions of federal dollars for major school reconstruction and many more personnel, tests, and well-paid cleaners with protective gear -- Trump's son Barron is not going to a reopened face to face school, talk about hypocrisy
Why we can’t have nice things. “When Trump talks, his base listens. That carries profound implications for efforts to limit the spread in the U.S., especially when he contradicts public health officials or state and local leaders.”
Interesting thread with pics on the, alleged, transgressions of the Houston consulate. I can see why the Trump admin moved to close it, but I wonder what airing the grievances in public will do for Sino-US relations
And trump retweets this why????  #TrumpMeltdown #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Never underestimate the general public’s mass stupidity in most political matters. Or the determined “evil” plans/intentions of the politicians. All this privatizing BS now is yet another personal grudge of tRump -bc Bezos uses #USPS
Cry me a river. If they would work for their constituents instead of being trump lapdogs and shills, they might be better off. Once you mess with a skunk, it’s hard to get the smell off.
Another HUGE reason we need to re-elect Trump in November in order to get conservative Supreme Court &amp; other Judges. I pray that ppl who consider yourselves Christians will WAKE UP &amp; realize you cannot vote democrat if you are a Christian! Look at democrat politics!! WAKE UP!!!
“The Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed this week, saying Chinese agents tried to steal medical and other research in Texas. ”
I concur. Portnoy did a great job without the sneaky gotcha BS that “real journalists” now rely on.  Trump needs more interviews like this and Biden needs to sit down with
biggest problem with attacking Biden is that Trump has no integrity, scruples, or character. Therefore, Trump has no credibility when it comes to judging another person’s integrity, scruples, or character.
Same thing here in Texass w/our limp dick  They have their heads so far up tRump’s ass that all they can see is the $$$$ he gives them to fuck us all over &amp; their delusions of grandeur for continued power from their GOP loyalty. Kill us all.
Everything Trump touches is contaminated.
Here we go again.... People are lying to pollsters because they don't want to be doxxed, or called racist fascist or any other ist. Here's are article from 2016 claiming the polls were accurate.
Speaking of tRump &amp; his WEEKLY golf vacations for the entirety of his “presidency,” has anyone been able to count high enough to tell US how much his outings are costing #WeThePeople in OUR tax dollars lately?
Texans are being poorly served all the way down including our senators, many of the congresspersons, our governor, lt. governor, et. al. They’re either kissing Trump’s ass in a ploy to retain power or bending a knee to special interests with $$$$. I really hope Nov brings change.
For everyone who has secured the bag, gathered thine coins, and saved your Trump checks 😂 Go check out my brothers photojournal and purchase a few prints to decorate your space !!   . #Photography #PhotographyRedefined #photojournalism #bmyrickphotography
Soooo....We’re Just going to skip over Donald Trump’s racist history and pretend like he never...you know what?Never trust a man who wears a durag with the flap out.
Good news, we only have 7.5% of Trump’s Presidency left to endure. We can do this!!! Everyone must vote. Vote early to counteract the GOP voter suppression campaign. Biden/ Harris !!!!😎
Thank you Trump!
Here is a joke.  trump.
Plus the way they did not ask for Big Cat’s opinion or insight on doing the trump interview after saying he would be such a big part of the company and would be included in these types of decisions
The truth is that leadership starts at the top. When you have someone like Portnoy meeting with a highly controversial and racist person like a Donald Trump it should be very alarming because it just shows how much a scumbag Portnoy is.
I feel the same way. There's no way Dave could turn down an interview with Trump, but he should've told Big Cat.
Doesn't matter if watch or don't watch. May not matter if you vote or don't vote.  How many people can you convince to vote Trump that wouldn't may be all that matters...
The best part is the last line: America fires Donald Trump.
That defines the trump White House
Can’t believe my followers keep going down!!! Guess I’m too pro Trump!!! God Bless him and God Bless America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
“Chaos in Portland?” But I thought it’s mostly peaceful people trying to get bread?  Is the  threatening nationwide riots when Trump wins?  Flash: we know Trump is going to win &amp; we know you’re going to riot. Dems didn’t accept 2016 loss, why would 2020 be different?
That was the whole point here. They way you are acquiring your drugs so cheap is because your government threatens to not honor patents. Trump said no more stealing of intellectual property. Your cheap drugs are going away. Now you will pay what we pay.
Are you F'n kidding me about distrust China. I am sure there are scores of countries who can and will say same about trumpmeriKKKa, trump and all on his cabinet. They have no reason to trust him, you or anyone else associated with trump.
People aren't going to take you seriously if you just randomly assign all good to democrat governors and all bad to Trump based on... . . . . ...nnnnnothing.
Sorry, just trying to keep up here... So 150 days in, if the state is doing poorly, it's Trump's fault and NOT the governor's fault... But if the state is doing well, such as NY, that would be to the credit of the governor and NOT because of Trump.
President Trump expected to sign executive orders Friday on drug pricing

Senate passes bill that to remove Confederate names from Army bases in defiance of Trump
Been saying this the min #COVIDIOTS started to reopen to soon. Now Ive been screaming it as we send millions of students/faculty/staff into pandemic-filled classrooms bc tRump is whiney tiny-dicked lil bitch! LEARN FROM HISTORY STUPIDS!
Take a real virus, then lie about it in order to achieve a political effect.  The virus is real, but the response is hyped, the data doctored, the news one-sided, the “science” ever shifting with the political winds. Trump rallies are bad, BLM protests are good. But you know this
if you mean living up tRump’s ass as an alternative reality, then yes they are!  has sentenced millions of us to get (die from)COVID when we are forced into pandemic-filled classrms in Aug. We’ve got 70k+   students coming here!
Could you imagine if this was Trump? Lol
The riots/protests, the lack of democrat-led police response, were designed to elicit a federal response in order to create unrest &amp; call Trump a dictator.  Your cities are on fire, your businesses burned to the ground- all props in a democrat war to regain the White House.
The move was a response to the Trump administration’s order this week for Beijing to close its consulate in Houston after Washington accused Chinese agents of trying to steal medical and other research in Texas.
Trump is right. Even Einstein had problems with that question. Trump is a stable genius😂
How appropriate that the Texas Attorney General, who has successfully delayed for five years his indictment for securities fraud from coming to trial, is a co-chair of Lawyers for Trump.
Like I said,Trump will do anything to keep himself in office!!!!!
Trump did the test and is boasting about the results so he can challenge Biden to do it.
President Trump donates his presidential salary to charities. What other previous Presidents have done that?  What other  Capitol Hill Democrats have donated their salaries the last four months to charities?
too many who think about economy first or won't vote for Biden even though they hate trump and want him out
Trump doesn’t push the media agenda. The media does! Wake up!
Trump's re-election campaign has purchased over 500 #Facebook ads that spread disproven claims about voter fraud. Federal regulators need to investigate and act!
The law means nothing to Trump or Barr. They have proven that.
President Trump casually throwing HEATERS
Trump announced Thursday that he has canceled the bulk of the Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a “flare-up” of the coronavirus.
I saw the Jacksonville sheriff on tv. He obviously didn’t say 5 words and ask trump to repeat them so trump didn’t remember what he said.
President Trump is her Commander in Chief, her Boss, she needs to be given a BAD conduct discharge.  She is an embarrassment to the military and the United States of America.
Yeah out of the mindset that only conservatives can be Christians. Out of the beliefs that I'm a bad Christian for disagreeing with how the church should engage with politics, and for calling Trump on his lies and immorality
Pathetic.  isn!t even smarter than Joe Biden’s DOG.  “Person, woman, man, camera, TV“: The 5 words that Trump says prove he's smarter than Biden
Joe Biden and Barack Obama are stepping up their attacks on President Donald Trump and defending their time in the White House in a new video.
I supported you for about a month until you turned into trump, iii. No more and don't count on ever being supported by true Texans again.
The Trump administration is planning to expand an operation that would send federal law enforcement agents to Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee in the coming weeks, the White House announced Wednesday night.
The meeting shown in the video illustrates the larger role Obama is expected to play for Biden in the months before November.
I trust Biden more than a draft dodging con man. When Trump loses, I hope he tries to stay and has to be dragged out kicking and screaming like the petulant child he is.President Trump is intellectually and intelligently smarter than the whole Liberal side! Every time he sets a trap they step in it whole hog! These people are sick and stupid!
Honestly I can listening to any politician speak. That includes Trump. The only guy I liked was Reagan
Like sports I don't keep up with everything... I'm just here to support Trump. Once his next 4 years is up I'm packing my shit and going to the phillipines... I've had it here....
President Trump
Since the DemoncRATS are constantly making demands.  Trump should make demands of his own. Voting in person only if you don't wear a mask. democRATS would immediately push for in person voting. Just to show him COVID19 spreads..
This is not a joke. Now it’s cost a life because Trump’s people are too irresponsible to listen to science? What have they become??
TRUMP NEVER TAKES A RECESS. TRUMP NEVER TAKES A VACATION. TRUMP DOESN'T GET PAID. TRUMP DOESN'T MISS A DAY. ONE HONEYMOON IN THREE YEARS.  SO WHY SHOULD THE HOUSE MAKING 100 XS HIS INCOME GET A RECESS. RECESS' ARE FOR SCHOOL STUDENTS...
They know trump is right and we r too.  That scares them
JUST WRONG.  IT TRUMP LOSES ITS ONLY GET WORSE OPEN UR EYES TAKE  OFF UR BLINDERS AAND LISTEN W UR EARS.
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING AND PRODUCING ANYTHING IS TRUMP AND HIS LOYAL ADMINISTRATION.
G W Bush hoBAMA And VP Joe Biden to Attend John Lewis funeral.  Trump and  Jimmy Carter will not.
And don't forget, They're blaming Trump.
A police organization that sat out 2016 after endorsing Obama/Biden in 2008 and 2012 is endorsing Trump in 2020. What’s your point?
fuck trump.
Texans for Trump
Oh now CNN USES TRUMPS VISIT AGAINST HIM  SHOWING ALL THE PEOPLE AT MIDLAND TEXAS.  CNN WAS THERE DISQUISED AS A DIFFERENT NEWS I QUESS.  BEINGS UP THE FACT HIS AID TESTED POSITIVE BEFORE TRUMP LEFT
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE INFORM.....  INFORM THEM, TRUMP IS IN ODESSA, MIDLAND TEXS SO...  SO THEY CAN RUSH. RUSH SOME NEWS REPORTERS TO COVER TRUMP.  IT WOULD BE BIG RATINGS FOR THEM.
CNN INCREASES ITS COMMERCIALS JUST TO AVOID SHOWING TRUMP.  CNN HAS BEEN BROADCAST EU. AND OTHER COUNTRIES  TO AVOID..  TO AVOID ANY THING TRUMP RELATED.
CNN  ISN'T EVEN SHOWING TRUMP IN MIDLAND.  NO SURPRISE HERE...  LOW LIFE FUCKING NEWS.
Streets of Midland Texas  Lines of Trump supporters.
Barr is scary!  He is tRump's puppet.  HE is supposed to be the AG for the US not POTUS...
If this is being interpreted as a negative, let’s consider How much Trump spent moving the hospital ship to NY’s harbor and how many COVID patients were treated there.
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS TO REMOVE TRUMP DEMOCRATS DECIDE TO BURN DOWN AMERICA  BLAME TRUMP. BLAME EVERYONE EXCEPT THEMSELVES.
President Trump set a trap, and the usual idiots from the Left stepped right in whole hog!
Donald Trump Jr. Twitter has temporarily SUSPENDED his Account For Posting A video.  Look out folks.  FB and Twitter wouldn't SUSPEND Kathy Griffin Account for showing Trump's severed head.  Look out PEOPLE. Your next, careful what you post.....
Oh I get it, they are using their time for a trump law &amp; order campaign ad.
It makes Trump look good and takes fear of Americans away
It’s because they would burn the country down instead of give Trump a win
MASKS PEOPLE MASKS. NANCY HAD HERS UP .THEN TOOK IT DOWN. IF THIS WERE TRUMP ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE.
This is some resister shit if I’ve ever seen it. Y’all are almost as stupid as trump supporters. Please quit letting these people gas you up, girl. This ain’t it.
Are you the BOD member at Fox News who is causing the swing to the left? I understand you were never a Trump fan. I don’t understand how you never Trumpers act like you prefer the radical left positions over Trump. You’re cutting off nose to spite face👎
NANCY ATTENDS LEWIS MEMORIAL AND IS MASKLESS IF TRUMP HAD DONE THAT ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOSE.  IT WOULD BE CNN FRONT AND CENTER.  I CAN HEAR IT NOW. "HOW DISRESPECTFUL OF HIM".
The Biden people aren’t acting like they’re trying to get votes for them only votes against trump. Do better!
Poor little Dem .. Has one follower. DO BLUE DEM. HATES TRUMP, A VEGAN. A BLUE WAVE. SEE HOW FAST SHE BLOCKS ME WHEN SHE READS MY FROFILE.  IS THIS INDICTATIVE OF A DEM.  1 FOLLOWER..???
If I recall correctly, Trump said exactly that a couple months ago in one of his daily COVID press briefings...that CNN and MSNBC kept cutting away from.
So it’s ok for governors to send in “storm troopers” to enforce rules on private property but Trump is not allowed to defend federal property. Again the the hypocrisy from the Dems.
Tell that to this Lincoln project who are intent on voting Trump out of office and they are Republicans! Apparently they listen to too much fake news! Donald Trump was anointed by God to lead this country at this time!
Ppl do realize Trump’s been President for the past 4 yrs, yes? Are they conceding his 1st term was “bullshit”?. I love how social conservatives are cool displaying items with all caps “BS” at the register of a family gas station now 😂
Trump 2020
They will be after they shoot each other. Heck more rioters have been shot by rioters that the Feds have shot.  Oh let me see.   The fed have yet to open fire. The rioters should be pleased with Trump refraining from doing what he could lawfully do.
TRUMP CANCEL CONVENTION  SOMETHING DEMONCRATS DIDN'T EXPECT.  SO WHAT WILL THEY BITCH ABOUT NOW...
LORI LIGHTHEAD TRUMP IS COVERING UP HIS FAILED ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC.  LORI DUMBFUCK. HOBAMA DID NOTHING ABOUT H1N1. HE LET 2XS AS MANY DIE.  WHERE WERE YOU THEN.  SDSTFU....
IF TRUMP WERE TO DIE TOMMOROW DO YOU HONESTLY THINK HIS FUNERAL WOULD GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AND MSM COVERAGE AS MCCAIN FLOYD LEWIS.......
He’s just using the exact words that Trump used to describe the ban 🙄🤔. Literally Trumps exact words.
Could you get Pelosi to stop acting like trump
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
It doesn't matter if you believe them or not.  What matters is that it spreads their crazy ideas to people who will believe anything.  You know, like flat earthers and Trump supporters.
Trump all the way!
LORD, I want to thank you for giving me another day of life. Lord I want to thank you for the greatest president this country has ever had Donald J Trump! THANK YOU!
President Trump is God's anointed!
Trump 2020
Wonder who has final say on this? Why President Trump, of course!
Trump 2020
Thing I can tell you, I was working on car that doesn't run in my driveway.  My neighbor DemoncRAT. Who ripped down my Trump flag last year. Saw me lying on ground under my car. Called cops told them I was drunk. When cop arrived I was in my house cooking supper. All bullshit
Well said truth . Trump 2020 !
Assuming they'll do the same for Trump #resign
This has been an issue for decades. It isn’t going to be solved overnight. To start the people of Chicago need to vote people out of office that isn’t doing a damn thing, refusing  help because it’s coming from Trump. Time to put hate aside and think about the American people.
Who was it hobama kicked out of USA just before ELECTION day 2016? 34 or 35 consulates. No news coverage about that. TRUMP shuts down Chinese consulate I Houston Texas. Biggest news coverage since H1N1.....lol
Biden would smell the kid up. At least trump can throw a ball.
Trump = Disaster
I need YOU back cuz seriously Kanye? Million-dollar babies? Why are people believing TRUMP OVER TRAINED MED PROFESSIONALS! I need your sanity...and humor!
"I miss Obama" has become a meme, but between this and the pic of Trump attempting to catch a baseball I saw today, right now, I miss W.
I know, but till I get into court and get a dismissal I'm stuck. It's illegal to be put on probation and not even a conviction.  I'm on a breathelizer And have to pay monthly fees...law and order... Go figure. All because my neighbor is a demoncrat. Hates me and TRUMP...
Please note school is set to open 8/20 in Florida about which Trump is adamant. He has just cancelled the convention which was set for 8/24 over safety concerns.
I am baffled by the number of people who listen to Donald Trump over EDUCATED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
Charmin utra strong Just said if TRUMP said let everyone home schooled See how fast schools would open , I agree.
the Trump virus!
OREGON wasn't The way it is now UNTIL TRUMP THREATENED TO CALL IN FEDS..  OH REALLLLYYYY..  SAYS ONE DEMONCRAT ON FOX.  WHY THEN WAS SEATTLE LIKE IT WAS.
It's a HOSTAGE situation. Remove TRUMP or we'll tear down everything. Notice terrorist PROTESTORS are now making demands in Chicago Oregon and many cities.  Mayor's, governors are going along with them because they know they are losing. It's a "HAIL MARY"
Yeah, even Trump can be forced to bow sometimes. He is fighting against rabid Dems, vicious media, &amp; public fear. He is politically adjusting to masks &amp; vaccines in order to counter act the fear. He should however make clear vaccines should not be mandatory nor given to under 45
I think the Biden people are hiding something. Well that is the charge they make over Trump taxes. However tax returns does not reveal ability to handle the office of the president but the cognitive test does. What’s the Biden people hiding or afraid of?  We all know &amp; they do to
George Floyd was just the fuse, in the stick of dynamite Laid in place November 2016.   Stop using George Floyd as a reason all this bullshitttt democRATS have been PROTESTING AGAINST TRUMP from day one.
I had a mental breakdown 7/4/2019.  I don't know what drugs were given me since  11/3/2019. I've forgotten 89 % of what I did know.   That being said, can someone tell me , Wasn't it 24 people running against TRUMP 2016.? Biden 8+ - %.....
Really well that's funny cause rioting and protesting does not make Trump look bad, it makes him look great and America's hero when he sends them good guys to kick the butts of the bad guys!
Thank you President Trump we do appreciate it!
Funny, FEDS raid  Epstein, in unmarked cars.  Even I don't approve of Epstein's crap, but my point is Federal agents raid him and bring CNN along which is against federal regulations And no one said shit.  Trump sends feds to federal building and SUDDENLY It's illegal.
I've been in dozens stores. Always someone says oh I love your mask. But my co-workers are MEXICAN Pakistani. And they hate TRUMP. I'm waiting for one to say I can't wear it. I'LL own me a motel 6...
My co - workers asked if I really wear mine. They didn't say anything out of character. But believe me, they hate TRUMP.   I'm just waiting for them to tell me I can't wear it to work. In fact I'm crossing my fingers that they do...
What’s treason? Be specific. The Russia thing debunked. The Ukraine debunked. Are talking about selling out to China? Oh that’s right the Bidens. What treason has Trump done. Using IRS &amp; FBI to spy on political rivals? Oh that right Obama/Biden. What treason?
As reapportionment nerds already know, this looks a lot like a fight that marked the 1920s - the first and only time (so far) that Congress failed to reapportion the House based on the Census.
If President Trump steals it then so be it, at least a liberal will not get to steal it, so let's go steal it!
Once local authority was removed from local officials then the Gastpo was in charge. That’s what some of the protesters R calling for, a federalize police force. It’s not Trump calling for this. He is just trying to protect people &amp; property, something he and all were sworn to do
I know but don’t give up. Failing to vote For Trump is a vote for Biden. Can’t have that. Sometimes we got to suck it up because the alternate choice suchs even more
Really. What has Trump said that is like “we will burn the system” which is what several BLM leaders have said. They have said they don’t want peace. How is that unifying?Trump did say they should go back to steam catapults.
If you’re mad everything is canceled for the rest of the year ask yourself if you wear a mask. If the answer is no blame yourself. If the answer is yes blame Trump.
Before Trump, there was no one who would go after Epstein.
Why Trump might quit – POLITICO

Based on your tweet history, you have a lot of hate for conservatives and Trump.  I didn't see a Twitter account aligned to what most people consider an American patriot.

This headline! -  Trump Is the Election Crisis He Is Warning About | The New Yorker
The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it’s like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Wouldn’t it be great if Trump’s “suburban strategy” failed and this marked the beginning of the end of racism in America?
All Trump has to do is be honest and say ok ok we lied about this PLANDEMIC were going open up no more masks no force vaccinations everything back normal n I'm sure the voilence will stop because people will have something productive to do n my ass can finally go see a movie
Aah - you took the blue pill.  Not very effective claims on a day Trump suggested delaying the election and falsely claimed that the country had universal mail-in elections (something other than absentee ballots). Sorry, can't return a "nice" try, your response is just a.... try.
If by hero "federal agents" you mean mercenary thugs sent by Trump, and if by "protecting federal property" you mean ASSAULTING VETERANS and Moms, then you'd be right and not embarrassingly full of shit. ...
Is trump the last person to realize that kushner is an idiot?
She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.
Trump will target Americans before he denounces Putin #traitorTrump
I like that. He builds and Trump destroys..
If it’s Trump’s, it must be The Greatest Winningest Depression  Anyone Has Ever Seen.
Rick Roberts: Did you know you can drive a Democrat nuts in just one easy step? It's easy! Just do what President Trump did and suggest delaying the election. Presto! Instant Hysteria!...
Rick Roberts: Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was with President Trump in West Texas. He called to tell Rick all about it. Then a funny thing happened...:the President called!....
I feel like trump is doing that for votes. Not because he cares... 😕😕
Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.
I betcha Trump wishes he could do that opening pitch now and crack some joke about them beating dead birds.
she also supports BLM and is anti trump and pro LGBTQ+ so she’s a real steal. Also comes with 2 dogs.
Sorry, Ana.    You helped gaslight the country and are part of the reason we have Trump.  Lay out your path of understanding and remorse if you want credibility.   Until then your words are opportunistic and hollow.
Recently he’s been more of a trump sycophant &amp; attorney. Deal with it.
Bull shit you will see this whole country flip red! Your Democratic Party is destroying America your the problem with America! #Trump2020 I don’t care if people like Trump or not they want a safe place to raise there kids and your cities are anything but safe!

The three destroyers do want to start schools, but some districts are fighting back. I know Dallas is delaying and my thought is they will not do it. Others are so trump blinded they will force it, but teachers are not having it. They will strike.
Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it’s worst than the other. There will never be a “good” or “perfect” politician. Bernie wasn’t either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process
Good one Debbie. If they were any kind of kids to their father they’d tell them to his face how wrong he is...but then, he wouldn’t listen. I think the Trump’s have forgotten &amp; that they have to live here after this epic failure of leadership is over. They’ll never live this dwn.
Eric Trump is a special type of dumb. He will die believing the world is flat and his dad is a hero.

Moron. President Trump banned Epstein from his properties because he was a creep.
Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.

Did you  seriously just ask if TRUMP would recognize to results of the 2020 election. The question is will the Democrats agree to IMPEACH  if elected?
I have no problem agreeing there is a cult of Trump followers... provided you equally recognize Progressivism, Feminism, and BLM are also modern day cults.

Iceland tested randomly &amp; without regard to symptoms, so results robust to index case issues. Yet their results are the clearest in confirming pediatric heterogeneity. Don’t understand how weaker studies speculating about what could be can trump Iceland’s evidence of what is.

I honestly don't understand this. How is this even legal? How is it that Trump continues to break laws, protocol, morality and ... it's all tolerated?  What is happening to us?

You got trolled by the greatest President in history. I vote Donald J Trump President for life .
Each state would get 1 vote, but let's assume D gov picks all D and R gov all R. Current count is 24 = D &amp; 26 =R. I count at least 2 R govs that would throw Trump aside: Ohio and Vermont. Biden is President. Your thoughts? (3) End

Donald Trump President for life. Then Donald Trump Jr.
I feel like I’m fully redeemed in my long-held view that Trump is a little weird.
The GOP does want RBG's seat badly, they can taste it. This is why we have to vote. 2016 was low-voter, let's turn that around. There will be no squeaking in, Trump must be thrown out by over-whelming public mandate.

Remember when Trump said we should sweep the forest floor.
Campaigning at a funeral! Well that spells nothing more than disregard for John Lewis. Unbelievable how the democrats leave no opportunity to voice their hate towards President Trump. Shameful!

Well troll patrol, besides stalking Trump supporters, spreading demo propaganda what have you LITERALLY done for black lives? Did you get the lowest unemployment #'s EVER for black, Asian, Latino, women's lives the list goes on?  What did you do to help?
Okay.  Can they name something Trump has accomplished — besides inheriting millions — in the past 50 years?
You are a dope
Time for Trump to set another record.   Nixon should have been jailed; that was gross negligence.  We can't make that mistake again or the GOP will never learn.
I can’t stand Latinos that support trump. Like bitch he’ll send your ass back too. Even if you’re from here
Here’s a deal. As per trump phd, md, dds, os, ocd, da, pa, rn there’s no danger in reopening schools. Leadership by example. Send his kid to a public school for a month to show just how safe it is. If not safe for his own son, it’s not safe for anyone’s child.
With Trump it is always about him.
John Lewis didn't go to George Bush inauguration but he was there.  Descent people find a way to have humility,  Trump has a mental issue.  He doesn't even relate to his wife and child.
Trump’s inability to grasp or refusal to accept proven scienfitic concepts is killing Americans.  No more conspiracy theories.  No more dead Americans. We need science not propaganda.  #TrumpHatesScience

I firmly believe trump is ugly on twitter to strategically divert focus toward his words and away from his policies. One side only cares about his policies, and the other hardly calls his policies out and focuses on him being mean. Democratic politicians fall for it all the time.

Hypocrite.   You looked at a shift in 2012. Talked about it on TV. But Trump asks the question and you panic.   Pathetic.
Works for me let's claim Trump as 2020 Election winner an call it a year.
You cannot make this claim and then turn around and vote for Trump or any who make allowances for his behavior.

Yet we can’t stay gridlocked like this - it seems like whether we ditch the filibuster or not, we still end up at Trump 3.0.  When and how does the suffering that the reactionaries are inflicting on us end?

What is it going to take to get Trump to shut his racist mouth and stop saying “China Virus”?  It’s so offensive and does not make anyone believe he’s somehow not responsible.
Trump will remain a factor, but minority parties have a way of many voices being relevant.  And Trump isn’t on the 2022 ballot either.
I’m not surprised that MSM are having a moment Today! It’s what they do! Trump can play them like a Fiddle! We won’t be having  Mail-In Votes Dimwads!
Trump and his complicit republicans are doing a good job of making our democracy “go away”.  I hate all of them for violating their oaths of office.  There is nothing worse than a liar with no honor and no ethics.

The governors were tasked with protecting their own states, and the mayors tasked with their cities. So, are you saying they were all inept? Only certain cities took it real hard. Mostly those busy trying to "resist" anything Trump says.
Or making fun of the man’s death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump’s lead, by attending a gathering that didn’t need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....

Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY “Trump supporters” refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN’T wearing masks because Europe❤️Trump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb

The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican “leaders” and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

May I also remind you what the democratic party was busy worrying about instead of COVID? Trying to find some reason to impeach Trump. None of them were concerned at all. Forgot about that part right?

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people’s lives?
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.

You backed the fascist. It’s sad, but doesn’t change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I’m sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he’s been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.

Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he’s been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.

Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He’s no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump’s
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y’all goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?

No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes

Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you’re right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that’s not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.

Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn’t exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don’t buy that he’d have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump’s rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I’m not convinced Trump’s team can thwart it.
The same Chinese that trump begged their president for help in the upcoming election...those Chinese?

Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it’s like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Wouldn’t it be great if Trump’s “suburban strategy” failed and this marked the beginning of the end of racism in America?

You’re a weak-kneed Trump mama’s boy.  We need a real man as Texas Senator, which in this case is a woman.  Bye bye, Cornyn.
We thankfully got Trump AFTER the traitor left the WH...
But....I thought Trump was racist...
Tweeted: 🛑IMPORTANT WARNING: Mailman just confirmed they have all officially been told to "SLOW THE MAIL DOWN," per trump's Postmaster General. So, for mail-in ballots: SEND THEM 21 DAYS EARLY. Mail on Oct. 13th. Don't wait. SPREAD THIS FAR &amp; WIDE.
UK hadn’t changed as well. Although it doesn’t have gut to say no to America, Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Ramona went full on Trump in this episode!!!  #rhony
Trump fans are a terrorist organization!  They don’t care about the people. Trump fans hate an America that wants to progress and everything about progression.  Facts do not matter to trump fans. All you need to do is listen to them speak and incite riots in American cities.
The greatest President - Trump!
President Trump tweeted that mail-in voting could cause an inaccurate election, and proposed moving the election date. Do you think this is a good or bad idea?
Federalist Society co-founder says Trump’s tweet about postponing the election is grounds for ‘immediate impeachment’
Trump is not the same as in 2016. He can’t drink a glass of water using only his right hand and drags his right foot when he walks. It looks like he had a left brain stroke recently
Keep on pushing.  There are people who see through you pushing this story.  Trump wins handily, but wait we have these uncounted votes that magically lean 99% Joe Biden, all in one truck.

Trump, his children,  his son law, all utilized the Mail in voting system during the last presidential election......
I hope more do in Congress. Mail in voting does not favor one party over the other. In fact, since older people tend to use mail in voting a lot and older people tend to vote Republican, it may actually offer them an advantage. But they listen to trump.
Literally #ETTD Trump owns this death and many others

Herman killed himself following Trump to slaughter. No Sympathy for all the followers, Allowing 45 to rip this country apart. Stupid is stupid dies
What?  lied again? I’m shocked!! (Sarcasm) Obama used a funeral as a campaign stage for Biden!  if you were not able to have a funeral for a loved one, remember this moment. The only people who matter to Obama/Biden are the ones with power !  Imagine if Trump did that
This country is so fucked. Has to be the biggest collection of the dumbest fucking people on the planet
Obama used John Lewis funeral to try to save his hide because he spied on Trump campaign and got caught. Desperation is the nail on the coffin.
And where is the f4cking stock market ? They don’t care that trump is running the country into the ground or that the republican want to take away consumer spending ability with unemployment? They used to react to tan suits now nothing
Covid took his life following tRumps Hoax Propaganda.  Yeah that shit is real. How many more are going to die for Trump?

Ive been a Trump supporter from day 1, barely hanging on through other bullshit. I like his hardliner stance on China, but any pursuit of this nonsense by Trump, and Im done. One of the most dangerous things I've heard a high ranking US leader say in my lifetime.
It totally is! My husband got all freaked out about one of them and I I had to walk him through the logic of trusting Trump until he gives us a reason not to 😂
Because Trump lied and said the Covid was a Hoax.  How many more will follow to the slaughter house? How many more will be lost listening to his lies? Can't have sympathy for those following the dictator tRUmp.
What's up with the Space Force? The Intergalactic Commander-in-Chief never mentions it. It's become the Tiffany Trump of U.S. Armed Forces.

For your amusement... #Trump #MaskUp! 😷 #MakeUp
Yeah, the do it in their sneaky way.  They don't SAY he contracted it there, they just IMPLY it by saying things like, "Herman Cain, tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the Trump Rally in Tulsa".  They say it in such a way that STUPID DEMOCRATS hear it the BAD way !!!

Why Trump Might Quit    We couldn't get that lucky.... it will be a long hard fought battle for the White House.
A Trump Putin puppet coward!!!
Or making fun of the man’s death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump’s lead, by attending a gathering that didn’t need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....
Can’t say I’ve ever seen the trump criticism that you speak of and I live in Texas.
I can’t say I blame him... I would totally take the Trump approach of ignoring it hoping it will go away
Barr is on the way to that. Give it time. He lied about taking orders from trump. He’s lied about Lafayette square. He fired prosecutors who were investigating trumps cronies. Roger stone. You haven’t got much of a leg to stand on here. Better quit before you get further behind.
Cornyn has fallen further in my book than almost any Texas politician during the Trump era.
Just tuned in to MSM And they are about to loose their minds that Trump will delay the Election 🤣🤣
Yet he is trying his best to stop it!? Yeah makes perfect fucking sense. Considering Obama released pedophiles and trump is putting them in jail.

This is what America is supposed to be about-what it has been for 244 years and will be no longer if Trump is re-elected.
Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY “Trump supporters” refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN’T wearing masks because Europe❤️Trump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Thank the lord for President Trump hearing the assertion of the Gillian case too it was more than a sexual assault it was a stalking&amp; brutal attack against that soldier with more than one person involved w/ it    will amnesty be granted
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a “conspiracy theorist” for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Anyone campaigning and voting for Trump is the enemy of America.

Party agnostic, I’ve always been a sucker when former Presidents are together at historic events  Sadly, I don’t see that happening for years as I don’t see Trump performing ceremonial duties of former Presidents
This is about the nominee for the defense department they pulled today.  This Senator already gave a statement that he had a conversation with a Trump last night recommending Trump withdrawal him nomination.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican “leaders” and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people’s lives?
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.

Before Trump, there was no one who would go after Epstein.

Okay.  Can they name something Trump has accomplished — besides inheriting millions — in the past 50 years?
You are a dope
Time for Trump to set another record.   Nixon should have been jailed; that was gross negligence.  We can't make that mistake again or the GOP will never learn.

These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY “Trump supporters” refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN’T wearing masks because Europe❤️Trump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.

he signed a pledge to support whoever the nominee is. and he has always said he will do what it takes to stop trump. running independenf would hurt that cause.
Jesus, Will Hurd!  How can voting for Trump even be a possibility at this point, considering everything you know?! Aren’t 6703 dead Texans enough to prove your fealty to Trump?! Are you really gonna dangle 4 more deadly years over our heads? My god! Disgraceful.
Sad that this man will not get any type of recognition simply because he’s a Trump supporter. At what point does the left stop picking and choosing?? Haven’t heard about him on CNN...
Trump is not a doctor, neither are you. Trump stands to benefit financially by selling this snake oil.
No Free world under Trump and current GOP leadership. Try something else.
All these conservatives asking "where?" probably really don't know.  If fox and trump and Q are your only news sources, there is a lot you won't know.
No the UN is right. Trump is hurting peaceful protesters. Thank you UN.
Good, I didn’t vote for Trump discipline. Notice the question marks at the end obviously meant as a thought that he completely cleared up in his 5:30 press conference, but I love how people go crazy by a thought by the President on a social media platform that allows kiddie porn
Thank you Duchess!  Native Texan all aboard!
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction god bless Trump 😂
Trump barely won in 2016 by 1 percent. This year he will loose by 6 percentage in Pennsylvania and lose the elections
Right!! You got two choices, Joe Biden or the Orange fuck Trump. We know what Biden is about and we dying seeing what Trump is about. I choose to live and have a brighter day. I’m voting for Biden.
In ten years she’ll be telling us how much Trump did for immigrants.
President Trump suggested delaying the election because of the coronavirus, something he cannot legally do. Top Republicans quickly rejected the idea.
Obama a real President  Trump a dictator and a laughing Stock 😂😂 that wants to delay the elections. 🤫🤫👎🏿
Ahh yes, another Republican that Never Trump GOPers will fellate dry for taking an action that is too little too late.   Want to do something? Introduce articles of impeachment for Trump and Barr.
Has our system of government exceeded its life expectancy too? Because your man Trump is working on trashing it, too, Fifth Generation American.
#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump often displays ignorance, but this tweet is actually a symptom of his brain decline, cognitive impairment, &amp; frank mental illness. He is out of touch with reality &amp; is incompetent.
Trump has dragged this economy straight into the gutter. We will be like that movie The Book of Eli if we are forced to remain under this idiot.  He is awful.
Native Texan All Aboard!          R E D   W A V E   R I S I N G  &amp;  S W E L L I N G !  V O T E   A L L   R E D   I N   N O V - S A V E   A M E R I C A !
I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people’s lives?
Yup.  They're a cult.  If Trump told them that gravity was a hoax and jumping off buildings was patriotic they would be deny they're falling while staring at the ground rapidly approaching them.
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.
Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally
Trump loyalist who tested positive for coronavirus is America’s ‘dumbest’ congressman, says Lincoln Project co-founder     Absolutely, his mask was a prop, not a real mask. You hate to wish someone harm, but maybe a few days
The democrats were to busy trying to Impeach Trump look where it got us. This is affecting the hole world no country as been spared. And many places that thought it was over it’s coming back.  Just look at France.
#BarakObamaIsARacist   I say we start rioting unti they unseal Hussein’s records!   America has had enough of this BS!! Obama/Biden  got us here, #Trump is our ONLY way out!   How did Obama come into politics as a poor coke head and leave a multi-millionaire?  #SilentNoMore
You backed the fascist. It’s sad, but doesn’t change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I’m sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he’s been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.
Lancet Formally Retracts Fake Hydroxychloroquine Study Used By Media To Attack Trump
So if Trump wins with control of both chambers, Obama’s given his blessing to drop the filibuster rule.  Can hardly wait!!
Nancy Dumbass Pelosi said in February we have nothing to fear come out and enjoy your self while she was walking around China Town is SF. And when Trump stoped all flights from China the democrats said he was being xenophobic.
None of them are going to work. Remember the parable of the scorpion and the frog. Trump is the scorpion. It’s all over.
Trump was busy meeting with the Family of a murdered soldier at Fort Hood. I think that’s more important than that funeral is or was.
If shutdowns are required, there is no reason that a slight delay in voting isnt something that can be done, we already delayed other conventions. Donald Trump Suggests Delaying ‘Most Inaccurate and Fraudulent’ 2020 Election
If Trump is going to lose anyway, isn’t this a great year to put forth a third party conservative candidate to lay the groundwork for a victory in 2024? Who can we recruit?   Anybody is preferable to 95% of what the Republican Party is offering.
Important. Congress and SCOTUS must stand up to this kind of behavior.
Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he’s been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.
#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump’s mental impairment &amp; cognitive decline make a national strategy on #COVID__19 impossible. Other nations have controlled the virus. We are dying out here. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
story but that is not why Trump hates China.  Did I forget to mention he still build hotels there?  God I hate this program when it comes to responding or having a convo but i digress
By the time Trump loses on Election Day, he will have murdered nearly a quarter of a million Americans (not including the American soldiers in Afghanistan whose Taliban murderers are paid Russia bounties).  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I hear moscowmitch has a bunch of money. But don’t bother with Trump. He’s apparently cash poor.🤣🤣🤣

Today Trump the 🤡 said research for antibody treatments are being heavily prioritized. TerraCoV2 is a NIH vaccine licensed by OGEN based on antibody science.
Bro get your gratata lookin ass out of here. The man was literally agreeing with you and when he stated an opinion, which you said people are entitled to, u drag him. And yea not every trump supporter is an asshat but imma say most are and so are you. No need to be that toxic
I don't think it's breaking news that Donald Trump will have to use absentee balloting in November. He lives at the White House but his residence is in Florida. duh The media acts like absentee balloting and mail-in voting are the same thing. They're NOT.

they're seriously sick in the head and also have Trump derangement syndrome. They're the reason why this country is fighting each other.
Masks do nothing.   This vaccine will be a non-starter.
Wonder if Trump knows what a hanging chad is.
(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.
(2) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump at fake briefing now drones his monotone script with (a) reduced freestyle BS; (b) fewer questions from press; &amp; (c) always calling on Sinclair/OAN minions.
(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
Is that why you are running scared and doing what you do best, lying to the American people  about everything !!!  The “Trump Virus,  Voter fraud and the economy!!!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He’s no better than any of them.
WhY is it we punish families and small businesses for bKP but he is smart? WHy is his business allow to drain our precious economy but no one else?  Why is he not held to the same starndards Everything Trump supports list and rage at others for he has done MANY times and recorded
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump’s
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
Regardless, as I have repeated, what u as a trump support, is the preceived injustice &amp; power others in DC have, but he is no different.  He is not an outside, he is part of their club &amp; always has been, but back to bKP...
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y’all goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?
McCarthy is a wanna be fart smelling dick just like trump
Well Trump needs to tell Russia to back off then.
They’ll blame President Trump.
Get this all you BLM supporters! When Bernell Trammell, a peaceful loving BLACK man was shot in cold blood in front of his BLACK owned business. BLM told his business partners who reached out to them for help that they won’t help them because he supported Trump! Hypocrites!

Is there a way to measure the impact of the trump administration throwing out the pandemic playbook prepared specifically for a situation such as this? #CNNTownHall
Maybe they delay the outcome calling all swing states into question, trump campaign sues, drags out Electoral voting into December, God knows
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn’t even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn’t have a clue but they deserve it. What’s that saying you reap what you sow.

Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.

Cotton, hope you go to the next tRUMP rally and make the same decision Cain did!
3 types of Dems:  Elitist who's above the law because$$$$$ they will buy as many votes as they can.  Sleeping demoncratic the largest group. You woke them up they remember Reagan. They will vote Trump.  Poor and poorly educated. They riot and kill or work three jobs. Not voters
Does not want to go down with the ship, but he was glad to sail along ... hypocrite, cya maneuver.  You cannot wash off the stench of Trump that easily.  Sorry.
'Donald Trump killed Herman Cain': Liberals waste absolutely zero time politicizing Herman Cain’s death  and blaming Trump
President Trump made a stop in Texas on Wednesday, visiting the Double Eagle Oil Rig in Midland. Correspondent Clayton Neville had more information on Thursday's WBAP Morning News.
I don’t remember Will’s criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you’re right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that’s not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.
30 JULY, 2020 When will #CNN, #AC360, #Donlemon, #BrianStelter, #ChrisCuomo, and #JeffZucker all be held accountable for all the lies and smears against President #RealDonaldTrump, Conservatives, Trump supporters, and the American public?
Greg Gutfield is a hypocrite-so high &amp; mighty complaining abt Twitter!  2-3 weeks ago he posted on Twitter saying "Everybody should hate all Republicans! They shld  hate all Republicans &amp; President Trump!" Don't believe me? Ask him!
My issue with Will is that he is ex-IC. He co-signed on way too many tRump attacks on our IC people and sources around the world. He knows better than most of how dangerous tRump has been to our national security and he will forever wear the Scarlett T as far as I’m concerned.
Trump 2020 no matter what
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction
Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn’t exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don’t buy that he’d have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump’s rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I’m not convinced Trump’s team can thwart it.
The same Chinese that trump begged their president for help in the upcoming election...those Chinese? JFC you are not bright at all...🙄😂😂😂
So your asking him to lose? He avoids Trump he wins by a landslide, he debates Trump and he loses and gets a ton of vids made of him like Jeb Bush did in 2016
I seriously think Trump wants out of office, I really don't think he wanted to ever be President.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction 😂😂
"voting my conscience" by voting for someone that would do 90 percent of the things trump is doing but would be friendly about it.
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
IGNORE Donald. Some call him, “Treasonous Trump,” everyone else calls him “DIP-SHIT DONNIE.”He wants you to buy Prince Harry and M. Markel book.
Big tech lies about suppression of conservatives and efficacy of Hydroxychloriquine, crickets.... Roger Stone broke no law, but uttered a trivial error in memory and FBI raids his house at 6am in the morning.  This is why Trump will/must win
Look at Trump and his African American. Bet I know what he calls him behind his back.
Trump is a dictator not a president 👎🏿👎🏿
Nice spin, my boy. You should be in politics. Donny Trump 👀
Trump is a laughing Stock no thanks 👎🏿
I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump’s birth certificate to verify his birth info).
How popular is   provides an updating calculation of the president's approval rating, accounting for each poll's quality, recency, sample size, and partisan lean.

Help me real quick. You’re not fond of Barack, and Michelle appears to bother you because she allegedly does anything to remain relevant. I’ve seen tweets about trump where you appear to not care for him either. Where do you stand? I’m curious.
President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
President Trump and his campaign reckless put the General public, the secret services and his campaign staff in danger of contracting Covid19. It was only a matter of time before someone died! God rest Mr. Cain's soul and comfort his family Amen.
Like Ford. Can't wait to find out what happened to all that missing Trump inauguration money. Gonna get juicy when he's out of office!
Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump’s term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You’re all talk with no action.  Why hasn’t anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn’t like trump when McCain was alive but since then you’re playing good guy to trump. It’s obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.

Maybe we should start saying the top military brass HAS NO BALLS, not even brass.. maybe trump neutered them too. Then they too would be COWARDS, with wha tails they have left between their legs.
Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don’t matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
Trump is often persuading.  His goal here may be to draw attention to problems in mail-in voting.  Or it may be to get Democrats to commit to accepting the results of the election.  Or it could be a random thought, but don't ignore persuasion or you will misunderstand Trump.
The ignorant love Trump.
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples’ lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn’t accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.Trump's America.
all of a sudden, they realize what the Democrats have been screaming for 3 1/2 years Donald J Trump is UNFIT for office smh...Americans!
Trump ain’t said shit about how that man caught the rona at his rally and died

Vickie’a a Trump supporter so she’s probably making that face for different reasons
It’s so painful to watch so many outcries for help, people are suffering, dying, not being able to make ends meet. Among a plethora of things he is, Trump is undeniably selfish. Ignoring the people he’s supposed to be helping. It’s so draining.
Trump hates AMERICA and it's BLACK and BROWN people!

It's an amazingly accurate analogy of Trump himself.

praying for your safety, watching Hurricane Hanna on the weather channel, stay safe oh and by the way i feel the same way you do about trump deep deep in my heart

yeah playing right into trump's hand
"True" Democrats support Joe Biden &amp; those that believe in American Democracy you can have the rest of them they are the 1's that jump ship when they dont get what they want Trump is Anti-Government so its good they join you guys &amp; perhaps the silent majority will save you guys.

hey all you folks that voted for trump so he could run the country like he did his business, how you like it now...by the way governing a country is nothing like operating a business especially one that does not have board members...be careful what you wish for
If we put Trump 2020 on every mask they would say we no longer needed to wear the mask
Genocide on Black and Brown People via COVID-19 ordered by Donald J Trump simply  without a plan, by the way he will use the kids to get rid of the older ones by sending them to school, Trumps Deconstruction of the USA

Ex-Trump aide says Ghislaine Maxwell ‘has the goods’ on presidentCan I wait to answer that until after the 1st non debate?

Let’s see if Trump does it at Herman Cains Funeral. That is if he goes 🤷‍♂️
We ought to be afraid based on all that has happen what is to become of this country if Trump does not get in. He has ego issues an opens mouth to often but he has kept things going in spite of what’s thrown at him. Socialism is where this is going if he is not elected
Look what Trump did! He states we should delay the election and all of a sudden they want to cure this shit! Funny how that works!🙏🏻🇺🇸
True! Couldn't get elected any other year but he's a shoo-in going against Trump :-)
Tend two agree but we've had three and a half years for Trump to prove he's no leader he's only there to serve himself and his crime family

Please tell us these Great Doctors are going to meet with President Trump.
Finally" Doctors are standing up telling the truth of what works and no one had to die. God Bless them and I hope they meet with our Great President Trump.
This is Awesome" Trump is right once again. It is the Democrats that made this whole thing Political and people have died and are dying.
I’m not surprised given what’s become the norm for Trump. Respect isn’t part of Trump’s makeup, just more of the same from him. He would have found some way to make it about him.
You can spin it any way you want, everyone knows Trump denied there was a problem for 2 months while other countries were setting up PPE and tests.
No, because Trump owns them...
Trump was working with faulty info.  Which was what people want. Presidents have advisers for a reason his were on the other side. So he made discussions based on that he know that now so do the people
If you are a woman and support trump please re-evaluate your life.
President Trump is a genius. Everything I say WTH with him, he proves me wrong. I’ve quit questioning him. I know he is there for us and America an D.C. I know he is extremely capable, I trust him entirely.

Thus is the first time I’ve heard anyone say Pence is a bad evil one.  I don’t believe that. He’s not bad or evil...He may not be the Candidate to help get Trump across the finish line in November, but that is for other reasons than bad and evil. No disrespect to a Patriot,but NO
what about the people in south Texas who are being sent home to die!  Your not talking about this or helping them!  Please keep the mask requirement on if or when the numbers go done.  You are in a big hurry to look good to Trump!  Your killing Texans!

Sorry for you, but Trump will be re-elected.
From what it looks like. It won’t go through until next week, but no care act or extra unemployment package as of now.   We are waiting for trump to do the final review last I read.
Guess what Tyler, you’re not being a quirky free thinker by voting for trump and listening to be Shapiro, you’re a bigoted pussy who’s desperate for someone to come up with an excuse for why you being a piece of shit is okay.
All this chaos is happening because they think it will hurt Trump. Think again!

President Trump please don’t force feed us the GATES STRATEGY!!!
Trump is hitting about .167 in a contract year. Is America dumb enough to resign him? 😅
I believe the Plan is to get Biden into office through lies and misinformation about Trump. Then he will act as a puppet for the extreme left’s agenda to turn America into a socialist or communist nation. Bernie and the Squad will be the Puppet Masters funded by Soros and others.
Even if Trump goes on to win Texas. It must really give you pause that Biden is so close to him in Texas.

All I can say is look at the company that he was with! Howard Stern has demons among him, and he is a pervert! I can judge for myself what is evil, and what is good! I sent Trump a warning also, but weather he read it is another thing. I hate the evil in the hearts of men!
Curiously that is how long I have been free from demonic oppression!  If u r talk about Trump I really don’t care! What man on this earth is qualified to make things great! That other puppet is not any better! No one sees liberals for the evil they are, or the curses they bring!

Amen. But, assuming Trump’s past responses to those who disagree with him, his previous verbal and authoritarian payback toward those lawfully protesting, his slavish relationships with authoritarian dictators, and a personality disorder that makes it impossible for him (cont)

Love this screen name. The liberals hate it when Trump talks to Putin. But they are working hard to make us more like the failed Soviet Union. Truly irrational.
Calabresi shouldn’t be allowed to teach law and should impeach himself. He’s partly responsible for tRump. It will be satisfying to watch a new administration and D controlled congress undo the damage that the FS has done
He listens to science unlike trump killing Herman Cain and 151,000+ people.  I wouldn’t trust him for anything. #votebidenandgopout

I don't take spiritual advice from anyone who is voting for Trump. Repent yourself.
You clearly missed my point. I'm talking about how Trump and the Republicans might steal the election from the American people.
Trump first announced his candidacy for President in the late summer of 2015. And you can bet he was planning it several months if not years ahead, starting with his "birtherist" claims against Obama.
Trump's fumbling is easily explained by his inability to trust intelligence agencies who are clearly opposed to him, and obfuscation by your friends in Beijing.

You think Greg Abbott wouldn't call the Texas legislature back into session to save Trump? Hell, he's killed thousands at Trump's behest.
Why leave out that he traveled a lot before and after the rally and could have gotten it from traveling? Must suck to think Trump Trump Trump 24/7.
Herman Cain is getting ratio’d on his own death tweet because he didn’t wear a mask to a Trump rally, caught coronavirus, and died  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Herman Cain did all that shucking &amp; jiving w/ no mask at the Trump rally &amp; he can’t even get a RIP tweet.
Could it be a Gambit to get Republican-controlled legislatures to appoint Trump electors? Which gets us this.
By the way -- if Trump did try to exploit this provision of the Constitution and get Republican-controlled legislatures to appoint electors, this would be the outcome.
What are your thoughts on Trump saying we should delay the election?
When trump was elected, my thoughts is he will never go away. He will spends years and years on his conspiracy theories. His hateful rhetoric will last until he dies.
I've seen a number of people trying to defend Trump by saying the 32.9% drop in GDP isn't as bad as it sounds, since that is the annualized number based on one quarter.  Because an 8.225% GDP drop in three months is perfectly fine, I guess.
Trump, of course, has no ability to cancel the presidential election. But could this be part of a gambit to get Republican-controlled state legislatures to simply appoint electors who will vote for Trump without a vote of the people at all? Because that would be constitutional.
Nancy becomes POTUS if we not careful on this. Trump/Pence are out on 1/20/21 12:00pm if no election 24th Amend.
The Crazy D’s are grasping at straws, trying to blame President Trump for COVID-19. Sad, huh that they deny that China is not our friend. Truth is: COVID stands for China’s Own Viral Infectious Disease! Trump’s been saying that from the beginning. He was right!
The article in  retweet said Obama's Fair Housing Initiative would “make it possible for low-income minorities to choose suburban living.”   There's no question what kind of low-income people Trump had in mind with his tweet yesterday.

Trump derangement syndrome has left some people without the ability to critically think for themselves.  Even when an over abundance of evidence exists to their contrary argument. This is life and death for people with cormobitities.  Would you want to rely solely on masks?
Trump derangement syndrome robs those afflicted with it of the inability to have a critical thought process.   Let’s just ban HCQ!!! For all Democrats.
I’m not one anyway..." Are there more of you ?? ahhh... preparing for the 'no tricks' mail-in ballots that democrats trust will help them defeat Trump ??
I hadn't mentioned China" Oh yes, implicitly you had. (oh you dems are so sly....). Proven hundreds of times their responsibility in covid19 among other anti-American issues and you blame Trump?? Oh... I get it, you were not defending/shielding China... just saying things...
where are you getting THAT from? " Easy: your blaming Trump for their actions to shield them from accountability. Looks pretty obvious... don't you think ??
beautifully weaves the romance of American ideals in shows like Hamilton, life as an immigrant in Chicago fully invested in those ideals, and the soul-crushing reality of the Trump administration.

Trump had the economy booming &amp; more people working than ever, then you democratic clowns destroyed that with your tyrannical #Scamdemic. Now that you've ruined the places you were elected, you're trying to beg and borrow millions to trillions to unfuk it. Then tax everyone later
But the kids who who die will mostly be poor and/or minority, so their lives really matter to Trump voters?  And as for teachers -- why would the GOP base be upset that people like me, who supposedly teach students to hate America, have died?

Hello Dear Mr. President Donald J. Trump, if you want to drive the left crazy and the media nuts. Plus give a rest to your supporters a few day from Trump fatigue. Disappear for 2 weeks from the spot light, enjoy family life. Watch Americans rise, appreciate your work .
Let me see if I can guess...  “Trump made me so angry I couldn’t help it.”  What do I win?
In 102 days I’m voting for TRUMP.  Pass it on.
dude how? trump didn’t cause this.. literally know ur facts before you start calling a party a hypocrite and complicit
Re lies Mr. Trump???  You only now show concerns on wearing mask and this virus. Blinded are xyou leadership, really wish you showed leadership VS. Polls. Should have been more concern about leadership and polls would have hollowed. Sorry but not rock science.
What are hamburders? If You hate America more than Trump by all means no one is stopping anyone from leaving!! 👋
Unfortunately, Trump told Don Jr. he knew “very interesting” things about Roswell, so maybe he just saw next year's cameras and tvs.
You live in America right? Then he is your president. Just like if Biden wins, he’ll be my president. Stop being a baby about all this. And stop confirming to the Left’s ideologies. They make up rumors about Trump to make him looks bad. Start doing research yourself! God bless!
Head ups everyone. The trump show must go on.
THIS IS HUGE! Black and Minority Voter Approval for President Trump At Record Highs  via
This #NeverTrumper celebrates every one of your (many) comical failures.  Hooray for the comedy that is #trump. Makes every day worth waking up for.   #ridingwithbiden
And he blamed Trump for sending in help.  What an airhead.
July 22- more than 200 Texan deaths.  and Trump are failing us! #COVID19TX #COVID19Pandemic
Top General Called Trump 'an Idiot' and Said Melania Was 'Inquisitive
I honsstly have no idea whag your point is besides a vote for anyone beside Biden is helping Trump.
That's Congress, not Trump.
Science instead of trump .Instead you went along with his horrible leadership of #TrumpVirus. People would of been able to start living a normal life. But no, you didn’t. Now you want to cut the extra down to $100. This country is a damn mess. #votebiden
Wait... I have to vote for Biden or else?  So now it's not even enough to not vote Trump.  This is interesting.
I really believe the hate of Trump is a mental illness.
Dude, Trump has 5 kids from 3 different women.
Wrong.  CNN reported on several occasions that there was no wiretap on Trump’s campaign.  That was patently false.  Not only was there a wiretap, but it was illegally unmasked and the transcripts walked into the WH.
Sadly, the lightning bolt did not animate her and she did not walk to Washington and beat Donald Trump with her torch.
A friend posted pictures allegedly of swords confiscated by police in Portland and used them to justify Trump deploying the Gestapo.  I asked my friend, who regularly carries an AR-15 at political protests, when he became an opponent of the right to keep and bear arms.
It not Trump, it’s that he is exposing their corruption. And threatening their power and illicit funds. Show me how a political figure can go into politics broke and leave a multi millionaire. Obama for example.
I have requested my mail in ballot. I encourage everyone that can, do so. Every vote counts!  Even though we know he’s gonna protest mail in votes!  By the way trump and Family have mailed in their ballots for years. So has the VP.  Why is it a problem now?
did I just hear Mary trump school Megan McCain on her attending a dinner for her aunt at the White House… I think I did!
Only in RepubliKKKan land lead by Trump
I do not want spam calls from any GOP including trump.    . Don’t give in.
Trump campaign demands right to spam your text messages.
Pro Trump demonstration in Temecula California. Over 5000 people saying they had enough of Liberal Democrat Pelosi &amp; Gavin Newsom destructive policies against the state of California. Protesters ask to recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom.John Lewis didn't go to George Bush inauguration but he was there.  Descent people find a way to have humility,  Trump has a mental issue.  He doesn't even relate to his wife and child.
Most Americans voted for Trump
She missed DACA under Obama. Trump ruined her second chance.
Trump’s housing tweets, explained
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.
Thinks? Pretty much certain the way he is acting.  All five year olds, ever: If I can’t play with it, I’m going to break it so nobody can play with it.  Trump is a bully with no compassion, he will tear everything down in the tim between the election and the inauguration.
Hehehe. We all know what bless your heart really means.  Good for him.  Trump wants fox to be state media.
Obama criticism is one thing, but to act like Trump is better for the black community when he’s letting a pandemic kill us is really worms for brains
Please tell me he coughed on trump at least
You are ignoring that trump thinks he is above the law and his supporters are letting him be so he could do this.
Amen! 4 years is enough....unless he suspends elections Heil trump 😬
Hmmmm, interesting thoughts.  Trumps dream...heil trump
Heil trump.....
Heil trump....

Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
This sounds like something Trump would say
Boy bye!  NOW you love Trump.  Playing golf with him during COVID increases, acting like a damn fool for Cavanaugh. Lighting the skin tone of your opponent because you are desperate. You are effectively helping him destroy the US and you will deserve it.  Karma has no deadline.
That is assuming trump will leave the office.  Economy can be repaired.  Letting a dictator take over the country only has one solution.
I live here too and more and more are seeing what is going on even if they dont want to admit it.  I dont care how we get there so long as Trump loses and gets kicked out.
You don’t understand because you are not affected. You are blinded by privilege. Must be nice. How does that feel?🤔 In your next life,I so hope that you don’t come back as a person of color.  You are blind and clueless as to how Trump really feels about brown folks.
While Trump ignored the Coronavirus pandemic, his idiot son tweeted nonsense.
Men? Jesus Christ slow down teanna trump
Bruh, you dressed up in the same suit combination as Trump.  You loss me already!
Recently spent time in mountains of KY, poorest of the poor - surprised at how many were Trump supporters. The see the Deep State of none for thee &amp; all for me &amp; they are repulsed.
I have said it once and I will say it again. President Trump has a chance of doing some really great things if he is fortunate to win a second term and can overcome the Democrats madness. We should give him the chance to do what Democrats have been unable to do for years.
Please please help us President Trump. #Hcqworks
Go visit the local hospitals and see how the TRUMP VIRUS HAS AFFECTED TEXAS. DUMDASS
No one cares about Benghazi anymore but Trump voters. So please explain how that would hurt Biden?

Were we not talking about Children?  Typical koolaid Trump supporter,  don't even remember what the subject was.  Now, who is using insults and name calling.  Go worship Trump while he is still in office but not for long.
Trump is self centered! It is all about him.
Drug makers have bilked patients long enough with their outrageous pricing. It's time that the Federal Government reign them in.
Trump has already said he will not (cannot) debate
Heil trump...will he leave White House after losing?
Lying trump is trending
Lying trump is trending...please retweet
There is truth to what you are saying. There are for profit prisons. Obama shut a lot of them down, Trump opened them back up as soon as he came into office. Also a felon must be “off paper” to vote. It takes a lot to get off paper. It’s a form of voter suppression
New low...As people die daily?  I would say the deaths that are occurring and Trump playing golf,unbothered; is the new low.
What the hell is wrong with you.  We have a President talking to Putin without telling us what is being said. With almost 150,000 Americans dead and you are hooked on 4 Americans who died? Trump has got to go!!!
Donald trump and Kanye west
Fuck Fort Worth, fuck all y’all, fuck the police, and fuck trump. Racists.
Your tweet inspired me to share my first visit to the White House.   I was so proud to take this picture with the people's house as a backdrop.  Look at it now, is it still considered the people's house? I'm very sad,  the Trump Administration must go.

On Joes worst day he's better than Trump on his best day
Anything less than the current disaster is acceptable. Just wait until Trump's idiocy affects you...your tune will change, Romney.
I think a lot of people support Trump cause they are tired of lifelong Politicians. No reason for people to be in Washington 20 years and average person having to work two jobs just to live. Democratic Party needs to find someone not a “Politician”
Kristie, The only time the Dems open their mouths at all is when it is an Anti-Trump smear.  The Dems are power hungry for a New World Order BUT they will NOT have the opportunity unless God Almighty allows it! Trump WILL win re-election!!!!!!!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Darryl is my favorite character from the walking dead, but I know he voted for trump 😩
#ReadTheEntireArticle God bless your hearts. 🥰
You are, undoubtedly, part of the problem because none is as blind as he who will not see. Money for HBCUs and an unemployment rate inherited from the previous administration is apparently enough to keep you out of the "suburbs" Trump wants to protect.
Sean notice that all of these Democrat idiots are running to the same beat " That Trump will not leave if not elected". Only a child could come up with an idea like that. Had to come from Pelosi who is already on record as saying. These folks are so childish it's scary.

This new executive order could bring big changes if it passes. I for one am for reduced cost of prescription medication and the such, but that won’t make me support trump for doing one good deed, especially considering he didn’t want this a few months ago when it first came up.
Trump we can see from anywhere in the world that the the Russians and China are interfering in our election process.  #Pay #Attention America

#MeToo I'm voting for President Donald J Trump!!
I really would like to know if Trump’s son is going to school face to face when school starts.
do you ever get tired of lying every time you get behind the podium. You said Trump hasn’t changed?? So I guess saying the virus is going to disappear is the same as him saying things are going to get worse. Now all of the sudden he thinks mask are patriotic?👀
And they continue blaming the cause for the spread of the virus on President Trump. I guess people are so self centered and not concerned about spreading it to others including their loved ones.
As Eric and I said before this came out .. Trump had his best week of of consistant critical thinking messaging on the big issues ever.  Best favorability ratings (likely not registered voters) in months. Focused, consistent messsging on the big issues works!
Trump has no idea how this process works, Jake.
I am 66 yrs old today. Met you at SpartaCon in Maryland  (was a panel host). Wondering if my fave Imperator/Templar might take a moment to shout out a Happy Birthday? And, for the record, Trump sux! 😇
Not fit to wear the uniform &amp; should be prosecuted. If she doesn’t like Trump she should keep her stupid mouth shut until she can get out of the Service; she is a disgrace to our Soldiers.
We must demand accountability from #Facebook for profiting off of Donald Trump's misleading, dangerous ads.Key federal oversight bodies must investigate Facebook &amp; stop them from profiting off vote-suppressing ads.
This was a dumb statement   Trump won’t get a pass You won’t get a pass  Effective communication means I don’t have to interpret what you are saying  Say what you mean, and mean what you say!
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
Many people are saying that the Trump administration will now be known as The Washington Felony Team
Can someone explain to me in the 40 years she has been in Washington what is one Government Department she has made better?  In 40 years of being in DC I someone to tell me 1 thing that she has done that has help the average US person. I don’t really care for Trump but he only 3.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don’t like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
Name one fault Trump has taken responsibility for. Politicians, Dem or Rep, don’t do that. That’s why we call them politicians.
Very accurate depiction of Trump’s coronavirus briefing.
President Trump should cut off all law enforcement funding immediately or whatever funds they receive that's within his discretion.
Do people not see what trump is doing. He is stationing these military men around the country because the election is coming up and they will enterfer with the election and when it’s time to leave the White House they will protect him. Let’s watch and see !!!
So Trump has n blood on his hands, right?
So, Trump's secret police is out terrorizing the American populace in an effort to show what another president would do?  C'mon Boris, you can't be that far up Donald's butt...or can you?

Aka my grandma, a Mexican, trump loving homophobic chatholic ☺️ I love it here
Yes but they were using scare tactics and nobody stopped them. These protest turned violent because Trump called them thugs but they have a legitimate reason to be angry.
Not me, nothing will stop me from voting for Trump
Trump wants to Keep America great again. But he's running this country like a dictatorship and yet. People still support him. What a fucking joke
Pop never criticized Morey, so that’s bullshit you made up.  Pop supported Adam Silver’s response to the controversy.  There is difference.  Trump has done nothing to help Hong Kong maintain its independence, and that’s a fact.
Make it blink 😳🥴
Trump supporters try to act like big shit. Untill you tell them the facts. They're fuckin Nazi they just don't want to admit it 🤡🤡🤡
Do you have “Trump refuses to leave office” on your November card or January card?
Well as Trump is prone to do. He creates a problem that doesn't exist and comes up with a solution. Here's some facts from the states that already have mail-in voting.  No advantage for Dem or Rep. Simply Trumps way to drum up Republican support.
Then these trump supporters wanna say black lives don’t matter, they do bless this man🙏🏽
Cain died in Georgia. Trump would stack an all white jury, and be found not guilty.
Don't listen to this piece of shit. All teachers can go on strike for violating safety. Trump's on his way out soon.
Trump fired and hired a new post office chief. To create damage to post office.
Crashing economy. I'm so tired of Trump brand winning.
It's almost like people prefer a podcast with interesting guests that cover a myriad of topics over a podcast with some screeching broad that talks about Trump nonstop.
Herman Cain speaking out on Tulsa, OK President Trump rally, "masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOLPLE ARE FED UP!" It's a little difficult to feel bad for somebody who ignored science, and put himself in that position.
Trump" smart people know it ( election fraud will happen with mail ballots), stupid people may not and some people may not want to talk about it"
$PRPO I’m out the trump rumors messed up the momentum of this one .
My prediction is that in October, Trump will try to an executive order to prevent the states from doing Mail-In Ballots. States will then have to be in a mad rush to try to get stuff set up for voter turnout with more people than average because of that take away.

Trump forgot Hong Kong. Spurs aren’t actually responsible for foreign policy.  They play basketball.
This man is insane. Just because he is not an honest man that doesn't mean everyone is like him. Nothing like this has every happen until this President came along. This  is not right.  Don't let him!!!🙏🙏🙏
Yes Trump supporters marching on a capital with guns is peaceful 😒 Give me a break
If we go “all or nothing “ then the answer is always “NOTHING “ and that is what the trolls will promote!  So join trump through the side door!  This whole post is a “pro trump “ bunch of divide and conquer “ nonsense!  Don’t do it and recognize it every time!!
If Trump or Biden weren’t an option, who would you have voted for? I personally was looking at Yang before he dropped.
RONALD MCDONALD TRUMP
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: Mail-In Voting For November Election Over Coronavirus Opens Door For Fraud, Experts Say
Trump is not a saint &amp; because of his incompetence the USA has lost 150,000 &amp; shame on him he refuses to take responsibility. His love affair with Putin is questionable. He refuses to accept that Putin has paid people to kill our military troops in Afghanistan. Facts or fake?????
Trump's gonna lose because he's a dumbfuck who won't get off Twitter and concentrate on that small job of running the country
Man oh man, I can't wait til people find out Trump gets a pension and money for office space and a staff when he leaves office.
Its a bot
President Trump tweeted the possibility of postponing the elections. It is a move that can only be made by Congress. Do you think the 2020 election should be delayed?
Nancy P and the democrats have been working with china for several years to develop a plan to get Trump out. This is all on purpose by democrats.

Trump Logic: It’s safe enough during COVID-19 (THE USA WHO HAS THE MOST POSITIVE CASES AND DEATHS IN THE WORLD) to send children to schools and open the country but it’s not safe enough to vote.   This dude is a disgrace and needs to be removed from office.
How else would he get listening devices in the walls?  Putin still needs intel after trump is voted out.
If a city hosts a Trump rally, they need to be paid in advance.  This is why American banks won't give Trump building loans.
He won because of people like yourself. It isn't hard to impress trump supporters.
This is obscene! Why is this happening?  Trump Administration is incompetent!
You are a disgusting, trump pandering excuse for a human being!
What about voting machine from when Hillary was running against trump
So stop disabled, elderly, military votes ?  Did you know Trump votes by mail and so do millions of other legitimate registered voters?  Stopping people from voting is ridiculous.
Bot! Bot! Bot! Trump doesn’t give a damn about you, your friends or anybody. He just cares only for himself. Always has been about him. Always will be about him.

This is how Donald Trump gets 4 more years
Trump's staff no doubt reminds him of Carville's quote "It's the economy, stupid." about the  importance of a good economy to being re-elected. He will try every dirty trick in the book to circumvent the election. He's nuts.

Trump drops idea of delaying election date. He can’t do that. Only Congress can. Guess what Congress won’t do? Change the date. — Vote. Early. By Mail. On November 3rd. Get this piece of garbage out of our house. 🗳🇺🇸
You can't call out Joe Biden and not mention the creepiness that is
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.

Want to know why people follow him and believe everything he says as gospel? It's the same reason trump became president, popularity!!
Trump's tweets about affordable housing. And black families living next to you. What a sick 🤮 lunatic racist.
Exactly. Yes, Obama built detention centers. But he did not use them the way the Trump admin has under their Zero Tolerance policy. Caring children for long periods, losing their parents. How can anyone be okay with that? It’s horrific.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have very different plans for the next four years.

They sure do☝️! They don't care, they just want to hurt President Trump's reelection.
Trump has bankrupted many of his companies. So, no, I still wouldn’t trust him.
So did President Trump see miracle happen. Love you Leo. ✌👍♥️😂😂🇨🇱
Seeing my mom commenting "Trump 2020 😊" on Facebook posts is really bothersome. Fuck that guy.

Hydroxychloroquine Study Finds the Drug 'Significantly' Cuts Death Rate   #HCQWORKS
Trump's going to pardon her because like Roger Stone she'll talk about him doing the nasty with epstein and young girls 👭.
Everyone with a brain agrees.  He is another trump plaything suggested no Doubt by the boss man named Putin
BS. You promised me a door. I want to see this door you talked about. I’m guessing accurately identifying structures isn’t a Trump support strong suit.
What do you plan to do while your here, President Donald Trump?  Will you visit monuments, golf courses or site see?
can we vote for  the bagpipe darkvader, on a unicycle guy for president next time? I trust him way more then trump! Hey we wont know unless we try!
I would bet if Yoe came to Tx there wouldn't be ppl stand along the road side like we do for President Trump. Maybe a hand full. Bring him let him have fund raiser. No way  fck Yoe 🖕🤣🤣🤣🤣🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Yep. It would be helpful to see breakdown by politics and other categories. One thought I had was that there may be some skepticism regarding virus safety because of the rush to develop and distrust of trump on the left.
It's important for you to be clear when speaking  so that your point is understood. What you really meant to say is Racist xenophobic fascist white supremacist Americans for Trump.
So Trump listens this wanna be doctor. And not Dr Fauci. 😜
Russia just approved a COVID-19 vaccine, though it isn't completely through testing yet. What do you bet that Trump buys shitloads of the stuff? #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteForOurLives
Its not that they actually believe it works, its that Reps want people to believe that Dems are aware of a “cure” but deliberately won’t release it because they want everything shut down for the remainder of the election so Trump loses. The drug itself is irrelevant
Actually, you can see the racism in Biden’s comment.  One must make a prejudicial assumption to see Trump’s comment as racist.
No! NO! Stephen, just NO! My wife lives and works in Midland most of the year and is a die-hard, straight-party-ticket-voting African-American woman. If you want to banish Trump somewhere, send him to eastern Siberia. Put him on St. Helena in the south Atlantic. #VoteBlue2020
To me it seems that Trump is deliberately trying to destroy the nation because of his increasing unpopularity. The smaller his approval ratings, the more things harmful to the national welfare he supports or does. Does it seem this way to anyone else? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
why’s trump in midland-
I agree. However, for schools to open and stay open, we'll need to implement public health measures that the Trump administration has resisted.
And I’ll be wherever the fuck I want to be. You do t like it? GTFO social media. Trump jails children, loses their family and YOU support that.
Wow you are ignorant. I have done plenty of research. The detention centers were built by Obama...duh. But it was the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy in 2018 when separating immigrant parents from their children started. And was widely rejected by BOTH parties.
love seeing you going to Midland I really hope you can help get the oil industry back to work as a oilfield worker I am one of the many that has been layed off since March and need to get to work to feed my family thank you Mr.Trump your a wonderful president
Imagine Trump and Pence coming down with COVID-19 at the beginning of October. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You and Obama left Trump with a mess. He had the economy in great shape before 6 Covid. Fauci was working on Covid under your administration
Hey bot we don’t love Trump.
Air Force One spotted by Aim this morning after it’s landing at the Midland International Air and Space Port. President Trump will be visiting a rig in Midland to see how the energy industry has been impacted, in an effort to help strengthen the oil and gas production in the US.
It's literally a bot that copy and pastes his tweets and replaces letters
Don’t worry the numbers will start to look better now that Trump has made hospitals STOP 🛑 reporting to the CDC.  He signed a Executive order to make them send the numbers to the White House.  He’ll fix em like those too hard CDC school guidelines.
Trump putting an executive order to STOP ALL CENSORSHIP, thank you! #TRUMP2020
The #CowardInChief is sending troops into our cities but is too much of a coward to question Putin about bounties on American soldiers. There is no bigger traitor in American history than Donald Trump.  He should be dealt with as a traitor,removed from office and thrown in prison
Lest you think this is all bluster, it is actually Donald Trump and Bill Barr preparing the American people for their unmarked goon-squad SS troops to put down riots when Donald Trump refuses to leave office after losing the election...
Stark differences remain between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counter from Republicans for the next coronavirus aid package.
The rule of law in America is now an illusion.  Our legal institutions are meaningless as long as  is unwilling to enforce it’s judgments.
Agree, totally. At the moment, all white Americans are aware of racism like never before. We passively ignored it too long. That’s on us. It literally took the overtness of Trump and MAGAts to wake us. So it’s not just yesteryear’s  Republicans at fault.
The thing about Trump's latest dustup with #hydroxycholoroquine apparently involves #DemonDNA.   And #SpaceAliens.   Yes, Trump made a fool of himself. Yes, conservative media are defending him.   But don't underestimate Trump's #Propaganda skill.
President Trump issued a memorandum seeking to exclude people in the country illegally from being included during the process for redrawing congressional districts.
#StellaImmanuel? I guess #DemonDNA and #DemonSemen are where Republicans have decided to make their stand.  I've heard that #Witches and #Reptilians are involved.   There was once some doubt about whether #Republicans are nutso. All doubt is now removed.
Texas is not "Trump country". It's actually divided on its support for him. It just depends on where you're at.
Trump = draft dodger.   If in some other universe Trumpkins were patriots &amp; IF in that other universe, some nation paid ppl to kill those Trumpkins, in that universe would the parent of those trumpkins want to discuss their killing w the person who pd to kill them?
Trump’s twitter feed is possibly the most negative on twitter!
Donald Trump is a Trojan Horse for Russia. Pass it on.
President Trump also referred to the intelligence as "fake news," and added that "a lot of people are saying that it's a fake issue."
You mean the children locked in cages by Trump administration, many of which they have lost contact and information to who their parents are? Maybe be concerned with ACTUAL atrocities happening instead of your fake BS ones that have ZERO credibility.
On this question I have evolved. Currently it’s impossible. In the post-Nixon years before Trump, I think there were many well-meaning Republicans who didn’t realize they were racist.
If trump wins, they’ll blame independent voters instead of themselves
How about ‘Trump’s gestapo?’
If you would have told me just 5 things that happened with Trump as President I would have thought you were crazy as shit.
Good for you little buddy. I knew you could do it. 😂
I can't WAIT to vote for TRUMP🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Nah. Just turn off the water and power in the White House. Trump will leave.
This should be funny. But it isn't #StellaEmmanuel  #Trump #COVID19
A petition for rulemaking has asked the FCC to develop oversight of online social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
Trump and Republicans are running with the "law and order" campaign. Creating disorder and making it look like trump is fixing things then trying to say this is what we have to look forward too if biden wins. Republicans are unified in this message, democrats need to step it up.
Put it this way.. I've had tires slashed windows broke because I have Trump bumper sticker and window flag
Won't happen. Dems aren't interested in helping anyone. There's an actual treatment for covid-19, but nobody wants to hear about it. There's only one priority take Trump down what ever it take. Even if it means sacrificing Americans.
Calls Susan Collins a Trump stooge! Moe.
when these ignorant #latinos flaunt signs that say “latinos for trump” i think to myself, who tf said you speak for the latinos? fuck you.
The og tweet was deleted but referenced the idea that voting between Biden and Trump is like choosing between getting shot by a handgun or a shotgun... which pissed me off bc of the actual lives lost to the spike in hate crimes and hate speech under Trump...
On the mind of so many Americans are stimulus checks, unemployment and the return to school.
Doug Jones’s victory in 2017 truly was perhaps the happiest day of the Trump era for me. I admire this man and subscribe to a pragmatic progressive politic that leads with the heart in all policies like him.
What does Putin have to do with Trump. The ignorance of some people are the problem. If you want to vote for Biden and his Pedophilia groupies then may God have Mercy on your soul! Because I sure won't!!!!
He pushed back against angry, skeptical Democrats who said President Donald Trump’s administration is unconstitutionally suppressing dissent.
Don’t you dare then claim to be an ally during pride month and don’t you dare say that you support children at the border and that black lives matter while you indirectly perpetuate Trump’s fascism and white nationalism
I’ve been spat on and called a “dirty queer” &amp; a “f***” at a B&amp;N and subjected to absolute fear walking around my neighborhood since Trump took office. So you can say the election doesn’t matter with your white cis-hetero privilege but don’t you dare then claim to be progressive
SCRIBD:  Barr Report, Twitter is Making a Big Push to Silence Discussion of a COVID-19 Cure, American Doctors Address COVID-19 Misinformation, Stimulus Check Is Coming, UN Orders Trump to Withdraw From Portland, &amp; Bitcoin Price: Pumping
I think one of the most interesting things to come out of this phase in the Trump era is how the pandemic and Trump himself have sped up the liberalization of a state like Arizona. It’s a longtime Red state that’s been turning blue in similar ways as VA did.
It’s that thing Trump lacks in totality — empathy. You just hate seeing us suffer.
If there are 10,000 peaceful protesters and one individual who commits arson, that’s 10,001 arsonists, according to Trump and Barr. Reminds me of an angry little guy with a funny little mustache who blamed all the people of one religion for everything bad.

Evangelical Billy Graham said that Katrina was Louisiana’s punishment for being a sinful city. Is the coronavirus Americas punishment for electing Donald Trump and the Republicans?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
NEW POLL: Who do you think will win Texas this upcoming presidential election? COMMENT Joe Biden or Donald Trump
Bunch of nutbags.
Thanks for all your doing President Trump! It is very much appreciated! Don't give up!
Trump to extend current DACA protections, reject new applications after Supreme Court knockdown
Their baaaack!  Remember when the Tea Party was pretending they cared about the deficit. 😂 Trump is raising the deficit higher than Obama ever did and I haven’t seen them the streets.  They’ll be back when another black person gets in office.
Our current and lowest Trump economy is sitting at obamas highest. But sure bud, live in today’s world Obama is gone living it up and laughing to the bank while the rest of the world is burning under the blm guise
Totally anti-Trump!
“The jobs are just not going to come back” -Obama.                                                            The jobs came back under Trump, nothing needed to be said. Only action.
This is serious shit around the world, and Trump's son tweets bullshit about not having to wear face masks.
listen to this Trump song. 👍🇨🇱
Simp, crying on the internet, trump supporter, wishing another girl good luck with him next... she is down and the streets are not open for her smh
Trial balloon for the real nominee?  Will she be debating Trump before the election?
This bizarre reasoning proves how unfit Trump is. USA TODAY: White House sought money for FBI building in GOP stimulus: source
Trump would absolutely mock someone he didn't like who walked like that.
I bet they even have an article congratulating Trump for winning the 2020 Presidential election too.
LADY LEAVE YOUR FACE ALONE, JESUS,  OLD GRACEFUL,  YOUR VERY SCARY LOOKING SWEETIE THINK ABOUT THAT! AND PLEASE BE QUIET IT, DO NOT SPEAK BAD ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP THANKA
President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak from the White House at 5 pm Eastern on Tuesday. Officials have not said what his news conference will cover.
He has no respect for them and the position they hold , his arrogance has become Trump like. This hearing is for naught
All the people who said Trump would destroy America, their the ones destroying America, rioting out there and “peacefully” protesting. Ironic
Barr being hammered very badly. Unfortunately, nobody can do nothing to charge, indict, fire in any way. Like Trump. They are doing criminal acts. And laughing.
The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center made the allegation in a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end DACA, but affirmed his ability to do so.
In an open letter from Young posted to  he says he changed his mind following the decision to send federal forces to Portland.
Watch out trump on what you say, these are the people that are going to vote you out
Hell yeah, TRUMP 2020 BABY.
#Trump tried to vote in 2004. Didn't go well.
But on another note I wanna know why tiktok keeps recommending trump supporters on my for you page my thumb hurts from blocking these people like???????
The hearing today is a circus!!! The Democrats are making fooos of themselves. I hope they continue that way because it is clear they are helping President Trump to secure his second turn!!! TUMP 2020 !!!! #ThanksDems!!!!!
Trump hiding and laundering money 💵
My father in law, and he couldn’t wait to vote Trump out in November.
1.8 billion to build a fbi building across from Trump hotel in Washington. Funds out of the trillion stimulus Trump is proposing. This is improper spending on Trump. How is this fbi building helping pandemic? 🤔
Oh my goodness, the Russians are retweeting this garbage so that it can continue to promote trump's favorite drug (besides Adderall).
After #Trump and #TrumpJr's irresponsible tweets about #Hydroxychloroquine a massive bevy of trolls are tweeting on behalf of #Quack medicine to boost Trump.   Quick reminder why bots are bad and how to spot them   #Bots
The president's eldest son will have limited access to Twitter for 12 hours.
Most covid deaths were from when the democrats moved patients into nursing homes, killing off millions. Rep states didn’t call for that, only 5 dem states did, that’s crazy but none of y’all do the research and still this this mishandling of the covid situation is trump. Cmon ppl
Donald Trump Jr. has been temporarily suspended from certain functions on Twitter for violating the website's rules for spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
President Trump's biggest flex is making everyone believe he is stupid.
It’s difficult not to gloat. It will be impossible if Trump gets it.
do y’all remember when trump thought he could force the states to open and a reporter used a question to say “who told you that you have that authority??” LMAOOOOOOOO
Trump keeps pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, is an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
His family appears to be cause they're following Trump and retweet some of his stuff as support...and it makes sense cause him and Josh deliberately make an attempt to keep politics to themselves.Maybe not but I wouldn't be surprised if he is Republican considering he's Christian
A Bernie Sanders campaign cochair says choosing between Trump and Biden is like having 'a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you've got to do is eat half of it'    With friends like this who needs enemies. Fire her NOW!!
Barr will not testify!  Want to bet?  Trump is a crook and so is Barr??
Great Reporting, most of us knew the down play was just to Spite Trump and for $$$
They do it because they follow orders from the DNC and to spite Trump
Libs are saying Trump will not pay respects to John Lewis. Is this true? If so, It’s a bad move
LMAO!! Trump is a LOSER!
You are a LOSER!!  LMAO  Yankees surprised by Trump announcing plans to throw first pitch without invite: NYT
Wish people would understand that Donald Trump is really for the people, he’s fighting against globalists, not the people. He’s been VERY consistent with his views from years back from past interviews where the news loved him and now they trash him. Smh.
I think “sleepy” Joe would loose the respect of his voters if he called Trump “Lier” Trump or Trump “Cheetos”. He’s way above that.
I just want to help others who can't help themselves but I guess Jordan Peterson and Donald Trump already took care of that
I live in Texas aka MAGA central...   First thing I’m doing is driving through the whole fucking city blasting FUCK DONALD TRUMP wearing my BLM shirt
It’s bigger than Trump. France pulled from the shelves with no reason in January.
Please know that we love and support and cherish you. Most of us believe God sent you to take on this evil for us. They are targeting you and trying to defeat you. Don't buy one bit of it! It's all bullshit. TRUMP FOREVER!
70s, 80s, and 90s. Awesome yrs. But while we were living our life. Gov. really started taking advantage. And now look at the mess we got. Damn it we had 1 to many joints and to many six packs. Fun days INDEED. Now we got to fix this shit. President Trump only hope
How appropriate, trump plays a round of golf with a sexual deviant  (Brett Favre) just like him. I guess they spend the round comparing notes.
Oh, disagreeing with someone is fascist now? Who told you that, Trump?
I will vote Trump #Trump2020
looks a lot like a Trump rally
Yes! She speaks truth to power! The Fed is propping up the stock market to the tune of trillions! Trump is a loser!
Pedodent Trump is so empathic ...... or so....so.... empathetic ... ..  Towards other peop...paedos....  pedos...
IF Trump hasn't been a leader, &amp; has lied 20K times, &amp; has denounced masks, which even Mr Mayor now endorses, what else could Trump be lying about? Wrong about? TX! CCTX! T.H.I.N.K.!
It would look bad for Trump's kkk supporters. 😜 Trump says he will not pay respects to civil-rights icon John lewis - Business Insider
Pedodent Trump, can you speak to the issue of scalp reduction as a cause of domestic violence?
Trump refused to pay respect because John Lewis supported BLM. Joe Biden visits Capitol Rotunda to pay respects to civil rights icon John Lewis
Americans know Trump's a racist. Typical not showing respect. President Trump says he will not visit John Lewis' casket in US Capitol  via
Wow cover it up Mayor so Trump can't come in
This is obviously a real real ignorant repressive. A Democrat would rather support Trump than Biden. Must be a Sanders supporter contaminating campaign.
Welp, have fun with another trump term
The Dem politicians, their propaganda media wing, complete with Democrat Doctors, all have 1 goal. Tank the economy, because historically any President with a bad economy doesnt get re elected. Fauci  is a HUGE Hillary supporter. Hillary hates Trump. They all wanted her to win.👇
Getting all the facts out = "a hit piece" huh?  Sounds more like you're trying to distance yourself from Trump to keep that sweet resistance cash coming in
Just come out for trump already  so 2/3 of Americans will not buy your products.
I'm sure this will be a balanced conversation and not at all an echo chamber.  I'd put the over/under on 100 on how many times "Trump" is said.
A vote for blue means you don't know any better. Trump and Biden are womanizers! Old, white and creepy. Is this the best Dems have to offer? Can't beat reds so Join them?
He will do this at the cost inappropriately sniffing and touching women. Don't get me wrong, Trump is the same way! We deserve better!
“Equal opportunity” outrage is usually a cover story for hate in general and racism or misogyny or both, in particular. Ten bucks says this person doesn’t really reject Trump or Trumpism.
WOW NOW THAT'S TRULY SCARY, IF THAT WOUL OF BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE PICTURE , ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE NOT COOL
Lol ! This is pretty good pre-2016 reasoning. But the truth is that whomever Trump endorses will have &gt;half the base locked down.  The GOP will belong to the Trump-esque faction for a generation to come. They have found a voice. Sad very sad. But true.
For tRump to “pay his respects” to John Lewis would be disrespectful.
Exactly. They do it for tRump all the time. Did it with BritishOpenGate.
Melania Trump is renovating the Rose Garden, seems pointless because she isn’t going to be around the White House next spring to tend to the garden, can someone please tell this poor lady to cancel those plans
What has trump said about falling wall? Cat got his tongue?
Nothing can open safely until we adopt basic #PublicHealth measures. It is increasingly obvious that this won't happen w/ Trump in the White House - and may never happen in the red states. #Baseball is NOT back.
Ted, I hate to tell you, but countries that shut down are now enjoying a revived economy and lower Covid-19 rates than we are.  If your buddy trump had taken the initiative and shut down everything in the beginning, we would also be getting back to business!  This is all on you!
Would also be interesting to know why she blames Trump for not funding schools when others have asserted he has no legal authority to do so.  Hell, he doesn't even control the budget.
... was not allowed to be mentioned in any court proceeding despite the fact that those facts had been widely reported by then. So she gave up and took a 5-year plea deal. This is why Flynn, Stone AND TRUMP belong where she is and she should be both free and celebrated.
Democrats: Trump doesn't have the authority to tell schools what to do.  Also Democrats: Why hasn't Trump told schools what to do?
Another Trump grifter spending taxpayer money.
Ok and why have you failed to stand up for us  by speaking out against his racism, lies and so on? There are 140k + lives LOST to this pandemic and you are one of Donold Trump’s enablers. Shame on you.
This is Trump’s America #DicatorTrump
The first lady says the renovation will make the garden more accessible to people with disabilities, and make improvements for audiovisual and broadcasting needs.
Stanley Kurtz on Trump's latest 'tremendous accomplishment' and why media largely overlooked it  #FoxNews
Robert O'Brien is the highest-ranking member of the Trump administration to contract the coronavirus.
President Trump said he planned to reschedule the event for later in the season.
Trump supporters haven’t been laid off cause they don’t need work!  Only stupid poor people were dumb enough to be born into a family without a lot of property and a good portfolio!
It's unclear how O'Brien was infected or how much contact he had with President Trump recently, but O'Brien recently returned from a trip to Europe.
Micha Cohen and his niece Mary have definitely honestly disclosed. Trump's a bonified racist. Among so many more criminal acts. To many crimes don't have room on Twitter to elaborate.
More Americans now say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in his presidency. That's according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC.
What’s that sound?  Gitmo is calling your name.  I’d be scared of Trump too, if I were in your shoes.
OMG THIS MADE ME LAUGH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 RETWEET  TRUMP 2020✌

Welcome to trump’s USA.
My son's class decided to do a social experiment.  He is wearing an I SUPPORT TRUMP T-shirt for 2 weeks. So far he has been yelled, at spit at, and had a glass thrown at him. I wonder what will happen when he leaves the house?
Protesters tried a utopian society in Seattle while being left alone and two people got murdered.  This isn't all on Trump, who you helped to get elected.

The Republican National Committee and the president's reelection campaign were offering commemorative coins engraved with the 40th and 45th presidents.
Same here! Red Aransas County is trump country, still. But we have our Biden sign and bumper stickers anyway! Resist, sister!
How much koolaide did you drink? You and Trump kissing cousins

Did Hurricane Hanna damage portion of Trump's border wall? What we know about viral video
Trump's fascist forces
Just three days ago, Trump revealed during a White House briefing that he'd throw the first pitch at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 15.
Truthfully, I think the reason Trump won’t throw out the first pitch at Yankees stadium is...............HE THROWS LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL.
Trump 2020
Federal assistance to the state of Texas in connection with Hurricane Hanna - President Trump signed our emergency declaration and opened  up important federal resources to help recovery and response efforts for Texas.
Hurricane “Hanna” hitting Texas has blown over part of Donald Trump’s Wall on border with Mexico. Video reported from the Rio Grande Valley in an area between Texas and Tamaulipas.
And yet you are still allowing Russia to put bounties on our military!! I'm sure you're enjoying your Trump Gestapo army. Enjoy it because come November America is going to say to you at the voting booth!! "You're Fired!!!!!"

The guy who had massive evidence Trump Colluded w Russia 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I personally think the silent majority’s support of Trump is real, it carried him 2016 and will carry him again in 2020.  Also note, I am equally skilled in politics as I am in #EFT, which is to say, not very skilled
The debates will be pure magic.  Trump, with substance or not, will steamroll Biden..but I truly cannot imagine there are a lot of undecided voters.  Trump faced a weak (but polarizing) candidate in 2016, now he is just facing a weak one...it will be interesting
Via  Trump’s Dementia is on Vivid Display in Sunday Twitter Tantrum :
He could ace the Trump test.
Once Trump is fired. The United States post office will be funded and reorganized to self substain itself in future 🔮. Trump is a loser. Going to jail.
Governor Greg Abbott today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and President Trump have granted a Federal Emergency Declaration request for Public Assistance Category B (Emergency Protective Measures).
The part where he talks about you buying, should have had the picture of Trump hoking Goya beans
Governor Abbott and President Trump grant Federal Emergency Declaration request for assistance.
I didn't say Biden was the correct choice but Trump isn't it either.
TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THEN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT
I thought Joe Biden was being billed as a "uniter"? How did Joe Biden spend his weekend?   He joined an event with coastal elites honoring Kathy Griffin, who was once photographed holding a bloodied, severed head of President Trump.  Classy, Joe!
And by the way, dont forget, President Trump does not collect his paycheck. He gives his quarterly salary to charity. That's $400,000 x 8years =$3.2 million he does not personally take as his salary. Hardest working President in 100 years,maybe ever.
I live in Texas &amp; trump HAS NOT done his job well. He reopened nation too soon. #TrumpVirus
You Did the best job not knowing how bad this virus is, plus being (CHINA MADE) not  naturally made! So, Mr President Trump you did your best, than any Democrats would have ever done, they would have ignored the warnings since they are controlled by satan.
I'd vote for Brian before trump.  #Biden2020

Daddy trump
Respectfully, I’d like to ask why you called me stupid when we support the same causes and support Trump fighting against these pedophile rings?
Dear Patriot, i agree, but it's not only the Chinese, it's our politicians, who are making obscene profits in China, using China, to get rid of Trump. The left is so power hungry, that they sacrifice American lives, not realizing that it helps China achieve world leadership.
Because Trump is president.
The poll also shows Trump's approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach.
Trump is selfishly abusing Reagan's legacy, and Reagan deserves every bit of it.
A strong, alpha male like our President Trump, happens only once in a lifetime. There is not one politician, who can measure up to this man.  Anyone else, would have thrown in the towel, long time ago, and gone home to enjoy their wealth. We the people, love Donald Trump !!!!!!!
Wow, news flash: Trump will take a stab at actually doing his job three and three-quarters years into it, “sources say.”
Not stupid enough or I guess I would be a trump supporter.
Mnuchin and the rest of the party of Trump (Formerly the "GOP") are worthless pieces of shit.
TRUMP 2020 ❤️🇺🇸
These are true Patriots standing alone side their citizens. Facing Trump's Gestapo army telling them they did their duty protecting their to protect the constitution against foreign and domestic enemies. And they are vets that are still upholding that oath against Trump's Gestapo
Every Republican in office right now will bash these brothers as being against America because they are carrying guns. But when white people do it that support Trump they are called law abiding citizens. No MFs these are law abiding citizens that have the right to bear arms too!
You know white dudes storm a capital in Michigan and Trump calls them fine people. Then people protest and he calls them animals. I'm sure he won't call these black men that have the right to bear arms fine people but very bad people that are a danger to America. No they're not!
Trump and kkk followers are terrorists Trump is calling protesters terrorists. That puts him in the company of the world's autocrats
He is unfolding his oath. He didn't swear an oath to a party. He swore an oath to the Constitution! Unlike Trump Gestapo soldiers! Those are traitors of the highest order.
These men and women would be slapping the shit out Trump. And Robert E Lee was not an American he was a Confederate General that took arms against his nation. Horrible disgusting painting that I wish I could burn. While you're at it. Add Putin, and Hitler to it.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  H/t
If it publicized enough before November, hopefully,  many Demoncrats would wake up &amp; NOT vote for him 🤔. And President Trump could hit him with it in the debates!
He loved people and President Trump does that.
If Trump gets re-elected he will immediately put a stop to all these riots the day after the election
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Thanks, the Corpus Christi area was spared the brunt of the storm, but our neighbors in deep South Texas we're not. There is devastation on top of a pandemic and trump is out golfing, or rage tweeting somewhere. I know  wouldn't do that ro us.
#WallAgainstTrump. Or Trump against a wall. Either works.
Trump bought cheap stocks again 👏 What a genious to use his power in such a profitable way for himself 😍 (next we will hear about lower licencing cost for drug companies and large government contracs and the stock prices go up again)
Unreal. The right-wing Putin-fellating lie that the dossier about Putin’s b*tch Trump was misleading. Page has the country’s best interests at heart.
The blue wave threatening to crush Trump's re-election chances is growing
THIS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR US THEN YOU AND THAT OBAMA,  HOW YHANK YOU FOR CALL HIM PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! CAUSE HE'S GONNA BE YOUR PRESIDENT ANOTHER 4 MORE YEARS, TAKE CARE JOEY
😜😜😜😜Trump praises DeSantis' despite record COVID-19 deaths in Florida, canceled GOP convention
That's what Kayne wants. He wants to help his communism traitor friend Trump by taking votes away from Biden. It's all a plan. He doesn't want to be president he wants to help Trump win again.
The rich support whoever they think will win. It's in their best interest. When the rich start funding Biden, it's over for Trump. #VoteBlue2020
Virginia just recently changed the name of one of its high schools from Robert E. Lee to John Lewis. Trump will be lucky to get a port-a-potty named for him. #VoteBlue2020
I have a Melania Trump joke, but you have to pay for it.
It’s a fun juxtaposition but let’s not forget that Trump’s failure on the wall is a good thing.
You know those tweets President Trump admitted he regretted send. Well I regret sending the one off the LPGA. I just realized it was a fcking rerun. So sorry. My bad 🤣🤣🤣🤣😱😱
Not only are Trump and other "Republicans" creating more and more to talk about; but also more and more earlier crap keeps being unearthed as time goes by.
Why do people hate Donald Trump?
not trying to be political or anything but I saw this article a few days ago... if it helps lol
Agree 100%, its because Satan never sleeps, that is why evil never quits. So that is why, the evil left, MSM and swamp attacks our best President ever Trump, 24/7 !!  I follow back.
These liberal women do not want to be treated differently than men. So this is hypocritical for them to be outraged over this when they use same language when speaking of President Trump.
Trump says he's "been waiting for Congress to take action" to reduce drug prices.  House Democrats passed a bill to lower drug prices more than 7 months ago. Trump threatened to veto it.

President Donald Trump on Thursday called for a bipartisan solution to high drug prices, tweeting out that he likes “Sen. Grassley’s drug pricing bill very much, and it’s great to see Speaker Pelosi’s bill today. Let’s get it done in a bipartisan way!”
Is it like saying Hillary was under investigation days before the election, but staying quiet about an investigation into trump?
Disclaimer: I do not actually believe that covid was made to wipe out Trump supporters, no is that the purpose of the disinformation campaign. I just believe Trump’s trying to keep up support by saying “everything’s fine!,” and his supporters believe him as if there is no virus.
Yea but it's better to be a self thinking smart guy President Trump voter. Then the idiots backing BLMs destroying and killing our country.
Don’t worry. If Trump doesn’t deplete it, Biden will. And whoever is behind either one of those, won’t be on our side either. Quit blaming the party you oppose and realize that both parties hate you.
This is why everyone should vote to get the crazies out so we can start over from a sane beginning point!  Disagreement is ok but we are out of control as a nation!  Heaven help us and get Putin and trump out of control of our country.
INSANE is the correct explanation and the trump supporters I know are not that crazy!  Off base but not completely INSANE.
I told you they are neither Democrats nor Republicans and a vote for trump is a vote against Americans
So sad to hear, but 9 a day in Corpus Christi is not uncommon. Our governor  was too eager to help his buddy trump's reelection bid by sacrificing the very people he swore to protect.
Kristy I have wasted votes before doing what you suggest but not this time!  That would be a victory for trump and this country must get back in the real world.  Trump is neither democrat nor Republican and I fear he is anti American!  Not a joke!  He is out of control!
Yeah. BEFORE the anthem. Not during. BEFORE! But you want to make a big deal out of it. Stop using the anthem, flag and troops as props. Quit using your master Trump’s tactics. Or is he using yours? It gets confusing.
You are the best Donald Trump. We love what you do! 🇺🇸
please Jean Pierre educate  on history of racist Presidents. Trump is not the first. Major foot in mouth.
I would say 99% of us Trump supporters don’t advertise. Good luck in November!
Trump's kid not in school. And private schools no kids. Yet these schools and trumps5kids6schools received millions from government stimulas aid.
I challenge all news agencies stop airing Trump's so called cov19 briefings. Without Dr. Fauci and talking propagandist campaigns. 🤪
Whoever the DNC decides to put in as Bidens running mate. That’s who will actually be running against Trump
The last thing this country needs is somebody in charge who has signs of dementia you may not like President Trump but you have to agree he’s done a lot of good for this country with trade deals eliminating terrorism being a very pro life president he is tireless. Love him.
WE BETTER WIN!!! OR ELSE WE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THOSE FAKE DEMOCRATS,  WHAT THEY DID TO YOU US AMERICA,  ALL THIS CRAZINESS,  WE'RE GOING TO DO IT TO THEM, IF I WOULD OF KNOWN I COULD OF DONE THIS TO OBAMA, NOBODY BETTER NOT  MESS WITH OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP OR ELSE👊
Yes. Cohen went home... other trump cronies. Call her congressman Filomon Vela 202 225 3121.
Trump using briefings for his kkk rally campaigns. Talks about fick cops instead Dr fauci missing. Fake briefings. Fox News breaks away from White House briefing that aired 'F--- Cops' graffiti   via
Consumers may not notice many immediate changes from the new orders, which must be carried out by the federal bureaucracy and could face court challenges.
I know things about mr trump and the catholic church that yall dont.   What you think I'm stupid enough to tell random ass people that shit, F you I dont want my door kicked in
He’s ok still better than trump tho
You know the answer Kevin! They are all bought and paid for, just like everyone else in DC. President Trump and about 6 of you are all any of us believe or trust.
Sorry about these posts on Mr. Sandmann, but it’s just funny how the GOP claims to have the thickest skin in the world unlike the Democrats, but get butt hurt when I talk critical of Trump or anyone who supports him.
Prominent Trump.supporter murdered in broad daylight on Milwaukee street. 60 year old black man. 💔😱
Bernell Tremmell, 60, was shot in front of his business, Expression Publications, at 911 E. Wright. The building is covered in handmade signs, the most prominent of which read "Vote Donald Trump 2020," and "Re-Elect Trump 2020."Law enforcement sources tell "The Dan O'Donnell Show
retweet.." I just told my grandparents (who once lived under Mussolini) that ppl in the US think Trump is a fascist.  They laughed so hard, they cried."
Trump 2020!
All of Trump’s properties when they are in receivership. I figure that’ll set me back $500 or so.
I’d like to see a multi partisan system that allows for electoral fusion and ranked choice voting, but rn our choices are limited. This novermber truly is an election between Trump and Biden.  represents the coalition of forces united behind a more progressive vision.
What century does Trump think American women are living in?
You know #AmericasGreatestMistake was believing a two bid con by the name of donald j trump.
Please! Check Biden’s Senate record with drug companies! Check how many times he  sponsored bills that sent our pharmaceuticals to China! Educate yourself! Blame Trump for decades of high prices! How stupid are the leftist?!?
Trump all the way! Do the crime, do the time stupid! Oh, those lies have already been proven false, just like the “anonymous” federal agents. Sheeple.
And a pending national weather disaster here in South Texas. He's no leader. trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake
Fat dunce Trump punts.
If you dont like Rahul replying to Jeff about replying to Trump you should stop replying to him
I'll send my kid to school when trump sends his. #NotMyKid
Trump holds his kkk briefing for the third time without Dr. Fauci. 😜
Then you, Trump, need to send Barron and all your grandkids. Let us know in 2 weeks how that’s working.
Until Trump replaces the inspector general.
Thinks she has a shot at VP, if trump dumps pence.
Do we blame Trump for this as well?
Trump is not a leader ridiculous. Florida don't want his ass with kkk rallys. 😜
Hurricane Trump has you pulling out your own hair.  You have no idea how to handle him.  Thinking you could handle him was your first mistake.  #Russiagate + #PussyGate + #ImpeachmentGate + #CoronaGate = #DumbasscRATS 0, #Trump 4 EVA
Shannon Sharpe Just Sent a Stern Message to Donald Trump
Make no mistake, whenever any Republican or Trump family member prefaces anything with “make no mistake,” it’s a pack of lies fraught with mistakes.
Trump’s son is doing remote learning at home &amp; NOT GOING TO HIS PRIVATE SCHOOL, because of fear of the Coronavirus.  BUT THE REST OF U PEASANTS carry on. Full reopening plans for our kids.
Ahhhh, the new kinder, gentler potentate  Trump Tells Barstool President Dave Portnoy He Regrets His Tweets 'Too Often'
Yeah it’s easy to level off when Texas stops testing.  Trump pulled out the federal testing centers and now they stop reporting how many daily testing they’re doing.  Probably around 200 a day for the state. Lol.  That’ll make the numbers go down.
The republican party will lose Texas. For too many years they have enforced their biblical views into our laws and way of life. But Texas is becoming more diverse and accepting. When trump loses I hope and pray to my god that he takes the entire GOP with him good riddance
McConnell starting filling the court with unqualified GOP supporters months ago. Was that in preparation for the court cases that will erupt because of Trump's use of the DHS and his future claims of rigged elections? Has this been the plan all along? #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Yet everyone else commenting on here is blaming Trump, go figure.
Vote for Trump if you want a strong, working-class America. Vote for Biden if you want a pedophile as your President.
The distilled spirits industry should not be used as a bargaining chip in trade disputes over airline subsidies and steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Tell the Trump Administration &amp; USTR that we need #ToastsNotTariffs. Take action NOW!
Pretty sure the aclu is not supporting trump.
You said not to debate Obama so I didn’t know what period you were using. When Biden voted against the embassy in Jerusalem?  Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the ACLU, tweeted, “Wow  Already trying to out-Trump Trump.
who tf am I gonna vote for. sure as hell not voting for trump. and Biden is a no for sure. CAN WE HAVE A NORMAL ELECTION FOR ONCE
Yes it does, when in uniform. That's like saying you can go to your boss, yell at him, curse him out, and then say he can't fire you. Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences. The same would go had she been yelling pro Trump stuff instead. She will be punished.
I'm not a Trump supporter. I don't care if she was yelling pro Trump or anti Trump stuff, neither should be done in uniform. All of us that have and do serve, know this.
Change from trump back to the previous 8 years?  Was that great? Unemployment and gdp and wars and gridlock?  I’m not saying trump is great but I can’t buy the logic that Biden is change. He will not last 4 years so who is vp matters most.
So anything is better than trump?  My problem with that logic is decades of voting for the same party has given us Chicago and Portland and Seattle. How could Biden change what he helped build?
I would like to see that too, but with Trump you have to condemn his felonies one at a time because there are so many. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Trump's reality show program is due to be cancelled on November 3 with its final program on January 19, 2021. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteForOurLives
This is wrong.  Trump administration says massive Alaska gold mine won’t cause major environmental harm, reversing Obama  By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis
Maybe Trump’s buddy Alex Jones can throw out the next one
Romney is not a republican. As much as trump may not be a republican Biden is clearly not so your logic makes no sense. I can’t get the republican I want so I’m going to vote socialist?  Please explain that benefit.
Trump is a necrophile, a lover of death, your death, not his. I am not saying that he is an actual necrophile.  I am saying that he is a lover of death and therefore I call him a necrophile.
You know Trump can do so much better to control the citizens then you ever can
What is a doable plan to get ourselves and other people to vote? Donald Trump will win if there is low voter turnout.
My daughter is the teacher in Portland Oregon and my grandchild is an elementary student. No school. No trump.
Basic lesson: even Italy is doing much better than the USA in the coronavirus response.     Millions of Americans support Trump only b/c they believe stupid #ConspiracyTheories   #Covid_19
I am so tired of this argument, that if they didn’t get their candidate then we deserve Trump.  Bottom line that is what they are saying.  They had their chance to convince America and cannot accept their own failure.
As long as a Republican stands in lockstep with Trump he not only is aiding and abetting, he is a co-conspirator.
And his party now stands with and for Trump.
Trump virus...funny. More like communist China fauci virus.
The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels before deporting them to their home countries.
Denise..please explain what Trump has "messed up"? Go on..I'll wait.
Anybody else noticing that since Trump took Fauci off TV Fauci keeps making worse and worse predictions? Now Fauci says this virus is the perfect storm and may worsen and never go away. Wow!  He is now omnipotent,  Progressive Democrat Virus God. FFS.  Destroy this gov bureaucrat
I believe the ongoing riots and insurrection happening in Portland&amp;Seattle will spread on purpose as the Progressives work overtime to get Trump to install martial law, call out real troops, not Fed agents&amp;then will scream "abuse of power".Civil War is coming.
Glad to see Leo Terrell finally supporting President Trump.
So it’s ok to for this jerk congressman to disrespect her.  Please go back to how she really framed this story.  Since Trump, his followers have become really nasty.  They need to treat others with respect.
god really said: “fuck it 2020 the year to end the world and start over again since we have trump as president”
Trump isn’t rioting.  It’s nutty agitators and Portland Antifa.  Anarchists will ultimately fail.
So, you take money from George Soros and you call President Trump a fascist? Soros is dedicated to the destruction of the United States and has said so. You took money from him so you too are dedicated to the destruction of the USA. That’s treason! Beware!
Was it dangerous to the two dead black children's that didn't matter to the mayor in Seattle? The black father whose life matters won't be able to kisses boy good nightever again I remember the video of him crying on the air the mayor didn't call the father but Trump did
This declaration by Trump is potentially lethally dangerous to the mayor of Portland, Oregon. There is now credible legal justification for the mayor to do whatever it takes to protect himself.
I hope Trump said.... YOU'RE FIRED!
Piece of shit is toast. Time to don't pass go. And go to jail motherfucker.

We need everyone to step up like this but tout the line for Jo Jorgensen. The woman needs traction. Our country needs to show both political parties its not politics as usual. The next man or woman up in the Democratic party is the formula that caused Trump to get elected.

Herd immunity was india's answer in the beginning of the pandemic because they are such a poor nation. Trump's america made the same decision not because we're such a poor nation but because our country is ran by greedy rich people that funnel money through advertising. #Genocide

I was not happy the way Meghan addressed Mary. Meghan seems to misunderstand Mary story regarding Trump's state of mind, we all know he is crazy &amp; Meghan knows that very well.  She could have been more polite after all Mary was a guest of the view. Mary is a professional. 💔
Trump's guide compares to flu. Fauci compares 10 times worse than flu. Fox news guide... A idiot. 🤪 Trump called Fox News doctor his 'guide.' Hear what Keilar calls him
Here is the link:   And I don’t give a crap if he believes that marriage is between a man and a women. He has that right. He doesn’t have the right to block those that are part of the LGBTQ+ community from receiving equal right...as TRUMP has recently done!
Same could be said and shown about children at a Trump rally.  The best solution is to leave children out of it.
You could certainly say that!  I am not sure what you mean by damage but I agree the people making laws and leading have done a terrible job.  My advice would be to vote them all out.  I think if Trump was not there it would be much worse.
Congratulations Trump USA 🇺🇸 is number one in highest most cases in the world. 👍USA TODAY: Thousands of deaths, millions of cases: Major COVID-19 milestones
stop protecting Trump.
Trump owns the White House and the Senate majority is GOP led by closet fascists. They were elected by their constituents and Trump with Putin's assistance.  Compromise is/should be the name of the game in US politics. Otherwise, we become a dictatorship just as Trump wants.
the hispanic trump supporters brain’s be like (ehem at my school) :
It’s funny to watch you claim “victim” status when you’ve said far worse about President Trump and conservatives....people/voters you don’t even know!!  You didn’t even know he’d said ANYTHING until your leftist buddies in the media reported it.  It is a sorry state of
So now Trump wants to keep beating up mother protesters and other BLM protesters until his ass gets throw out this November. Then he'll no longer have presidential immunity from many pending civil and criminal charges. His ass is getting chewed out completely
I'm a male and therefore not in the picture here.  But if I called my true love a "housewife," I'd need to buy a sleeper sofa. And a bunch of flowers. And I'd need to clean the garage. Luckily, I'm not that stupid.  I don't suppose Trump has ever cleaned a garage? Probably not.
Trump’s America
Trump’s America!!
I took a look at this article. It's an op-ed article and stinks of bullshit and the GOP. I cannot imagine Obama and Biden cooked up anything like the madness described here. It does sound like something Trump and the current GOP would do, but for the benefit of the 1%. #VoteBlue
Many times when I hear the media revealing another of Trump's crimes or indiscretions or failings, I think of something Michelle Obama is said to have stated: "The presidency doesn't change you. It reveals who you are." #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I'm over in Lago Vista, by Botanical Gardens.  Trump lovers here also, but not visible.  Several Biden supporter friends in our hood.  Come on over!!
Because I said “dump trump?”
It's easier to believe you're lying than  would try to inhibit anyone's freedom of speech. Right now, anyone supporting Trump/the GOP has serious credibility issues. The White House has become a fountain of bald-face lies. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlue2020
I wonder if Trump asked Putin about sanctuary, extradition, defection. You know, things that might be coming up in Trump's future.
Trump's unconstitional demands making his puppet attorney General William Barr look corrupt because he is. And of course his illioustrious leader... So called president. 😁
Good one  But I can see right through guys like you. Talk a big game and try to back it up but can’t. Then you try to latch your name on to tRump’s name to get your 15 minutes but then can’t get the job done. Nice try though.
You nitwits. This is #DonaldTrump's America. Trump is president right now. This event is happening right now. Are conservatives too stupid to look at a calendar?   Yes, it's scary, but it is #Trump's America. Grow up.
That's Trump's America now! Here is  America:

Trump has always been a whiner and a loser. Every venture mentioned im this video lost money or ended in bankruptcy. The Plaza, Trump Shuttle, Trump Taj Ma Hal.  He knows less about government than he does about business...not much

Trump's gonna sweat 😰 bullets when Cohen releases his best seller book 📙
Portland mayor got tear gased by Trump's motherfucking little green men
When was the last time Marie was in those “peaceful protests” in Portland and Chicago!  Her ignorant liberal, Democratic attacks against Republicans attacks on Trump are blatant. BS uneducated, biased opinions of liberal media reporters.
I’m sayin’! Exercise your 2nd Amendment right as the Founders intended and Trump and the NRA didn’t.
So you’re saying having several kids with several women is wrong?   Interesting. 🤔  Did you know Trump also has 5 kids with 3 different women?
Only...this is Trump’s America...right now...in 2020.
I posted a drastic message about trumps illegal insertion of goon squads into democratic controlled states!  It was too harsh but how should we stop trump as he becomes more absurdly hitler like? Will the military protect us?
Trump desperate for police votes. Over stating Defund. When BLM requesting police reforms. Now Trump escalating to a new war with BLM. Incompetent desperate president.
Hes doing his job obviously the ones in control of the cities can't. Are you blind you dont see whats going on you all just hate trump so much you turn your heads on the problem an just  focusing on Trump
Damn! Trump got PUNK’D! Badly!
I am baffled as to why Trump is so insistent on sending kids back to school. With 143,000+ dead, does he believe COVID-19 to be a hoax to unseat him? Is he in denial? Does he honestly think it will just go away with positive thinking? Madness. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020

How does anyone fall for whacko Q conspiracy theories and Trump's con jobs? Shouldn't you be on Parler?
GOP senators and President Trump are at odds over priorities, and Democrats say it’s not enough to stem the health crisis, reopen schools and extend aid to jobless.
Your statement re: Mr David, in Portland. Is a flat out lie. How far you have fallen for Trump.
Interesting point, but I think this sounds better: Trump doesn't belong in the U.S. Capitol. Anyone committing treason against this great experiment we call America in order to keep fascism alive doesn't deserve a place in a building that represents freedom and unity. #VoteBlue
Trump gets blame for everything these days
Wow... Trump avoids making prejudicial remarks.  Reporters are like the Pharisees of old.  Using ‘gotcha’ questions that make one look bad no matter how they answer.  Let the courts take care of Maxwell.  Be decent and quit playing political football.
President Trump said there would be a larger stimulus check for Americans 2nd time around. Keep to your promise, Trump. Good Day
Please note the rising desth rate!  Trump just doesn’t understand what is happening.
True.  Trump is doing nothing

Senate Republicans are expected to roll out their $1 trillion plan Thursday, but deep divisions remain over a payroll tax cut President Trump wants.
This is caused by GOP turning other way. Letting Trump and William barr not prosecuting civil rights violations. And no police reforms.
Bloody Sunday 1965. On right to vote ❎. Trump is wrong to denie equality because color of skin to stop police brutality. Police reform. BLM.
Two years ago 10.000 Texans Flu Deaths  No store closed  No school closed.  No citizen forced to wear a mask. No lockdown or 🏠 Arrest   2020 = 4.000 Dead from Covid  &amp; Texas Closed guess wasn't a year when President Trump was up for re-election..
Trump creating a Selma across USA 🇺🇸 all over again. With his little green men. Unfit dictator.

This display of fake remorse is a political stunt meant to appeal to African Americans.  Instead of proposing new ideas to reform police brutality, Trump says he wants more violence as he sends in federal troops to beat up African American protesters.
Now Americans know where Trump got the saying. Catering to White supremacy
Last flu season 2 years ago 10000 dead in Texas  Covid-19 so far only 4,000 dead  I guess I wasn't a election for Trump that you're 2 years ago when nothing was shut down and nobody had to wear a mask and kids still went to school.       :) fear-mongering =  terrorism
I'm sure President Trump only regret is not going into protect the two children who are murdered in Seattle black lives that a black father will never be able to kiss goodnight again .. Along with these black but dead lives from Chicago
the only thing I would gratify where Trump is not going into Seattle earlier and protect the lives of two black children whose lives used to matter but no longer do and these Chicago lives..  .. and these lives in Chicago that used to matter
Past three years under Trump's regime brought these protest to a head. Corrupt attorney General, Trump and enabling GOP turning away to abuse of racial injustice. BLM.
She knows..... She knows what he did to young girls 👭 Scaramucci claims Ghislaine Maxwell ‘has the goods’ on Trump and he hinted ‘please don’t talk’ when he wished her well
... not long after Trump comes in to protect the lives.. like the mayor should have done it earlier in Seattle  to protect lives of two black children,  their lives used to matter but no longer do because they're dead and their father can never kiss them goodnight ever again!
Who protected the lives of the two children in Seattle? Was it the mayor? If I were Trump I would regret not going in earlier with Federal Force and not retreat like you!
Seattle mayor is responsible for two black lives that used to matter Chicago mayor is responsible for many lives that used to matter   Trump steps in only when mayor's fail.
Unlike Democrat mayors Trump regrets not protecting the 2 black lives of children that used to matter that were murdered in Seattle... Vid of many lives that used to matter in Chicago
You have the right to" peaceably assemble".... Assemblies not so peaceful.. are unconstitutional  If Trump protected Seattle when the mayor would not two black children would be alive and their dad would still be able to love them. :( #mayorfail
Sadly Trump didn't get Federal forces to protect these lives that matter in Chicago earlier.
The mayor of Seattle did nothing as  Black lives needlessly died of murder..children.. black children.. Trump's action stepping in where the governor and Mayors won't will protect  black lives that  matter to mayor's in Seattle and Chicago
"mostly peaceful protesters"  You know nobody's buying that b******* anymore.. Trump just doing his job protect property life when the city state and government won't
What does Biden have to do with Trump calling these wars beautiful? My husband’s grandfather was killed in WWI and his father was bombed as a child living in England during WWII. Regardless of your friend’s political views, what Trump said is disgusting.

#USElection2020 for Indians back home, Trump is a better bet than liberal Biden. Democrats are filled with sermonizing liberals and this ain't good for India. Trump is extreme and takes bold decisions impacting world, dems are soft , vacillating and no good for Americans.
During his coronavirus news conference on Wednesday, Trump was asked whether he planned on sending his son and grandchildren back to school this fall.
It’s simple. Follow this Trump logic: Albuquerque is in New Mexico, which has “Mexico” in its name, and Trump hates Mexicans. Ergo ...
This Trump quote belongs in DNC messaging against him, not yours in support. Y’all are some serious pendejos.
trump is mum about Russians putting bounties on US troops.
Isn't this EXACTLY what's happening in cities across the US right now?  You know, in Trump's America?
I know you guys are damn liars there are too many Trump supporters for sleepy Joe to be ahead of anything the only thing he would be a head would be bedtime LOL

In Trump's America, 4 million people are infected with a virus that the entire WORLD is trying to combat, and over 145,000 people have DIED. All because of the Supreme Orange's INCOMPETENCE.
Of course.  I think the enforcement agenda is a pretext for intimidation.  Let’s let the evidence speak vs Trump propaganda.  Agree?
If anything  impeach trump over his poor handling of the WHOLE COUNTRIES corona virus outbreak 🙂 #TrumpVirus
Dear Patriot, these so called leaders are not negligent, but doing exactly what they are told by their leadership. They want to destroy our civilization, to build a communist state. That's why our kids are not schooled in history, geography, etc.., just to hate America, &amp; TrumpTrump only puts Trump first. No one else!
Trumps sends mixed messages about wearing a mask and social distancing.  Trump is to stupid to realize that wearing a mask and social distancing go hand and hand with opening the economy.
This is a bad take Kim. The deep state hates Trump more than they ever hated you
I want a paint gun. I want to go super Saiyan on all of the tRump signs but I don't want to ask my grandsons to borrow theirs. Bad Mimi.
And because Trump is both a moron &amp; an asshole...
The Trump Dump...
Marco, Trump and all the  are the only ones who apparently didn’t foresee the disaster this virus would cause. This is why all  who can be removed should be during this election. We need people who can see what’s coming and act accordingly. Marco’s safe, but drop the rest
Damn Right cause he is a Bad - A!!! Surgeon general to Trump: ‘You look bada-- in a face mask’
Oh NO...so sad  Trump mourns Herman Cain: ‘He was a very special man, an American Patriot, and great friend’
When I first saw this coming on my feed it had trump at 3%
Trump had 4 years to make America "great" and look at the mess he made. We can't afford 4 more years.
So stand up for Trump that has rolled back over 89 environmental regulations that would guarantee clean water and air for generation to come. Trumps gave a tax cut to the 1%.
Trumps lied about Mexico paying for his wall,  and no denuclearzation of North Korea, no draining the swamp, in fact Trump has added over 290 exlobbiest or CEO's. That's a lots Gators. Trump stole from his charity and paid restitution for a scam university. Trumps a loser.
Trump had 4 years to make us "great" And he has failed miserably. World leaders laugh at him because of his Indeceiseness, the economy is in the toilet, there is social unrest and rampant unemployment, 30% of American go to bed hungry and Trump chose to ignore a pandemic.

I think people are grossly underestimating just how badly this two-party system has ruined the checks and balances system. Trump can do anything he wants because he vicariously controls the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
Under trumps administration we have massive unemployment, our economy is in the toilet and a pandemic that trump chose to ignore by not realizing that wearing a mask and social distancing go hand in hand with safely opening the Country. And you want 4 more years of trumps shit?🤣
John Lewis a great and inspirational man was laid to rest today without Trump giving his respects because he held a grudge against him. What a petty little man you are.
when ppl have “no clue” why people hate trump it’s bc they don’t think homophobia, sexism, transphobia, racism, and abuse are that big of a deal apparently
Like Trump that has caused chaos, are country is headed for a depression, the economy is crippled, almost 30% of the population can't pay their rent and unemployment is rampant, we have Social unrest and a pandemic that Trump chose to ignore. Save America, vote Democrat.
Social Distancing, and wearing a mask will go hand in hand with the economy opening. Trump is setting a bad example and fighting a losing battle.
Trump has already killed 150K Americans. He would kill more just to try and justify pushing back the election. NO NO NO!  He will NOT get to push back the election so he can kill more of us with his dereliction of duty and criminal negligence with his response to #COVID19.
Me too. I can't believe Republicans made much about him wearing a tan suit and now put up with all the shit Trump dishes out!
Who out there can’t tell that the Democrats are using everything under the sun to force mail in ballots so they can cheat and steal the election?  Trump draws 1000’s to his rallies. Biden drew 19 total to his video 24 minutes in to it.
I ❤❤❤ Trump.....
He died for Trump’s sins
Trumps Law and Order campaign seems lame since unemployment is rampant, the economy is down the toilet, we have a pandemic that Trump chooses to ignore and all amid social unrest. Save America, vote Democrat.
Don’t believe it. The man is a story teller to suit his narrative. He’d say he was drinking cow piss if it made trump happy.
is 1000x better than Trump. I have not voted for a Dem for Pres since '92, and I will be voting for Biden in 2020.
Evil Trump shit...
It is amazing how Trump has destroyed so much of the GOP's political playbook. They have ruined so much and have become so hypocritical, their go-to slogans have become absurd. Family values, deficits, global might, and more have been washed away and are now laughable.
Poor Trump he really believes that.

Trump is afraid of the people of this country, guessing he knows even more than we do about all the evil shit he’s done.
They are making major arrest of domestic terrorist.   You will wake up one day and be very thankful. Your being played by the Global communist  party trying to take over our nation. If it wasn’t for Trump and the white hats we would of been sold out. That’s why they hate him.
No, Laura. There are idiots all over the place. For example, there's a horribly xenophobic woman on Fox "News" spewing racism and her love of Trump.
You are at X but want to get to Z. There's a bus to Z, but it starts &amp; stops and takes a few wrong turns along the way.   There's another bus, driven by Trump, that says it's going to Z but instead drives right off a cliff killing everyone on board.   Choose your ride carefully.
On Trump’s plans to remove US troops from Germany. Mark Hertling is a former Commanding General of US Army Europe.
And under Trump's administration we have a pandemic, social unrest, a crippled economy, rampant unemployment and we are no longer respected as a world leader. America can not afford 4 more years.
Isn't it obvious? Because aborted fetuses can be sold by George Soros on the black market so he can make money to send to all of us liberals so we don't have to work and can troll Trump all day. Duuuuhhh!
Trump broadcast the deal from his press conference - probably as cover for his insider friends...

Absolutely Trump Strong 💪
World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump or even worse. They just ignore him. We don't need a arrogant, perverted, self-centered president in the White House. Save America, vote Democrat.
Trump will pull 5-8% more votes than polls indicate because people will not admit they are going to vote for him and will.
Being in Texas, specifically New Braunfles, SO MANY PEOPLE support Trump and are going out to concertsand, having parties, tubing, and not wearing masks. It’s scary! I don’t want to leave my house because I know it isn’t safe.
Trump holds a grudge. No a safe characteristic for the leader of our country.
Is trump putting up all those fences and walls around (our) Whitehouse in anticipation of losing the election?
And 5-8% of those polled will never admit they are voting for Trump just like in 2016.
Trump inherited a strong economy that has been under a upswing since the great recession ended in 2010. Trump hasn't the qualifications to run a Democracy. Trump only cares about Trump.
Trump already did that.
I do that why I vote Democrat. I don't like the turmoil Trump has cause. Trump has filled the swamp with over 289 exlobbiest or CEO's. He has rolled back almost 90 environmental regulations that help the rich get richer and he lies about healthcare and drug prices. Just a few.
Wasn't. So that's why I hate seeing a AG drop charges on the presidents allies and fire his foes. I don't like Barr's unconstitutional campaign to reelect Trump.
Trump is president and the Country is his responsibility. His whinny tweets don't help the problem. Trump has taken his secrets all the way to the Supreme Court. Who does he owe and who owns him? And I still am crying.
Barr has turned the Justice Department into a law firm with one client: Donald Trump. The AG is suppose to work for Americans not just the Republican friends of the president.
Barr's illegal armed invasion of Portland, Seattle and other cities. Barr's clearing of Lafayette Square of peaceful protesters so trump could have a photo op. Some participants have apologized. Barr drops criminal charges against Trump allies and fires his foes. Just a few.
Why can’t he wear a jacket? It’s the dress code, yes?  BTW, starting out with the debunked “spying” bullshit was really not a good strategy. Showing clips of Trump’s failure to lead was also a bad strategy. Jesus.
Barr has turned the Justice Department into a law firm with one client: Donald Trump. He discharges people on presidential orders, has taken trumps financials and Mueller report to the supreme Court to supress them from the public, what are they hiding?
Like Trump, I'm sure he will lie.
The problem the Democrats have with AG William Barr is he takes his orders from trump and not the American people.
Trump is full B.S.he has had almost 4 years to do something about the cost of drugs and he is just now do something about it. Just a reelection ploy, like his beautiful healthcare.

Wrong! The protests are mostly peaceful, John. Unfortunately, bad actors on both sides are turning the peaceful protests into something destructive under the cover of night.   Trump's "Gestapo goon squads" are partly to blame for the uptick in violence. There are many videos.
Trump &amp; Barr’s version of America is scary, wrong, illegal, evil - it must be stopped!

Donald Trump President for life. Then Donald Trump Jr.
I feel like I’m fully redeemed in my long-held view that Trump is a little weird.
The GOP does want RBG's seat badly, they can taste it. This is why we have to vote. 2016 was low-voter, let's turn that around. There will be no squeaking in, Trump must be thrown out by over-whelming public mandate.

Campaigning at a funeral! Well that spells nothing more than disregard for John Lewis. Unbelievable how the democrats leave no opportunity to voice their hate towards President Trump. Shameful!
Bummer! What happened dude? I was always ready to support you. Don’t give up on change. Let’s get rid of Trump together and make the Dem party stronger in doing what’s right for humanity. Go spend some time with your sons. That’s all that matters anyway.

Trump has only one thing left. To stoke racial fear. Fear is what led to the Confederacy, the Klan, Jim Crow &amp; Nazism  But it was hope, unity and human decency that defeated those fears which are now remembered in history as cowardice &amp; evil  Trumpfedercy is next #SaveAmerica
Think of it though. What any of us really want him to have been there? This was about John Lewis. This was about his fight for the right to vote for everyone. This was about him. Trump would it made it about Trump and it would’ve been a disservice.

Bonus points if the scientists who performed this work were atheistic socialists, so we could rest assured knowing they are not sell outs to Trump making ship up like the CDC is (when it disagrees with us).
Yeah, if Trump delivered Heman Cain’s eulogy (fat chance) and touted the virtues of 9-9-9, I doubt it would even make the front page.
Well troll patrol, besides stalking Trump supporters, spreading demo propaganda what have you LITERALLY done for black lives? Did you get the lowest unemployment #'s EVER for black, Asian, Latino, women's lives the list goes on?  What did you do to help?
Today Trump offered to temp extend unemployment until a deal can be reached, Dems in the House killed it. DEMS killed unemployment, where is that in the media?
Okay.  Can they name something Trump has accomplished — besides inheriting millions — in the past 50 years?
You are a dope
Time for Trump to set another record.   Nixon should have been jailed; that was gross negligence.  We can't make that mistake again or the GOP will never learn.
I can’t stand Latinos that support trump. Like bitch he’ll send your ass back too. Even if you’re from here
Here’s a deal. As per trump phd, md, dds, os, ocd, da, pa, rn there’s no danger in reopening schools. Leadership by example. Send his kid to a public school for a month to show just how safe it is. If not safe for his own son, it’s not safe for anyone’s child.
With Trump it is always about him.
John Lewis didn't go to George Bush inauguration but he was there.  Descent people find a way to have humility,  Trump has a mental issue.  He doesn't even relate to his wife and child.
Trump’s inability to grasp or refusal to accept proven scienfitic concepts is killing Americans.  No more conspiracy theories.  No more dead Americans. We need science not propaganda.  #TrumpHatesScience

Hypocrite.   You looked at a shift in 2012. Talked about it on TV. But Trump asks the question and you panic.   Pathetic.

Trump will remain a factor, but minority parties have a way of many voices being relevant.  And Trump isn’t on the 2022 ballot either.
I’m not surprised that MSM are having a moment Today! It’s what they do! Trump can play them like a Fiddle! We won’t be having  Mail-In Votes Dimwads!

Or making fun of the man’s death.  His death is sad, like most deaths, bug made worse by his decision to believe and follow Trump’s lead, by attending a gathering that didn’t need to happen, refusing to wear a mask and not practicing social distancing....
Can’t say I’ve ever seen the trump criticism that you speak of and I live in Texas.
I can’t say I blame him... I would totally take the Trump approach of ignoring it hoping it will go away

Some of y'all are soooo critical of Biden if you want to vote for Trump just say that
These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.
Reuters implies #HermanCain (RIP) died from not wearing a #mask yet offers NO evidence.   Reuters reports ONLY “Trump supporters” refuse to wear #masks.  So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Iceland AREN’T wearing masks because Europe❤️Trump?
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb

The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican “leaders” and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

All these conservatives asking "where?" probably really don't know.  If fox and trump and Q are your only news sources, there is a lot you won't know.
No the UN is right. Trump is hurting peaceful protesters. Thank you UN.
Thank you Duchess!  Native Texan all aboard!
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction god bless Trump 😂
Trump barely won in 2016 by 1 percent. This year he will loose by 6 percentage in Pennsylvania and lose the elections
Right!! You got two choices, Joe Biden or the Orange fuck Trump. We know what Biden is about and we dying seeing what Trump is about. I choose to live and have a brighter day. I’m voting for Biden.
Alright. I gotta do a beer run before  so Im done arguing with liberals and Trump cultists for the day!  Too-da-loo!  Furthermore I consider that Capitalism must be destroyed.
In ten years she’ll be telling us how much Trump did for immigrants.
Obama a real President  Trump a dictator and a laughing Stock 😂😂 that wants to delay the elections. 🤫🤫👎🏿
Literally they are actively trying to defund both even more right now
Ahh yes, another Republican that Never Trump GOPers will fellate dry for taking an action that is too little too late.   Want to do something? Introduce articles of impeachment for Trump and Barr.
Has our system of government exceeded its life expectancy too? Because your man Trump is working on trashing it, too, Fifth Generation American.
#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump often displays ignorance, but this tweet is actually a symptom of his brain decline, cognitive impairment, &amp; frank mental illness. He is out of touch with reality &amp; is incompetent.
May I also remind you what the democratic party was busy worrying about instead of COVID? Trying to find some reason to impeach Trump. None of them were concerned at all. Forgot about that part right?
Native Texan All Aboard!          R E D   W A V E   R I S I N G  &amp;  S W E L L I N G !  V O T E   A L L   R E D   I N   N O V - S A V E   A M E R I C A !
I have always believed that Trump would pass universal health care, real single-payer or socialized medicine, if you just let him put his name on it.  Let him officially call the system "Trumpcare" &amp; he'll sign that bill the minute it crosses his desk.
Why? Because tRump takes no responsibility in saving people’s lives?
If trump did honor him you'd complain about that.
Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally
Trump loyalist who tested positive for coronavirus is America’s ‘dumbest’ congressman, says Lincoln Project co-founder     Absolutely, his mask was a prop, not a real mask. You hate to wish someone harm, but maybe a few days
The democrats were to busy trying to Impeach Trump look where it got us. This is affecting the hole world no country as been spared. And many places that thought it was over it’s coming back.  Just look at France.
#BarakObamaIsARacist   I say we start rioting unti they unseal Hussein’s records!   America has had enough of this BS!! Obama/Biden  got us here, #Trump is our ONLY way out!   How did Obama come into politics as a poor coke head and leave a multi-millionaire?  #SilentNoMore
You backed the fascist. It’s sad, but doesn’t change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Oh I’m sorry, I know you would love to get back complaint about Trump the same stupid shit he’s been doing for the past 4 years over acknowledging DEMOCRATS VOTING TO ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GROOM CHILDREN.  Typical ignorant liberal.
Lancet Formally Retracts Fake Hydroxychloroquine Study Used By Media To Attack Trump
So if Trump wins with control of both chambers, Obama’s given his blessing to drop the filibuster rule.  Can hardly wait!!
Nancy Dumbass Pelosi said in February we have nothing to fear come out and enjoy your self while she was walking around China Town is SF. And when Trump stoped all flights from China the democrats said he was being xenophobic.
None of them are going to work. Remember the parable of the scorpion and the frog. Trump is the scorpion. It’s all over.
Trump was busy meeting with the Family of a murdered soldier at Fort Hood. I think that’s more important than that funeral is or was.
If shutdowns are required, there is no reason that a slight delay in voting isnt something that can be done, we already delayed other conventions. Donald Trump Suggests Delaying ‘Most Inaccurate and Fraudulent’ 2020 Election
If Trump is going to lose anyway, isn’t this a great year to put forth a third party conservative candidate to lay the groundwork for a victory in 2024? Who can we recruit?   Anybody is preferable to 95% of what the Republican Party is offering.
Important. Congress and SCOTUS must stand up to this kind of behavior.
Imagine complaining about people not caring about Trump doing the same fascist stuff he’s been doing for the past 4 years over Democrats voting for the military to GROOM CHILDREN.  I expect nothing less from meaningless liberals.
#Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump’s mental impairment &amp; cognitive decline make a national strategy on #COVID__19 impossible. Other nations have controlled the virus. We are dying out here. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
By the time Trump loses on Election Day, he will have murdered nearly a quarter of a million Americans (not including the American soldiers in Afghanistan whose Taliban murderers are paid Russia bounties).  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I hear moscowmitch has a bunch of money. But don’t bother with Trump. He’s apparently cash poor.🤣🤣🤣
07/30/20: President Trump Holds a News Conference  via
Today Trump the 🤡 said research for antibody treatments are being heavily prioritized. TerraCoV2 is a NIH vaccine licensed by OGEN based on antibody science.
Bro get your gratata lookin ass out of here. The man was literally agreeing with you and when he stated an opinion, which you said people are entitled to, u drag him. And yea not every trump supporter is an asshat but imma say most are and so are you. No need to be that toxic
I don't think it's breaking news that Donald Trump will have to use absentee balloting in November. He lives at the White House but his residence is in Florida. duh The media acts like absentee balloting and mail-in voting are the same thing. They're NOT.
Cofounder Of Conservative Federalist Society Calls For President Trump To Be Impeached
Premiered tonight on virtual  Town Hall Meeting.   PLEASE RETWEET!   WAKE-UP! TRUMP MUST NOT BE RE-ELECTED.
RASMUSSEN UPDATE - JULY 30, 2020  Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows 48% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance.  #TrumpPenceVictory2020 #VoteRepublicanAcrossAmerica
they're seriously sick in the head and also have Trump derangement syndrome. They're the reason why this country is fighting each other.
Masks do nothing.   This vaccine will be a non-starter.
Wonder if Trump knows what a hanging chad is.
(3) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump is so cognitively impaired &amp; mentally dull he does not understand (for example) how testing works, or how science works. This is why he sounds paranoid &amp; delusional re mail-in voting, hydroxy, etc. Dementia is taking him down.
(2) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump at fake briefing now drones his monotone script with (a) reduced freestyle BS; (b) fewer questions from press; &amp; (c) always calling on Sinclair/OAN minions.
(1) #Presidementia #TrumpDementiaSyndrome - Trump was dysfunctional at the Red Cross as well as at his BS/CS afternoon fake briefing. Noteworthy today is his delusional idea re delaying the election.
Folks, China is preparing to take over the World and you better hope that Trump is your President  when it happens!
Why Trump might quit
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
I like that celebrities turn a whole bunch of attention toward Trump and staying together to beat corona. Yet can some how squeeze time out of their day to still give themselves reward shows.
States still afraid of government (here, the CDC) even though Trump is a President. Shows how DEEP this goes!
The trump era
sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He’s no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump’s
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y’all goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?
McCarthy is a wanna be fart smelling dick just like trump
Well Trump needs to tell Russia to back off then.
They’ll blame President Trump.
Get this all you BLM supporters! When Bernell Trammell, a peaceful loving BLACK man was shot in cold blood in front of his BLACK owned business. BLM told his business partners who reached out to them for help that they won’t help them because he supported Trump! Hypocrites!
Is there a "flattering" book about Trump?   The president's ex-lawyer is allowed to publish a tell-all before the Nov. 3 election under an agreement filed on Thursday  via
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
Repugnantcans were more outraged about the made-up, pretend “war on Christmas “, than they have been about trump’s idea to move the election.
Maybe they delay the outcome calling all swing states into question, trump campaign sues, drags out Electoral voting into December, God knows
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn’t even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn’t have a clue but they deserve it. What’s that saying you reap what you sow.
lol.  no one believes your bullshit Rafael.  Energy costs to $65,000 lolol.  Your Donald Trump economy is in the toilet.  All the problems are happening on your watch.  Blaming future democrats for your problems is laughable.
Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
Watching  make Zuck feel uncomfortable never gets old. I wanna see her debate trump.
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes
Apparently, someone did not pass third grade grammar! Where did you learn how to write...tRump University?
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction😂👎🏿
Impeach and remove Trump again and Barr at once.
What Trump is doing to the United States Postal Service is criminal.
Cotton, hope you go to the next tRUMP rally and make the same decision Cain did!
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
Does not want to go down with the ship, but he was glad to sail along ... hypocrite, cya maneuver.  You cannot wash off the stench of Trump that easily.  Sorry.
'Donald Trump killed Herman Cain': Liberals waste absolutely zero time politicizing Herman Cain’s death  and blaming Trump
She missed DACA under Obama. Trump ruined her second chance.
President Trump made a stop in Texas on Wednesday, visiting the Double Eagle Oil Rig in Midland. Correspondent Clayton Neville had more information on Thursday's WBAP Morning News.
I don’t remember Will’s criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you’re right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that’s not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
30 JULY, 2020 When will #CNN, #AC360, #Donlemon, #BrianStelter, #ChrisCuomo, and #JeffZucker all be held accountable for all the lies and smears against President #RealDonaldTrump, Conservatives, Trump supporters, and the American public?
Trump’s housing tweets, explained
My issue with Will is that he is ex-IC. He co-signed on way too many tRump attacks on our IC people and sources around the world. He knows better than most of how dangerous tRump has been to our national security and he will forever wear the Scarlett T as far as I’m concerned.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction
Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn’t exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don’t buy that he’d have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump’s rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I’m not convinced Trump’s team can thwart it.
The same Chinese that trump begged their president for help in the upcoming election...those Chinese? JFC you are not bright at all...🙄😂😂😂
So your asking him to lose? He avoids Trump he wins by a landslide, he debates Trump and he loses and gets a ton of vids made of him like Jeb Bush did in 2016
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.
I seriously think Trump wants out of office, I really don't think he wanted to ever be President.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction 😂😂
"voting my conscience" by voting for someone that would do 90 percent of the things trump is doing but would be friendly about it.
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
IGNORE Donald. Some call him, “Treasonous Trump,” everyone else calls him “DIP-SHIT DONNIE.”He wants you to buy Prince Harry and M. Markel book.
Big tech lies about suppression of conservatives and efficacy of Hydroxychloriquine, crickets.... Roger Stone broke no law, but uttered a trivial error in memory and FBI raids his house at 6am in the morning.  This is why Trump will/must win
Look at Trump and his African American. Bet I know what he calls him behind his back.
Trump is a dictator not a president 👎🏿👎🏿
Nice spin, my boy. You should be in politics. Donny Trump 👀
Trump is a laughing Stock no thanks 👎🏿
I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump’s birth certificate to verify his birth info).
New B2T Show!  Why Lie? The Cabal's Last Stand. Trump Out or Die. B2T Show Jul 29, 2020 (IS)
They should seize colleges' endowments and assets to go into a public fund that would pay off students' toxic student loans.
Why is blocking President Trump and not the Ayatollah of Iran.  I think Twitter employees should all move to Iran to enjoy the freedom afforded the media in the Middle East!  Traitors!
Just wondering,  did this black life matter?
Help me real quick. You’re not fond of Barack, and Michelle appears to bother you because she allegedly does anything to remain relevant. I’ve seen tweets about trump where you appear to not care for him either. Where do you stand? I’m curious.
President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
Like Ford. Can't wait to find out what happened to all that missing Trump inauguration money. Gonna get juicy when he's out of office!
Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump’s term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You’re all talk with no action.  Why hasn’t anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn’t like trump when McCain was alive but since then you’re playing good guy to trump. It’s obvious
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.
Herman Cain, death lies directly at the feet of Donald J. Trump. Tulsa-No Mask. #COVID19
Trump is an evil POS. -jvo Trump Can't Postpone the Election - The Atlantic
Dems all hate each other, just hate of Repubs/Trump unites. Still can't wait till more muslims and LGBTQ realize they are in the same party... wtf
Trump hates American soldiers. #TrumpTraitor
Maybe we should start saying the top military brass HAS NO BALLS, not even brass.. maybe trump neutered them too. Then they too would be COWARDS, with wha tails they have left between their legs.
Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don’t matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
The ignorant love Trump.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that’s cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples’ lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn’t accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.
NO MASK. Trump does not care because anyone near him gets tested. Trump is safe while he let's 150,000 die. DUMP MALIGNANT TRUMP
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  😴
Actually Herman Cain got the Trump Tulsa Virus
Unfortunately, defiantly going unmasked to a Trump rally was his latest claim to fame, so becomes becomes the title of his obit. Sad reality.
Hey occupant of the House chair...  You want school delayed. You want economic recovery delayed. You want hydroxychloroquine delayed. You want everything delayed.  Maybe President Trump is tight, let’s add the election to your list of delays.  🤣
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ⅓ on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
Bullshit Stop getting off the subject. You posted about what Trump supposedly did. I corrected you now you wanna talk about Obama. Every word you typed is an opinion. Whats your point geniusYou are out of your mind.  I actually though this was a joke due to the fact that it is always opposite.  Did you see the video of Bidens Quid pro quo with the Ukranians?  (Trump was impeached by Libs claiming he did that...a lie, we heard the transcript)
I won't getting any vaccine under Trump administration auspices.
Don't know. But I believe Trump's  and George H. W. Bush's birthdates were very close to mine.
We may never figure it out. I also saw a Latinos for trump! WTH!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I save all these tweets it took me two years to reply to everyone who thought trump would loose last time butni got to everyone I saved I'll get back to you November 3rd laughing
Go Trump!!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I'm on Pennsylvania last election the steel workers backed Hillary this time there is no way they are solid behind trump. we have more steel workers in Pittsburgh than you have blacks in Michigan probly check day no one in Michigan will vote anyway
Hahaha what community? The I hate trump because Biden molest little girls?
And I said trump will have not did have he will have the highest black turn out in history next to Obama
Do you think they are against trump now?
During a meeting between Vanessa Guillen's family members and President Trump at the White House, the president told them that they have his support and that he will personally help with funeral expenses.
#WeWillVote Trump uses a 9-iron instead of a fiddle. I'm ready to vote NOW!
Bitches be saying shit like evict Trump and then use "Thousands of Americans are at risk of being evicted because of you!" As an argument against him.
If Trump wins, then it is fair and just. If he doesn't, it is fraudulent.
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs
Please don’t open our schools here in El Paso.  We are getting sick and dying.  Trump tell us kids won’t get sick and if they do, they will get better soon.  But he forget they going home, family is at home, they will get sick . You lisent to him less time, now people  are dying.
Now Trump is going to say he doesn’t know him. 🤷🏻‍♂️
When the other candidate is complete shit &amp; is hand picked by the establishment, it’s pretty easy. I’m not the biggest fan of trump I think he’s a flat out narcissist but people act like the sky was falling. Aside from the virus, nothing truly catastrophic has happened in 4 years
Hahahaha trump will have the highest number of black voters except for Obama. Without 90% the democrats can't win.
Can you believe there is group ten times more disgusting than the MAGAS? These are MORONS that just should not exist. I’m talking about Blacks for trump!😳😳😳 Did you bring your own rope or was one readily available to you?🤣🤣🤣
The DNC and Biden's staff are avoiding Biden having debates with President Trump. Events keep being cancelled with Covid excuses. You only need 2 nominees, a panel to ask questions, and a camera. All social distancing.
No he is not. Trump gas been saying that mail in voting can result in not having results until months after the election due to voter fraud
During a one-on-one Wednesday from the oil fields of West Texas, President Trump discussed jobs in the oil and gas industries, coronavirus, a vaccine, and stimulus checks.
I think you’re assuming I’m voting for trump, I could very easily just stay home. I wouldn’t say at all you’re stupid just cause you don’t think exactly like me, I’m not wired like that.
Trump will challenge the election results and challege it in the courts,  allowing him to remain in office.  He said as much today when he  said "if done right" the results will be held up in court for years. That is where Barr helps him mount the challenge.  Be Aware!!!
Trump must have a lot of inner peace.
Trump today stated that mail in ballots will cause "if it's done right" years of legal challenge.  He just gave away what he will do, with Barr's help, challenge the election results and delay the swearing in of a new president.  Watch Rachel's space.
Today, I held an important conversation with my colleagues from the Women’s Working Group on Immigration about Trump’s attacks on migrant children.  We remain committed in our fight for children who, despite the pandemic, are expelled, detained and separated from their families.
I'm not trying to defend Trump, if I had to bet, I'd say he definitely has done some creep stuff with women. What I dislike, is this mindset that I hate the orange man so much that I'm gonna ignore that the other guy definitely seems like a creep as well. A little objectivity.
Trump would have beat his ass.
President  said #VanessaGuillen's death was a “terrible story” and that he would help with funeral expenses.
Trump will not show up to Herman Cain’s funeral because he doesn’t give a rats ass about anyone!
There is a reason nobody asks Trump to speak at funerals. for one he has the vocabulary of a dim five year old and he will spend most of it saying how great he is
Today Trump said "if done right, it (the election) will be held up in court for years to come". Trump just told us what he will do, with Barr to help. BOLO!!!
Wonder what Trump thinks of the NBA right now 😂😂😂
STILL saying he wants to postpone the election. First off he’s only saying it because he’s gonna lose. Second, ya let’s do that... No election, January 21, 2021 his term still ends and we can throw a party for President Pelosi. And we still say bye to Trump!
US politics since 2017 has just been a series of Trump saying he was going to do something he can’t legally do, the Democrats saying it’s illegal, him doing it anyway, and 48 hours later the Democrats saying that presidents have always done it and to vote if you don’t like it.
Why is Trump trying to kill off his constituents?
War criminals🇺🇸🤡 put trump in there too, what’s going on? where his Bum-ass at?🧐
During a meeting between Vanessa Guillen's family members and President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday, the president told them that they have his support and that he will personally help with funeral expenses.
President  met Thursday with the family of #VanessaGuillen, who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed.
In a tweet denouncing universal mail-in voting, President Trump suggested that the Election Day be delayed. Why experts say that is impossible:
I would definitely take 8 more years of Bush over another 4 of Trump
President Trump is urging Americans who have survived COVID-19 to help battle the pandemic by donating plasma.
Trump’s narcissistic need to do his Schtick in Tulsa was thought to be where Mr Cain caught the virus.
tRump, yes I agree he is a waste.
trump punching the air watching the pels and jazz kneel
Literally Trump has been breaking laws while in office for 4 years and nothing has happened to him. You think a petty thing like delaying the election is beyond his scope? LOL
We'll do better without you trump....shouldn't you be packing......
Trump doesnt care about anything but Ivankas uterus.

What's the difference between a Covid party and a Trump rally?
Herman Cain died from exposure to Trump.  No doubt that he'd be alive today if he was enjoying retirement at home instead of shilling for Trump.
Trump doesn't rule NYS, that asshat Cuomo does, and he doesn't mandate masks for the racial riots, so why should anyone else wear a mask?
Trump and his ilk will burn the country down if they can't have things as they want #umbrellaguy
Trump Wins!!!!!!
Trump’s stupidity is followed by stupids only.
This is stupid.  APD found this weeks before the Feds showed up.  Classic Trump taking credit for others' work.
I just do not like how he is trying to portray himself as a victim for being a trump supporter when he was stabbed for being stupid. Even though they can be mutual they are not exclusive.
Wait.... wasn’t President Trump there? Why hasn’t he gotten sick? Just asking...
Trump wants to hurt Democratic states and cities. You should know that.
Too dangerous for an election sounds like an automatic 4 years for trump....
trump's insistence that increase in mail-in voting this November will result in massive fraud is unfounded. Contrary to the trump's insinuation, nonpartisan election experts say it would be very difficult for foreign countries to influence the election using mail-in voting, which
He's talking now....what a difference from Barack....to trump..
How in the hell can you go from listening to Barack....to try and figure out trump....
It’s just gonna be Trump. Nothing he does really affects his chances. Like he bragged before, he could shoot someone and lose no supporters.
This is gonna make trump so jealous. It's sad that he doesn't know this moment is to honor the memory of someone much greater than he.
and why exactly are you visiting #Nazi graves,   effing #Trump appointees.  Dump them all.
I don't believe Trump understands mail in and absentee voting. Some absentee votes are mailed in.
Omg #LadyG is standing up to Trump? Is it 2016? I’m confused
Definitely...Delaying the election is the most prudent, to avoid any fraud attempt and protect the population that is the most important...  President Trump  45 - 46...  Lo mas prudent...!!!
What do you call it when tRump wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well, but calls Mitt Romney human scum?  And btw, Herman Cain admits settlement was made over sexual harassment claims.  The dude was disgusting just like your Dotard President.  There is nothing good about that man.
Hi friends! This is  and she’s running for senate. An American hero, a Purple Heart and just a straight up badass. Its time we have a senator who make us proud to be Texans because Cruz and Cornyn are doing a crap job at representing us. Let’s vote trump AND Cornyn out🙌🏼
don't forget #Trump is disobeying decisions of the Supreme Court. #DACA And disobeying court orders to release the #KidsInCages
President  and his Democratic challenger,  both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
remember when trump said corona would be gone by Easter😩😭
Obama unloads on Trump at John Lewis funeral — without even mentioning his name -
5/...And it all came to a screeching halt that day, August 3, all the venom Trump has ignited came to my front door. and I've been in a fog since then...  But I'm tired of the anger inside me, I want a release 😞 so I will attend some of the healing events (social distancing)
4/ l think for me, I've been so full of anger for so long. Since Trump launched his campaign targeting Mexicans, my life has never been the same... I was used to normal day-to-day racism, BUT after June 2015 it went back to the level I only read about in history books.
Lol! That’s like asking trump to do or say something smart!😡😡😡

How does trump want to postpone voting but say it’s safe to open schools back up 🤨
Actually it’s a distraction from the economic news... and to take the focus off John Lewis... Trump can’t stand not being the center of conversation
Agreed it was because of the Trump virus... Q3 will also be a loser due to #IMPOTUS45 incompetence!
Wow! The extremes Trump supporters go to to conceal the truth from themselves. Delusion isn’t a good thing.
So basically if you had any hope of Trump 2020, he made sure you wouldn't. He's really throwing this whole thing away with two hands ain't he?

So we know for a fact that he got it at the Trump rally??  Can you prove it please?
Well we can hold them accountable for the predicted 25,000 deaths, using the model that other countries have experience, that we should be at right now.  But if we're pointing fingers, the remaining 125,000 deaths lay at the feet of Trump and federal leadership (or lack thereof).
Rupert is basically about $.    He knows that Trump is starting his own channel that will merge with OANN; Trump kids are very clear about that.  The Murdochs have to carve out a new lane on a highway that is already filled. It will be a challenge.
My coworker is literally a five year old trapped in a man’s body with a racist mind who supposedly hates trump yet agrees with a lot his views

Covid will be directly or indirectly responsible for killing more Americans than the US Civil War (600k+/4 years) if Trump is reelected.

I also know damn well that none of my communist mutuals are liking Trump tweets, so don’t put them in my feed with that lie.
Why do shitlibs trust the people who are currently beating the shit out of people protesting against their killing Black people to suddenly turn on Trump just because the law tells them to? The people charged with enforcing the law don’t give a shit about the law.

Extending Trump’s presidency isn’t a new idea. I recall Trump remarking that he should get an extension due to the impeachment hearing.  I don’t know if it’s the federal troops detaining protestors in unmarked vehicles or COVID fatigue.  This time it feels different.

She wasn’t read her rights, those “officers” are wearing t-shirts that anyone could make, the vehicle is unmarked. We don’t “arrest” serial killers this way. Jesus, Rafael. You really are a trump bootlicker supreme.
My take: Brennan was involved in having the dossier used in the election, but after, the CIA didn't want it used. The FBI (Comey/McCabe) was adamant to use it to hurt Trump as President.

What Trump has done since the day he started his campaign on that escalator in New York and talked about Mexicans as 'rapists,' is that he's emboldened white supremacists. Patrick Crusius deadly (23 dead) views were shaped and very parallel to our president.
So, I gave you an example of a time Trump’s ideologies put my people (and me) in lethal danger and that’s what you come up with? So you agree?
also it’s not “i think trump is putting people in danger” it’s “ i watched a trump supporter come into my city and kill 23 people, read his manifesto, and attended the funerals of those people- i know he’s put us in danger”
Poor baby Trump, what  lies you say  about on other goes aound ,  And will come back  3 times worst for you. Looks like you will getting alot more back  you.  Its all falling apart for you. #LiarsNeverWin #CrybabyTrump #BooWooLoser

Polls say Trump has scared 75% of his voters away from mail-in ballots.  But Dems are now big on them.  In NJ's primary, 7% of the mail-in ballots were rejected.  That is enough to flip an election.  Vote Early by Machine - you can't be rejected that way.
It is post like this that push people to vote for Trump. Instead of doing research, things are being posted without thought to play a certain narrative. Democrats are hanging themselves by ignoring context.

And, unfortunately, YOU are the one with unoriginal thoughts. And like Trump supporters, all you do is insult. Great debating skills. 😂
You missed the point. Never said you were a Trumpet. But you, like many Sanders’ supporters have the same mentality as Trump supporters. I do not vote by party. I vote for the person. Unfortunately we are again stuck with the lesser of two evils. But Sanders is worse than Biden.

What? Your post makes no sense. If you are trying to say Trump is to blame for COVID-19, you are correct. He is, however, responsible for not handling the pandemic correctly and making it worse.
just found out i work for trump supporters. fucking EWW one (1) like &amp; i’ll quit. 🙃
Would the #TrumpAdministration suppress the news of #HermanCain's death from #coronavirus so that Cain wouldn't make #Trump look bad?   Because there are rumors.
you and the President are doing a terrible job of taking the COVID 19 virus seriously and running the state and country. What did Trump have for dinner? Since your head is up his butt you should know 😂😂😂😂
There is no comparison Trump! Reagan was a great President and a great Gentleman, something you know NOTHING about!

No one really wanted Trump or thought he belonged there and he knew it.  It wasn’t his choice......  I’m surprised he respected that and didn’t crash the funeral.  You’re saying it was his “choice” just to make it seem like he really had one.

Yeah man I’m in no way pro-Biden. I’m anti-Trump. And if you just look at their platforms, I essentially just think Biden isn’t doing enough. But it’s easy to see the “One of these offers less harm to fewer people than the other” aspect, so it makes my vote easy.
Trump is the make matters worse, I so agree with you Madam Pelosi.
Trump is a coward, but president Biden is gonna tear it down.

We knew this was coming. We knew Trump would invalidate the results to stay in power. But what now in the midst of a global pandemic?
If you hate those who love Trump, why are you trolling President Trump's tweets?  I despise trolls.  I love my President and pray for him daily. So, go ahead and block me!
At what point is it fair to say that being a senator is not a lifetime position. It is evident in her mannerisms that she trembles and shakes. She may not have the stamina for the job, she certainly has demonstrated that she won’t stand up to Trump. It is time for someone new.
Donald Trump is the worst of both spectrums; he is a leftis populist and a rightist authoritarian, a danger to the republic.

trump represents: police brutality, racism, hate, bigotry, divisiveness, ignorance, selfishness, greed and much more... any show of decency, love, respect, unity, compassion, equality, intelligence.. etc is a giant fuck you to trump.
Fool. Trump did everything he could to slow the spread. He stopped all travel to/from China first, then Europe. As for preparedness for a disaster such as COVID-19, that’s a STATE issue. Lo and behold most liberal states didn’t have a clue. Cuomo murdered thousands of old folks.

Like I said before, Trump wants violence so he can come in as the savior of law and order. The agents don’t want the media to record the abuses because it would show them abusing their authority.
It's crap like this that make Trump question where the money goes and everybody gets angry at him for asking questions. Why can't he just leave everything the way it's always been.
El mentiroso and his goons are at it hardcore
Trump is acting exactly like an abusive spouse.
Trump is president Boris , what a stupid statement from a clearly impaired individual.
Trump is testing the ground with the federal agents. That’s how he operates. If things go his way, then he takes it as a good sign and moves on to do the same in other cities. He wants to create chaos and then come out as the savior of law and order to get re-elected. Just watch
The trump administration is a prime example of group think. Trump is so out of touch with Americans and the coronavirus crisis.

Maybe if you followed rules, everyone will be safe?. Trump wasn't joking, did you read the tweet? One of his better written tweets - he likely had help. It was definitely not a joke When Pompeo was questioned about it - he didn't say it was a joke - he said Barr would decide if the election would be delayed -  Ominous
After listening to Joy Reid w/ Mary Trump interview it appears Putin is like a father figure or replacement of Fred. Trump thinks highly of him. The man is mental! How many times has he talked to Putin? 16x's? Getting advice from our enemy! Great!🧐😷
To be fair tRump was pretty well set up to do what he has and is going to do. Our Congress just puts on a show and the Senate is worthless. All they care about is Power. It is past time for term limits in both houses and the Supreme Court.
Where has this guy been the last four years?? everything Trump has done while in office has been unconstitutional and without precedent.
The Nasty people are a larger group than we ever imagined. Life is hard now but it is going to get so much worse. People might vote for tRump just to stop their personal pain.
I'm so sorry that you felt fear. Fear sucks. I've been through Hurricanes but never an Earthquake. I would probably freak the F$ck out. I think tRump is freaking out the non-koolaid drinking population so much that they have nothing left for natural fear. Your fear is validated.
So Don Winslow did you send the same message to Pelosi and DeBlasio who downplayed the Wuhan when Trump ended flights to China and told people to party and go to movies and gather in large groups in Chinatown?Or are you just a hateful racist Progressive bigot who hates blacks?

Laura Ingraham sprints past Rachel Maddow to become most-watched female cable news host    She leads because she covers the news.  Maddow covers fake news then pretends its real.  I am still waiting for the Trump/Russian collusion apology.
We knew this would be Trump’s fault as soon as we heard bit take solice in the fact that Cain would not have blamed DT for using his free will and supporting POTUS.
This is a friend of Trump's - his life was a high price to pay for being a follower.

Trump seems to be able to bring out the Nasty in people and 38 percent of the people in the USA are showing us how Nasty they are. It's a small but annoying population. Their Hate Monger is on his way out. They are going to find that hate will not be tolerated. They are dying out
Wear a MASK!  SAVE Lives! Love your neighbor as thy SELF! Don't be selfish! Lets save lives and STOP this TRUMP Virus. Over 150K DEAD Americans is unacceptable!  It's negligent homicide now! Republicans are complicit with TRUMP.🧐😷
If Dick's can sprout. Matt is just a sprout of tRump
I can get a new dishwasher? I’ve died and went to heaven. Thank you President Trump!
He pleaded guilty - remember  No joke - real -  what's scary is to think about what it was Flynn was trying to accomplish --  Judges don't like to be misled or lied to Neither do Americans - pretty darn tired of the lies from this administration &amp; tRump's cronies over 4 years
Yes.  Everybody hates tRump.
🚨🚨🚨For Heaven's Sakes!🚨🚨🚨 Does anyone, including Trump, in the Trump Administration know our Constitution?  ANSWER:       NO  Incompetent Administration!
Good to see someone in the Trump administration is listening to me.  Cut all advertising to the MSM.  Defund the MSM.
Trump probably wants to go back to private life where he can avoid the press constantly criticizing him. To best be surrounded again by folk telling him he's "The Best. Ever."
I loathe tRump with the intensity of a thousand suns -  tRump has earned it --
uh, moms don't want their children to be in danger. sending the kids back to school now is a decision trump is making that puts them in danger. I choose Biden and common sense.
Matt has few goals, none of which aimed at addressing the needs of his district. He is focused on impressing trump and melania (who once, he says, called him handsome), and constructing a career in the right-wing media. he needs to go and get off MY dime.
No. He was a grown man that should have known better but he chose Party over Country. Trump is still a mass murderer.
With the blatant racism aside, all that bs this morning from RW Twitter saying he died from Cancer, enter Trump👇🏿
tRump Barr and Pompeo.  And man would I have fun.
Well, they are running wild now...But,  it took all of this to make him see who Trump is? Anyway, this is trouble within that party boiling over.
I remember the 60s and the civil rights demonstrations. they were dismissed as professional agitators, anarchists. soon proved not true. jeez, trump needs some new material.
dropped in on the trump blabber-fest. he's a disgraceful, lying troll
Governor, what do you think about Trump promoting Stella Immanuel. This woman claims on her website that horny, nocturnal demons steal our health. How can we possibly take Trump or any member of the Republican party seriously.
trump can't even name all his grandchildren.
Sticks with Corruption/Criminal TRUMP!  VOTE THIS REPUBLICAN out-of-office! 🧐😷            #StopCorruption #StopRepublicanCorruption
Because he hates women and owes Trump thousands of dollars (Via the donors who paid off his mortgage)

Now do trump
He was diagnosed being positive with COVID-19 within the window of CDC guidelines after attending Trump's rally. #Coincidence?
Bunch of ignorant fucks!  Herman Cain was successfully treated for stage 4 colon cancer in 06 and declared cancer free in 2007. He died from the COVID-19 virus directly related to his not wearing a mask at a Trump gathering!   End of story!
On the day of a most solemn #memorial service for #CivilRights pioneer and Congressman #JohnLewis, our #POTUS #Trump made an alarming, provocative, and distracting tweet about Trump potentially hindering a timely, free, and fair election. Trump’s normal must not become ours. #GOP
"Once McCabe became director, Bureau employees grew so concerned that Trump would try to shut down the investigation that they secreted at least three copies of key documents, including Comey's memos, in remote locations around the Bureau."
It has been a busy day but, I haven't forgotten about these bounties that Trump claims he never heard of..Still waiting on someone that is a lawmaker, to explain why he didn't get the memo? #BountyGateAintGoingAway
AGREED!  &amp; other  are trump’s court jesters!   #TrumpIsJoke
Do not use our taxpayer dollars for a new FBI building to help Trump’s hotel. It’s our money. Help the people.
Heyyyy, Why doesn't he just ask Dr Immanuel (I use the term Dr loosely). Maybe she can summon some of her horny nocturnal demons. The ones that cause cysts, etc. I heard Trump repeatedly praise her yesterday.
I’m not surprised Trump is tweeting about delaying the election.  I’m also not going to get mad about it.  He’s just trying to stoke fear and anger.  It’s what he he does best.  Nothing is going to delay his downfall.
I was a History minor in college.  A quasi Civil War buff and didn’t know this till Trump informed me
I use to watch news &amp; disliked #Trump w everyone else.Until March when I heard #POTUS himself speak, and heard the news reports take his words out of context.Cut &amp; pasted quotes delivered a  message that was very different from his. #FakeNewsMedia #listenanddecideforyourself
No sir.."Both" candidates aren't..Only one. Trump. Nice try to spin this but, since you can't "legally" defend Trump's position, you cast Biden into this..That is ridiculous
finally got to Lynch him a black man personally, we know the genocidal racist history of Tulsa and the shoe shinier Mr Cain sacrificed himself for the cult of trump, the house nigga will gladly die for Massa, REMEMBER HITLER HAD FOLLOWERS TOO
Don't go -  tRump is just doing this to interrupt Rep. John Lewis' Memorial.  Don't go.
Trump needs to go after their FCC licenses.  They are arms of the Democrat Party and not operating in the public interest.
Masks --  You seem angry - but your anger is misdirected - you should take a second look at trump's incompetency. Covid19 is an American tragedy made worse by failed leadership.   My deepest condolences to Mr. Cain's family and friends.
Ben Domenech not buying Google's denial of political bias in search results  #FoxNews   I just did a Biden search and the first three pages of searches were all MSM progressive articles supporting Biden and trashing Trump.
trump should be impeached, again.
What a stupid,  ignorant,  hate filled tweet. Trump didn't create covid though Obama funded it  I can't recall a single democrat blaming 12,500  H1N1 deaths on Obama though he was responsible for the deaths of 10 of 1000's of gays &amp; Christian in Iran by allowing the rise of  ISIS
Trump made wearing a mask political..Him and you all that follow him are a big cause for these deaths..Don't try me ma'am..
Must be Trump’s fault, too
Still not accepting the results of the last election I see. When are you going to learn that the media is nothing but propaganda? The majority of Americans have figured it out already.
Wow so former Republican candidate for president Herman Cain passed away from the virus after going to  rally in Oklahoma, the CULT OF TRUMP STRIKES AGAIN, BUT WE NO THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS KIND ANYWAY
Herman Cain refused, like  to wear a mask... how many non-masked Trump supporters will die from COVID19...a pandemic Trump called a Democratic hoax!
Trump’s request to delay the vote is a request for tyranny. Sic semper tyrranis.
will not acknowledge Rep. John Lewis but he will Herman Cain...  speaks volumes about Trump!
The answer is to speed up the election, because every day tRump is in office more people die!
7/30/2020        Herman Cain passes away today from COVID-19 contracted at the Trump Tulsa rally.
Must be Trump’s fault...

Here we go. 2016 election all over again. Democrats question if Trump will accept the results of an election all the while refused to accept the results of the last election. More people, now more than ever, can see how unhinged you are. 🤦‍♂️
I love how Trump's complains about the F.B.I and the Department of justice being crooked, that's what we've been saying for decades about those racist bigots, we've been complaining about the DEEP STATE, the DEEP STATE created this GENOCIDAL NATION

Well, Ingraham has gone full on Nutso - No one outside of tRump's cult will ever consider her anything but a kook.
TRump is a danger to American Democracy. He tweets to delay the election but wants to send children to school everyday. This tweet is about his poll numbers not Covid19.
Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Globalist plant or no, Joe Biden is not on Trump’s level and is not Presidential material.
Here's the shortcut to that old song Trump sings in the shower!  Don't let it get stuck in your head or you will think of Trumpublicans  all day!  Nightcore -They're Coming To Take Me Away Ha Ha  via
OMG....Trump is retweeting this kind of information from this QUACK on his OFFICIAL TWITTER account! Saying "I thought her voice was an important voice?" OMG!  This man needs the WHITE COATS coming 2 take him away! Hey Hey! Anyone remember song "Their Coming To Take Me Away?"
🚨🚨🚨Leader of the Free World?🚨🚨🚨         I think NOT!  Trump Retweets information, which is supposed to be OFFICIAL, from "Quack" Doctor who believes medicine is from "Alien DNA." I kid you not! S.O.S. to our Allies! HELP!
🚨🚨Walking Away from Trump🚨🚨 More People are walking away from Donald Trump everyday. Obviously, he is making it known he has no interest in the PEOPLE'S HEALTH, OUR COUNTRY or OUR SOLDIERS. Trump continuously commits TREASON w/his Cabinet &amp; Republican Congress. #VOTE GOP OUT!
says he "was impressed" with Dr. #StellaImmanuel's claim that she has cured hundreds of her patients of #SARSCoV2. I guess #Trump doesn't realize that she is a pediatrician. You may wish to think about this for a moment.
You talking about #JeffreyEpstein. "“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Mr. Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
Trump has my vote again!🇺🇸🙌
. salivates over Barr testimony, continues to push Russia hoax    Things must really be getting desperate to go full potato  against Barr and Trump at this point.  Biden must not have a 15 point lead in the polls, and they know it.

Faucci? Heck, I'm going with Anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits and any discredited doctor/pastor who swears Plaquinil is just great for curing Covid19! The rest of the world's scientists are ALL in a cabal to try to unseat Trump! Talk about a hoax!

Thank you President Trump!
Trump hasn't started a war. He did destroyed ISIS  Trump let me keep more of my money. I'm not in congress so I'm not a millionaire.   I want to own my health care. Not my employer,  not the govt.
Lean pickings on your table  but you know that!  Don’t want to truly help poor golf... your trump/cult supporters in Congress agrees with you!
We all feel the same except for ONE.  Donald Trump feels only for himself.
It's all about TRUMP and how to screw the next guy!
I agree with that..But, the majority spoke for Trump...
Oh, Ignatius, how we need you! You would despise trump and his ilk.
if you have the chance, read the book "Confederacy of Dunces." written WAY before trump, but so perfect for today.
I contributed to  to help Democrats fight Donald Trump's dangerous agenda and take back the Senate. Join me &gt;&gt;
But, Trump says it is fake
Trump is making up excuses for this ridiculous move..This move only benefits Putin..It will cost us billions more to do the move..We were there for strategic reasons and Putin didn't want us there in the beginning..That can only tell me one thing sir.
Don’t forget Erik Prince helped steer the election to trump in 2016.
Glad he said it..At this juncture, voting for Trump or any of his Congressional supporters, local supporters etc, is a vote for racism, bigotry and misogyny..That's the bottom line..
I just rushed a donation to help Nancy Pelosi hold the House and make sure Trump is always held accountable. Join me and chip in, too!
so, he should not have taken the test? that would have been trump's advice.
We have to vote every last one of the Trump supporters out..
am I the only one sick of having to deal with trump's lifetime of complaints?
This is what Hitler-scheiss trump is shooting for. F him
I guess he wanted to be cool for the girls, now he looks like a fool with his head stuck in a rectal cavity.  Make sure you have some spare toilet paper handy for that brown stuff on your eye brows.  Make sure you wash your hands when you are done.
Once again, our #POTUS #Trump enacts policy that pleases #Putin #Russia.  #Germany #NATO
I am reminded of this story, which seems like ancient history now, but was less than a year ago.  #JackGraham #PaulaWhiteCain #RobertJeffress
This did not happen because of Trump..It took decades to do this..While we were saying this, people held the thought that Republicans were saving the economy and black people were lying..
Back in 2015, black people were saying Trump was racist before his ass came down the escalator..Before 2015, we were telling folks that the Republican Party overall is tainted with racist..
Dangerously negligent behavior from a President - everything is a commodity for a deal TRump  holds on to everything like it is his own personal stash to use as a carrot  He's going to need a favor though  People are dying &amp; tRump is dispensing lifesaving medicine in dribbles
Omg that crazy doctor that Trump seems obsessed with.
In the U.S., Black-run urban farms fight food inequality    Don't worry BLM/AntiFa/DNC will burn and loot them when they find out where you are at so they will have another thing to blame on Trump.

It's just as well. Donald Trump is not good enough to shine the shoes of a man like John Lewis.
Nothing but another hard headed attempt to undo something good the previous administration put into place. Not a coincidence that this plays to the stereotypical Trump base.   doesn’t agree with this, and neither do I!

Hydroxychloroquine Study Finds the Drug 'Significantly' Cuts Death Rate | CBN News
Why do you think Trump is so happy that suburbanites can now keep low income families out?
We don't need any of it. We have Dr Stella Immanuel, she will summoN some HORNY, nocturnal demons who will provide all that we need. President Trump was just saying how impressed he was with her. .
Trump and McConnell, because Gaetz and Jordan will fade because they won’t be trying to kiss Trumps ass and Lindsey Graham has always been a “beta male” riding someone else coattails (McCain previously)
A friend shared a post on Facebook yesterday from this Doctor - claiming hydroxychloroquine is a therapy that should be taken by everyone - this friend would be at high risk for complications. I wanted to cry &amp; I was so angry with trump for spreading harmful myths!
Why do you think Trump is promoting a quack whose website claims that horny, nocturnal demons cause a myriad of health problems?
The war against hydroxychloroquine continues.  A life saving drug is deliberately shelved to spite Donald J. Trump.  How many have to die to promote hateful racist Progressive bigotry.
Well maybe Trump's quack can hook you up. She claims to be an expert on horny, nocturnal demons. Trump was praising her again this morning.
Fake News. You're still on the Trump Russian Collusion when the Mueller Investigation failed to find any evidence &amp; declassified docs show that Obama admin knew that Flynn was innocent but they framed him anyway. 🤡
A timely reminder that in 1973, #DonaldTrump and his father were sued by the #Nixon Justice Dept for #housing discrimination. #Trump fought for two years before finally accepting a settlement. 👇
Thousands have died because of the media's animosity of Trump because he mentioned HCQ early. They promoted a fraudulent study that was forced to be retracted. Class action lawsuits can very effective.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$ I'll bet you a dollar that they bet their last dollar on what tRump assured them was a sure thing.   They never learn -
Beware of nocturnal, horny, demons that will cause all sorts of health problems. Our Republican leaders have found an adviser who is an expert in the horny, nocturnal demons. President Trump praised her again this morning.
I did!! And thanks back at you
spends millions of dollars on Federal "Agents of domination" to quell $50K of damage to #FederalGovernment building. #Trump brags "Nobody knows more about money than me". I guess that math question wasn't on the #CognitiveTest .
Will Trump still be praising the doctor that  thinks cysts are caused by nocturnal, horny demons?
I’m never going to forgive her for voting to acquit Trump in the impeachment.
You inserted yourself in my reply about cowboys which had nothing to do with Trump or MAGA. STFU clown!

No the science does not.  What study can you point to?  The one where is was given to older dieing patients?    The one where it was administered w/o zinc?  It's the cure. Trump hate does not equal science.

I was only half kidding.  IDK what the GOP will look like in 4 years.  Maybe the Trumpism is exorcised after he gets his ass thoroughly trounced in Nov or maybe he and his family remain defacto Godfathers able to anoint a successor (or for that matter Trump runs again in 2024)

Here is a #Trump campaign leader making an absolutely insane and untrue claim. This is some next-level gaslighting as she claims the #AlienDNA doctor is “the only medical professional and actual doctor with experience treating COVID—19 willing to speak up...” WHAT? 😳
Trump probably thinks alien DNA is blood from small Mexican children and he already has a supply on hand.
We’re you this fired up about the last flu season where thousands more were infected and died??!  Oh no because it had nothing to do with Trump!!!

Sorry he beat the cancer in 2006, so he had been in remission for 14 years. What does his cancer that he beat 14 years ago have to do with his death via the death-pack at the trump Tulsa rally?

What does colon cancer thar Cain beat in 2013 have to do with him getting coronavirus at Trump's Tulsa death rally that eventually killed him in 2020?
Sorry had to mute my TV MR.TRUMP is having his daily rant on TV. He going to tell us how well he reads and how he doesn't tell Russia to stop putting bounties on our military because they wouldn't do it because Vladimir Putin said so and why would he and anyway OBAMA did it. MUTE
Nope, not hardly.  Sounds like Trump is playing the "left" on this one.  They want mass voter fraud to occur by mail in votes, and the right is having NONE of that.  So if its mail only because of Covid, then lets wait until Covid is out of here.  Like on Nov 4 lol
My grandson is 16 and has Dylexia and got great help and is in 10th grade at top of his class.His MAMA my daughter also worked with him. Unfortunately Mr.TRUMP got no Motherly or Fatherly love. That stunted all kinds of learnings and feelings in Mr.TRUMP.
Actually Mr.TRUMP prefers Bugs Bunny comic books.
So we don't have to worry Mr.TRUMP can not cancel  on January 3 2021 there will be people elected and in office. This is not The Twilight Zone. Congress sets election dates not the PRESIDENT..
TRUMP TWEETS:
Anyway the answer is moot. MR.TRUMP can not delay the elections.The Congress sets the date. And you in your mind that there's no way in Hades that the Congress will be completely dissolved in January.
Imagine dying, for Donald Trump....
My TWITTER FRIENDS AND NOT SO GREAT FRIENDS. MR.TRUMP SAID THE ELECTION SHOULD BE DELAYED? IGNORE THAT TWEET OF IGNORANCE! JUST IGNORE IT. NO PRESIDENT CAN CANCEL AN ELECTION.THE CONGRESS DECIDES THE DATE OF ELECTIONS.EVIDENTLY MR.TRUMP DOESNT KNOW THAT. SEND HIM CONSTITUTION

You trump supporters always ask for proof and when presented proof you dismiss it. But will literally believe every single word that comes out of trumps mouth like he’s the only president who never lied about anything.
He doesn’t care Americans are dying. He wants people at the polls instead of doing mail in voting. I don’t understand how Mail in can worsen Corona when more people will be mailing in their vote. Trump doesn’t want mail in cause he knows his going to loose

She needs to vote for Trump!!
Ok Tugs! How many thousands died at the hands of Cuomo? And how about Biden ripping Trump about early travel ban? Waiting... Biden is a DA!
Why I don't like MR.TRUMP ? So many but the latest he repeats in press conference that a medicine proven not to work should be used. He also retweeted a nutty woman saying to take the drug proven not to work &amp; dangerous.This WEIRDO WOMAN ALSO HAS SAID DRUGS MADE FROM ALIENS BLOOD
I'm from Texas, but please win. We need you. Trump needs you. California needs you desperately
To hear you talk about the rule of law ,is to laugh.The rule of law is what Trump says it is and has nothing to do with the true rule of the law.
It’s funny you post stuff like this, knowing that there was collusion with trump and Russia during the 2016 elections (it was proven)
This mess falls on Trump, but it wouldn't have to be this bad if Texas had a leader who stood firm for the well being of Texans instead of his own political and financial gain. Abbott and Trump have killed Texas  Join  and vote for Biden in November
You do realize America is LITERALLY built on protests and riots? Ever since right before the Declaration of Independence. If anything the protestors in Portland are infinitely more American than you. The only person trying to “demolish the American way of life” is Trump. Wake up
Or, a theory that makes more sense, Trump is the fake media. Because the sheer number of people it would take to stay quiet about it if ALL of America’s news media was fake would probably be around a million or so and would probably be found out within 1 and a half years
You are Donald Trump in a dress.We hate you too.
PRAISE THE LORD ! Our Eyes &amp; Ears are Protected From The Lies &amp; Misconceptions Of Elitist LIAR IN SON O F LIAR AND CHIEF DONALD JOHN SON. NOW We Don't Have To Hear Crying &amp; LIES by Donnie TRUMP Jr. Trying To UNSUCCESSFULLY GET DADDY TRUMP TO LOVE HIM. DONNIE DADDY ONLY 💝SELF😢
Jimmy Jordan turned a blind eye on young men and boys being raped why maybe he enjoyed watching like he likes watching PUTIN and TRUMP  RAPING AMERICA
Hunny they are leading in all polls. Democrats are losing no one.Think the TRUMP PARTY is losing B I G.
The young people are ignorant. If you had a clue as to how corrupt the Democrats and NeoCons are you would know why they hate Trump. We have been a guided democracy for decades. It isn't supposed to be possible to elect a president only a puppet.
The same person who doesn't care about rape of young men is again lying in CONGRESS and ignoring your god Mr.TRUMP raping AMERICA.
Out of fear and hate you allowed a orange painted money hungry man to destroy your party and AMERICANS RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER RESPECTED BECAUSE OF COURSE IF MR.TRUMP BUT MAINLY BECAUSE OF YOU HIS ENABLERS. FEARFULL LITTLE TURTLES HIDING YOUR HEAD INSIDE SHELL.
#democrats need to #stop!  At what point do they make laws and stop investigating Trump? What is the point in all of this? #Barr This us a #wasteoftimeandmoney
Your god Mr.TRUMP has made your party go from GRAND OLD PARTY A CHRISTIAN PARTY TO A GODLESS PARTY WHO HATES THE CONSTITUTION &amp; SUPPORTER OF A PUPPET OF VLADIMIR PUTIN AND AGAINST.RULES OF LAW. CHRISTIANS ARENT PERFECT.BUT ARE GENERALLY HONEST FULL OF LOVE NOT HATE &amp; FEAR. U LIAR
Goddamn, Republicans are so far down the Trump hole.
Hahahahaha. Good one. 🤣  "Voters?"  They were Democrats and even they weren't buying his socialist nonsense. They weren't "scared of Trump winning" in 2016. They STILL rejected him for Hillary. 🤣  Gotta hand it to Bernie tho. He made out like a capitalist personally.
Oh yeah I’m sure trump was so stoked to take a cognitive test that he couldn’t even answer what would you get if you started from 100 and counted back by 7
At least he’s more mentally stable. Trump can’t even answer a simple question without changing the subject
At least he's there. Trump wasn't.
"LAW AND ORDER" APPLIES TO YOU AND PENCE AND BARR AND IF U HAVENT NOTICED THE REAL TRUE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT AS FEARFUL OF YOUR TWEETS AND ARE DESERTING THE DICTATOR WANT TO BE DONNIE JOHN TRUMP. QUICKLY. YES IM USING CAPITAL LETTERS TO SHOUT AT YOU SINCE YOU CANT READ OR HEAR.BYE
Donnie TRUMP REMEMBER when RICHIRD NIXON tried to use the phrase LAW AND ORDER to keep his PRESIDENTCY when we found he was so corrupt with his enemies list like you? How did that work out? Even the REPUBLICANS turned against him.He had to resign!  tr
Im with you on this one. I cant see biden running this country. Trump may have had some hiccups but biden would be a whole new nightmare.
At what point does Barr look at Trump’s chances and start backing off in his efforts to protect him and his cronies?
Trump will blame the Marlin’s woes on all of the Dominicans on their roster.
Trump be lying UNPROMPTED
Goodness TRUMP looked as stupid while appearing on the Office as he does in the Rose Garden and his office
I actually an a Senior Citzen Veteran Grandma. Christian who blocked my former pastor who on Facebook posts so many posts praising TRUMP &amp; putting down Democrats. He knows the Bible but still supports a little evil man like TRUMP .So I blocked someone I otherwise respected.
Trump when posting this tweet:
the people in these communities want this.  And Trump has every right to protect federal buildings.   thats in his jurisdiction
He thought that Lewis was “ lying” in state and Trump didn’t want any competition.
Vote for him and hold him accountable, challenge him, and push him as far left as possible. That's what most progressives plan to do. Ceasefire to get trump out of office, as soon as the election is over, fight for what you believe in.
What Trump has done makes Nixon look like a saint.  He has made a mockery of the GOP.  It is a shame that it one person to ruin the Reputation of the Republican Party.  One idiot, liar, thief and just all around Evil person.
Trump is visiting Morrisville in NC today and he may not catch the fade but I hope he catches that COVID
As far as I know Trump has not gone to any one of these riots and has been seen shooting anyone, but this is all his fault? #FakeNews #MAGA
No one could be as disgusting and lies more than Trump!!!!!  He doesn’t care about this country he only cares about himself.
Trump has done nothing to stop it.
Please use smaller words so Trump can better understand, such as person, woman, man, camera, TV.
President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. Department of Justice will send a "surge of federal law enforcement" into American cities run by "extreme politicians" who are on an "anti-police crusade," including Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.

It’s out in the open now. Trump’s #AmeriKKKa. Thuggery in the streets. Nazis on the march. Stay strong, stay safe, and #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica like all of our lives depend on it!
You mean like Hillary tried to steal the election, and Obama/Biden spied on Trump campaign
Is anyone going to ask Trump when he is going to sign the new healthcare bill ? It’s been the two weeks that he mentioned.
As a NATIVE TEXAN OF 76 YEARS BELIEVE TEDDY CRUZ needs to take the COGNATIVE TEST MR.TRUMP TOOK &amp; SEE IF THE LAST 5 QUESTIONS ARE AS HARD FOR HIM AS THEY WERE FOR MR.TRUMP. POOR TEDDY IS GOING SENILE TOO.
Trump has brought soilders back just to use them to attack citizens. Very patriotic.
As soon as Trump agrees to an interview on MSNBC.
Another conspiracy theory by TRUMP and his TRUMPO CULTISTS . Conspiracies here.  Conspiracies there. Conspiracies everywhere.
Guess you turned a blind eye and deaf ear to Donnie TRUMP DOING just that.
As a TEXAN WHO THE HECK CARES WHAT A WOOSE LIKE TED CRUZ HAS TO SAY? VOTE BLUE TEXANS TED CRUZ EVIDENTLY WAS A DABATER WHO WON MEDALS BY BRAVE  HE BOWS BEFORE TRUMP WHO CALLED HIS WIFE DUMB AND UGLY AND HIS DAD A TRAITOR. LITTLE HAIRY MAN HAS NO BACKBONE
Typical Trump construction.
Mr.Trump mail in votes are not fake or false or rigged. Mr.Trump YOU will lose because you are a puppet of Vladimir Putin and a lousy PRESIDENT who caused hundreds of thousands of people to die and inbred coward &amp; LIAR &amp; corrupted woman chasing racist dictator want to be.
He is our last chance at getting trump out but that doesn't mean he isnt abhorrent and you shouldn't be ashamed to call yourself a fan of his
I’ll agree with that. Guns are not the best accessory for a protest. But still, people. Please don’t drive your car into a crowd of pedestrians. How is that so difficult for Trump Ragers to avoid doing?
Except students Teachers Cafeteria workers Those who clean up Aides Nurses Principals Oh did I mention teachers and families and students and families. KISSING TRUMP'S BUTT
No I mean Trump!!!  I’m not trying to pick a fight.  I am stating what I feel.  I can do that.
Trump is fake this another attempt to use fake stories so he can rig the election.  Do Not Believe Him!!!!!  Keep your eyes off his fake stories.  Do not be fooled again by the biggest FOOL OF ALL.  EVIL PERSON. Most corrupt person ever!!!!!!
The article fails to link to the video, so here it is, in all its kool aid drinking Trump cultist glory:

Government corruption and grifting is what doomed Venezuela. See why we need Trump gone ASAP?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Joe Biden is not going to DEFUND the police. Donnie TRUMP is just lying again.
Biden describes lower classes as entitled and regularly attacks welfare as entitlement. His view points haven’t ever changed, his actions reflect that. Trump on the other hand has a mouth, but his actions show character that Biden just doesn’t have.
Well said. The Trump cult is quite the mind controlled.
Honestly, Trump--examples include the wollman park ice rink, his executivevorder to strengthen families, his executive order to lower medication prices, his hong kong order which focuses on civil liberties that are much needed.
Shout a lot at Mr.Trump and buddies on TV. BUT WILL NEVER EVER GIVE UP!! AS ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS "THATS WHAT GIRLS DO" "WE PERSIST FOREVER"
I have a Trump joke , but it’s insane.
ETTD!! Maybe the GOP will realize that the Trump crime family cares for no one but themselves.
TRUMP AGAIN SIDES WITH THE N.KOREA DICTATOR. TRUMPO CULTISTS OF COURSE DO NOT CARE.
Do these TRUMPO CULTIST not realize the government took TRUMP to court and he and Fred TRUMP had to change their actions and pay a huge fine. GOD forgive gullible people. There's fools born everyday.
Some TRUMPO CULTISTS have disengaged from their brain stem &amp; will believe ANYTHING. There's a POST going around FACEBOOK THAT TRUMP GOT AN AWARD FOR HELPING INNER CITY YOUTH.HES PICTURED WITH THOSE WHO WON HUMANITARIAN AWARDS. MY FORMER PASTOR POSTED IT. PICTURE TRUE BUT NO AWARD

Anti-Trump Republican groups urge voters to support Joe Biden  via
If even half this number of black likely voter approval of Trump is real, Biden and the Dems are in deep, deep trouble.
Yeah?  Friday, July 24, 2020  The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 49% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance.
Really amazing Biden had the nerve to call Trump racist after the ridiculous things that have come out of his mouth! Has he forgotten the “ You ain’t Black”!remark?
This is unacceptable. We must beat Trump in November and then take out the rest of the trash and Dave our state. Join
one of the best Trump interviews I've seen.  Well done, Dave!
This is what you would call a death panel. Not the ACA. No, trump and the GOP caused this.
SIR not only do you support the MOST RACIST PRESIDENT SINCE ANDREW JACKSON. BUT LIKE MR.TRUMP WHEN YOU SPEAK YOU MAKE AS LITTLE SENCE AS YOUR RACIST gods inability to hode YOUR RACISM OR MAKE SENCE WHEN YOU SPEAK. U SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE &amp; TAKE HISTORY &amp; GOVERNMENT &amp; WRITING
Yes IT MUST BE STOPPED!!!!  Wake up and see truly see TRUMP IS NOBODIES PRESIDENT EXCEPT FOR HIS COMRADES!!!!!
Friday, July 24, 2020  The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 49% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance. Forty-nine percent (49%) disapprove.
Yeah, that attitude.
I found one source and placed an order. We'll see if it actually arrives.  My observations are mostly addressing retail, over the counter sales.   I find your attitude to be less than helpful.   But that's just me.
Does Trump not realize in his pea sized brain that Portland is still in the United States or is he not even trying to pretend any more he is not on Russia’s bought and paid for list!!!
You think he's gonna ask him tough questions and give a fair interview 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 delusional, trump is not taking an interview (amidst a deadly pandemic that he had terribly mishandled ) with someone who’s gonna ask him hard questions.
I fully intend to purchase your book and read as much as I can bare without screaming at TRUMP and Kirsten how can you be so cruel and full of hate and fear. AMERICANS need to read your book and write your CONGRESSMAN or WOMEN and TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REGISTER VOTE
Great news for some.  I don't see any 380 Auto in there.
little lady question??? Are all REPUBLICANS in the TRUMP liars from birth through July 2020 especially in the TRUMP administration or just become LIARS under TRUMPS TUTORSHIP. HUNNY HE SIGNED A BILL AND YOU ACTIVATED IT PER YOUR ACTIONS AND WORDS TO SEPERATE FAMILIES
Yeah?  And exactly where do you suggest I buy it?  The U.S. is sold out of handgun ammo. Yes, the entire country...and has been for months...and will be for several more months.  I can't even buy ammo at my range.
Kissing the feet of his GOD Donald trump
Eh, not so much.  Friday, July 24, 2020  The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 49% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance.
I welcome any and all who oppose Trump.
I didn't qualify bc I filed as a dependent (University). Now I'm graduated with not much support or income bc Trump ruined this country and didn't care enough to have a real support system in place unlike every other 1st and even 2nd world countries.
Trump Signs Order Excluding Illegal Immigrants from Census to Prevent Inflated Congressional Districts
His choice was to believe science and get bullied by Trump or tow the line. He tried to do both and failed.
My favorite network ! PLEASE SPEAK ON ALL PROGRAMS START TALKING ABOUT TRUMP KNOWING ABOUT THE BOUNTIES ON MILITARY BY PUTIN AND TRUMP DOING "0" ABOUT IT.STILL HAS NOT MENTIONED OR DOES "0"  ABOUT IT! AT NEWS CONFRENCES THIS IS NEVER MENTIONED. PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS!
Donald Trump's facebook ads are so targeted towards 60+ year old rural area conspiracy theorists. I know that shit works too
Which is insane. The #1 argument for Trump is that he's "not a politician" so a woman of color who worked her ass off to get where she is, is vilified and derided, while the orange asshole can kill 140,000+ Americans and it's no biggie
Man Trump got one hell of deal inside of your head. Hey tell me again why you named you show after genocidal maniacs?
Liberal Says They're Voting For Trump, Facebook DELETES Video??!  via
It’s interesting seeing Donald Trump finally start to make moves like he wants to take the virus seriously (wearing mask, cancelling convention).   It only took 150,000 deaths, and I’m still sure he won’t commit to it fully for fear of admitting he was wrong (too far gone).
GUESS WHO DOESNT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AN EPSTEIN SCANDAL? JOE BIDEN!! GUESS WHO HAS TO WORRY ABOUT AN EPSTEIN SCANDAL? DONALD JOHN TRUMP!!
I absolutely cannot stand him. He is not mentally right he is unstable and every I mean everything that comes out of his mouth is a flat ass lie.   Trump Just so you know we see them now, we look for the real answers.  The only answer to yourcorrupt life is JOE BIDEN PRES.

How did Trump make people unemployed exactly? He did not create the virus. But yes a payroll tax cut is not a good idea
YOU DONALD JOHN TRUMP IS THE ONE DOING THE SQUIRM
There was no need for this.  It is an embarrassment and criminal.  We have the right to protest!!!! They I’m sure Trump’s and the idiot in charge need to be held accountable for there communist like tactics.
A word about Trump's "test" results. 🙃
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I fucking hate trump and want him out of the office
Everybody keeps trying to say Trump is the most racist or most dangerous president ever. That isn’t true. He IS however the most stupid president by a large margin. GWB and dementia era-Reagan being 2 and 3.
Those that hate the Jews call Trump a racist. They are all hypocrites, and this is just one example of many.
The anti-semities call Trump racist. Really?
It's currently Donald Trump's America
Oh trump dealing with social justice and throwing the COVID-19 Updates to distract EVERYBODY but putin.
Supports Trump? Hell no. Don't love him. He doesn't have me or my family in mind and won't keep us safe. Texas is fucked.
DEFUND THE POLICE AND LOCK TRUMP AND BARR UP!
I can't hear the fans chant 'WHAT' thanks to Trump #TrumpVirus
Why people blame trump for the virus? This was given to the state leaders which that represent YOU to see fit that the virus is under control. This administration is not a dictatorship. Stop being an idiot, please.
SORRY didn't realize Donnie TRUMP had friends only those he considers beholden to him.
YOU'VE HEARD OF FAKE NEWS? THIS IS BOTH FAKE NEWS AND FAKE CHART. TEXANS ARE NOT STUPID.TEXANS KNOW LIES WHEN THEY SEE THEM AND HEAR THEM. ARE REPUBLICANS BRED TO BE LIARS ARE HAS YOUR PARENTS TAUGHT YOU TO LIE OR WERE YOU INFECTED BY YOUR god MR.TRUMP

As a TEXAN I find it shameful to hear you who is supposed to be serving Texans &amp; keeping us safe say not to believe the MEDICAL EXPERTS such as DR.FAUCI but believe your TRUMP cherry picked doctors 2. However thousands disagree with your cherry picked 2 doctors. GOP DEATH CULT
GOP congressman: Trump’s Ghislaine Maxwell comments were ‘unacceptably obtuse’   LOl! Well what the heck did you expect from an entity who is totally obtuse?
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 49% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance.
I'm not a government scholar but have studied how government is supposed to be run. However in the dictatorship we have not sure what the Democrats can do to rid the country of TRUMP and his REPUBLICAN ENABLERS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AND EVEN THEN HES NOT GONE TILL END JANUARY.
There's been other racist presidents but none as blatant and touted like trump
LOVE LOVE LOVE HOW YOUR GOD DONALD TRUMP HAS TUTORED REPUBLICANS IN THE ART OF LIES. YOU PASSED YOUR COURSE 101 LYING TO AMERICANS. YOU ALSO PASSED COURSE 102 ACTING UNCONSTITUTIONLY ! BET YOUR MAMA AND DADDY AND GRANDPARENTS ARE  PROUD! BET RONALD REAGAN AND BUSHES ARE PROUD.
Pay attention  You thought you might be different than literally every other person who acquiesced to what your Emperor Trump demanded of you. You'll be joining the many others under that bus.   We're coming for you.
YOU were actually elected president with 3000000 more votes than Donnie TRUMP . You have a mandate he doesn't. YOU ARE STILL LEADING OUT OF OFFICE .TRUMP A FAKE PRESIDENT IS DOING NO LEADING. THANK YOU AND BILL CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN FOR LEADING
This doesn't bother CHRISTIANS &amp; NONBELIEVERS that MR.TRUMP ACTUALLY SAID THIS? THIS ISNT FAKE NEWS..HE SAID IT ON LIVE TV. SHE WAS THE EVIL WOMAN WHO BROUGHT YOUNG GIRLS TO PEDEOPHILE EPSTEIN!😣🐷🐢🐍🗽😣
y’all are so lucky man, I actually do hate it here..luckily our seperate counties themselves are pushing for online classes until January but the trump administration says they’re gonna make sure we go to school physically 😐
This would be funny if not so serious and worrying about who will be PRESIDENT for the next 4 year's.
Trump said he wishes Ghislaine well
The republicans were doing the same thing to prevent Obama from doing things. How was he able to handle H1N1 and trump still hasn’t handled COVID??? If Obama was able to handle a pandemic with the opposing side not helping trump has no excuse either lol. #CORNY
5.. Your party no longer are the Christian JESUS Loving Party but the party shaking in their boots BOWING DOWN TO AN MORALLY EMPTY FAKE PRESIDENT OUT OF YOUR OWN IMMORALITY OR ABJECT FEAR OF A DICTATOR WANT TO BE DONALD TRUMP. F.D.R. SAID "YOU ONLY HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF"
How bout telling us why our troops were getting targeted by Russia and trump did nothing about it?
I pray he finds a much better teaching position. This is unconstitutional. Trump is our President. That is not a false statement.
Blame trump this is his fault if it weren’t for his overly inflated ego and incompetence it wouldn’t have gotten this bad. There were many people in his administration that told him several times he needs to take this more seriously but to him it was a democratic hoaxAt least Obama showed up. Where was Trump!

150,000 Americans have died because Trump lied. #TrumpVirus
I can't help wondering what people will say at trump's funeral.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
He just hands #Trump the election with these mental breakdowns over and over again...🇺🇸
And the reason why the Texas government is not shutting down because our governor is kissing Trump's ass and trying to stay open for the economy. Most republican states.  Its pretty ridicules.
"no, no, no, i wasn't paid to vote to not impeach trump or to confirm kavanaugh! i made those choices all on my own :)" that's  not better
Trump did this.
Keep doing what you’re doing and start using those executive orders!Trump 2020!!
Thanks,I am so scared that we can’t mobilize our voters as we did in 2016. So many even here, don’t realize that Trump didn’t create the shutdowns. I lost all hope during OBAMA admin of this country not going socialist. Trump gave me back HOPE .W/ Biden there is no HOPE for USA
This crazy witch wants to get us invaded and ruled by a communist/hostile country.She is nuts but the Bernie bats and Bidenites eat this up with a spoon. It will be the end of our great country. I have never seen a more dangerous situation in my lifetime.We have to re-elect Trump
Trump did this with rejecting black tenants in his apartments citing lack of respect and tendencies towards crime they brought. Now he’s using classism again to protect the white soccer moms from the poor single mom just looking for a home to house her kids.
That guy is an asshat and most in Texas know it. Unfortunately, he’s the rep for a deeply religious section of Texas. Ever want to be creeped out?? Take a road trip thru his area. Even the churches have trump signs up.
Americans are suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons.
The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for DACA.

The riots in our Dem controlled cities see  themselves as the beginning of an Arab spring.They want chaos, they want fear, they want Trump supporters to fear to get out of the houses! They want Trump gone and the rule of law suspended. They want Kamala Harris &amp;Biden to control us
What we saw democrats do to AG Barr is the opening salvo of what Kamala Harris threatens . We have to get out the vote and re-elect the President or we will find ourselves in concentration/re education camps. This is going to get a lot worse as they want to scare Trump voters!!

I nominate Trump for the experimental trial. #CognitiveTrump
That’s absolutely shocking.... Said no one ever about Trump. But of course it’ll be labeled a hoax perpetrated by the violent anarchist left. Insert massive eye roll.
Just another Trump lie. Not surprising.
How is business related success in par with the average black American? While I agree anyone can become successful in America, I also understand there is still alot of prejudice. Yes Obama was president, he got shat on by Trump saying he not American. Playing on his skin....

So the Dems will let us or our relatives die because of a Drug Trump says is good. That alone should be a reason to re-elect the President. They don’t care if we suffer or die. Trump could cure cancer and they would block the cure because they hate him so badly. #retirePelosinow
What does it say about a political party that keeps a drug away from the public that would stop a lot of suffering because The President took it and recommended it? The Dems are trying everything to keep the public from getting it. They want anyone who agrees with Trump to suffer

It won’t be long when Trump catches the virus, and then we can tell him it’s only a Hoax. Drink some bleach and you’ll be better.
Trump forgets that the 2 cases that were proven in voter fraud, was done by the Republicans. Yes it’s fixed, by corrupt Republicans.
We love ❤️ our Trump!
BLM’s real objective. I am afraid they are gearing up for an armed offensive against the US Govt. if the FBI had been investigating these terrorist instead of trying to unseat Trump we might know what these bastards are up to.
Texas loves Trump

This is Trump's America
Trump’s?
James That old cow Pelosi called The Covid 19 virus  “Trump Virus” over the weekend. I propose we ask all patriots to call her DC office and complain and demand an apology from her or we keep calling &amp;calling.Please ask those who follow you if they could help us!
There is one pathetic one at the end of the street. All my neighbors have Trump signs
Remember all of you call Pelosi’s Washington DC office tomorrow and tell her that we don’t appreciate her calling Covid 19 the “Trump Virus” That is unacceptable. We all need to call all day long and show her how pissed we are.
Ms Trish, u should b ashamed. Calling Trump a dumb MF is an insult to dumb MFs.
WHY DOES THE LION HAVE THE EXACT SAME FACE AS TRUMP AFTER THE FLOPPED RALLY
White supremacist point of view  you talk down to all of us Blacks Asians Latin who support Trump and see how Thr Democrats are turning the USA into the mess that we left behind in our anatovie countries.  Wake up! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
tRump only cares about himself
If trump isn't president
thanks for following. Go Trump KAG2020. ARE YOU ON FACEBOOK?
I am sick of These left wing asshole Dems blaming this pandemic on our President! I don’t what can be done about it but vote for Trump and all of them out of office.Maybe we all should call Pelosi’s office Monday and tell her we don’t appreciate her calling Covid the Trump Virus.
Yes. Even if I had a mail in ballot I’d stand in line. Trump would find some reason to invalidate mail in. I will stand in the blazing S. TX sun for a week to be at the front of the line.
Because Trump said it was good and orange man is bad. The media is  a joke...
You hate Trump and since we should stand up to hate all of us who voted for him last time are going to stand tall against your hatred of Trump and do it again!! We are putting the Anti hate Trump hoodoo on you. Plus about a million more than last time are voting Trump!
Prominent Black Trump Supporter Murdered in Milwaukee
Mr Trump please deploy water cannons on federal property and let these agents use them. Nothing stops a riot quicker. Who cares what Maxine waters or that brain dead bimbo Pelosi thinks about anything. We need a victory over these asshats. I promise 1 water canon =10k votes!!!
Leave it to Trump supporters to make America disgusting
Trump’s deployment of federal agents in cities has everything to do with his reelection
Trump doesn’t lie
We are with you President Trump. You were dealt a hand in 2016 with marked cards &amp;still won the pot! They have been dealing from the bottom of the deck ever since. It’s time to stop this insanity.Once you R re elected please go after the criminals in DC and the ones on the street
She was alway presidential. I can see her running against Ivanka Trump in 2028.
To blame a federal agent for the shooting.They believe that even though it won’t happen they will act like it did similar to their operations in Ferguson. They know the media will blame Trump and that’s the objective. Trump has them so scared because he doesn’t scare or back off!
When these thugs invade your home I suggest you have a shotgun loaded with #4 buckshot to defend yourself. I haven’t seen a human that can take  a load like that&amp; keep coming.This in case Biden wins because we don’t get the vote out for Trump. Immediately reload and negate threat
Criminals like Lori Lightfoot, AOC, Wheeler, Pelosi &amp; all these Dem Governors and Mayors need to be taken to task by the citizens in their jurisdictions.come November this violence and crazy cancel crap statue busting will get 100 times worse if we don’t re-elect President Trump!
All because something something comicsgate and Trump. Yet won't call out Antifa or BLM. Whata fucking joke
This is what we have in store if we lose President Trump!! Biden will absorb Antifa into the FBI  AOC AS THE HEAD OF THE EPA. Imagine the mayor of Seattle as Secretary of State. Whomever is VP will replace him as unfit. Imagine Lightfoot as VP then POTUS. Next concentration camps
Show this to all who have lost their jobs and businesses / livelihood due to the Governors keeping their states shut down to try and Blame Trump. The states did this not the Trump administration !!
For anyone who thinks that all this violence is something that just happens in big cities. Antifa leaders and even Kamala Harris has said they are coming after all of The Trump supporters and anyone who opposes them. Antifa is their attack arm with BLM. They are coming after us.
oh how i love people roasting trump
President Donald Trump will tour an oil rig and meet with energy producers in the Permian Basin during a Texas visit on July 29.
Exactly people, Everyone get off your asses and vote. This country won’t survive with Trump and his Nazi administration, if they are not voted out of office. Just saying the obvious.
Haha, man oh man the mindset of liberal leaders - they lost the election still haven’t gotten over it 😂 Isn’t it great how they blame Trump for literally everything, including their own failures. #MAGA #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Obama is just trying to get ink. He is covertly being a Muslim trying to stir sh!t. It s a crying shame that the USSS does such an excellent job is all I have to say except this. He and that idiot Biden is why we elected Trump!!!!
This November we have to get the vote out! These Asshole are trying to scare people to not vote. They are going to do more. Soros is old/ill and wants USA destroyed before he dies. He has said this publicly many times. This is what this offensive is about.Soros can’t buy Trump!!!
We sane Americans outnumber these SORONAUTS/Antifa/BLM PROB 100k/200k to one of these idiots.I feel sorry for the residents who are being terrorized by these Marxist.These residents can stop this by voting for Donald Trump in Nov. Biden gets in Antifa has said they are empowered
These left Dem mayors and Governors appear to all want this chaos which is funded by Soros. This seems to be an offensive to try and scare Voters away because Dems are frightened of 4more years of Trump and the truth coming out. If Biden is elected lol the DOJ investigations stop
3-4,000 illegal children went missing under Trump's administration. And since he's associated with Epstein, I wouldn't put it past the fucker if he's doing pedo &amp; organ trafficking. Its a theory yes but bottom line we need proper immigration reform.
Has anyone on here ever had a call polling asking whether you are going to vote for Trump or Biden??? I am an old guy and have had the same number for 25 years and in all that time I have never been called by a pollster, has any of you??? Please ask around.
This is PUBLIC ENEMY #1 this man is the money paying these rioters and telling them to create chaos. He tells the mayors and Dem governors to not ask or allow Trump to send help. I want to see Soros deportation or funeral.
REMEMBER IF A DEMOCRAT ACUSES TRUMP OF DOING SOMETHING, THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES REALLY DOING WHAT THEY ARE ACUSING TRUMP OF. They are trying to scare Trump supporters into not showing up to vote.They are scared to death of us and they are trying to bluff and scare us like 2016
Trump calls off Florida segment of GOP National Convention
Every single thing Trump does that's not 'fix COVID-19' invites the obvious attack: "why is he focusing on this and not the pandemic?"

Lit just washed my car and it rains.. Thanks Trump
this now, and step up to the challenge in providing PPE to our Hospitals. You Trump and your administration are the cause of this virus growing out of control. All these deaths are on your hands. Mr President, you &amp; your administration are 💩💩💩!
Hey Trump, why didn’t you show this much ergency, getting PPE to all hospitals in the country, like you violating Americans rights to protest with your Gestapal Police. You sir have your priorities all f**ked up! You and your administration keep embarrassing our country. Stop
What? Have you even seen the movies? Biff Tannen was literally based on Donald Trump, and the movie quote is literally "make like a tree and get out of here," and that's what you should do.

This is what desperate looks like.  could have done much better but chose to put Brett Kavanaugh in the SCOTUS and she thinks trump has learned his lesson...yet she is probably losing this fall to Sara Gideon

More like little bitches that need their own bubble
Will Hurd has had multiple opportunities to stand up to trump and do the right thing. I’ll believe it when I see it.
Now hold trump accountable

Trump: "I'm an absentee voter."  Dude, you're an absentee leader.
I so hope you do not win as Maine Senator. You are a flake. Not good for our country. We do not need another Trump and liar.
Its actually true. Those are not even their kids. This was all set up by rich ppl long ago and the Bush administration. They were crooked. Its honestly why Trump matters so much. Why would they do this to someone unless he had a lot of dirt on them
She works for the cartel. There is just so much people dont know about what's going on and they all throw shit at Trump and blame him. 6 months ago I hated Trump. The media! Well, I have more power than the media!! Its called my finger tips
He won against cancer  He went on remission since 2006  He lived another 14 years  Attended a Trump Rally without a mask  Died from Covid19   If only he loved his children the way he loved Trump lies  Black Lives Matter

I dont care what Trump has done. They are both crooks. Only one has been here only 3.5 yrs and the other has been sniffing everyone for almost 50 yrs!! Joe has never done anything, except pass laws to put more black ppl in jail. Facts
Election games used to make Trump look bad and to get rid of them so they can go back to crooked business as usual! Those tariffs were fucking with all the illegal money coming back in. Clintons money was getting taxed way too much!!
You’re absolutely right, I do yawn 🥱
Ad hominem attacks, how surprising. So the people who listen to a liar like Trump are woke and the people listening to reputable sources of info are sheep, huh? No wonder Trump loves the uneducated.
If Obama or Clinton hasd EVER said anything close to what Trump said, would it be considered “a joke” by Cornyn and the rest of the complacent Republicans?!?
Irrelevant. You can always count on Trump supporters to change the subject anytime they know they are losing an argument.
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn’t leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
I wonder how much Southeastern donates to Trump-friendly PACs.
Texas is fine.  We all know these covid numbers are propaganda to derail Trump.
Tru! Why did they release the virus!! To make Trump look bad and incompetent. All I know if before China and The Democrats released their elections weapon  Was killing it statistically!! Media made me hate Trump! Well. We have weapons too! Its called the internet

Idk im not for him. But Obama during his term deported thousands more than trump. And the ice facilities the way they are now is because of Obama. Not to mention Obama bombed countries left and right. Trump is brining light to the child trafficking pandemic and this is

Will Mr. Trump be attending his memorial service?
No, I’m Just waiting for president trump to lock them all up!!
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
“Studdered” aw lmao. That’s not a word. Aren’t you a trump supporter, isn’t he into 10 year olds and his own daughter?? Yeah that’s what I thought.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
So you don’t believe in the fact that hospitals are attributing more cases for financial gain? If not that’s fine but in your opinion are blue states inflating numbers to hurt Trump? Honest question nothing behind it.
Omg he made a mistake, wow. At least he’s an eloquent speaker unlike Fraud in chief Trump! Person woman man camera Tv! Wow he can pass a simple memory test how impressive!!!
Hmmm I’m sure if trump did it you’d be okay with it though 🤷🏽‍♀️
You obviously don’t know what John Lewis stood for 🤡. As if trump wouldn’t make a speech at a funeral about himself and how he’s the greatest president ever.
Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn’t want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis’s name! EVER!
You have no foreign policy experience.  Your motives are selfish.  You are only opposed because in your fantasy you think opposing Trump makes you a hero.  You’re not...you’re a fraud.
You know what, forget I. I shouldn’t be insulting someone because I’m very privileged and was born into a wealthy family. If you think Donald Trump, despite the fact that he made our country a freakshow, will be a good President, vote for him. It’s your right.

Wonder if Trump will attend his funeral.
But Trump promoted Patio Pizza, so there's that.😳
Trump wants to deflect from Obama's eulogy at Lewis' funeral?
...and when  said this, did he recall the Trump statement from last month, when he talked about slowing down testing, that he doesn’t joke around? It’s too bad Cornyn feels like he has to remain a Trump bootlicker to prevent his base from abandoning him.
is a confirmed ass and will happily carry any water he can for trump. Vote  and let John retire.
Well unfortunately he's a Trump supporter and believes in a lot of stupid conspiracy theories.
President Trump, I respectfully disagree with your desire to delay the election.  I agree that the potential for fraud is high with mail in voting.  We need to come up with a solution to combat fraud, but not delay the election.  In person voting w/precautions against Covid.

FRIENDLY REMINDER: If Trump cancelled the election, Nancy Pelosi does not automatically become president on January 20th. House of Representatives would be vacant come January 3rd, thusly on Jan. 20th there would technically be NO speaker of the house to assume the presidency.
Cancelling/Postponing the election will not only end in a constitutional crisis, but I don't think Trump understands that the constitution holds that at Noon on January 20th, both him and Pence will be jobless if the election has not yet taken place.
Wouldn't be great if they brought back  for one final episode where they surrounded the White House and dragged out a half-shaven Donald Trump in a wife beater and pajama bottoms and the last you saw of him was the in the back of the squad car with the closing credits?
Trump is only tweeting it to distract from the news that the US is in recession. The Trump Recession.
I'm going to miss when the Trump presidency is over and every expert he hired seems like they were the 50th caller to a radio station that morning.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
You are the actual disaster. The trump virus cannot be cured with your vile tweets.
I am PISSED OFF and I’ve been no fan of Herman Cain’s politics!!  What an appalling waste that he would die for Donald Fucking Trump!!
Trump wants it
What are you talking about? Didn’t you see the quotation marks? That was what Trump said in his ad, that we won’t be safe in Biden’s America and he will keep us all safe, but the irony is that absolutely nobody is safe in Trump’s America as showcased by the horrors occurring now.
How does an otherwise universally-accepted smart individual, business leader and visionary essentially meet his untimely death because he actively chose to shill for Trump?   How?
I'm not sure how you feel sorry for this guy?... blame Trump? Seems like he was a grown man that refused to educate himself (C-19) , putting his life/ supporters at risk. What if he gave it to YOUR child?
Herman Cain is dead from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally without a mask... I spot 8 other black Republicans next to him. One was smart enough to wear a mask the rest think Trump is their god.   Stop politicizing Covid19 Black people, your lives matter!
I've got as much to learn from you Bob as Trump does from a lecture in quantum mechanics from Richard Feynman.  I typically laugh at clowns for being the clowns they are.  The notion Walsh is a Democrat is laughable, just probably every  take you have, political or otherwise.
But... why didn’t Trump give him his Hydroxychloroquine
He went to a Trump Rally without a mask and got Covid19 how is this BLM fault
Wait he died from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally 👀 I wonder what excuse Trump will have this time... last time he said his friend should have lost weight
It would seem this experiment would Trump AG Barr opinion wouldn't it?
that’s how it works. This situation is primed  what prevails is the hopeful attitude of those who are protesting who look to vote trump out dismantle his and republican policy
Obama fought for what he believed in and would not back down.  Trump does the same thing.  Mitt, rolled over, and still does whenever the Leftist press put pressure on him.
You mean conman.  Not businessman.  Lmao it's funny that people like you even still exist I'm not sure if its dishonesty or stupidity but to almost every human being on this planet besides a small % of clowns in this country know what Trump is.  It's sad, I feel bad for you.
You Starting to realize you've aligned yourself with actual criminal scum traitors?  Is it dawning now Adam?  Just a bit? A shred of realization of what You have promoted, because believe me if Trump slides us into fascism, this tweet doesn't eliminate the last several years.

In 2008 President Bush quipped that he’d rather be FDR than Hoover during his economic crisis.   President Trump has arguably replaced Hoover as a warning on how not to handle an economic crisis.
Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.

Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.

It is so funny to read the apologists' comments about why this hasn't been done sooner.  My favorites are, "it's Trump's fault that Nancy didn't use her authority sooner".  You guys crack me up!

This is about as clear as it gets why we need President Trump out of office mostly from his own mouth and tweets! My personal opinion.
Given the views you’ve expressed about the judiciary and women in 9”office, etc, I’m curious - how was it that it took Trump’s nomination to make you leave the GOP? I’d have thought you’d have left long before that.  Serious question, not snarky.
Sure build one next to a Trump Tower!!

I find it extremely hard to believe Trump when he says, “I’ve read a lot about hydroxychloroquine”. The man doesn’t read his own daily briefings! Actually, he doesn’t read at all! There is no way in hell he is reading the chemistry break down of hydroxychloroquine!Trump was the only high profile person who came forward back in the early 2000s to help the FBI with the case against Epstein
This post was from a Covid 19 support group.  This person does not support Trump (I do). It goes to show you this drug works on Democrats, not just us Republicans.

Its actually true. Those are not even their kids. This was all set up by rich ppl long ago and the Bush administration. They were crooked. Its honestly why Trump matters so much. Why would they do this to someone unless he had a lot of dirt on them
She works for the cartel. There is just so much people dont know about what's going on and they all throw shit at Trump and blame him. 6 months ago I hated Trump. The media! Well, I have more power than the media!! Its called my finger tips

I dont care what Trump has done. They are both crooks. Only one has been here only 3.5 yrs and the other has been sniffing everyone for almost 50 yrs!! Joe has never done anything, except pass laws to put more black ppl in jail. Facts
Election games used to make Trump look bad and to get rid of them so they can go back to crooked business as usual! Those tariffs were fucking with all the illegal money coming back in. Clintons money was getting taxed way too much!!
Perhaps President Trump should suggest that ALL VOTING BE DONE BY MAIL! Then the Dimocrats would insist that ALL VOTING BE IN PERSON!!!!
If Obama or Clinton hasd EVER said anything close to what Trump said, would it be considered “a joke” by Cornyn and the rest of the complacent Republicans?!?
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn’t leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
Tru! Why did they release the virus!! To make Trump look bad and incompetent. All I know if before China and The Democrats released their elections weapon  Was killing it statistically!! Media made me hate Trump! Well. We have weapons too! Its called the internet

If Trump had acted sooner, we wouldn't be in this mess and many lives would have been saved
my close friend (from like middle school) and coworker (we also worked together) was a trump supporter lol. i don’t think they all racist 💀 cus she wasn’t lol she never said anything derogatory or hurtful. we always had a good time.
I take offense to that. I’m born &amp; bred  Texan. Love my state. R we full of idiotic people? Hell, yes. Just like every other state in these United States. But let me tell you, there are plenty of us sensible folks who want to kick trump to the curb. We ain’t all gohmerts!

what evidence of current rioting “every night” have you actually seen? because there aren’t actually videos proving that. it’s just what you’re told. trump just deployed those federal pigs because he wants control. he wants quiet. not justice.
“'It can only be my personality, that’s all,' Trump said at a news conference where he lamented his plunging popularity."  I can tell you right now, personality is just half of it, big dawg. 😂😂😂  So weak...
Hmmm, so another branch on the tree of despair for the Dems to exploit. Results from their insane lockdown orders that they will now blame on Trump in order to scare people into voting for them! Well we are not falling for it! Vote Red and let’s Make America Great Again!
No or a chance to blame Trump for anything!
TDS has gotten so out of hand with the Dems that they will embrace anything to cause disruption in this country in the attempt to defeat Trump! It’s time we get back to American values and put all the petulant kids in their place !
I want to kick that food blister square in his condescending ass. Our elected officials are a colossal failure. President Trump please continue to expose the swamp rats.
Yes it does! The hatred the Dems have for Trump has always exceeded any concern they have for America. They don’t care who they hurt and all the while they still try and blame Trump for what they are doing.
Trump derangement syndrome can cost you your life if you allow the left to exploit your common sense!
That’s exactly how Trump became president.
Sweetheart,  fascism is a type of politics. It can't be applied to private companies. Here,  let me do it correctly for you. Donald Trump is a fascist who is trying to bring fascism to America. Understand now?
and on a larger scale anyone that enables President Trump and his goons. everyone needs to get out and vote against this administration and his enablers. don’t just talk about how fucked the system is, go make change on election day.
Just saw a Trump 2020 ad that showed footage of fires and looting with the tag line, "You won't be safe in Biden's America".  LOL!!!  Yeah, that's actually footage of TRUMP'S America!  That's on YOUR watch, big dawg. 😂😂😂
You are correct. This is Trump respecting Lewis’ wishes. But you know the left. Any stupid thing they can come up with to whine about.
They’d criticize President Trump no matter what he would do.

Trump is lying in state of North Carolina. There's that.
This video needs to go viral until Trump brings this Dr to the press conferences!
Sounds like our situation in the USA, Trump funneling money and contracts to all his cronies.
You gotta do something to compete against Eric Trump
Anything and Everything Trump does Democrats think up a reason that it’s wrong, and outside of presidential power. Using basic laws of average it’s impossible for Democrats to be more than 50% correct. Even less than 50% when intentional! However; they’re 100% soreheads!
Yes he is, and if the idiots keep burning stuff down they won’t have anything left when Trump wins in November. 😂😂
Actually more of a presentation of the Trump Administration and how it's going to end
Yes they are! They want Trump to react and in so be able to blame him for the outcomes!

The more President Trump tries to stop these domestic terrorists, the more bitching and whining the liberals do.  It’s all a plan...and people are too stupid to see.
Ugh..,Trump did more for black Americans than any president other than Lincoln...but you already know that and are lying. 😡 SMDH
I agree with everything said about trump but, in fairness, just about anything operated by the federal government regardless of President is shit quality. Lol
No worries. I’ve been on twitter for so long and have never been in twitter jail until I started following Trump supporters like myself. It’s craziness!! Thank you!! 💙❤️🇺🇸

Lawd this plug from  talking about how will Trump or Biden lead us out of this moment......can Biden rise to the moment &amp; compete against Trumps skillful use of media.  100 days out &amp; here we go.
Support it, yes. But more importantly, these are not protests. This is declared war. However, I do understand that these Marxist terrorists WANT us military to come in so they can call Trump a dictator.
I don't understand how you have footage of trump saying that.  said it was a "complete and total lie" when Biden referenced this in a tweet. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Covid_19 #LiarInChief
I have a joke about Trump's love of potatoes. But he's really just a dick-tater.
No. That’s a line we cannot cross. Voluntarily, fine. Mandatory injection of a NEW drug, many effects unknown, is wrong. Trump said he would take the first dose or last. Let politicians take it first. I have underlying conditions.
It was 7.8 at the heart of it! Not on the coast! The coast experienced a 5.1 at max. Texas is experiencing 5ft of storm surge, not 12ft. If you're not a Democrat, but want to kill Trump, what are you, a communist?
The Nation is fed up to they’re ears watching these Democratic Mayors make fools of themselves while ruining our Country. After all the Country belongs to all of it’s people. Blaming Trump is insanity. Democratic leaders are acting insane.
1. There was no tsunami in Alaska. 2. That is a category 1 hurricane in Texas. It isn't Irma. 3. Stop making all Democrats look bad by saying, "Execute Trump."

I don't know who that Trump-supporting clown was you had on this morning, but you set his arse on fire!!!
Every Democrat who was anybody at all was in on the attempted coup of President Trump as far back as 2016. These Democrats were and are the most obstructing deep state gang of politicians ever to step foot in our Country. The country will clean house in 2020!!!
I re:listened to John Lewis’s speeches demanding President Trumps impeachment. Everything he accused Trump of has been proven false. It’s not John Lewis fault. It was a Democratic talking point. He was a follower! Not a leader re: these talking points!

100% of the time.  Trump earns my vote every single day he fights the liberal bull shit on behalf of the American people.

I don’t like Trump. However, all “scandals” aren’t created equal. I’m old enough to remember “terrorist fist bumps”, tan suit gate, etc. It comes with the job of being the most powerful politician on earth. Trump whines/lies too much. Period
What did Obama do to the military? Do tell 🤔 He gave them the tools in Iraq they hadn’t had. He expanded drone warefare to put them at less risk. He fought for and passed the Choice Act of 2014 (the one Trump reupped and now claims he passed). This is interesting 🤔
I’m around military people constantly. All of my friends are either brats or former military. Home to me is Ft Hood. My family was represented in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. Most despise Trump. Shall I tag some? They see this very different than you 🤷🏾‍♂️

Trumps lack of a response is his fault. Trump not paying attention to his briefings is his fault. Trump not telling Putin there will be retaliation is his fault. Who are you blaming if not him? 🤔
It’s a thing if you understand Trump and his long standing ties to Russian organized crime. Again, everything isn’t political. I oppose the right because I was raised in a normal conservative environment. These people are not that. They are fascists.

Wh says you?  Trump kicked Epstein out of Margo resort area.   Lawyer for some of the victims said that President Trump was the only high profile person to actually want to help in 2009.  Get over it. You liberals will not continue to bash our President.
If Trump suspended democracy altogether tomorrow, you'd be the first person here telling us that democracy is a hoax. You're already cool with suspending habeas corpus and delaying elections.
We all kind of knew Trump wouldn't go quietly.
is killing it. Night after night with well articulated and vicious takedowns of Trump. Keep fighting, brother.
Sounds like someone with that level of concern would have some studies proving fraud. I wonder why Trump won't tweet those?  You're totally cool with governors administrating their own elections, disenfranchising millions, and gerrymandering by racial boundaries though.
What if it really came to that? We have established that Trump has no regard for the law and there are GOP senators that refuse to hold him accountable  What if Trump really tried to delay the election-who would be there to stop him?
Meh...better than what we have is a very low bar to clear...these cats all disappointed us in various ways as heads of state; but they were there - they did some work and we’d be better off both sans Trump and sans puppets of the corrupt establishment

To me, it boils down to what limits the feds ability to dictate to me. Under trump = a vibrate strong economy and military. Biden ?

163 consecutive months of job growth. A decreasing deficit under Obama. Trump's continuation of that growth was a drunken party on a credit card - exploding deficits, mushrooming national debt and a decided decrease in environmental protections. I'm done.

You mean like the crazy outrageous shit Trump tweets every single day?  Apparently the election delay thing was just to make our heads spin? Real productive with 3 separate apocalypses and a wave of hurricanes...  #Trumpageddon
Oy vey. Outrage, outrage, outrage. You’re exhausting and your opinions are drivel.
Because why? "Illegal aliens" means those legally slaves to their overseas embassy. They picked hillary too. They lead the Trump rallies in matagorda too. As proudest sadaam Hussein dynasty. So why are real "illegal aliens" complex in terms of their overseas embassies?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Are you going with the proud Sadaam Hussein dynasty led boats for Trump in Matagorda for Elfants pedophiles staff? Sadaam Hussein's dynasty line there is screaming that all Republican candidates have to be L. Ron Hubbard DNA only. Nikki Haley insists too only the DNA of Hubbard.
Starting late October, everyone send Trump $1 in the mail. Y’all know that bitch is so pinche he’ll keep the post offices open just to collect his dollars! #fucktrump
All Trump needs to do is link Biden to Epstein ... 🤣🤣
Today:  - Trump threatens to delay election - Benefits expiring - Worst GDP drop ever - John Lewis funeral/Obama eulogy - Herman Cain &amp; Harvey Updyke died - Maxwell depos implicate Dershowitz - DHS intel on journalists - Flynn goes en banc  2020 is officially crazier than 1968.
I should clarify - important that this particular person is pushing back against Trump.
Think I lost 5 followers for stating I was considering voting for trump because I hate America. I don’t think I could bring myself to hit that button to be honest. Biden is a lesser evil. I just don’t want the DNC to think they can pull this shit forever!!
Did you take out the $1.7 billion for an FBI bldg across from Trump Tower?
You think Dems don't turn on bad guys in our party? We didn't force Al Franken out? You voted for Trump knowing he was a pussy-grabber.
The COVID-19 virus unleashed upon us by Trump’s corrupt mismanagement is the biological parallel of an equally destructive epidemic his sadistic nature has fostered. Fear, anger, &amp; greed, all in their way as contagious as any virus, and as dangerous, destroys our social compact.
I can’t believe what I’m seeing, and more importantly, who I’m seeing it from.   Trump is screwed.
You are a fool. Trump himself votes by mail. Didn’t know that did you? it’strue
Remember that picture of Trump, Melania, Maxwell and Naomi Campbell?
And when did the CDC begin diverting numbers to the White House?   Trump lied about being invited to throw a baseball pitch for the NY Yankees. You better believe he'll lie about COVID19 deaths heading into the election.
I bet Trump is “sad”
Wishing his family peace and comfort.  So many have tragically died for no other reason then trump's stupidity.
Watch you're language! You're insulting mentally disabled people with that comment! Besides, we both know mentally disabled people are way way smarter than Trump supporters
ICYMI from    Texas Republicans tell President Trump "no" after he calls for delaying the November election — something he's not legally able to do  #txlege #coronavirus
Individual responsibility. How frightening. Why can’t we all just say trump pinned him down and injected the virus into his lungs? Isn’t that what the left thinks anyway?
USPS will be lucky to make it.  trump does not want mail-in ballots.  He will do whatever it takes.
NOBODY. ONLY TRUMP.
Not to mention the embezzlement and pilfering of campaign money into Trump Inc. that are draining the fund.
There is NO serious election fraud, that includes ballot harvesting. If there were, don’t you think your Dear Leader wouldn’t have dissolved his voter fraud task force?? Ooops.
Ditto. Spreading misinformation about a political election; discouraging participation by voters. Whenever it happens, report it. Trump has done it a lot.
I hate Obama... better than Trump but not by much. Also that’s just deflecting. Do you really think a budget 3x the size of second place is for defense?...
Did anyone else notice the way Americans talk about the end of the Trump administration in the same way Churchill talked about WW2?
Shut up! Trump's got blood on his hands.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leader of the President’s coronavirus task force disagrees:
That’s a fact. Hoover, Bush, Trump did the same thing. Deregulate and let the economy go at full speed until it implodes
Really this is your NON-FACTUAL cause of Covid infection headline? You are a piece of SH?T  “Herman Cain, ex-presidential candidate who refused to wear mask, dies after COVID-19 diagnosis” at Trump Rally.
TRUMP : IF I WIN, EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL, HAPPY, ......OK BUT IF I LOST : THIS IS SHAME FOR AMERICA, THIS IS HORRIBLE, HOOO MY GOOD ......LIKE A PAMPERED CHILD....
Yeah. When it's Trump's time, that approach would make for a quick-as-a-flash funeral service.   So I guess I can see why #Fishsticks  is upset about the precedent President Obama has set. 😏
Trump is at fault. He should be ousted. We hate him for damaging 🇺🇲. We want to save 🇺🇲.
I heard what you said about H. Cain and Trump having blood on his hands, your brother has the real blood on his hand #nursinghomes
A border wall is headed for Laredo—and the only thing likely to stop it is time.
Reagan asked are you better off than you were 4 years ago?  Biden can ask, are we better off now than we were 4 months ago. More than 150 thousand dead, 3x Vietnam war losses, our economy reduced by one third. We did not make America great again under Trump, we made America less.
They are going to win. Tired of being ignored by my representatives.  Tired of Trump's racist, hate filled, incoherent rants. Sickened by your blind loyalty to Trump.  You're  supposed to serve Texas not Trump.  You  let Trump insult family . Now you kiss his ass.
No mask!
Trump killed him
WASHINGTON - In a rare moment in the Trump era, several Texas Republicans pushed back against President Donald Trump on Thursday when he floated in a tweet  #atx #austin #all512
Question: Have you genuinely thought about leaving the country if trump gets re-elected?
The power to remove Trump from office.
“To some degree” is the key there. What Trump is referring to is mass vote by mail, where ballots are automatically mailed to everyone in the registry - not to those who request it. If states had time to update their systems this would be great.
Questions that were obviously not on Trump's cognitive test.  I'll start Dolt is to idiot as vote by mail is to A) Lost in the mail B) Defund the post office C) Absentee ballot D) Well let me tell you, I am the greatest dolt in the world

I absolutely believe the election should be held on schedule. And I go after Trump frequently. I have also seen Ds make outrageous statements, virtually as bad as this. Have you ever corrected a D president and tagged the Party on it? Tell me about it.
Actually, yes. The staff-written tweets don’t share Trump’s curious capitalization standards.
Absolutely! Trump has no interest in doing the job he sought but only wants to use it any way he can for personal benefit.
Stuff I don’t wanna see on the TL  - Any support for the Lincoln Project. Every Republican before Trump was still awful.  - Praising politicians for obvious career ambitions. Idc who... if they don’t explicitly step up to kick establishment ass, then they’re self absorbed hacks.
And while Trump has been doing photo-ops and tweeting rather than addressing the COVID-19 pandemic this happened. GDP dropped 32.9%.   Worst  in  history.
I miss when we had REAL Presidents.  Pres. Obama, Pres. Bush and Pres. Clinton.  Now we have cheeto trump...killing us.
Why did Donald Trump wish mega child molester Ghislaine Maxwell “WELL” - twice within 5 minutes??
Except that's what Trump does.
If only the media and Democrats hadn’t tried to ruin the perception of #Hydroxychloroquine just to “get Trump”. It works. How many people died because of their politics?
TRUMP is the only person to give up his salary.   We have 446 former members of Congress who receive government pensions who are lobbyist on both sides of aisle.   Does that make any sense? NO. We even have people in prison who receive pensions.   We need to end this madness.
Trump may have been elected but he has never actually stepped up to become president.
1. Biden isn’t a dictator. Im a Bernie supporter 💯 and not a Biden fan but trump has caused more death than Biden could. I was on the not voting Biden train till covid. We can’t do another 4 years under trump. Democracy won’t survive here and you know it.
The Trump monkey paw curse means that the Democrats will seek to delay the election at some point.
Oh, isn't that mitch a great guy; sticking his neck out like that; taking a chance of pissing off trump. 😜Dump Trump...Ditch Mitch...VOTE!!!
I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that "his staff" tweeted this batshit death cult insanity  Die for Trump to own the libs
Kind of disappointed that  still give Ramona a shot when shens clearly a Trump supporter. 😒 #RHONY #WWHL
Same, vote for who you want. Im almost over all this politics shit when it comes to Trump.
I’ve considered creating a site that misattributes Trump’s bile to Obama just to see how fast it would get picked up by conservative sites, but then I worry it would be laundered by those same conservative sites and end up the getting The New York Times both-sides treatment
I haven’t heard one Republican today agree with Trump’s tweet re: changing the Election Day. I hope this is as significant as it feels.
If your voting for Trump  I can't with you. And I ask how can you???? I can  have friends that are Republican of course, but I just can't have friends that will vote for Trump again.   Reposted from
I'm sure you're mad that Trump is trynna delay an election right? Or what's going on in Portland?
But she called it a republican hoax, right? Of course she made fun of trump, everybody makes fun of trump. He's a clown. We elected a man with no political experience, no previous employment, no military service, as POTUS. A vainglorious braggart and bully.
I'm serve myself an abundance of 🍔McDonald's🍔🍟🥤. Trump gets 💩.
If he doesn’t leave we have few choices... we either fight. Or we leave. Trump is a dictator following the fascist playbook. We want democracy back... look how we have had to make other countries democratic. Gonna have to do the same for the USA now.
If Trump "orders" $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All, this family will give him 5 votes.
Trump and the rule of law is an oxymoron. Even if you did ignore abuse, I thought you were smarter than this.
Trump is responsible for every Covid death because he refused to act when he first found out about it. Period!
"He can't do that" has never stopped him before. Let me ask you, if Trump really did play this card, who has the power to stop him? And would they actually do it?
correction, after trump/biden
I wonder.... do you think trump ever goes back to the residence and thinks to himself, "Boy, I really shouldn't have said that."
Hey Chip, not really trying to help you but  When Trump loses the Federalist Society, I mean come on man  Read the plan was to wait till the end of August, but somebody needs to call this game   America needs you in this fight  Our Democracy needs you
Trump people always on some other shit every day
I agree. However, the Trump, Pence, Biden, (Pelosi), Schumer gang does not bode well with your desire.  They control the politics/power.  That’s the problem.  Dem  “answer” is a rich old white man who has been in the political system forever. Where is the progressive movement?
"Those who produce" = essential workers "Those who refuse to produce" = landlords "Those who complain" = Trump and his whiny followers, I'd say

You are really twisting what I wrote. Tell me, what did you think about Idi Amin’s reign of terror? Trump is on his way to do worse. The rally was like a Jonestown event. I’m not happy about anyone’s death, quite the opposite. I am angry Trump let this happen.
So, Dems forced Trump to hold his last rally and made Herman go to it without a mask? Can you find that clip of Nancy saying it will go away like a miracle? All those libs discrediting Dr. Fauci? Calling the virus a hoax? I'll wait.
"  “If I can help you out with the funeral, I’ll help you out, financially, I’ll help you,” Trump said."  Trump reacting to this the same way he reacts to one of his flings turning up pregnant.
When you hear people say "Vote blue no matter who." - it's not that they're being flippant about the issue. It's that we desperately need a way out of Trump's reality.
⁦ calls trump a “man” and calls himself a Democrat. He’s wrong on both counts. trump is a weak man’s idea of a strong man.
No Damon. This is about Trump wins and when far left riots.  YOU and ALL DEMS SAY go break them in half.
Evict Trump, bone spurs, Kremlin Annex, Putin's puppet, Impeach 45, Reeeeeeeeesist, little hands, cheetos, Orange Man Bad, pumpkin lies, hamberders, ETC. Just blah, blah like spoiled children throwing an eternal fit, you think they'd get tired.
Too bad the trump disdain for reality killed him.
Take your Anti- American BS somewhere else. You are behind and Trump will crush Biden.   The Democrats are evil and America knows it.
Not here to play backgammon with the Democrats or Republicans   Americans &amp; Trump need to shit or get off the pot and stop this tit for tat game with these poser in Government and these riots freaks it not a show &amp; tell   This inst LIFE   This reminds me of a dam game show
" “Well, I saw this on one of the shows recently, and I was just looking, and it hit me very hard,” Trump said."  Really?  No one in your administration thought to mention this case to you?
We will be delivering our mail-in ballots in person.  I trust USPS carriers but Trump's new USPS bootlicker is already slowing down the mail.  This election is too important for any mishaps.
That’s not fair -  took time to explain that Trump was just kidding...
Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST! Trump is a FASCIST!
And our Trump GOP elected officials     and the rest of the Texas Republican delegation back this DHS activity. #ETTD
If you have to ask for it, that is being processed like an absentee. When Trump talks about “mail in voting”, he is referring to mass mailing to everyone registered to vote, without their requesting it.
I believe in vaccinations too. They saved my life when I was a foreign service brat, living in third world countries.  That said, no way do I trust any vaccine coming from the Trump administration.  I'll wait until WHO or the EU endorses a vaccine.
NO! Senator McConnell &amp; Rep McCarthy, leaders of your party, recognized that Trump was talking about postponing an election he is losing badly. Of course, Trump has no power to do this. And leading elected Republicans think it was stupid, statement. Why are you defending it?
All bets are off until Trump whines about it. Depends on if he sticks to the script or not. If he's feeling left out in the cold, he may just go into a full tantrum and not approve anything except his executive orders anymore.
AOC is the second politician that spends the most on FB ads, only after Trump
if you think Biden is worse than Trump you don't know anything above stupid
Howdy handful of people that follow me. Voting by mail isn't going to work. It really easy for Trump's hand picked Post Master General (What's his name?) to compromise them. Lots of ways to make a mail in vote not count. Lots.  We should accept this now.
How is bringing politics into it on point?  ESPN is owned by Disney which is a huge conglomerate that is very conservative.  Most of their product  is not liberal. Now go back to being a great H-town fan and Dad.  You're a lot better a those than whining like Trump.
So glad to have your confirmation even though it was never needed... I think our constitution is pretty clear here. Now on the whole conspiracy pushing, there is ONLY one candidate who promotes that - Trump.
Trump threatens Democracy as we know it! #EvictTrump
Will You have a Republican Convention? If Not. Is it because Trump listening to his radical, Right Wing Donors?
We can't vote by mail.  Trump's compromised it.   He's installed a William Barr like Post Master General.   There's all sorts of arcane rules as to which mail in ballots count and which don't.  All of which fall under the purview of the Post Master.
Let me go to your house and steal your ballot and place a vote for Trump and mail it it in. You can’t argue you didn’t vote, they received it. Especially if you don’t like who your neighbor is voting for. How does that look for you? As a registered voter I refuse to allow this!

#CowardCornyn, Trump's most prolific and consistent apologist, tries to convince reporters and himself the president was joking about delaying the election. Trump was serious.   is not. He is a shell of a man and lacks any principles.
What I’m gathering is that a e shouldn’t vote for Donald Trump or Bill Clinton in November. Sounds good.
Yep, the plan is to get a Trump big donor to lead the postal service and then have him drive it into the ground and then blame it for being inefficient and then move forward to privatize it

Trump only has the power to delay the election if we let him.
Trump has never, and this is true, owned a pet, let alone a dog. Think about that.
Uh, did you actually pay attention to anything those guys did? We were already well on the way to fascism way before Trump came along, and they all helped.
The current Post Master General has one job. Suppress the mail in vote.  Trump's going to win reelection if we vote by mail. We're going to have to go out to the polls.  It's not right. But it's true.
Trump literally never even said the word bleach. Yet here you are calling other people ignorant. You’re a joke.

Don't forget the Kennedy Center honors.   What happened to them? I guess Trump killed them too.   ETTD!
That is, if you haven’t already died from the #TrumpVirusCatastrophe   Eating Pizza is a great way to forget that Donald Trump is a sociopathic conman who’s responsible for the deaths of over 160,000 Americans due to his ignorance, incompetence, and lack of compassion.
Any 3rd party candidate in 2020 had even the tiniest shred of decency, intelligence, or class, they would drop out &amp; encourage their supporters to suck it up &amp; vote for Joe Biden, b/c Trump &amp; the GOP are existential threats to this nation.  It's telling none have done so. (2/2)
So, I'm reminded of how the VP choice for 3rd Party candidate Gary "What is Aleppo" Johnson come out just before the election and told everyone to vote for Hillary, because Trump was an existential threat to the country.  He showed real intelligence and class with that. (1/2)

Yeah, this is less a "Come to Jesus" moment and more like the next step in the original plan.  Someone was probably chosen to be their new leader a while ago. Now they will step up and lead the party on an anti-Trump course correction, and pray it's enough to keep the party alive
Over the past 20 years there’s been .00006% cases of fraud in all mail-in ballots cast in presidential elections. Trump wants to delay the election because he knows he has a .00006% chance of winning.
Lol, give us fake tRump? That will work I’m sure of it.
Yes, we will crack open some trump vodka, grill some trump steaks, stare for a moment at our diploma from trump U, then catch a trump shuttle to Atlantic City to gamble at one of his fine casinos. Like that.

do you and the  have anything lined up this year to air if/when Trump drops another "October Surprise"?
I’m offended that Trump is front of the Texas Flag. He is anything but Texan or could care less about Texas.
#maddow  is right - the election doesn't have to be delayed for Trump to interfere with it. He, his boss Vlad and all the people raking in $ absolutely will do everything they can to ratfck the election. All of his allies will purge voter rolls, close polling places,
So...just abolish rules that don’t serve our interests? Sounds totally fair. What happens when the other side wants to get rid of rules that don’t benefit them? Hasn’t Trump been doing this his entire term?
This was always the plan.  Someone was probably designated a long time ago to be their new Figurehead when Trump ultimately destroyed the party. Now that the new internal polls are out, II expect that alarm just went off.
Just a bunch of #MAGAMorons on their way to infecting each other.  You can’t fix stupid, but you can bury it...

I wouldn't worry about it. Trump is just talking out of his big orange a$$ again.

... and the 150,000+ Americans who died from Trump’s Virus!
It is too little too late in my opinion.   After all of Trump's Constitutional abuses, this tweet is what caused him to pull his support?  Absurd...more like looking for an excuse to jump ship now that Trump is likely to lose.
Why would people who are just voting to get Trump out care to watch a Biden rally? And if rally size mattered at all wouldn't Bernie have won the dem nom?
Stuff like this has been going on for decades. It does a disservice to the gravity of the issues we face when people blame everything on Trump.
Anyone "undecided" is voting Trump
It's shameful that none of Trump's other unconstitutional acts have bothered him.    This reeks of fear that Trump's stench won't wash off.  Everyone that conveniently looked away from Trump's myriad of abuses b/c of tax cuts for the 1% &amp; rightwing judges will be stained forever.
Obama just gave Trump the election. better than Hillary's deplorable moment!!! played the race card again!!! asshole!
I will not trust any vaccine that trump and this administration has it's grubby hands in.
Trump is also super vocal ab it because sex trafficking is something that isn’t partisan, everyone can agree sex trafficking is evil. So he realized by having a unifying enemy he might look better if he looks to be combatting it  I mean he’s not  But still

Biden’s the Dems/Liberal/Progressives/Socialist, or whatever the party is called now Bitch!    Trump 2020 🇺🇸
Trump was always only ever a useful idiot. Destructive sleight-of-hand while McConnell did their real work. This was always going to be their endgame. Milk Trump for everything, damn the consequences, cry before the election and pray it's enough to keep their party alive.
Trump became vocal + reminded people realized there’s a global slave trade and with creeps in supermarket everyone is assuming they’re traffickers bc they see it in the news more often, and w sex work becoming more visible people try to link the two and think it’s more prelevant
This is true in some states but most states, including Florida, you do not have to offer a reason to get a ballot. According to  President Trump was in Florida during early voting and could have voted in person
Trump now thinks he is invisible? Mr. President have you been eating bath salts again?
I think they were working on some evil shit to use on Hong Kong protestors. Tested but not what they wanted. Got out. They chose to have the world suffer if they were going to suffer. Possibly on purpose to hurt Trump and get rid of millions of their elderly. China is a mess.

Shadow work is excruciating, which is why most will never engage in it.  Just ask anyone whose done serious psychonaut work.  Toward that end, this article is spot on.

They’re being sarcastic bc voter shaming is lame and you should try shaming people in power to be worth voting for or doing more to earn our votes rather than brow beating people who don’t wanna replace trump w the stuff that got us trump. Biden is not a solution to our problems
But to Trump's point, neither of those crises were as severe or malicious as CNN's treatment of him.
Where was Trump’s “buddy”  - thrown under the bus, as usual. Playing catch-up as always
Ew no it’s a candidate’s job to earn people’s votes, it is not our fault Obama was a well spoken republican-lite who sold us out and gave us Mitt Romney’s healthcare plan, or that Hillary was so bad she lost to trump. The onus is on THEM to earn ppl’s votes to win, not us

Trump effectively brushed back mail in voting.  Everyoen stands in line on Tuesday the sacred day.
At least now we know for sure that trump will not accept the outcome of the election when he loses.  OK, we will just have to drag him out of the White House kicking and screaming.
Trump knows HE would cheat if he could so he assumes everybody else would, too.  He doesn't understand that 72% of the country are 1000 times better people than he is.
But even this is unlikely. Trump's overarching goal I think, if he loses (which is likely), is to delegitimize the result. Country &amp; stability be damned if he can manufacture a claim he's been wronged.
So much for Trump's "secure phonecalls." He must be our enemies' dream POTUS. No need for any sophisticated listening equipment because everyone can hear him shouting on his phone!

There’s no way that this is any authentic awakening about Trump’s fascism. The Federalist Society has read the polling and realizes that GOP may really truly get creamed in November, and is desperately trying to find some way to get Trump off the ballot.

Q. What the difference between Donald Trump and a bag of 💩?  A. The bag.
The intermediate step, as Trump would argue, is that if the ECollege can't select a winner (much depends on the 12th A.'s interpretation), then the House, the current one, would pick. Trump would win because each state would get one vote.

And if Trump were to try to "order a delay," it will take SCOTUS less than 24 hours to say "That's up to Congress." Roberts would never hold otherwise. Presidents, unlike Prime Ministers, don't get to set election dates. Too much potential for abuse.

This is the most dishonest thing I've read today.  Congratulations, you are a lying hack.  Trump rhetorically asked: "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote?"  The obvious implication is that all voting should be postponed until the election...

And yet I have received these emails for several days, and have seen her post on Twitter about "our" program to fix the country post-Trump. I don't think you should count her out just yet.

Did Trump grab your p*ssy too?
Now’s a Great Time!! Trump  has NO CHANCE of winning!!!   #TrumpLies #COVID19 #MishandlingBadly   #Biden2020
I can’t stand Trump, but there IS a difference. An absentee ballot must be requested by the voter. Mail in ballots would be mailed out to all registered voters.
Trump is the worst example of our species. But sometimes I think the only thing that can save America is a precipitous fall from power and we discover we're not who we thought we were, not exceptional, not the Greatest Country Ever in the World, but a place that needs fixing
Yes. On days like this that's about what I can muster without my head exploding.  Trump is a crazy person.
Trump votes by mail  Florida does not have absencentee ballots they have vote by mail
Jokes gonna be on them when Trump kicks Mike and mother out and makes Nikki his veep
No I gave you plenty of answers. Be easy on Trump. He’s gonna win and do great things. Take care bud
WTF? Trump doesn't have friends. He is only sad that legally he can't sex up his daughter.  That's it.  That's his only regret in life.
Hey  You're wrong, #Trump wasn't joking about postponing election.  He just needed something in the news cycle to detract from President Obama, a true leader, delivering the eulogy at the funeral of John Lewis. #Trump has to have all the attention, all the time. Sad/
Trump holds a ‘Coronavirus’ briefing, BUT is talking about mail-in ballots.   #RemoveTrump2020
If there’s any doubt that Trump will do whatever he can to hold onto power after losing the election, this press conference should dispel it for you
Trump: “we all agree that absentee ballots are good but mail in ballots will be the greatest fraud”  Also Trump: Half a dozen eggs are good, but six eggs are bad
Trump is responsible for the deaths of every American that thought COVID was a hoax. If he had just soberly and factual reported what he was told about it in secret meetings, significantly less people would have gone on for months thinking it was fake.
Unlike Trump, Cain wasn't in meetings with the experts getting facts about the virus. He, like others on the right, got info from right wing media, who were parroting Trump's lies about it. The media and leaders that he trusted lied to him, but why should he not have believed it?
The thing that is missing from the Herman Cain commentary is the realization that he was effectively murdered by Donald Trump.   Cain, like every other conservative in this country, was the victim of the media propaganda surrounding COVID. He had no way to believe it was real.
"Trump breaks laws. It is what he does."
If you have a shred of integrity or decency, please remove Trump now.
For those not watching this disastrous press conference,trump is just rambling incoherently and lying so there that covers it
“John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.” — President Obama  This is what this moron thinks is divisive even though Trump announced his segregation policy yesterday?
I feel selfish for even worrying about the pandemic given my grandma just died.  I do.  But I'm about to go into Trump territory where no one takes it seriously and I'll be around lots of people, traveling,  etc  Its just....fuck this year
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
There is really no other way to look at it. Trump is an insecure, weak, orange-stained buffoon. And, as  put it, Trump is the biggest piece of shit on earth.
My vote didn’t go to Trump in 2016, but the man thought I “listened” to and supported him because I follow him on Twitter.   He’s the President of the United States.  Regardless of what I, or anyone else, think(s), his opinions matter and are being misrepresented ALL THE TIME.
So.. What is Trump trying to distract us from with his postpone the election tweet?   What news are we missing?
Trump is going full bore into discrediting an election that is still three months away
Seems to be this:
The trump briefing compared to this morning’s eulogy in terms of eloquence and credibility is...oh never mind
First question to Trump is about delaying the election and it doesn’t sound like he’s “joking”
Correction. Americans say keeping Donald Trump as prez causes "more deaths" by coronavirus. Now, that's better.
Trump says democrats are obstructing aid to American workers  The house passed a bill back in May   #MoscowMitch and trump have dithered and now they can’t even agree among themselves
Well, first of all, he probably wouldn't be allowed in the country, which suddenly gives me a brilliant idea! We can ship his remains to Russia! Putin is a harsher and smarter sociopath than Trump. Once Trump is no longer useful, he'll use another GOP member to achieve his goals.
Obama publicly shamed DT that one time over his birther foolishness, and Trump cannot handle being criticized whatsoever let alone roasted to a crisp by a black president. Tearing down everything Obama did is in large part due to that weenie roast. 🔥🔥#thanksobama 😉
Does that include Michael Flynn?  Or, Roger Stone?   Do you really care about the Rule of Law.  No. You are a fake and a hypocrite!   TX-21 needs a real leader not a carpet-bagging Trump toadie.    2020 #VoteBlue2020
Or he could have caught it any other time he was in public. You know you can catch this virus at places other than Trump rallies right
It's tragic. I am sorry he listened to trump.  I wish his family peace and comfort.
Oh yeah you don't just get to stay until there's a new guy. Trump realizes that I'm sure but I doubt a lot of his more frothed at the mouth followers do.

Top Republican Officials Turn Down Trump's Idea To Delay November Election
What if postponing the election and getting impeached is his exit strategy? If he gets impeached a second time the GOP Senators are damned if they do and damned if they don't. Trump going supernova is an interesting strategy, he gets to blame the virus and Senate.
TRUMP: Election Day will be in December, or something CONGRESS: nope TRUMP: yeah ok whatever, hey MAGA, we’re gonna vote in Decembruary, got it? MAGA: GOT IT! EVERYONE ELSE: that’s not how this works...  Joe Biden wins the election in a landslide on Election Day, November 3.
If he didn’t get it at the Trump Rally that means he probably spread it at the Trump rally which is even worse Eric
I missed the start of Trump's presser. Did he mention that he killed Herman Cain?
I'm in Texas things are not coming down. #pressconference #trump # #COVID
They should toss paint balloons off Trump Tower every night.
"PLAUSE-MA" - Trump
#Trump sows discord with "delay election" BS, Pres Obama shows Americans what leadership looks like. "It is a great honor to be back at Ebenezer Baptist Church, at the pulpit of its greatest pastor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to pay my respects to perhaps his finest disciple.
Donald Trump has no idea how to pronounce the word “plasma.”
Trump is completely unhinged, can we impeach him for it?
Rudy is a washed up politician hanging on to Trump’s tailcoat for money making opportunities. He’s not all dignity and respect from the community. After Trump is gone from DC, Rudy will be lost and probably writes a book that won’t sell.
Look at the death rate amongst kids with COVID-19. It’s no different than the flu. Democrats want the kids at home so it makes it difficult for the parents to go back to work. They want to hurt the economy so it hurts Trump’s chances at winning. #COVID19
From a thing called a Trump rally.
Listening to Trump makes you dumber :fact
Apparently, repealing the Iran nuclear deal wasn't such a good idea after all. And now we have to ask the UN that Trump has insulted time and again, to fix our mistake?
could we get a prayer, prayer chain, for Biden and progressive politics? Several active for Trump, but none for Biden.
It’s hard to say it’s the Left making Trump look bad when you listen to the awful coming out of his mouth.
When trump loses in a landslide and calls the entire thing a hoax, his lawyers will hand count every ballot and try to get every single one tossed out. Also, don't let this distract you from the worst GDP in U.S History.
Nothing about his history other than former candidate. Just making sure everyone knows he was at a Trump rally and later died from the Nancy Virus. A pitiful lot they are.
“The doctor even admits its should be taken with caution. BUT YOU PUSH IT AS A CURE!! You’re full of $&amp;*(*#$$!”  And I could not stop laughing, because I’ve never heard a retired “professional,” talk the way he did. He HATED Trump, and I showed, it really did. Terrifying.
GWB and Trump are both provocateurs, different but the same. They ascended to rob from the poor and give to the rich. The intent behind their actions is less important than what they actually did. If you want to judge them, don't judge their intelligence. Judge their deeds.
Yep trump just began his presser being a racist again calling the Corona virus 'China virus' this shit is not normal
All this means is Fed Soc would rather run with Pence than Trump. If Trump is removed, Pence isn't gonna win either, but that shows what they think of Trump's chances.
you are as stupid as you look! Why don't you swig a glass of bleach while you are at it. Wake up Nacogodoches!   Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert to take hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19
Just trying to hang on and stay sane AND safe - both from Covid and Trump’s storm troopers.  We have descended into an authoritarian State run by an adderall-addicted buffoon with dementia....who is not going to leave the WH peacefully😣
The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it will not allow eligible immigrants to apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals if they are  #atx #austin #all512
THANKS PRESIDENT OBAMA🇺🇸  President Obama is getting involved to defeat Donald Trump.
Operation Safe Childhood. President Trump’s DOJ has been doing so much to protect children #Trump #Barr
Death by Trump rally. Unbelievable. All to own the libs.
Denying Trump is a wannabe dictator has always been like assuming your wife and her pilates instructor, Trevor, are just VERY GOOD FRIENDS. Sure, he bought her lingerie, but Trevor says they are for pilates only.
The total disrespect of the president and this country by the socialist demoncraps is the real crap. The Democrat party has done zero for this country over the last 2 years, except to try and remove Trump and it hasn't worked yet. What's the plan after Nov 3rd when that fails?
It's not going to take Team Trump and the GOP to see who gets blamed for this.
Bless your heart. Trump can’t talk. He is illiterate and uses small vocabulary. With Biden’s stutter challenge, he is more articulate on any day. Also Biden will hire smart people instead of family and scum.
on your show? Why not #Trump's new med guru, Dr. Stella Immanuel, plus  who thinks Dr. Stella is an expert on #COVID19? She can tell us about about "Holy Ghost hand grenades" &amp; how "snake penises" cause illness in the night.
We are simply going to have to decide that we do not want Trump’s America. Why is that so difficult?
Talking to a kid at eye level is profoundly respectful.   I doubt #DonaldDumbass  would ever take that courtesy when speaking to a child.
Texas will go red for President Trump 💯👍🇺🇸❤️ #TexasStrong 🤠❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
Can you tell me why Joe Biden is a good candidate without mentioning Trump?
How did Trump bungle the pandemic? There’s a very long timeline of mistakes (see below), but perhaps you could check in with Herman Cain and get his take. Oh wait you can’t because he’s dead thanks to Trump and his idiotic “don’t wear a mask” leadership.
Because President  is EVERYTHING that Trump will NEVER be. The list is endless.
Holy Shit! Trump's own cabinet is starting to die from Covid-19.
While . is laughing about trump's tweets that actually affect millions of Americans, added truly impactful stress to an already trying time, the rest of us are planning to vote for  so she can actually serve Texans as she has served America all along.
It’s good to know there’s finally a line that some Trumpsters won’t cross. It’s pitiful that we had to get this far into Trump’s fascist dream for them to notice though.
When a President Won’t Concede...
"Trump probably cannot postpone the election, the bedrock of American democracy, but the greater danger is that he can destroy its legitimacy," writes
He should also drink bleach and stop having sex with demons.
No amount of stupid Trump can't overcome.
I was going to tell a joke about Trump he does that for himself every time he talks.
If not for the cult-like atmosphere trump has created- Herman Cain might be alive today.  As well as thousands of other Americans.
Did you apologize for having a rally he went to, where he contracted the Trump virus?
🔥Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
UPDATE: The Latest: Trump urges COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma
Dana Bash :Trump is trying to distract from the economic news,which is bad ,really bad
FEC commissioner to Trump: 'No. You don't have the power to move the election'  Amen
People didn't have to die this way. People didn't need to gather to watch Trump ramble in Oklahoma. Campaigning is more important than human life to this piece of trash in the White House. As he lay dieing staffer continued to push agendas on his Twitter. #HermanCain #TrumpVirus
Wow, another triggered trump supporter bot 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
he is turning into trump
Voting by mail is NOT rife with fraud. #WeWillVote
If they are going to replace Trump the ballot they are running out of time.
So how well did the democrats take the result of the last election?  It is over 3 years and they are still fighting the results.  What is going to happen when Trump gets re-elected?  4 more years of this crap?
So according to Trump it's too dangerous to hold an election in November but perfectly fine to send our kids back to school next month.  Makes sense
You'd think Trump would be behind this, as much of a fan of the "acting" title as he is: &gt;If no newly elected president is available, the speaker of the House of Representatives becomes acting president.&lt;
I read yesterday White women in PA are still Trump fans.
My words for 2015 hopin'-for-Trump Dems were usually "careful what you wish for"
That's how people in political parties are though. They prop up people that have no business running the country.  The Democrats are doing it for Joe and Republicans are doing it for Trump.  They are both too old and their brains are shot.
Kewl Human COVID-19 Petri dish = less people voting for Trump Pence
Project Blue Beam. It's a joke and a distraction that Trump is using to feed his hyper religious crazy fanbase.  They eat that shit up like crazy.  These nuts use Religion, Aliens, and Conspiracy as a way to keep the paranoia going while they pick their wallets and destroy minds.
Too bad Trump and the right wing hadn’t started wearing masks yet.
Considering Democrats are burning their own cities? Yea, I think President Trump will win by a lot #MyPresident #NotShy
Trump owns the DOJ right now. The very fact no one from the Obama admin has been sent to jail or even interviewed should tell you the DOJ doesn't have a case.
I agree but I also see the same thing going on with Donald Trump.   there might be something to not electing presidents after their past the age of 70.  for the most part they are just nowhere near as sharp as they need to be.
Started a cute argument about Trump with my dad on Facebook. Lol all my friends are literally at his throat because they got a peek at his bigotry. Welcome to a glimpse of my horrible childhood ✨
Trump says we shouldn't be able to vote by mail because it will be rigged or fraudulent.
The fun fact is that he got tested before traveling w/Trump, so he  said he got sick because he started wearing a mask. Stupid is as stupid does 🙄
Then you just voted for tRump. It doesn’t matter that you don’t like Biden. We have to do what we have to do to rid this country of this blood sucking tick tRump.
This is trump's insanity.
This has to be a joke how you gonna die &amp; leave us with Joe Biden &amp; Donald Trump. The way I see it is I'm not going to vote your life mattered to and my cousin lives in district 10 NY &amp; he has #COVID19 were the bodies pailed up &amp; ditches were dug
BIG: Herman Cain, Former C.E.O. and Presidential Candidate, Dies at 74  Mr. Cain sought the Republican nomination in 2012 and became an early supporter of Donald Trump’s 2016 bid. He had been hospitalized with the coronavirus.  #RIPHermanCain
No, the elections should not be delayed. Trump fears losing and is grasping.
It so striking to compare Obama with Trump. One of them is supremely intelligent, well-educated, radiates good will and compassion, is supremely articulate, inspiring, a greater orator and thinks of the greater good for all and the other person has none of these traits.
Now that Trump is losing badly to Vice President Biden in the polls, he's attempting to undermine the validity of the election in advance. This is what desperation looks like on the most powerful man in the world.
To all those  expressing sympathy, know this: He died believing what Trump says abt the virus. He had an underlying condition and yet he still believed Trump. Wonder why most Americans don't believe the WH? If ur stomped by that question, ur in deeper trouble then we thought.
Now that Trump is losing badly to Vice President Biden in the polls, he's attempting to undermine the validity of the election in advance.
Don’t be stupid!  Trump didn’t creat cancel culture!  The socialists have done that!! AOC calls every person who doesn’t agree with her!  BLM has destroyed people by even going to the persons employer to demand the person is fired! They harass and threaten people’s families!
I am now waiting for the John Birch society to come out against Trump
I certainly hope more and more Republicans have grown sick and tired of Trump's bullshit that they will reject him in November... or better yet, deny him the nomination altogether.
apparently not everyone thought Trump was just joking, like this crazy guy who (checks notes) founded the Federalist Society
Just as badly done as Trump as Thanos.
Out of one side of his mouth, trump is claiming mail-in voting is corrupt. Out of the other side, his campaign is mailing information on how to vote-by-mail to his supporters.  What a hypocritical a**h*le.
Razib can’t make up his mind whether Trump is Julian or if we are still waiting for Sulla.

Why did a tiny Long Island pizzeria get Trump's stamp of approval? Thank roiling local Facebook drama and a well-timed Fox Business segment
For sure. Most of them are rational actors. Given Trump’s downward spiral, it's inevitable they will ultimately abandon him.

She’s so confused!  Trump believes in science, governance and law and order!  He doesn’t believe in dictatorship, socialism, communism, Marxism as she does!
If they get rid of trump in a rush then Pence can run for “reelection” on the “It’s Now Merely a Theocracy” platform and the Rs will rally around him   :0
Trump doesn’t want states to count military votes   He must know the military doesn’t like having bounties on their heads
to say there is no evidence of cheating on mail in ballots means you either forgot about absolutes or are parroting a company line, which is fine but it doesn't make it true.  The reality is Trump is negotiating to make sure they don't happen and the election will be on nov 3
Them: This is Trump's evil strategy! Me: Um. You know Trump and "strategy" in the same sentence is an oxymoron, right?20 years from now (maybe 30) it will be revealed that Trump was a CIA operative.

Seems convenient that Trump is actually mentioned as doing nothing. Same as Clinton.  "They were there with 2 young girls but he was always a gentleman."  I feel like we are all getting shammed.
The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Donald Trump is the Red Baron.  And we are all Snoopy.
Absolutely, Trump uses people all the time.
Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke.
Oh no, what shall we do now that one conservative dislikes Trump? A statement or tweet does not justify impeachment. Maybe if you could win fair and square you wouldn’t have to talk about impeachment. Also...no, I don’t want to join your Neo-Marxist fan club.
He never kicked him out of Mir a Lago.  That is a story Trump says.  He said he was a great guy up until 2004 when Epstien outbid him on a building and got in trouble.  Just because Trump says it now does not mean its true.  He tried to get rid of Berman.
I am really sorry that Trump rejected you as his campaign manager. I think it was a good decision though, after seeing you screw up McCain’s campaign. Good luck to you.
Not all!  Some are still avid Trump supporters.  The staunch republicans would rather vote Trump than put a dem in.  The sad thing is Today's Republican party is not the republican party of my father or grandfather. He has them brainwashed.
Well, at least: "#Republican #leaders in #Congress, who often claim not to have seen Mr. Trump’s outlandish statements and tweets and who infrequently #challenge him in public, promptly and vocally #condemned any notion that the #Election2020 would be moved."

Results matter.  Republican tax cuts and deregulation got us record low minority unemployment.  Trump's pardons are sweeping bipartisan criminal justice reform make him more progressive than Obama.  Democrat welfare got us triple the percentage of single parent black families.

That's right. Trump CAN'T delay the election. As he himself stated, it would take an act of Congress. So, why are you whining about it? I got your email saying he was dangerous for trying to delay it, but here you say he CAN'T. Which is it? IT CAN'T BE BOTH.

#FIDO #FuckItDriveOn  words to live by. Vote, volunteer, and be informed. Inform your friends, neighbors, families, and coworkers. Go vote, bring them with you. We end Trump's presidency this way.
Hey idiot. Trump did not take a salary when he took office. He is a multimillionaire. Maybe billionaire. He can afford to pay things himself and he does.
BEST POLITICAL AD EVER 🤣 TRUMP 2020
We voted TRUMP and will vote TRUMP 2020 and we don’t give a fuck what you think about us, we are patriots and we are American citizens #MAGA2020
In a rare moment in the Trump era, several Texas Republicans pushed back against President Donald Trump on Thursday when he floated in a tweet the idea of delaying the presidential election in November.    |
He was a good man. A true trump supporter
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb
Seems like to the Republicans that everything trump says is a joke lol
I read a comment the other day that perfectly described Trump:  "He sounds like a fourth grader giving an oral book report on a book he didn't read."
They would love to see all us old people die i am old and on ssi that would give the dems more money to steal from our children so #HCQzinc4prevention. To President Trump so we can get the cure
The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
Yeah, I don't think it's an either/or. We knew Trump would be awful. We know Cruz would be awful. It's just which kind of awful.
Until Trump gets the popular vote then it is bad. Lol
They don't want you to know that we have the cure #HCQzinc4prevention their are a lot of front line doctors trying to tell the people and the msm is trying to stop them so # hcq to President Trump we want the cure now
It’s complicated....basically, no election means no House and a partial Senate. That would currently redound to the Democrats, so they’d probably temporarily appoint their most tenured member (Currently, Senator Leahy of Vermont)
what a giant POS you are! That wasn’t a eulogy, it was an anti-Trump speech. You fucked it up for 8 years, you shouldn’t get a second chance! #obamagate
Need to start telling President Trump we want the cure #HCQzinc4prevention
Alright. I gotta do a beer run before  so Im done arguing with liberals and Trump cultists for the day!  Too-da-loo!  Furthermore I consider that Capitalism must be destroyed.
Literally they are actively trying to defund both even more right now

May I also remind you what the democratic party was busy worrying about instead of COVID? Trying to find some reason to impeach Trump. None of them were concerned at all. Forgot about that part right?
I’m tired of waking up with trump just completely ruining this country by the hour
This is the most damning statement against trump to come out now.Calabresi is a founder of the Federalist Society which is a right wing, conservative organization that has always supported the Republican President no matter what they did.This is truly breaking news.Please retweet
Trump is trying to buy votes.
Black Lives Matter? Do they really?  Did David Dorn’s life matter? And now this? I don’t think the unrest is about George Floyd, and that should be clear to anyone with half a brain.  It’s clearly an attempted leftist power grab, but omegalul! #4MoreYears

Trump promoted a doctor. Watch what she said about demons  via
He was immunocompromised because of colon cancer a while back. President Trump mentioned him with respect and sorrow.
I would disagree with your theory as to why Trump was elected. And the election will be far more than interesting, which implies an almost intellectual curiosity. There are real stakes here, for the world. May be too late too.
And trump does not care. Why can’t people see what

Who said we were worrying about Trump's tweets? They're spot on.
More like little bitches that need their own bubble
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes

#Realrepublicans stand up, and against Trump. He is a RUSSIAN pawn, and continues to tell LIES. Do not trust him. He is a disgrace.

If you still support trump, not only are you showing your cards in terms of racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, sexism, transphobia &amp; MANY MORE systemically oppressed people... but you’re showing the world you’re intellectually challenged, willfully ignorant, &amp; a FUGLY DOUCHE.
Wait until Spanky finds out that he really is a loser.
Give me one good reason why Trump would ever go to pay respect to someone who didn't respect him. JL refused to attend Trump's inauguration, And then all he wanted to do is impeach the President on a Hoax. If you were Trump Bob, would you go to an event to only get a coldshoulder
Trump likes them blonde, stupid and desperate.
Some actually think Trump is more articulate. No rational person can look at Obama and thinks he can't actaully speak intelligently without the aid of a teleprompter.

Trump, as the President, has obviously never read our Constitution! Delay The Election?  Say Hi To President Nancy Pelosi |
Don’t keep going with the Trump supporter.  It’s a pointless task.
You can't even offer me any positive points on Trump. Sounds about right. That's why Trump doesn't represent the Republican Party - he may spout what you want to hear, but his actions fall short. He's a Russian political puppet. I will always support USA, and do not trust him
Texas. Trump all the way.
Trump never sent his SS guards to Chicago. Fighting armed drug lords is a little different than unarmed posters in Portland. Just saying.
I was polled about 6 months ago from CNN. I don’t think they liked my answers. My answer was Trump, Trump, and Trump.
I don't agree that Trump hates Black people, but he certainly doesn't do anything to protect us or keep us united during these difficult times.
Please enlighten me. OK - he started the wall. I will give him that. Other than that, what has he done? It's a shit show right now, with no end in site under Trump.
Trump is misleading us on purpose. He is being paid off by Russia to create this chaos. Which is why he is sitting back as thousands die from this very preventative virus.

With Bush v. Gore, there was not time to prep a legal team when the Republicans worked to steal that election. We know what's going to happen when Trump loses. Joe needs to be rallying teams of lawyers from every state that are ready to fight.

Trump wants to delay the Nov. 3 election. Looks to me somebody just realized he don't have a prayer. Trying to extend his rule of "King Trump" .  Better keep an eye on him now. He's getting desperate now. Lie, cheat, steal, bribe, kidnap important families. What ever it takes

I've noticed that when Trump brings someone or something up it's usually for a reason. Sometimes it's because it's  good, &amp; sometimes it's cuz he's painting a target on it.
McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff drumpf’s call to delay the Nov. 3 election bc fear of (unsubstantiated) voter fraud. Republicans may be starting to distance themselves from drumpf.  It’s more than time for invertebrate Repbs to do so.

Obama delivers call to arms in eulogy for Lewis, links Trump to racist Southern leaders who fought civil rights in 1960s. Anyone else miss Pres Obama SS president? 💔His eulogy was a call to arms for voting rights, calling for further additions to VR Bill.
Election games used to make Trump look bad and to get rid of them so they can go back to crooked business as usual! Those tariffs were fucking with all the illegal money coming back in. Clintons money was getting taxed way too much!!
I’m not saying it isn’t a big deal. You’re just suggesting another dumb trump tweet is to distract from the economy being down (historically down). I don’t think he’s intelligent enough for such a scheme.
Let’s see if Trump does it at Herman Cains Funeral. That is if he goes 🤷‍♂️
Trump is doing a terrible job with his handling of the pandemic, but a linear extrapolation of a 9.5% drop is mere conjecture. Besides he doesn't even have the authority to make direct regulations on the situation, the governors do.

You and trump are the frauds.

A little while ago, when Brian Williams was talking to Valerie Jarrett, he referred to something “the President said.” I had to smile because he wasn’t talking about Trump, he was talking about Obama. It was just so natural at that moment to think of Obama as “The President.“
Trump also knows that the instant he leaves office, the NYAG has cooperating witnesses and, most likely, evidence to convict him of enough felonies to put Him away for the rest of his life.  He doesn’t leave voluntarily unless he can flee somewhere w/o an extradition agreement.
Trump encouraged people to not wear masks...he is responsible for many deaths!

They called people who wear masks week now that they understand that mask save lives they’re afraid of being seen as being weak. Let me tell you tired when you started giving your soul to Trump that’s when you became weak
Trump has decided to reject initial application requests &amp; make current DACA holders renew every year rather than every 2 years.
so explain trump on Epstein’s island “wishing Whatever the fuck her name is” well 😖
Yes.  I hate the Right but the Left looks incompetent as hell.  Y'all spent 4 years trying to impeach Trump instead of picking a good candidate so you failed at both. Now politicians from the left are freaking and saying whatever they can for November.
Tru! Why did they release the virus!! To make Trump look bad and incompetent. All I know if before China and The Democrats released their elections weapon  Was killing it statistically!! Media made me hate Trump! Well. We have weapons too! Its called the internet
Get rid of the nasty orange Trump stain to this country November 3rd and let’s party the day afterward
"Hey Mr Trump, I'm good with just getting 1 tweet. Thanks."
No. But Trump isn’t that stupid. There has to be a reason he’s floating this. Something up his sleeve.
It’s ok, Jo.  Tiny Trump loves and appreciates you too.  🤣😂😆#tiny trump
Live video of Trump tossing out pardons:
Crying Chuckles whining as usual about President Trump, crying and using his best scare tactics. What a buffoon.
Get rid of Trump ass kisser McCarthy, Kim Mangone will represent you interest in the House of Representatives.
Now do Trump.
why is topo chico trending? I swear if I find out they support trump..

Are you ok with no voter ID? No right? But your guna say yes cause you aren't entitled to your own opinion anymore its mob mentality.  And you cant go against the mob that's why you guys push shit I know in your right mind you wouldn't agree with. All to stop Trump. Sad bro. ✌FO
Sorry to hear about Cane, I thought Dr Trump’s prescription of “Hydroxichloroqin” and “Demon Sperm” would save life. 😀
Trump: “11Yeah you should donate. I donated and they said they never seen plasma like mine. I’ve heard that before. Many have said I had the best plasma. Obama left the plasma bin empty but I filled it up.” Trump talk... OUT🎤 👏🏾 Thank you 😂😂
There’s something poignant to be said about blind loyalty to Trump and being a traitor to the constitution in service of your own ambition being a deadly combination.
Several places are, but with Trump trying to destroy the USPS and now him wanting to cancel the election it may not matter much longer.

A bad day for Trump!
President Trump voiced support for an investigation into the murder of Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillén after meeting with her family Thursday.
This might be a bad analogy, but: Trump reminds me of Scar from The Lion King - corrupting his way to power while being a coward much of the film. Remember how Scar finally attacked Simba when he saw he'd lost everything? Yeah, I am scared what Trump will do should HE get there.
Please speak out against the #PutinPoodle’s idea to postpone the election.  Come on, Ted. Get up off your knees, grow some backbone, peek out from behind Trump’s coattails, and speak up.  Make Texas proud, for once.
Not a good day for Trump!
Not a good day for Trump!
Facebook has lied about you, and changed the narrative to make it look like the great things you have done aren't so great. I agree Facebook needs to be held accountable. But here's my biggest issue great president trump. I am a very skilled tradesman..
Not a good day for Trump.
Will Mr. Trump be attending his memorial service?
If Trump mentions $PRPO and turns it into a $KODK moment, I’ll vote for him!
Oh, this is good! We are absolutely living in the Twilight Zone, or rather, the tRump Twilight Zone!
Yes sir, their presence and outrageous actions are just making the entire situation worse. And worse, and worse...of course, that’s what tRump wants!
Who knew the Republican Party was so full of people with no sense of self-preservation. Not wearing a mask in obeisance to Trump is not a hill I would choose to die on. #HermanCain
Trump is supposed to be a leader. By Trump not wearing a mask, he is saying to his followers that it's ok not to!
This was just a distraction. The second-quarter GDP plunged by worst-ever 32.9% and Herman Cain died from COVID-19 that he probably caught at Trump's Tulsa rally. But, Trump's tweet about delaying the election is getting the most attention.
So you’re saying it was completely his choice to go and not wear a mask. So Democrats need to quit blaming his death on Trump. Y’all are so evil.
Trump suggests delaying November election -- but date is set by Congress
No one forced him to go to Trump’s rally. He chose to go and he lived his life how he wanted to. It seems Democrats want no one to take any risks ever again for fear of death or just something bad happening. Life is full of risk - get over it.
This nigga Trump says whatever he wants lol
He doesn’t realize that he is serving his last term now. After Trump is out of office, we’ll likely learn how Trump Republicans were traitors to US citizens.
Trump is going to win big.
Tea Party opened the door for. Trump to hijack, thoughts and prayers
No, I’m Just waiting for president trump to lock them all up!!
I also don't think Trump would have enough votes in his favor from SCOTUS
Dude that's the whole point. He said EVERY DEVELOPER IS TREATED THE SAME. They are NOT. Every developer is NOT treated the same. One definition of "lie" is stating the opposite of the truth. He did that. I'm so tired of Cook doing the wrong thing. Trump/Austin, China, all of it.
I wonder 🤔 if thousands of Trump supporters were doing this to congress federal building in DC,would they demand law enforcement leave?
Daydreaming that in the future there will be a "did you vote for Trump in 2020" question on job applications, that if you answer yes to just proves you have poor decision making abilities and are unsuited for any position...
Trump is only worried about 1 thing; himself. He will literally and metaphorically throw anyone or anything under the bus to not just save his pathetic ass but for financial gain.
That will depend entirely on how many in the military remain loyal to the country and how many are loyal solely to trump.
Fit for Trump
President Trump will surely be tweeting about this racist.
you think those are Trump voters, sh** for brains?
“Studdered” aw lmao. That’s not a word. Aren’t you a trump supporter, isn’t he into 10 year olds and his own daughter?? Yeah that’s what I thought.
President Trump KNOWS that FAUCI praised HCQ in 2005 as a CURE for COVID viruses, and that he has fought against it now, clearly showing he has been bought and paid for by the Demoncrapic Party/Communist Chinese Government.
So you don’t believe in the fact that hospitals are attributing more cases for financial gain? If not that’s fine but in your opinion are blue states inflating numbers to hurt Trump? Honest question nothing behind it.
The  found in an analysis of more than 200 Portland arrests that even those accused of breaking the law during the liberal city’s nightly rallies don’t neatly fit into President Donald Trump’s depiction of protesters as “anarchists and agitators.”
While I totally agree with the punishment mandated in federal code, the #democrats are actually hoping rioters are killed so they can blame Trump. That’s what this is about and it shows the EXTREME EVIL the Dems will go to to prevent indictments for their crimes against children
Yes and Donald Trump is dissing him and not attending the pomp and circumstance...My Mama always said "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
Omg he made a mistake, wow. At least he’s an eloquent speaker unlike Fraud in chief Trump! Person woman man camera Tv! Wow he can pass a simple memory test how impressive!!!
and many others are also doing excellent work to help remove Trump &amp; his enablers out of office.
Trump 2020 Fool-Proof Talking Points For  Trump Supporters To Debate With  via
Fauci went on to say that if you have "goggles or an eye shield, you should use it." Close enough for me. I mean Trump asked about using an internal disinfectant, which I know someone who had that done medically, and it was claimed he said drink bleach. So there’s that.
“We’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3.” McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election - The Washington Post
You don't have to like trump to know his policies have been good for AMERICANS.
Yeah... I'm worried about the disregard of science in the Trump administration. I'm worried about defunding the CDC and disconnecting from the WHO.
Notice how right wing trump supporters never reply to any actual arguments but ignore them &amp; only provide weak rebuttals tothe few insignificant comments they think matter in the scheme of the entire argument🤣 hes silent for what matters but only responds to the insults.Pathetic
We ought to be afraid based on all that has happen what is to become of this country if Trump does not get in. He has ego issues an opens mouth to often but he has kept things going in spite of what’s thrown at him. Socialism is where this is going if he is not elected
Hmmm I’m sure if trump did it you’d be okay with it though 🤷🏽‍♀️
Don't think so. They are all in for Trump.
110 million votes reserved for Donald Trump! Americans are wiser now!! No more bullshit!! One good term deserves another🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Let me guess- you agree with trump about moving the election date?
You obviously don’t know what John Lewis stood for 🤡. As if trump wouldn’t make a speech at a funeral about himself and how he’s the greatest president ever.
Donald Trump is the most despicable man to ever place his hand on a holy Bible to take an oath of any kind.
Trump is not a President. He is a disgrace. Mr. Lewis wouldn’t want racist Trump at his memorial anyway. Trump should never utter John Lewis’s name! EVER!
Remember that time she called Trump supporters "a basket of deplorables"?  Remember when that turned out to be prophetically true?
Vote for who ever you want. Just remember that if you want Trump out of office that a vote for anyone other then Biden is a vote in Trumps favor. The Democratic party can not afford to split our vote. We know the Republican party won't be writing in celebrities.
Donald trump could never do you hear me. NEVER. #JohnLewisMemorial
what makes people wake up and think it’s a good idea to wear a trump shirt??? weirdos
trump not being re-elected will be the the best 15th birthday present!!
A back the blue flag hung above an American flag that is hung above a Trump flag... like ok we know you’re racist.
Obama really called out trump at john Lewis' funeral. I love it
That's the sound of Cornyn coming out of Trump's ass.
DUH....Are You kidding Me...FOCUS Mister President...Economy, Civil Unrest, Schools...Wash, Rinse, Repeat...Economy, Civil Unrest, Schools.
TREASONOUS Trump!
You think fighting for civil rights ends with trump? This has been a long time coming. I guarantee the protests/movement will not stop until substantial change is made no matter the president but still #fucktrump.
You know Trump Bad when Bush looks like a old friend .....that I didnt vote for! #JohnLewisMemorial
I'm amazed that Cruz, Cornyn and Abbott didn't realize that President Trump was trolling the Dementiacrats and MSM.  Trap set. Varmints caught. 🤣
Cain knew he had underlying conditions and listened to trump lies, he presented himself to #COVID19 , the virus doesn’t discriminate, it infect and kill ‼️ #tulsadeathrally #TrumpTulsaRally #GOPDeathCult #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Friendly reminder donald trump tweeted “law and order!” exactly one day ago, and is now floating the idea of something never before done and also a power that rests only with states and congress to decide.  Also if the virus “isn’t that bad” let’s go vote? Tf?
Romney says Trump plan to remove U.S. troops from Germany ‘grave error’ - Deseret News
Trump coulda Stopped the Carnage in its Tracks bt Declined...
exactly. revival happens whether Obama or Trump is president. our call is to love people unconditionally as ministers of reconciliation. it is never dependant on who is president. all presidents are imperfect. but love never fails.
I’m more furious than sad. This black man towing the Anti Mask line for Trump and Trump ain’t going to even give a f—- about him. Less than two weeks after being at the Trump Tulsa rally he contracts Coronavirus.   You really hate to see it. I’m so angry.
Meanwhile Trump is tweeting about pizza. 😑 #8645110320
Look what Trump did! He states we should delay the election and all of a sudden they want to cure this shit! Funny how that works!🙏🏻🇺🇸
But Cuban doesn’t know right ? He is very busy trashing Trump an Twitter .
Trump wants to push back elections. Ah hell nah.
Trump cares about trump and election ‼️💯 #TrumpDeathCult #GOPComplicitTraitors #tulsadeathrally
Speaking of MEN not doing their jobs, the entire trump administration is not doing their jobs!  #presidentMakeUpLine is a criminal.
Did we actually find a line they aren’t willing to cross for trump?!?! 🤯
Those of us who hope for Trump's defeat should keep up hope, but we should also have a Plan B. It is not impossible that we could end up with another 4 years of Trump and Mitch, which would make the last 4 years seem like a resort vacation by comparison. What will we do then?
And there is a "Walking Dead" vibe in our politics now that makes people fanatically devoted to Trump like the Night King and his army of frozen corpses.
Yes, Trump *could* lose, and Democrats *could* retake the Senate. But it ain't over till it's over.  Backing Biden right now makes me feel like "Weekend at Bernie's."
"...I find myself a little worried as I see the growing level of grinning and winking and nudging the current crop of 'Trump is finished' summer polling has encouraged.  "No doubt Trump is in big trouble.

How about holding the White House accountable for their reckless acts and complete indifference to over 150,000 deaths and a cratering economy? You are complicit for enabling Trump.
Anything trump says is lies 💯Cain knew he had underlying conditions and presented himself to #COVID19 , it doesn’t discriminate, it infect and kill‼️ #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #TulsaRally #GOPDeathCult
Trump's rally kills Cain, the Co-Chair of Black Voices for Trump.  You couldn't make this stuff up...
y’all trump supporters really have the audacity to be that stupid. it’s rude.
Unlike Trump, GW Bush at least acts like a human being.
Well, I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. But keep an eye on this space
I used to not vote but I changed my thinking. I have never truly liked any candidate until Trump. In my 50 years he is the only one I have noticed who actually DOES what he says (in a good way). If you ignore the MEDIA it's amazing how positive things get.
When it doesn’t directly affect him Trump says “ Schools must fully be open no matter what!” When it affects him directly Trump says “Postpone the election until it’s safe for people to congregate?” #DumpTrump #Biden2020
The way Trump did when McCain died...like that?
The WP article that Trump wants to delay the election is written in such a sleazy and unprofessional manner that it makes me think that it was some Chinese political operative who wrote this!  It is disgrace, and shameful. The WP with it's political activists needs to go!!!
"It turns out that a nation that sends Louie Gohmert to Congress was fully capable of sending Donald Trump to the White House. So, this is a reminder that the dysfunction in our body politic was a pre-existing condition and that it won't go away with the departure of Trump.

I support Trump whole heartedly; this being said, you are right. Really, these witchhunt tactics are only good for stirring the Hornets nest. They solve nothing and create more questions than answers.🤗
Yes. Hundreds of thousands of Americans dying of #TrumpVirus and our President and Senator from Texas are focused on making jokes to "make the press's heads explode." Sure. Trump is the guy who propositions every single girl he sees, telling the ones who refuse "I was joking."
Let’s leave out fact he already had Cancer. Let’s blame Trump.
This is from 2016. He supports Donald Trump 100%. Trump never apologized either.
Not scared.  is deep in thought.   “Why won’t Trump like me? Why won’t he respect me? I’ve never talked back. I’ve always cowered. I’ve fallen to my knees in supplication. Why, oh Donnie, why? WHY?!”
...and when  said this, did he recall the Trump statement from last month, when he talked about slowing down testing, that he doesn’t joke around? It’s too bad Cornyn feels like he has to remain a Trump bootlicker to prevent his base from abandoning him.

Can we stop talking about Trump's Election Day postponement?  We should be talking about the disaster he created with the economy because he felt #COVID19 was a hoax.   You guys fall for it everytime.
The idea that Trump was joking about delaying the election is TBS.  He thinks he can change the Election Day because he has no concept of the limited powers of the President.  Just like his “joke” about injecting people with bleach. He wasn’t joking.

And in that case, Trump wins the Presidency. Unbelievable... Can you imagine what the next four years of his term would look like?
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Full appeals court will review decision ordering dismissal of case against former Trump adviser Michael Flynn.
We’re NOT laughing. Republican senators need to voice their objection to Trump for stating possible delay of election.
If Trump successfully pushes back the general election, I’m convinced he has naked pic of God.🧐
Trumpeting false hope does a disservice to the people in oil industry.  The bigger energy trends to alternative power, transportation and chemical production is away from hydrocarbons.
The Obama Adm. left, teams, processes and procedures in place, embedded in China, to STOP this pandemic before it started.  The TRUMP Adm. BLEW IT.    YOU are responsible for giving a criminal a not guilty vote.  YOU are 10 times more responsible for this pandemic than China.
Trump killed Cain.

i would think loyalty to trump would get ANYONE KILLED?! loyalty towards greed lust &amp; envy would result in death in the end for ANYONE!

Duty Trump Honor Country Russia - his west point motto.
Care to expound? The number of times Trump did something after people said "he can't do that" are too numerous for me to recall.
It was the 19th week in which initial claims totaled at least 1 million and the second consecutive week in which initial claims rose after declining for 15 straight weeks from Covid19  #jobs #business #education #coronavirus #covid19 #covid #health #trump
So you've mad at the Chinese Communist Party?  Trump's tax cuts and deregulation got us the best jobs economy in half a century.
I doubt it, I don’t see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can’t glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should’ve learned.
Trump is terrified
Thank you President Trump ! maybe now the media will allow schools to start, churches to open, and a cure to be found.

The #COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the construction industry. Tell Congress and President Trump to include significant construction investment for transportation, schools, water, and broadband infrastructure in relief legislation.

Herman Cain's tragic death may have been avoided if he hadn't attended this Trump Campaign rally in Tulsa or if asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 at the rally had worn masks to reduce his risk of being infected. Please don't be selfish. Wear a mask.
Did Herman Cain receive the medication?  You guys are fools. The president is unhinged and has yet to broach the subject of Cain's death!  He doesn't care if you, your children or your parents die. He does not care about honor or country. He cares about Trump!
Donald Trump didn’t kill Herman Cain. Listening to Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Bro survived stage 4 cancer and died of COVID after going to a Trump rally God really be up there playing greys anatomy with these story lines man 🤦🏾‍♂️
This dude isn’t a billionaire, Trump is. Unsuccessful? Get over yourself
There isnt any realistic chance of this happening. It’s just Trump planting seeds in the heads of his supporters that the election is getting stolen from them. He can’t afford to lose a single vote from 2016 so he’s banking on keeping his base rabid and energized as being the key
He’s repeating what Trump said about the pandemic that’s why he said you can’t have it both ways settle down boomer
Ms. King is really going to flip out when she realizes that all of the 150,000 people who have died from the virus are not just Republicans, but ACTUAL TRUMP DONORS. Trump was right.  It's a very clever virus.  Who knew?

Within this WaPo opinion peice, it reads, “Nonetheless, Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason.” Is it still treasonous when Trump himself suggests delaying the election,
I stand corrected! There's some Iowa common sense for you. No b.s. from him this time. It's been far too long, but hopefully at least some of the GOP will finally disavow Trump and try to remember some of what they used to believe in and, more importantly, actually stand up for.

He probably did not die from CORONAVIRUS EITHER!!!!!  But it makes for good reason to once again Publicly blame Trump ,  and try to make him feel responsible!  They're cunning propagandist!!!

Trump is only tweeting it to distract from the news that the US is in recession. The Trump Recession.
Biden watching Trump collapse, but then realizing what he will probably inherit.
It's too dangerous to have an in-person GOP convention. It's too dangerous to have mail-in voting. But, it's safe to send our children to school.  The only type of voting Trump's ilk believe is safe is in-person, with confederate flag waving election monitors, in red states only.
Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe’ — meaning till his polls are up again, of course.
Important context for Trump's tweet floating postponement of the 2020 election

Good point here (re: Trump's tweet about postponing the 2020 election)
Absolutely right (re Trump's ludicrous suggestion that the 2020 election be postponed).  And, honestly: Is anyone really surprised that Trump would float this dangerous idea?
If our media appreciated the wisdom of Charles Schulz they'd know the parable of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. But hope does indeed spring eternal in the hearts of journalists covering Donald Trump.
Alternative theory...  Dems and media for the last three months, "We might have to delay the election because of Covid-19 or allow mass mail-in voting."  Trump. How do I get the Dems &amp; media to scream that the election MUST absolutely happen in November?

Let me answer that for you: No, it will not have an impact on Trump...Herman Cain is just another dead Black Man who can’t vote for Trump this November.
"We’re heartbroken, and the world is poorer: Herman Cain has gone to be with the Lord:” Former GOP presidential candidate diagnosed with #COVID19 after attending Trump Tulsa rally; staff says it’s unknown where he caught it. #HermanCain #coronavirus #GOP
Yeah Herman Cain is dead and Trump's threatening to delay the Elections (Called it)  But did you know Trump caused our GDP to shrink by almost 33%?  A third of the 'behstuest powahful nahshun' value is gone by a THIRD under this "Stable Genius"  great work, Conservatives.
AAAAND...there it is. If you have somehow been waiting for a sign that trump wants to be dictator (and haven't seen it yet) here you go...

No. Trump is now threatening to postpone the election.
How does an otherwise universally-accepted smart individual, business leader and visionary essentially meet his untimely death because he actively chose to shill for Trump?   How?
I hate joe but this is a clear example of Trump’s authoritarianism
I’m in. Trump 2020
There’s no issue here either. Trump wants people to think there is one.
Texas voter. How about an order to hold Trump accountable for reckless acts that lead to the current pandemic and has so far contributed to the death of more than 150 thousand Americans.
Died because he went to a Trump rally... wow.
I wonder what Superspreader Trump will say about this?  Trump, now has one less vote.
tRump is NOT A LEADER..He does NOT know how to LEAD...That’s why 150000+ Americans have died...
The tweet is no longer available. By the Mr. Cruz-the Senate needs to get off their butts &amp; out a lid on Trump. He’s now wanting to delay the ELECTION. Think times are tough now? Keep stepping on our constitutional right!!
I'm not sure how you feel sorry for this guy?... blame Trump? Seems like he was a grown man that refused to educate himself (C-19) , putting his life/ supporters at risk. What if he gave it to YOUR child?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Can never throw at someone's head. Even an Astro. Maybe Trump...
I did not vote for him and have no opinion on Mr. Cain as a person.  I did not like his politics.  No one should be attending Trump rallies, with or without a mask.
trump killed him.
I apologize but I don’t feel sorry for anyone who follows tRump off this VOVID cliff..At what point in your life do you say “If HE walks like a fool and HE talks like a fool then HE must be a FOOL and it’s time for me to abandon this FOOL”!!!
Back on Feb. 25, when we had 57 confirmed cases of covid19 in the 🇺🇸 I made a bet with my husband that tRump would use covid to cancel the election. Back then he was laughing at my wild ideas. Today he is not laughing.
Just because Donald Trump is scared we shouldn't delay the vote! #WeWillVote
I've got as much to learn from you Bob as Trump does from a lecture in quantum mechanics from Richard Feynman.  I typically laugh at clowns for being the clowns they are.  The notion Walsh is a Democrat is laughable, just probably every  take you have, political or otherwise.
RIP. Though I was never a fan of Cain's politics, this is sad news. Cain tested positive for #COVID19 a week after attending Trump's Tulsa rally, where he was photographed interacting with others without a mask
It’s mostly because irresponsible behavior with respect to the virus has become a Trump party platform.   Large indoor no mask rally 12 days before Herman goes into hospital?  I don’t need the magic 8 ball to connect those dots.
Too little, too late. This lifelong Texas conservative voter is voting for  and for every Dem I can find on the ballot.  I will not support the   descent into a corrupt, xenophobic, misogynistic, Christaliban, cult of Trump ass-kissers.  #VoteBlue2020
And how did he get the virus?  Oh, that's right - at Trump's Tulsa rally.  Good job GOP!!!!
or combat the ignorance?  To combat both we fire trump in November or sooner if possible.  Or, trump or one of his family get the virus and get very, very sick.
Come January 20,2021 your sorry ass is OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE...VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY.  How do you feel now that Herman Cain DIED taking YOUR ADVICE. Just count it as another American dead from the TRUMP FLU. This is on YOU!!

Honestly, I would rather him resign and for Pence to be President #46 for whatever time is left of Trump’s term. This man cannot be trusted.
Agreed but he’s a Trump bootlicker so not much hope of that happening
Too bad, never going to happen. Within the next generation, they will be the only superpower left.  While we invest in war, they invest in AI, renewable energy, space exploration, and cutting-edge comms technology while Trump destroys every  global partnerships built after WWII.
Trump's America: - civil unrest  - record unemployment - record economic dive - corrupt administration officials convicted  - same officials pardoned - letting a pandemic run unabated - cowering to Russia - Russians taking out bounties on American troops
Here’s the thing - states are not listening to president stupid. Schools in north Texas and Houston aren’t opening. Schools in Indiana aren’t opening. Trump is a total buffoon and while he should have 0 credibility, whatever he does have is diminishing.
Donald Trump is too nice to Russia and Venezuela! When we get a real man, not an effenminent homo, in the office, he’ll make sure those countries don’t fuck with America again!
all you have to do is look at how hard they fought when President Trump announced he was taking it. All countries that deal with malaria take HCQ and subsequently have hardly ANY reported cases. The Demoncraps and their LAPDOGS the Marxist Media fought because they KNOW IT WORKS
Anti-vax, Kardashians, and flat earth were probably the test cases to see how stupid Americans are, leading to Trump stealing the election. That worked well for Putin. Now the anti mask thing is proving we’re even dumber, opening the door to who knows what type of manipulation.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Yes. And I’d like to think I’d do the same even if the Trump supporter is not elderly. You never know what might come from a simple act of kindness. And at the end of the day, I have to be true to myself.
Ok now do Trump.
The President has no lawful authority to move or stop the election.   However, when has the law ever been a deterrent for Trump.   IF Trump chose to ignore the law. e.g. order poll workers to stay home and/or send federal officers to turn people away, what would be our recourse?
The sad deflection ploy again.   “Trump’s urging came on the heels of the release of dire new economic figures from the Commerce Department that shows that the U.S. economy shrank at a 33% annual rate in the April-June quarter, creating the worst quarterly plunge ever.”
Putin and Trump played them and they had to get on board the Trump train now they have no other choice but to ride it off the cliff :-)
If a Supreme Court spot opens up in the next few weeks, is there any way to prevent Publicans from ramming through a Trump pick?
Trump floats election ‘delay’ while making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.   In other words, the president of the US is flexing his criminal depends.
Well of course he did! Same as he suggested to ignore bounties on our soldiers, the pandemic ravaging our country, troops pulled from Germany and the list goes on. Trump works for Putin.
It is clearly unfounded, over the line, and outrageous to suggest such a thing, basically accusing Trump of treason! At least according to one conservative writer.
I’m ready for Trump to be out of office 👊🏻
This probably explains why he did it.  “Trump’s urging came on the heels of the release of dire new economic figures from the Commerce Department that shows that the U.S. economy shrank at a 33% annual rate in the April-June quarter, creating the worst quarterly plunge ever.”
This explains it.  Deflection again.   “Trump’s urging came on the heels of the release of dire new economic figures from the Commerce Department that shows that the U.S. economy shrank at a 33% annual rate in the April-June quarter, creating the worst quarterly plunge ever.”
What does it require, 2/3 of Congress?  This is funny because I saw last Friday on CNBC that 90% of CEOs go with Trump, which is logical. Lax business regs. Anyway, CEOs do this shit all the time. They don't want to deal with an issue? Delay and ignore.   Power is crumbling.

You do understand Trump will only believe the election is fair if he wins right? In 2016 the popular vote was rigged, according to him, cuz 3m voted illegally. But, the electoral college win was the greatest ever.
It's getting easier with Trump, though. He's fixing to run us into bankruptcy, which is all he's good at.

"Trump was always going to be blamed for the coronavirus response" Well, when you're in charge of it and fail, it's not someone else's fault. No matter how much you refuse to take the blame. Also, Trump is ALSO using it as a political weapon, so don't think that's a 1-side thing
Everyone should remember to vote  out of office next time he runs. He’s a grown nosed, two faced jerk. He cares about himself and nothing more. Trump proved that.
A gross over step, Trump sending unmarked federal agents and kidnapping teenagers in Honda Minivans should be disgusting to everyone, regardless of party. Sign up &amp; urge local leaders to join the movement and start protest in your area. (Spread the word)

Plus trump’s staff removed all the social distancing markers. But in the end it was a personal decision. Had trump required attendees to wear a mask, maybe he’d still be here. So it was a group effort.
He was battling cancer too. He caught it at trump’s failed vanity rally in tulsa. He didn’t wear a mask either. You’d think he would’ve known better?
Can you imagine Trump eulogizing anyone? Well, Roger Stone,or Putin, I guess.
How terrifying it must be for Trump to listen to President Obama today. There is no escaping the Compassion, the Eloquence, the Truth, the Hope &amp; the Admiration. There is no place to hide your smallness in the light of this honoring of #JohnLewis #WeShallOvercome #GoodTrouble
At least they took the bait. Now that we know that theres no excuses the election will go on as scheduled. You gotta give it to Trump. He had enough sense to know they would come up with an excuse to delay so he called them at their own game.

I am confused.  Trump mispronounces a word or any thing, he is castigated.  This person cannot even pronounce a full sentence or thought and it is embarrassing.  They want that to lead USA and represent to the world?  What a terrible thing.
If Trump wants to change the election time then let's have the election next week. Mid-Summer Is about as safe as its gonna get.

Actually, I think they hate Trump (because they can't control him &amp; don't own him) AND America's founding principles.  What's more, Trump is trying the hardest of the 13 presidents in my lifetime (Ike to Trump) to get the govt back to its Constitutional foundations.  /1
All we’ve learned is that Democrats weaponized the federal government to try to steal the 2016 election, even years after it was finalized. Yet these same ppl want to say Trump is. Remember they said the same about Russia before they paid for a fake dossier from Russia.
If only she was as tough of murder and violence in a Chicago as she is against police and Trump, Chicago would be the safest city in America instead of the most violent. Decades of failed and corrupt party leadership.

If the same rioting, looting, &amp; burning were going on in cities with Rep mayors &amp; govs, then I would agree that this is Trump's fault.  BUT since this is happening in DEMOCRAT territory, I can't do that. It would be a lie &amp; unfair. 😋  So suck it up, 🌞. It the Democrats' fault!
Trump’s eyes are going to explode.
President Donald Trump has canceled segments of the Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a “flare-up” of the coronavirus. Convention events will still be held in North Carolina.
Maybe Trump needs to officially rename it the Pelosi Virus. It doesn’t make much sense. It keeps hanging around. It absorbs tons of American resources that just disappear with no reward. And it has a lot of support in California and NY.
Perhaps Trump should have done more. It would have kept NY from sending all those infected ppl to nursing homes and they’d be alive today. Liberal governors wouldn’t still have states on lockdown. And violent rioters wouldn’t have been allowed to spread Covid. Good points.

Trump is still her running mate. She clearly is trying to run away from him to Maine voters with this move. I don’t think Maine voters are stupid however. She votes for just about everything he does. She voted for him to remain as President just 6 months ago.

I prefer Bernie's take to "Trump's new tone," when he has been undermining his own scientists and catering to his worst instincts. I don't think Dems (or anyone) need to affirm Trump for doing the bare minimum, and should criticize him for having been detrimental to the effort.

The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it’s like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Wouldn’t it be great if Trump’s “suburban strategy” failed and this marked the beginning of the end of racism in America?
All Trump has to do is be honest and say ok ok we lied about this PLANDEMIC were going open up no more masks no force vaccinations everything back normal n I'm sure the voilence will stop because people will have something productive to do n my ass can finally go see a movie
Aah - you took the blue pill.  Not very effective claims on a day Trump suggested delaying the election and falsely claimed that the country had universal mail-in elections (something other than absentee ballots). Sorry, can't return a "nice" try, your response is just a.... try.
If by hero "federal agents" you mean mercenary thugs sent by Trump, and if by "protecting federal property" you mean ASSAULTING VETERANS and Moms, then you'd be right and not embarrassingly full of shit. ...
Is trump the last person to realize that kushner is an idiot?
She did, and then suddenly stopped. The pattern of intimidation we're seeing here puts that into context. Trump does appear in these files as being present with some of the girls and flirting with one. In that instance, at best, he knew what was happening and did nothing.

I feel like trump is doing that for votes. Not because he cares... 😕😕
Clinton &amp; Trump are both implicated in being *present*, and I wouldn't put molestation beyond either of them. But, so far, there's no allegation of either of them doing anything beyond Trump "flirting" with one of the girls. Dershowitz and Richardson, OTOH...that's actionable.
Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke.
I betcha Trump wishes he could do that opening pitch now and crack some joke about them beating dead birds.

Sorry, Ana.    You helped gaslight the country and are part of the reason we have Trump.  Lay out your path of understanding and remorse if you want credibility.   Until then your words are opportunistic and hollow.
Oh no, what shall we do now that one conservative dislikes Trump? A statement or tweet does not justify impeachment. Maybe if you could win fair and square you wouldn’t have to talk about impeachment. Also...no, I don’t want to join your Neo-Marxist fan club.
Recently he’s been more of a trump sycophant &amp; attorney. Deal with it.
He never kicked him out of Mir a Lago.  That is a story Trump says.  He said he was a great guy up until 2004 when Epstien outbid him on a building and got in trouble.  Just because Trump says it now does not mean its true.  He tried to get rid of Berman.

Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it’s worst than the other. There will never be a “good” or “perfect” politician. Bernie wasn’t either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process

Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.

I think this is what they call getting rid of the riff raff. It's why people like Trump like borders and country club memberships. Jack up the prices until "undesirables" can't afford to hang, then all you have left are the willfully ignorant deplorables.
Look, supporters of Trump, and Herman Cain, and...you can say what you want, but big gatherings, and opening up, and skipping the wearing of masks...these are dangerous, and dispiriting to our front line health care givers. Help them out!

Okay when Fauci speaks all I hear is QUACK QUACK QUACK.  The man is working for Hillary in my opinion because if you pay attention to Hillary's body language she doesn't appear to be as upset like she was in Trump's first 3 years but after the China virus it has changed.
You’re a weak-kneed Trump mama’s boy.  We need a real man as Texas Senator, which in this case is a woman.  Bye bye, Cornyn.
We thankfully got Trump AFTER the traitor left the WH...
Good theory, Trump will do something last minute that will cause Democrats to want a delay.
But....I thought Trump was racist...

Trump is not the same as in 2016. He can’t drink a glass of water using only his right hand and drags his right foot when he walks. It looks like he had a left brain stroke recently
Keep on pushing.  There are people who see through you pushing this story.  Trump wins handily, but wait we have these uncounted votes that magically lean 99% Joe Biden, all in one truck.
He wore no mask, he attended a Trump rally in Tulsa, with no social distancing, and yesterday, he paid with his life.  Must all who deny the validity of the science have to experience the virus before realizing that they have been lied to?

Only you and Trump are bigger threats.
Fool us once in 2016, shame on them.  Fool us twice in 2020, shame on us. We live in crazy times, but everyone should know by now Trump isn't above the lowest forms of cheating. He's a zero sum gamer.

Trump, his children,  his son law, all utilized the Mail in voting system during the last presidential election......
I hope more do in Congress. Mail in voting does not favor one party over the other. In fact, since older people tend to use mail in voting a lot and older people tend to vote Republican, it may actually offer them an advantage. But they listen to trump.

Same here in Dallas.  And Abbott gave us an extra week. Do it so Trump can’t challenge us.
That's right. Trump CAN'T delay the election. As he himself stated, it would take an act of Congress. So, why are you whining about it? I got your email saying he was dangerous for trying to delay it, but here you say he CAN'T. Which is it? IT CAN'T BE BOTH.

This country is so fucked. Has to be the biggest collection of the dumbest fucking people on the planet
Obama used John Lewis funeral to try to save his hide because he spied on Trump campaign and got caught. Desperation is the nail on the coffin.
And where is the f4cking stock market ? They don’t care that trump is running the country into the ground or that the republican want to take away consumer spending ability with unemployment? They used to react to tan suits now nothing

It totally is! My husband got all freaked out about one of them and I I had to walk him through the logic of trusting Trump until he gives us a reason not to 😂

These are not the brightest guys. Trump is so obsessed with mail-in ballots, he thinks this will help his re-election. He's too stupid to understand the economy runs on mail. Slowing down USPS slows the economy. That will do far more to hurt his re-election than mail-in ballots.

In a rare moment in the Trump era, several Texas Republicans pushed back against President Donald Trump on Thursday when he floated in a tweet the idea of delaying the presidential election in November.    |
He was a good man. A true trump supporter
Also to consider - biggest issue is probably COVID-19 which Pence has been the image of as head of the TF.  His hands are all over over it and the public will consider him as guilty of the response as Trump.
Again, the part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of them resisted Trump's directions. Leadership begins with followership. They sealed their fate. The impeachment was still going in Feb
Thank the lord for President Trump hearing the assertion of the Gillian case too it was more than a sexual assault it was a stalking&amp; brutal attack against that soldier with more than one person involved w/ it    will amnesty be granted
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a “conspiracy theorist” for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.

The part many of you fail to see is the state governors were tasked with ensuring their own states were protected, especially after many of the governors resisted the federal Gov'ts directions. Trump doesn't have the right to force those governors to comply in these matters.
His death is quite sad and it could have been avoided, it Trump and his supporters would have simply worn masks and practiced social distancing.  There will be more deaths to come, from Republican “leaders” and the MAGA crowd who still think this is somehow a political issue.

sold Texans out the minute he laid at the feet of the Trump altar. He’s no better than any of them.
What is the Congress approval rating? I bet way lower than Trump’s
Shut up. You know nothing about what is needed.
But, even if the election were delayed, Trump's term ends on January 20 (as does Pence's). Patrick Leahy, as 4th in line, would then become president.
Inform   that Absentee Voting (which Trump does every year/on record that it's "safe" and "good") is THE SAME as Universal Mail-In Voting!  This should not be a States' issue.  All Americans have the RIGHT to Universal Mail-In Voting!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
Something Trump would never do, pay his respects.
one question, when Trump gets re-elected in November, are y’all goin to whine and cry and spend the next 4 years on witch hunts instead of legislating and working for the American people like you were elected to do?
Wait wait wait here’s the truth: trump is a racist, child predator, child rapist, rapist, pedophile, immoral, homophobic, transphobic
McCarthy is a wanna be fart smelling dick just like trump

Well Trump needs to tell Russia to back off then.
CNN’s Don Lemon wonders what Trump would do if we started calling it ‘the Trumpvirus’ – Raw Story   That sounds like PRECISELY the correct term for it to me.  Let’s make it trend: #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirus
They’ll blame President Trump.
Trump promoted a doctor. Watch what she said about demons  via
He was immunocompromised because of colon cancer a while back. President Trump mentioned him with respect and sorrow.
Get this all you BLM supporters! When Bernell Trammell, a peaceful loving BLACK man was shot in cold blood in front of his BLACK owned business. BLM told his business partners who reached out to them for help that they won’t help them because he supported Trump! Hypocrites!

Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
I would disagree with your theory as to why Trump was elected. And the election will be far more than interesting, which implies an almost intellectual curiosity. There are real stakes here, for the world. May be too late too.
And trump does not care. Why can’t people see what
Repugnantcans were more outraged about the made-up, pretend “war on Christmas “, than they have been about trump’s idea to move the election.
Trump's Absentee vs. Mail-In Ballot Spin  via
Now some of my conservative coworkers are saying Trump is really a RINO and not a real conservative. Hell No! These cheerleaders and enablers own him and his legacy. I don't wanna hear it.
Maybe they delay the outcome calling all swing states into question, trump campaign sues, drags out Electoral voting into December, God knows
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn’t even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn’t have a clue but they deserve it. What’s that saying you reap what you sow.
Who said we were worrying about Trump's tweets? They're spot on.
lol.  no one believes your bullshit Rafael.  Energy costs to $65,000 lolol.  Your Donald Trump economy is in the toilet.  All the problems are happening on your watch.  Blaming future democrats for your problems is laughable.
Please all TRUMP FAMILY. EVERYONE!!
No. No he did not. We still have jobs leaving the country in droves. Maybe you should ask people who know things and not Trump.
Watching  make Zuck feel uncomfortable never gets old. I wanna see her debate trump.
More like little bitches that need their own bubble
So everything is fake news till it's something Trump likes, then all of a sudden it's true. Also the man wants to move the election yet wants children to go back to in-person classes
Apparently, someone did not pass third grade grammar! Where did you learn how to write...tRump University?
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction😂👎🏿
Impeach and remove Trump again and Barr at once.
What Trump is doing to the United States Postal Service is criminal.
Cotton, hope you go to the next tRUMP rally and make the same decision Cain did!
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
Does not want to go down with the ship, but he was glad to sail along ... hypocrite, cya maneuver.  You cannot wash off the stench of Trump that easily.  Sorry.
'Donald Trump killed Herman Cain': Liberals waste absolutely zero time politicizing Herman Cain’s death  and blaming Trump
She missed DACA under Obama. Trump ruined her second chance.
President Trump made a stop in Texas on Wednesday, visiting the Double Eagle Oil Rig in Midland. Correspondent Clayton Neville had more information on Thursday's WBAP Morning News.
I don’t remember Will’s criticism of any of this.
Herman Cain survived Stage 4 colon cancer (that spread to his liver), only to sacrifice himself on the altar of Trump's science skepticism.  Unbelievable.
Only thing you’re right about is no unjust murder being acceptable. But that’s not the point here or of BLM but you Trump loving idiots love to keep spewing it. Get some new material.
Alternative facts: When the real data just won’t do, try alternative facts. President Trump uses them every day, and now you can bring home your own alternative facts. Act now and pick up your crate of professional alternative facts from the Whitehouse Administration!
30 JULY, 2020 When will #CNN, #AC360, #Donlemon, #BrianStelter, #ChrisCuomo, and #JeffZucker all be held accountable for all the lies and smears against President #RealDonaldTrump, Conservatives, Trump supporters, and the American public?
Trump’s housing tweets, explained
My issue with Will is that he is ex-IC. He co-signed on way too many tRump attacks on our IC people and sources around the world. He knows better than most of how dangerous tRump has been to our national security and he will forever wear the Scarlett T as far as I’m concerned.

Anyone who works for trump is shady, unethical &amp; probably lying.
Prayers tonight for this to happen
I have an idea. When Trump loses, just let him stay in the White House. They have trashed the place. Throw some paper towels and toilet paper over the wall and just let them die in there. We will rebuild.
People liked Obama but he wasn’t exactly sporting a robust approval rating throughout his Presidency.  And if the GOP could have hand picked a 2016 opponent, I don’t buy that he’d have won either.  Beating Trump, how hard is that?!
Trump and his Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain......
Has anyone tracked the people that attended Trump’s rally in OK? How many are now ill or have passed?
For Obama to so forcefully push this NOW implies he knows Dems will successfully steal the election with their mail-ballot operation. I’m not convinced Trump’s team can thwart it.
The same Chinese that trump begged their president for help in the upcoming election...those Chinese? JFC you are not bright at all...🙄😂😂😂
7pm w/  Rep. Jim Jordan calls out Google for supporting Dems: "in spite of fact that you did it in 2016, Trump still won"; Poll: 40% of families more likely to homeschool after lockdowns end 📊; Local CBS news tests voting by mail. 📮 ➡️️
So your asking him to lose? He avoids Trump he wins by a landslide, he debates Trump and he loses and gets a ton of vids made of him like Jeb Bush did in 2016
So who’s fault is this? Was it because of pelosi who toured China town to say you and me that this virus is nothing? Or is it because trump who closed our nation for China?
It's very sad that you stand up for a conman and not the American people. A man who sold our soldiers for bounties.  When the truth comes out about Trump,  I'm going to contact you to see how you deal with it. Bless your soul.
I seriously think Trump wants out of office, I really don't think he wanted to ever be President.
154,000 dead 40 million unemployed  The economy in the 🗑 Protest on the streets Yeah your right vote for Trump 2020 if you like death and destruction 😂😂
"voting my conscience" by voting for someone that would do 90 percent of the things trump is doing but would be friendly about it.
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
IGNORE Donald. Some call him, “Treasonous Trump,” everyone else calls him “DIP-SHIT DONNIE.”He wants you to buy Prince Harry and M. Markel book.
Big tech lies about suppression of conservatives and efficacy of Hydroxychloriquine, crickets.... Roger Stone broke no law, but uttered a trivial error in memory and FBI raids his house at 6am in the morning.  This is why Trump will/must win
Look at Trump and his African American. Bet I know what he calls him behind his back.
And the people who can’t make rent should do whatever it takes to get by because they don’t believe in handouts lmaooooo  $7 million dollars could go to SO MUCH but that doesn’t matter when it comes to their lord and savior Donald Trump.
Trump is a dictator not a president 👎🏿👎🏿
Nice spin, my boy. You should be in politics. Donny Trump 👀
Trump is a laughing Stock no thanks 👎🏿
I assume you all knew this. It just seems eerie to me.  Donald Trump: born June, 1946 George W. Bush: born July, 1946 Bill Clinton: born August, 1946  3 presidents born in one 3 month period. (Of course, we would need to see Trump’s birth certificate to verify his birth info).

Just wondering,  did this black life matter?
Help me real quick. You’re not fond of Barack, and Michelle appears to bother you because she allegedly does anything to remain relevant. I’ve seen tweets about trump where you appear to not care for him either. Where do you stand? I’m curious.
President Trump make Hydroxychloroqui e available and stop the ban. It should be sold o er the counter as in other countries. Drs are refusing to prescribe it.
Yes, so? It's from the Bull Connor playbook and Trump is running a a Wallace/Nixon campaign.
Like Ford. Can't wait to find out what happened to all that missing Trump inauguration money. Gonna get juicy when he's out of office!
Cut it out man. Neither has done anything for the black community but you posted sone type of Trump statement as it were fact. Thats where the disagreement started. Stop getting sensitive when you're being challenged
If we delay the election, Trump’s term will still end on January 20th, 2021. Absent a new president-elect, America will revert back to the British Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II will become our sovereign. Does nobody bother to even read the constitution anymore???
You’re all talk with no action.  Why hasn’t anyone been subpoenaed? What tangible action will you do to make these politians accountable including your buddy McCain? You didn’t like trump when McCain was alive but since then you’re playing good guy to trump. It’s obvious
How do we truly know it’s reporting correctly.... it could easily be that trump is lowering the numbers to “make” it look better... still cases in Tarrant county really haven’t trended down
Trump 2020!!! God bless this President 🙏!!!!!
#Realrepublicans stand up, and against Trump. He is a RUSSIAN pawn, and continues to tell LIES. Do not trust him. He is a disgrace.
You did not close the borders totally as you allowed travel by Americans and their families from China. Trump, you should have closed all the US borders immediately and grounded domestic flights. There were and are, a lot of missteps by you and your administration.
Herman Cain, death lies directly at the feet of Donald J. Trump. Tulsa-No Mask. #COVID19

Dems all hate each other, just hate of Repubs/Trump unites. Still can't wait till more muslims and LGBTQ realize they are in the same party... wtf
Trump hates American soldiers. #TrumpTraitor
Maybe we should start saying the top military brass HAS NO BALLS, not even brass.. maybe trump neutered them too. Then they too would be COWARDS, with wha tails they have left between their legs.
Jeb, seriously, why are you here? You don’t matter. Trump neutered you and now like a good boot licker you support him. Sad!
The ignorant love Trump.
For any Trump supporters who follow this guy that’s cool! I say follow who you choose. Just know the truth
Trump is responsible for. LOTS of death. The plan book was right there. The plan that got us through H1N1 and Ebola. And he chose to ignore it and put peoples’ lives in danger because his pathetic, fragile little ego couldn’t accept that Obama is soooo much smarter than he is.
NO MASK. Trump does not care because anyone near him gets tested. Trump is safe while he let's 150,000 die. DUMP MALIGNANT TRUMP
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  😴
Following President Trump Tweet, Texas US Lawmakers Say They Don't Support Delaying November Election
Actually Herman Cain got the Trump Tulsa Virus
Unfortunately, defiantly going unmasked to a Trump rally was his latest claim to fame, so becomes becomes the title of his obit. Sad reality.
Hey occupant of the House chair...  You want school delayed. You want economic recovery delayed. You want hydroxychloroquine delayed. You want everything delayed.  Maybe President Trump is tight, let’s add the election to your list of delays.  🤣
120 days would take an election beyond January. The Senate would reduce by ⅓ on Jan 3 &amp; Dems would get the majority. They'd likely make Patrick Leahy the new pro tem. All House terms (including Pelosi's) end, too. On Jan 20, Trump's &amp; Pence's terms end.  Welcome President Leahy.
Bullshit Stop getting off the subject. You posted about what Trump supposedly did. I corrected you now you wanna talk about Obama. Every word you typed is an opinion. Whats your point genius
If you still support trump, not only are you showing your cards in terms of racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, sexism, transphobia &amp; MANY MORE systemically oppressed people... but you’re showing the world you’re intellectually challenged, willfully ignorant, &amp; a FUGLY DOUCHE.
Imagine how many dead Americans would have lived had you not compromised your honesty and ethics.  Wait!  You work for Trump.  You showed us who you are by working for him. #WrongSideOfHistory

I will vote for #JoeBiden on the first day of early voting in Texas. Apparently, just being 62 with underlying health conditions is not enough for me to qualify for an absentee ballot. No worries. I can’t wait to vote Trump out. #WeWillVote  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I don't know who 2 direct this 2 but will we someday see a "U.S. -vs- Trump Family" lawsuit? There is NO WAY they deserve the taxpayer supported services &amp; monies that are usually provided when an "official" leaves office.  Further, we should go after ALL of their assets. 🗽💰🇺🇸
If you don't like Trump, that's fine.  But don't call yourself a conservative if you are voting for the other side because given what they have openly showed us these past few months you would be voting for socialism and anarchy.
Wait until Spanky finds out that he really is a loser.
Trump sinking, rats jumping ship. Great Trump iceberg of undocumented Trump voters does not exist.
Give me one good reason why Trump would ever go to pay respect to someone who didn't respect him. JL refused to attend Trump's inauguration, And then all he wanted to do is impeach the President on a Hoax. If you were Trump Bob, would you go to an event to only get a coldshoulder
#DemonSpawn #TrumpImps By the way, you put politics ahead of the American people.  Your actions killed Americans.  Your compromising ethics to serve Trump, no matter the excuse, KILLED AMERICANS!
Trump likes them blonde, stupid and desperate.
Some actually think Trump is more articulate. No rational person can look at Obama and thinks he can't actaully speak intelligently without the aid of a teleprompter.
Cornyn is up for re-election at the same time as Trump.  Guess he wants people to associate him with the Cheeto.
You’re not going to be president because trump is going to cheat.

I know, but that message doesn't get the same sort of backlash. Lord knows it *should*, but saying that sort of thing won Trump an election.   Also, Barr know that if there's no election by January 20, it'l be President Patrick Leahy.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.

You found another tweet by someone who is falsifying trump as a fascist to support your argument. Way to go 👍🏻Opinion over facts, right? So whatcha going to do when Trump wins 300 electorals in November?
I initially thought trump got ahold of a sharpie 🖊 again?! 🤷🏼‍♀️
The Republicans don't want it to be made easy.
But we will not forget that #TrumpOnWheels kissed the ring and followed trump's implied advise initially. That put us 4-6 weeks behind. The deaths in that period will be calculable when we are past this. I hope they are all held accountable for their deadly shit decisions.
Of course, Trump was too busy to pay his respects at the Capitol ... only dropping the ball when it's inopportune ... or continually ... whichever is more frequent.
Tony DavisMAGA COUNTRY 🇺🇸 I don't know about everyone else but these lying scumbags made me physically ill watching them lie straight faced to Congress for the umpteenth time. Hopefully, Trump will take them down a peg in his second term.

Every resident of a state is traditionally counted during apportionment, but Trump last Tuesday issued a directive seeking to bar people in the U.S. illegally from being included in the headcount as congressional districts are redrawn.

This is, again, Trump saying the quiet part out loud.
Biden is getting 92 percent black support. Trump only getting 8 percent in 2020 yeah your so right Trump has done such a great job with Blacks 😂😂. Let’s delay the elections. The only man who says dumb stuff like that is when they know they will lose badly.

You can't even offer me any positive points on Trump. Sounds about right. That's why Trump doesn't represent the Republican Party - he may spout what you want to hear, but his actions fall short. He's a Russian political puppet. I will always support USA, and do not trust him
#trumppresser Q : How come Trump never catches #Covid19?  A: Covid19 is very rare in the non-human species.

For Covid-19 deaths, loss of income etc. Can people sue Trump's businesses?
The most amount of money you’ve ever received in your check thanks to trump. Obama isn’t even a citizen, he’s gay, and Michelle’s a man. He is also a part of the Jeff Epstein scandal and is a part of the lawsuit Hillary is going through for all them emails.
Idk im not for him. But Obama during his term deported thousands more than trump. And the ice facilities the way they are now is because of Obama. Not to mention Obama bombed countries left and right. Trump is brining light to the child trafficking pandemic and this is
Bless his Heart!! Fuck Trump!
where does Trump suggest Germany get their Energy if not from Russia??? who has it to sell to Germany and  can get it to them??? I'm sure Germany would have much preferred a different choice.
Trump isn't going to FIX what he has already destroyed, he  wants to destroy more and open many doors for Russia to move in.
You have no foreign policy experience.  Your motives are selfish.  You are only opposed because in your fantasy you think opposing Trump makes you a hero.  You’re not...you’re a fraud.

Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the Implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship  via
I really don’t give a 💩. Just sorry he didn’t pass it to trump.
You mean you can’t pass your bill with no money for people and lots of money for Trump’s pet projects?
FRIENDLY REMINDER: If Trump cancelled the election, Nancy Pelosi does not automatically become president on January 20th. House of Representatives would be vacant come January 3rd, thusly on Jan. 20th there would technically be NO speaker of the house to assume the presidency.
Cancelling/Postponing the election will not only end in a constitutional crisis, but I don't think Trump understands that the constitution holds that at Noon on January 20th, both him and Pence will be jobless if the election has not yet taken place.
We will vote and we will vote Trump, right Joe?
Wouldn't be great if they brought back  for one final episode where they surrounded the White House and dragged out a half-shaven Donald Trump in a wife beater and pajama bottoms and the last you saw of him was the in the back of the squad car with the closing credits?
Sue? We’re voting for Trump, even Joe knows it.
I'm going to miss when the Trump presidency is over and every expert he hired seems like they were the 50th caller to a radio station that morning.
A lot funnier people than me on here are dunking on Herman Cain (and rightfully so, may he rest in piss) but there's thousands more who have died of the 'Rona, all for Trump, and he will never know their names.  Shit, someone probably had to remind him who Cain was.
You are the actual disaster. The trump virus cannot be cured with your vile tweets.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on!
Trump wants it
Herman Cain is dead from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally without a mask... I spot 8 other black Republicans next to him. One was smart enough to wear a mask the rest think Trump is their god.   Stop politicizing Covid19 Black people, your lives matter!
But... why didn’t Trump give him his Hydroxychloroquine
He went to a Trump Rally without a mask and got Covid19 how is this BLM fault
Wait he died from Covid19 after attending a Trump Rally 👀 I wonder what excuse Trump will have this time... last time he said his friend should have lost weight
It would seem this experiment would Trump AG Barr opinion wouldn't it?
Obama fought for what he believed in and would not back down.  Trump does the same thing.  Mitt, rolled over, and still does whenever the Leftist press put pressure on him.
68% of “Trump voters” maybe.
In 2008 President Bush quipped that he’d rather be FDR than Hoover during his economic crisis.   President Trump has arguably replaced Hoover as a warning on how not to handle an economic crisis.

If you listen 2 Mary Trump's Interview &amp; read her book it speaks volumes of what a mad man we have in our Oval Office. It's crystal clear he's lying about the Bounty to protect Putin. Without ? Trump is THE biggest TRAITOR this country has seen in a long time.
Every time U get caught with your pants down U ALWAYS USE "A lot of People are Saying" YET we NEVER hear who these people are. It's a PATTERN-CHECK OUT TRUMP'S RECORD 2 PROTECT PUTIN:  #Helsinki #Kurds #Bounty #Germany INTENTIONALLY Endangers Allies-OUR Troops!
It boggles the mind ANY AMERICAN will even bother 2 listen 2 a Pathological LIAR over what Scientists &amp; Doctors have told us over and over. If Trump is talking about the virus just turn your TV off, quit listening 2 someone who's ALWAYS WRONG! Don't allow him 2 make U a statistic
Sadly there's a lot of people dying in this country we don't even know 4 sure if they died from the virus-because Trump has tried 2 take over all records 2 suit his own fancy 4 political reasons. Republicans think our public is naive-which is why its our job 2 educate the public.
If Texas had STAYED SHUT DOWN to begin with many of these people didn't have to die.  Trump has Shut this Government down for much less for a Racist Wall &amp; people like you embraced that.  What a hypocrite &amp; ignorant Fool.  Nothing but Partisan Reactionary Spin no one is buying.
PLEASE  IT'S TIME 2 speak out on the Massive Destruction Trump is imposing on our Planet. How much longer is our Party going 2 stand back-say nothing?  Jan 20th should include a heavy agenda 2 save what's left.    WE NEED A UNITED DEPT OF SCIENCE
How did he betray them on trade or immigration? Words have meaning,.. explain?  Who do you propose we put in office? Are you voting for Senseless Joe, he doesn't even know the day, the year or where he is.  What is your better plan? Grow up and stop your bitching, we need Trump.
Trump releases all his convicted friends so they don’t snitch on him. This administration is loaded with crooks and it’s only obvious to people w good common sense. It’s a shame what Donald has done to his bleach drunk supporters.
Democrats are the only ones who can fix back what you’ve destroyed. Republicans always do a terrible job when in control of office. Trump destroyed this country trying to undo everything Obama built. Crime boss bunker boy Trump is no good for Americans.  #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots
Nope, just telling the truth. The truth hurts  doesn’t it. Mr. Trump
Shoot  why not sooner if it's so important?  How long have you had the authority to do this?  One would think that it would have been done long ago unless this is a purely political move.  I'm not a Trump supporter so not saying it has anything to do with him.
It is so funny to read the apologists' comments about why this hasn't been done sooner.  My favorites are, "it's Trump's fault that Nancy didn't use her authority sooner".  You guys crack me up!

Is that the statement where Biden implied Trump was Xenophobic for restricting travel from China?
This is about as clear as it gets why we need President Trump out of office mostly from his own mouth and tweets! My personal opinion.
Sure build one next to a Trump Tower!!

Absolutely. I’m still able to say “fuck Trump”.

He established a council to restore black neighborhoods, he once dated a black woman, he granted clemency to Alice Johnson, he upgraded MLKs birthplace to a national park, he promotes HBCUs...Trump isn’t racist.
No kidding I felt the same way. Who knew that he would be such a GREAT President. If he could run I would vote for President Trump a fourth term. 🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Why would you blame Trump?

Trump isn’t a racist.
I'm voting for President Trump no matter what. (I will be doing this in person).
I am literally Terrified about the Election. No Rule of Law, Barr propagating trumps corrupt agenda and claiming falsely that Vote by Mail is fraudulent and will compromise upcoming election, admitting outwardly today that he will help trump Cheat!! I wish He could be impeached
The same person that starts all lies about Trump: Trump.
I see a lot of rage on Twitter, a lot of frustration, a lot of sarcasm and cutting remarks from my Bernie brothers and sisters. But what I don’t see is a viable plan, solution or alternative to letting Trump remain president for another 4 years...
Ok. What do we do? We vote Trump? Is that the change we want to see? Or we don’t vote? And Trump wins? Or we write in Bernie..anddddd Trump wins?
Bernie hasn’t ‘cheated’ on anyone. He ran a strong campaign, but SC and the American voter decided that getting rid of Trump was more likely with Biden as the nominee. Everything we hate about the Demstablishment is way way worse under Trump, so, we prioritize. That’s real life..
The BDN is going to put up a fight to get the platform changed; they may or may not succeed. But I’d ask you folks out there, who claim loyalty to Bernie but don’t trust his decisions when he makes them; Would y’all rather 4 more years of Trump? Politics= patience and compromise.

Y’all gonna flip shit when you learn that Obama, Bush, Clinton, Pence, Biden, and Trump are all on the same team.
Well either of them are no longer in office so we are lucky to have him. Also no other President has put more minorities to work than Trump. This reflects the Stock prices during their time in office but how many in the minority segment owned stocks?
I have noticed a lot of West Africans pandering to Trump and the right... there ancestors must have been slave sellers
That's ok.  Who the hell needs Hollywood!!  We're behind you and we live in Texas and are Trump supporters.
HQC isn’t a “big pharma” drug though...That’s also Trump’s message. It’s cheap, can be paid for even out of pocket for around $50 if needed, and big pharma doesn’t like it all.
One got on drugs and messed up his teeth and the other voted for Trump
On right now that Trump is getting what he deserves its time to blame Twitter and FB.
No, we don't and you are delusional thinking he's a good man. No one but Trump has ever said that unless he was paying them. And even then they were less than impressed.
By we, you mean you, yourself,  and I. Just like Trump talking about himself in the 3rd person. Selfish Pricks all around!
It isn’t a stretch at all. Why is Fauci changing what he says all the time? Because his people have told him to change to be against Trump.
Then what is Doctor Brian Proctor curing people with? It’s too bad you don’t like Trump...he keeps giving the right info out, you just don’t like him.

If Trump wins again, Covid will continue to last “somehow”, but if Biden wins, Covid will disappear around Feb 2021 right after Biden takes office.
No, you wouldn’t be so demanding “WHO IS YOUR DOCTOR???” to the other person...calm down Greta. Doctors ARE out there stopping C19 with HCQ and it works. Sorry Trump called it back in March, but just because you don’t like him doesn’t mean he can’t be right.
Across the board...If Trump loses in November, then Covid will be gone in February. If Trump wins, then Covid will still be here because there’s “always a reason to blame Trump” when he’s been touting HQC all along.
Fauci told Trump not to have people wear masks...remember?
People for Trump aren’t burning things...that’s BLM rioters. You’re confused.
Trump campaign accused of breaking federal campaign spending rules - Business Insider
Trump took it back in March. It works. They don’t want to be TRUMPED again!
That’s debatable. Take Chicago for example. Obama pumped millions of dollars into that city. Yes, Trump withdrew the remaining funding, but Chicago saw little to none of that money for improved infrastructure.
LMAO. I'm sure you've called out all the "false &amp; ugly attacks" on Trump.
I agree they need to set new rules. Stay away from federal buildings. See if feds retreat to federal building! If they follow people will see the lies from Trump!
Dancing all over my house when Trump loses.
Depends. It Trump wins, Covid continues...if Biden wins, *poof* it magically goes away and we’ve found a cure around February if he takes office.
If the US weren't such a biased partner anymore then of course it would be a worthwhile relationship. Even outside of Trump, the domestic &amp; external political realities in America are chauvinist and hysterical. Record homelessness/rent defaults &amp; we still give BILLIONS to Israel.

I seen the trump cut off and I knew all I needed to know
is actively stoking violent confrontations to keep the protests going. The only thing his campaign has got at this point is the ‘left wing radicals are coming for your suburbs’ narrative. Trump is attacking Americans for a photo op. We need to be talking about it
Trump just put his mask on and what do you see? The backtracking of these corporations. I’m going to wear a mask until things go back to normal because 1. I like how I look with one &amp; 2. Maybe folks will think I have it and will stay tf away from me😂

You are trying to build a career &amp; online following by parroting the same old bullshit. It didn’t work for Trump, who’s complete disregard for the Constitution and American lives have cost him the support of a majority of this country. I’d say it isn’t working for you either.

It's easy for liberal Zionists with money to use Trump as a bögeyman to enact a shared Zionist vision for the Middle East. It's clear that this is more important than Americans' quality of life, some will fuel antisemitism &amp; cause incidents like Pittsburgh to push more to Israel.
They're working together. Trump was necessary to advance goals quickly before the 70-90 year old Zionist boomer crowd with all the money and political clout dies off. Biden isna bigger Zionist than Trump, he's made Christian congressmen calling themselves "Zionist" a whole thing.
