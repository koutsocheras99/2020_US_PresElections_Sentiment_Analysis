I don't see why the ruling class would be better off with Trump as opposed to Biden, seems like Biden would be better for capitalism. That's why I would be surprised if there is any election delay.
This is certainly frightening out of context, but I think we're jumping to conclusions on the anarchist bit. Liberals think that anarchism is just about breaking things. While I have no doubt Biden would support the blanket oppression of anarchists, he's not calling for it here.
You are an embarrassment to the USA.  You know you are behind Vice President Biden in the polls and you're scared.  Postponing the election would be catastrophic for this country, as we need to get you out ASAP before the country gets any worse than it is now!

Right, but what is "technically" worse? Trump is worse in a variety of ways, but when I say Biden's worse, I'm just talking consequences. I'm talking about the overall direction of the country. Biden is kicking that vicious cycle into overdrive and it's going to be bad.
Especially because it's all lies. Biden's a white supremacist the left will have zero influence over, and Democrats like him have been incrementally making the country worse for the past forty years.
Biden's platform is by far the most left-wing in Dem history. The Intercept/DN/red rose folks are really in a huge bubble that sees "enemies everywhere." That an outside entity making trolly ads against your opponent represents some "quid pro quo" is Breitbart level quackery.

Why do it though when AOC, Omar, and Bernie have endorsed? What is to gain? It certainly advances no policy objective or political objective. Is it so she can say 10 years from now that she didn't endorse Biden?
