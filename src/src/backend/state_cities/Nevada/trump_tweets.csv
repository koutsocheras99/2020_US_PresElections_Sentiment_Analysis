The new postmaster general is just another Trump stooge put in his position for the sole purpose of aiding the Trump Administration corruption machine.
President Trump please tell me how a decrease in payroll takes is going to help unemployed people pay their rent and buy food to feed their families. Trump has no good ideas.
Nope. Majority of it went to..... Drum roll..... Joe Biden and the DNC!!! Because THEYY NEED IT! Not you! But they'll mk sure u get out of jail cuz they still need u to cause anarchy. Until they don't. Trump will win then you all will be in prison with no bail.
New York Magazine: U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump.   via
Trump is trouble
Former first laddie Michelle Obama says she's suffering from "low-grade trump derangement syndrome" due to the orange man bad pandemic, race relations in the US and the political strife surrounding it all, he says.
This is the work of our corrupt President Trump trying to tilt the election in his direction by impacting mail-in voting. On Nov. 3, America needs to put Trump in its rear-view mirror.
I was anticipating a Trump loss.  I did the silent cheer when he won.
Once AGAIN Don 'The Lifelong Con' Trump wanting to take credit for something that already exists.  #EgoManiac #Megalomaniac
Trump is using these THUGS to intimidate &amp; brutalize #BLM Protesters!
I’m sure, once again, you have no argument, no proof, no rebuttal. All you do is call Trump names bc you are a sheep to the media, w/ nothing to back up what you’re calling him, accept an unimportant Bristish article. Can’t argue w/ stupid. Bye bye
If U think that Biden comes off as honorable, respectable, coherent, intelligent and as a leader in that video, there is no hope for U. Liberals have no basis on Y Biden would be a good president. Only reason U will vote for him is bc U want Trump out. Worst reason to vote 4 som1
OMG A chip off the old block Like #Trump this dumb ass piece of crap knows nothing about what he's doing and now will run all those who most likely do out of office He will destroy #USPS
Frost/Nixon Trump/Swan  taking odds...  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
I never expected a Trump presidency, but now that it is here I couldn't imagine it any other way.
Yes, Trump is a more dangerous political figure but Joe Biden is also a very dangerous political figure who won’t change a thing for the average American here in Nevada. He’s not a change candidate he’s the keep things the same keep us in war candidate.
Trump2020! The only one deflecting is you. I brought up Obama to some1 else and YOU responded to me w/ a tweet about Trump. I wasn’t talking about Trump, so why are you deflecting and bringing him up to me? Anything so you don’t have to admit Obama kept kids in cages. Pathetic
Forget the elections: Let's split the country in half. Democrats/Biden can have the left coast. Republicans/Trump can have the east coast.
Well shit. I detested trump in 2016 and voted for Hillary, whom I did not like. Now I'll  have to vote for Biden, whom I kind of like.
Sharon, I agree wholeheartedly with everything you said.  People like this say they are fighting for the children, which I support 100%, but the second you say Trump was part of it, they defend him.  The left will say everyone involved should be prosecuted, but the right won’t.
Why do trump supporters love fake news so much

I hope this woman was the first one in line screaming over her constitutional rights when Trump said he wants to move the election down, which goes against the constitution!! Who does this woman think she is?
You know: Yes, Trump and his buddies are crooks, but that was clear from the beginning  Dem Leadership, allowing this to happen, not putting in place a system that this wasn't possible in the first place, being punked by Mnuchin etc. ... that's almost as bad.  It was foreseeable

Typical. Deflect and change the subject. Actually, this thread was about Biden and YOU turned it into being about Trump😂😂 but trump... but trump. I brought up Obama to some1 else and you replied, so it is about Obama now. Admit you don’t care about the children.
The CCP doesn't want Trump reelected. No sh_t! Why because they claim he's unpredictable! Again No sh_t. They have had every president since Nixon Dancing to their tune, and always benifiting them the most. The didn't expect Trump to have a backbone. Can we expect that of Biden?
Doesn’t take away the fact that Obama built and used those cages too. You all pretend to care about the children, but didn’t care about them when Obama did it. You only care about taking down Trump. Your tweet just solidified that. Pretty disturbing
And you show me this right as Trump’s about to ban the damn thing??!! Gee thanks...
Trump's entire term has been a blunder
And. Either to Garth and Trump!
Coincides with everything Mary Trump wrote in her book
She needs to go sit in the hall with all of the conspiracy theory sheep and Trump sheep.
400 pages of it from the fbi in the 70s 😂😂
He finally figured out that it doesn't what he surrenders these thugs demand more. And yes America is watching. So many Dems have been sitting on their hands blaming Trump for state governments failure to enforce the law. Americans need to learn CIVICS. Start with Pelosi/Biden
Also before he dismissed the pandemic as a hoax, every news source that isn't far right propaganda was saying that Trump should order a national quarantine.
That makes Murphy the racist. He's obviously insinuating that only colored people can be for low-income housing. I don't know if Trump is racist but this doesn't help your case against him. He is at-worst an man-child.
Sounds like you’re talking about Trump.

The moron know as Donald Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
You have to admit that whenever President Trump talks he answers all questions even assclown questions from Acosta, may not be the answers you want. But you can NOT say that about Biden, he wont even let you ask softball questions as he hides, WHY? I forgot, you work for the DNC.

You can like trump unless you like trump therefore you can’t like trump
So many are under the illusion that a vote for Joe will cure racism. I hate to burst that bubble but Donald Trump didn’t create racism! Contributed yes but it was here long long before him. This is a multi century crisis.
Over 20 women have accused Trump of rape  &amp; sexual assault. His helping Epstein victim in 2009 means nothing. It's a cover: in his twisted mind, the law applies to everyone else but not him.
Yes, so stop playing the game. When I bring up reasons why I don’t want Trump to be President, stuff like the fact that he can’t pronounce Yosemite is not what I talk about. I bring up things like he’s had 160,000 Americans die on his watch from Covid, with no end in sight.
Great 7 minutes:   black voters for Trump Enlightenment !
Did people blame the governors for Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy, no they blamed Bush and Obama.  When an US doctor returned with the ebola who did people blame, not the New York Governor... but Obama.  Only with Trump has this "Blame the governors" for disasters been a thing.
I'd wait in line for 8 hours to vote for a sack of wet leaves to get Trump out.  So for Biden? Maybe.
Exactly. trump paid them to be there.
Because birds of a feather, Trump has no friends or was ever loved by anyone including family. His hangers on would throw him under the bus as he would do them. Read Mary Trump’s book.

It’s true and your comment about Hillary has already been proven fake by several sources about 3 years ago. Get with the times and stop posting lies.
Hot mic 🙄Really 🤨 If you heard it it’s because Trump wanted you to hear it. He plays you like a fiddle 😆😆
Trump trolls randomly coming to my profile thinking I'm gonna entertain their bullshit, NOPE. This is my space, go spread your feces in your own space.
And Trump’s intimate relationship with Putin, who was putting a bounty on the heads of our soldiers, and sharing intelligence, makes him a better choice for 4 more years? This is NOT a friggin game boys and girls. 💙🇺🇸❤️🇨🇦💔
I love how he calls it "hot mic" as though they caught something juicy that Trump doesn't say to the world all the time, practically daily. Poor Jim.
The best part for me is the country club members sitting there as Trump straight makes shit up.  They know he's lying. He knows he's lying.

I bet if you actually did a honest comparison of who is actually racist Trump or Biden. Unfortunately Biden wins that distinction. So besides the fact that you just hate Trump, which is absolutely fine. Find a honest way of doing it though.
How does it feel to be a puppet of the dictator trump.
Still nothing about massive gatherings of protesters though. Bunch of fucking hipocrites. Coronavirus doesn’t affect protesters, but it does affect everything else. What in the fuck does Donald Trump have to do with a 80 year old tradition. Please enlighten me
Too little, too late. Wheeler already handed the election to Trump, the House and the Senate.  Democrats inaction backfired.

Let’s see who’s the better businessman; Trump only had to pay $130k to Daniels, Slick Willie paid $800k to Jones....
Pretty simple, dolt....it’s a-holes protesting and rioting because trump is president...not for any particular cause. But just because he’s president. This is what you tardos do. But you already know that
Which is even stranger when you consider the pre-Trump era R’s all swore by things like fiscal responsibility and small government. Meanwhile, Trump just steals money and uses DHS to attack people he dislikes. Still fully supported by The R senate. It’s actual insanity.
Honestly this is election interference plain and simple. Even if Trump didn’t authorize it this man is clearly doing it in support of him. But obviously Trump authored it! Just days before basically saying he would!
I’n sure everyone appreciates your attempt at ... civility? But we’re just so far past that. There ARE other countries who handled it better and even with the economic hit they did better by far than we did. Trump lieing about masks&amp;cures has caused MANY people to spread it more.

The fact the republicans support this madness is hilarious. Your point is taken though, Republicans constantly complain about everything Obama did, but love it when trump does the same thing but slaps his name on it. Good chat.
Just pointing out the fact that the Trump Administration is actively suing to repeal the Afordable Care Act, while simultaneously issuing an executive order to keep protections for pre-existing conditions. You think healthcare is expensive now, just you wait. It’s comical.
Played 'bottom half winner'  1.95. So marginally beating the number, and the bottom half is still stacked compared to the top half. But while Trump is alive and kicking, so is the top!
Trump has gone his entire life thinking that the rules do not apply to him.
Trump is literally trying to take credit for Obamacare now.
Trumps English is broken, but not unintelligible. Biden, on the other hand, is just plain BROKEN. Can’t speak, can’t campaign, won’t interview for more than 10 mins at a time, and has no clue where he is at any given moment. I’ll take trump 7 days a week &amp; twice on Sunday

It’s both. When Schumer and Pelosi start caving in to Trumpiblican demands they don’t help the left at all. They just perpetuate a R belief that they can get away with anything. Pelosi didn’t even want to impeach Trump. Both of them believe the R’s are going to suddenly be fair.

Trump wants to win so bad he’s now taking notes from Obama. I hope y’all know this is a strategy to win the election and a bunch of fake promises. Notice the small changes he’s been doing lately. He wants to win democratic votes. It’s a game.
We’re not just fighting TRUMP - We’re fighting PUTIN too!!!
So let's say you have 60% of the nation agreeing Trump is an outright enemy of the people sitting in the White House.  BUT you have 30% vote for one alternative and 30% vote for another - you then have 40% voting for Trump.  Despite your agreement he has to go, he still wins.
Ah a very interesting take - Jerry clearly has some sexual “issues” that Trump might have used to his advantage!!!
One of the bad things about the Trump Presidency that doesn't get talked about is people looking back on the Obama Presidency with nostalgia  But at least this gif is kinda relevant again
Unfortunately, Trump lumps assholes like this with peaceful protesters. There is a big difference between attempted arson &amp; murder and peaceful protesters. Not everyone who protests is a radical leftist. Most want to keep things peaceful. These guys have no such intent.
If you pick Susan Rice I fear your chances of winning dwindle.  She will be looked at as another Obama Era and Bengazi will haunt you and trump will do enough with her to win the election..those are my thoughts but i fear I won't be wrong if you pick her.

Trump didn't involve us in Neocon Wars, W did. Trump revived the economy, reformed trade &amp; demanded that our NATO partners pay their dues. W caused the implosion of the world economy in 2008. Trump is America First; W a globalist stooge. Trump appointed Conservatives to SCOTUS.

I don't give Trump much, well anything, but what the PNW Youth Liberation Front (slogan No cops. No prisons. Total abolition.) did Weds in PDX was awful. They tried to burn a police station down after locking police inside. The peaceful group of BLM protesters were not involved.

Lol.  He's one of the reasons we American manufacturers don't exist anymore...  Build China back better is what you mean.  You can't out Trump, Trump.  Need a new slogan.
I can’t imagine why he’d even be bothered with Trump.
Trump installed this Postmaster because he needs USPS to fail then he can contest the election results if Biden wins.
Here is President Trump's full speech today in Bedminster, NJ. Enjoy!
New kneepads are in order..  She is so unlikeable that this guarantees a Trump reelection.
Are they peacefully protesting BLM while simultaneously giving Trump Corona? I hope so bc this is the only way I will accept this.
This is the nicest I’ve seen trump be to a reporter ever.
TRUMP GOING TOO LEAVE AMERICA IN
They played a game of chicken with all of our votes, and unfortunately they won. It breaks my heart, however I know the best thing for humanity is to vote trump out. Hold your nose and vote Biden. ❤️
Hey Republicans... Even Lindsey Graham is secretly voting for Joe Biden. He hates Trump, but is just scared Donald will out him. It’s ok Lady G, everyone already knows.   #RepublicansForBiden #RVAT2020
Dylan won’t be able to walk down the street. President Trump is saving these poor children. He’s such an ungrateful POS!
Ima pull up to a Trump rally like this 😂😂😂😂
What has been Christian about Trump at any point? The casino owning, trump university scamming, mob tied, extreme racist? Have we lost all sight of who Christ was? Could you protest more for your cause than getting nailed to a cross? Christ was a revolutionary progressive.
He eats his steak well-done, thinks taco salads are authentic Mexican. Know who attended elite universities and knew how to wear a suit and use chopsticks? This guy. Bourdain was blown away by  sophistication. Trump is Queens white trash.
Any other option is a throwaway vote and a throwaway vote is only possible if you are OK with the failure of the impeachment process to work simply because you have a jury of pre-biased party members engaged in the vote.  You absolutely cannot get worse than Trump - he needs 2go!
9 million new jobs over 3 months for 30 million unemployed. That’s not strong. Based on reports Trump has lost $8 million in office, since those numbers are based on assets we know about, (hotels, property and golf courses) shouldn’t he have made money in such a good economy?
JOE, he listens to the women around him! Unlike Trump
Would that also mean that Trump doesn’t have to worry about the College vote?
Thank you President Trump. You are the best president ever!
Final sentence could work for the entire trump presidency. In this particular case it’s just totally obvious pandering to sign an exec order for something popular that’s already on the books
In the next cycle of huge news, we're gonna hear about how Trump signed an executive order granting minorities the right to vote, even though his party tried to obstruct that in Kentucky and Georgia.
That damned Trump just snapped his fingers and put everyone out of work for the lulz.  Nothing else happened and no one else had control over the things that left to this unemployment rate.  Just Trump being Trump, amirite?
Not all Biden voters are Biden supporters.  He just happens to be anyone but Trump.
Biden May LOSE the BLACK VOTE as Trump CRUSHES Him on His Latest Racial ...  via
Trump is getting more deranged by the minute. His idiotic self just cant help from putting a foot in his mouth every single time he opens it. Pathtetic
I said this three months ago he needs to be kicked right Square in the Nutsack put him in a closet through the away the key he's getting paid under the table from somebody to be negative and go against Trump on any thing that he says that's positive.
Seen a sign that said “women for trump” yeah y’all finished 🤣
Sorry Trump 2020, get over it, He will be our next president, Just work with him, and things will work out
With all due respect, no but tRump does define lying #eyeswideopen
Trump is deranged. PERIOD
The military has been doing mail in voting for a long time. Please don’t spread misinformation. We get enough of that from Faux news and Trump doing nothing but lie.  or is the military wrong too?
why does brett favre have to explain why he golfed with donald trump?!
I particularly like the part where he says it must stop.  Not because it's wrong or evil but because it will help Trump's campaign.  So if that wasn't the case would it be okay?
Tonight has been a breaking point. I am in process to try to get the fuck out of Dodge &amp; because of Impeached President Trump’s ignoring of a possible health threat, I may have to stay here and deal with the inconsiderate people who don’t want to wear masks
TRUMP’s sabotage of USPS is literally putting more lives in damaged!  High risk folks getting their meds by mail are being targeted!!!
Trump will win 2020
Are there any REAL Republicans out there who have the backbone to stand against Trump? I'd follow them.
Anyone want to remind  about the Postal Act of 1792? And which POTUS signed it into law?  Hint: His initials were GW. What Trump, DeJoy, and  are doing is unconditional and would piss off the Founding Fathers.
I don't care about the parents. I am worried about the children. Incredibly irresponsible just like idiot Trump.
Goodnight to you as well!  Wow, I think your link was to the wrong document.  The document shows that there was Russian collusion.  I guess Trump really should have been removed from office.
Trump is a media whore!
Could it be that  is a #Trump supporter? Who is he? Why does he feel the need to hide? #LasVegas
I am totally NOT surprised!
Pelosi and Schumer aren’t willing to come to the table- Trump has to do the legislating himself- he wants to help Americans
Trump does Bernie!    via
trump is useless and is deliberately working to see the collapse of the U.S.  These democratic ran cities and states belong to the U.S., but trump has decided their value for all Americans. #AmericaIsComing ☠
Yeah that didn’t boomerang, sycophant.  Post all the memes you want but it doesn’t change the fact that Trump has had four years (including two with a Republican majority in BOTH houses of Congress) and has accomplished nothing but making himself and his cronies richer.
I'm sure they are a proud Trump voter!

Not what they care about, Trump is trying to take the health care away, he won't get the speed rapid testing. Over 160,000 people have died and Trump has not done one damn thing to save people's lives, and to protect kids going to school. All people get is Mass deaths and lies,
They're doing what they can to see another day, it's wrong people have to risk their lives going to the store, going to school and work. Trump and GOP politicians proved to the American people they don't care about them, they put the health and safety of the people behind the

You know I find it very hilarious that you have all this trash to talk about Trump why don’t you turn that magnifying glass on yourself you racist piece of garbage More you talk the more your lack of intelligence shows
Both sides do not say the same thing. I just said I would  be happy with two Rs (JK and MR) and even included a 3rd in McConnell! Would Trump fans do the same and be okay with Bernie, Yang or Warren? Doubtful.

How the Pandemic Defeated America  "Trump is a comorbidity of the COVID‑19 pandemic. He isn’t solely responsible for America’s fiasco, but he is central to it. A pandemic demands the coordinated efforts of dozens of agencies."

Right, and if Trump were racist, he would never had signed the “FIRST STEP ACT” to reform the criminal justice system that disproportionately affected African Americans during the Clinton-era crime bill. Trump is giving 1000s of unfairly sentenced black inmates a second chance

Not healthy to be that heavy as a child. Only will get worse. There's Anderson trying to figure how he can blame Trump.
Donald Trump is not able to come up with any health plan. It is beyond him. He almost destroyed Obama care but knew it will be too much burden for him to tackle and he didn't touch it. He can slam it all he wants but had no resource to come up with a better plan.
Trump goes further than the Democrats said thy would to help Americans in need and the Media $hits itself trying to process the announcements.
If Trump isn’t truly evil, he plays it well on TV. An Emmy is in his future.

I am upset that  money is un accounted for and those victims deserve every penny of that. Our Governor is a liar! He is a thief. He is also destroying this city more and more as each day passes. My statement had nothing to do with Trump. I never mentioned him. Why did you?
STOP WORRYING ABOUT TRUMP Governor Sisolak your History of evil continues, hoarding meds through “pandemic”! let’s not forget the $12million(Commissioner at the time) that you stolen from the October 1 2017 Go-fund-me intended for victims! God knows it all &amp; Nevadans never forget
Sleepy joe doesn’t like to questioned about anything, answered:” come on man” P/losi answered,are you GOP advocate. The sore losers dems communist going crazy because they know the polls are fake. Hillary experienced it very well. Thank you Mr. President Trump for MAGA.
That’s good to know. I’m voting for him—no question. My friends are voting for him. But I keep running into people who still like Trump...
Trump plans to suspend payroll tax, reinstate eviction moratorium
Trump is the greatest!
Trump would lose that one bigly
Loved it. At least he’s not hiding. Biden is a complete disaster and his handlers are afraid to let him out. Trump will beat him
States ask that Trump's district drawing order be stopped  Our freedom is in danger!
The real Donald J Trump.  A whiny little man. November 3rd is his time to go!

Trump jokes in 90s sitcoms did not age well lol
Trump has NO IDEA where real people live
trump is sewer slime.
Reading all the comments praising Trump for announcing a law that already exists in the Affordable Care Act, and that he is coincidentally fighting to end in court, is peak America in this Administration.
China fears President Trump, not because he's unpredictable, but because he has warned the world about china's designs on world domination! Whilst Biden has sold out to China!
Stop Donald Trump. Vote on November 3rd!
Spewing Russian talking points. You know once Trump is gone you will be lose too. #traitor
That was classic Trump!!! FABULOUS!!
We know where the trump viruscamr from
We seem to lose sight of the fact that Hillary and the DNC has paid for and used information solicitated from foreign governments on Trump in 2016. They are still trying to spread fake news. They are really desperate.
You know this is exactly what Trump and DeJoy want to happen, right?
If u think orange beast is going to help you lower drug prices, let me burst your magical bubble. Drug companies will be raising all international prices to match that of the US prices. Trump is on the side of greedy drug companies.
This is how the Kanye stuff will hurt Trump in the long run. They're just not seeing the field clearly in their hubris.
Trump needs to RESIGN NOW! Sick of his B$ &amp; wasting millions of our valuable tax dollars.
No, tRump sheep blame China. NORMAL people blame tRump for his abject failure to control the virus, denying science, not mandating masks, politicizing aid and being an all around waste of space. #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Kanye admitted he's working with republicans to be a spoiler and help trump win again. He's already committed fraud. He had one person fill out hundreds of signatures and has a bunch of electors that live at the same address.
If  is elected, I want him to do 5% of what Trump has been able to get away with. Not because I'd approve of it, but watching  &amp;  lose their shit would be worth it.

A comment toward one person is nothing close to a comment re an entire race.  But you know that. You're a smart man. But you are also hyperbolic, agitating and a provocateur.  You make far more troubling statements than our President.
Kanye is completely in on it. He admitted he's trying to be a spoiler and help trump.
😂😂 fuck trump but with ✨style⚡️😌💖
Does every woman who works for Trump always wear cocktail dresses to work?
Kanye admitted that he's trying to be a spoiler and help trump. He had one person fill out hundreds of names and has a bunch of "electors" that live at the same address. Major fraud.
Trump is SO DESPERATE for media attention!!!
NJ police should shut this down. If nothing else to get the children out of this damn petri-dish. To hell w/ the rich parents that are foolish enough to believe in Trump. I don't want a child to die due to their stupidity. Time will tell.
My guess is that Trump held that political rally at his golf course tonight because he wants to distract us from this bigger and much more consequential news. #USPS
She’s behaving like a goddam divisive idiot.  She &amp; other Trump cronies have politicized a health pandemic which has continued to excerbate the increasing # of cases &amp; deaths!  We’re over 160K deaths.  LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS NOT TRUMP!!  Kelly Anne knows better - she’s dangerous
Trump is drawing "YUGE" crowds this year.
To hell w/ the parents. I am concerned about the children. When one of his club members loses a child from attending this rally will they regret attending &amp; believing in Trump? Not wishing for any of them to die, but they are tempting fate. Many of them put on masks way too late!
Thank you Pookz for the Patriot ride Trump 2020 landslide #IFBP 🦅🇺🇸🦅follow the Conductor  Stronger Together
Explainer: Trump wants to bypass U.S. coronavirus aid talks with executive order. Can he?
Honest question: Does NJ actually make exceptions in those cases, or is this just Trump spouting nonsense as usual? (If they do, that's dumb, but it wouldn't actually surprise me that much.)
Microsoft are in talks to buy TikTok after Donald Trump said he wanted to ban the app
U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. U.S. officials also assess that China prefers that Trump not win a second term.
Just finished listening to President Trump's press conference, and I just LOVED the closing scene.  A snotty reporter asked about lots of people in the room not wearing masks, and President Trump put it down with "They are exempt - They are peaceful Protesters"
It wasn't turned "into a rally" it was a rally disguised as a news conference like all the rest of them paid for w/ our tax dollars. Trump needs to RESIGN.
Oh good God!  That’s exactly why Trump had them there.  This whole thing was wrong on so many levels.
Will trump actually debate Joe Biden?
At this point anyone can float an idea to trump on the golf course and two hours later he issues an Executive Order.
Trump has supported PEC since his campaign. Obamacare was a purchasing mechanism that limited the insurance options to boilerplate plans with stupid high deductibles. Totally ruined the small group and individual health insurance market. So, no, Trump isn't reinstating the ACA.
Trump just said his event was exempt from New Jersey’s coronavirus rules because political events are exempt and it’s also a peaceful protest. 😂 #Trump #PeacefulProtest
Reporter: where will you get the money for the unemployment benefits without congress?  Trump: we have the money
They're violating COVID-19 restrictions - this should be shut down now. Trump could care less about anyone &amp; enjoys wasting our tax $'s. His condolences are hollow &amp; meaningless. Trump must RESIGN! $'s spent on this could go a long way to feed the hungry &amp; shelter the evicted.
Trump just dropped some nice presents for err body :)
So this prick is at his golf club addressing the nation ???!!!! You are a walking POS Trump
trump supporters should be gifted this plaque
Thank goodness Donald Trump is here to school me subjects I already know, but that he didn't know until 5 minutes before speaking.
Answering a reporter's question, President Trump says executive orders could be signed by 'the end of the week'. He says he expects to be sued over the legality but that lawyers say it's doable. He wouldn't put a $$ amount on the enhanced unemployment
Prescription prices are higher now that when Trump took office. He promised to lower them in his first year. Another failed Trump promise.
Oh and yeah I voted for Trump and voices like yours are the exact reason why. You’re also the reason I and a lot of others will do the same this round.
All at the expense of tax payers. Plus, he is violating COVID-19 restrictions. Campaign rally disguised as a presser - Trump needs to foot the bill for security. We need our tax $'s to protect people from the virus not expose them. To hell w/ the parents concerned about the kids.
Trump? WTF are you talking about? How does Trump have anything to do with this evil piece of shit stealing millions of dollars from the October mass shooting victims? You approve of stealing money through a go fund me that was intended for shooting victims? Really?
This is a good read!Or in my case, listen (audible).  Stevens argues that Trump didn’t hijack the GOP,but rather IS the GOP in its purest form- a party of white grievance.  Family values🤣, Fiscal responsibly 🤥.  He’s from Miss, worked for the late Jon Hinson- he would know

Wtf? Projecting your own inadequacies onto others. The Trump defense.
Yes because the virus can differentiate between fifty people not wearing masks standing shoulder to shoulder that are Trump supporters vs fifty people not wearing masks standing shoulder to shoulder that are protesting.
I realize being in your position as Governor has to make a statement and call out Trump on his actions. But, he doesn't care for anyone other than himself! I believe he'd throw his own children under the bus if it benefits him! SAD!

To be fair, Mormons seem to stick to their principles more readily than evangelicals — it's why Trump is not popular in Utah.  Might have something to do with the fact that they've been persecuted for what they believe and evangelicals pretty much never have.
Well, since Joe is not actually picking, she absolutely must be a radical, a socialist (otherwise she would not be selected). And if she is overly ambitious, a loudmouth or emotional then we will all see it, right? Trump can be vulgar. Aside from that, you’re wrong.
Your guy is the one running propaganda on his Twitter page, Trump 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, etc... that doesn’t bother you? Selective outrage...

Trump’s desperate attacks are revealing the scam Republicans have been pulling for years.
We're in the pot. Getting hot enough to kill more and more of us. Trump and his party are turning the heat up not down.
Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats are going to try to cancel Christmas, they have for years, Trump brought the greatness of Christmas back, we have to protect Christmas and America, Re-elect President Donald J. Trump
It isn’t a binary choice though. Trump doesn’t have to be less racist, just to make Joe look racist enough to either suppress voter turnout like he and Russia did in 2016 or detour voters from Biden to Kanye as they did with Johnson and Stein in 2016.
The overlords on the left want to disrupt the republican convention with violence so that the message is diluted. Trump should be smart enough not to let the left know where he will be.
This. So many of them acknowledge Trump is bad, but then they'll post lists like "here's who I endorse in the Senate contests" and I see a ton of senators who are just as racist as Trump is, and many who have actively helped him dismantle institutions.
He's just sick of Trump. We all are, so I can't be that mad at him.
Mitch has cheated all these years, the Russians aren't just helping Trump, how can we protect against this foreign interference?

This slight of hand lie is what passes for conservatism in Donald J Trump’s RepubliQ party. Of course people pronounce words differently in other countries with differing accents. Donald did not know that. He mispronounces words because he can’t read.
When  and his RepubliQ party enablers aren’t busy stealing valor or denigrating and retaliating against veterans, former POW and those still serving, they act without integrity, without honor, and without courage.   Donald J Trump lacks the moral prerequisites to command.

If Biden wins and accomplished nothing else than eradicating Trumpalo corruption from the Federal government and making our economy, foreign affairs, and the ACA functional again he will be a success. If he works with congress to prevent another Barr and Trump, he’ll be great.

That's his incentive for doing WHATEVER he has to to make Trump the winner.
I recently saw the brain dead Mayor of New York is wanting to impose quarantine checkpoints at various places throughout the city? It's always funny how if Trump were to do some shit like this he would be called a tyrant!
He’s going to get clobbered. You saw how well it worked out for Hillary running on the “I’m not Trump” position went.
Oh what the fuck ever,, I find it very hard to believe the former first lady of the United States is dealing with any form of depression because of Trump,, boy they are pulling out all these stops aren't they??

7. There are further considerations for Twitter as well. First it’s been trying however unsuccessfully to create a friendlier platform. If your point in trying to get a topic to trend is because it will own the libs or get under Trump’s skin, you’re creating a hostile platform.
2. It’s in no ones interest if Donald Trump or Beyoncé can determin for the entire platform what trends at #1 simply by tweeting to their massive follower lists. Twitter appears to require more than that for a topic to trend. Likely a combination of a variety of factors.
I was thinking about that earlier today. Two things that will be extremely difficult to get past congress and a new president have to happen if we’re fortunate enough to vote Trump out. 1. Punishment to deter both candidates and donors. 2. Constitutional amendments to

And those priorities didn't come with Trump and it is not only republicans who are responsible. The system has been for something other than the welfare of the people, the common good for a fucking long time. It needs to be destroyed or revolutionized-probably same thing.

I’m sure, once again, you have no argument, no proof, no rebuttal. All you do is call Trump names bc you are a sheep to the media, w/ nothing to back up what you’re calling him, accept an unimportant Bristish article. Can’t argue w/ stupid. Bye bye
If U think that Biden comes off as honorable, respectable, coherent, intelligent and as a leader in that video, there is no hope for U. Liberals have no basis on Y Biden would be a good president. Only reason U will vote for him is bc U want Trump out. Worst reason to vote 4 som1

Trump2020! The only one deflecting is you. I brought up Obama to some1 else and YOU responded to me w/ a tweet about Trump. I wasn’t talking about Trump, so why are you deflecting and bringing him up to me? Anything so you don’t have to admit Obama kept kids in cages. Pathetic
Forget the elections: Let's split the country in half. Democrats/Biden can have the left coast. Republicans/Trump can have the east coast.
Well shit. I detested trump in 2016 and voted for Hillary, whom I did not like. Now I'll  have to vote for Biden, whom I kind of like.
Sharon, I agree wholeheartedly with everything you said.  People like this say they are fighting for the children, which I support 100%, but the second you say Trump was part of it, they defend him.  The left will say everyone involved should be prosecuted, but the right won’t.

Doesn’t take away the fact that Obama built and used those cages too. You all pretend to care about the children, but didn’t care about them when Obama did it. You only care about taking down Trump. Your tweet just solidified that. Pretty disturbing
Trump's entire term has been a blunder

Also before he dismissed the pandemic as a hoax, every news source that isn't far right propaganda was saying that Trump should order a national quarantine.
That makes Murphy the racist. He's obviously insinuating that only colored people can be for low-income housing. I don't know if Trump is racist but this doesn't help your case against him. He is at-worst an man-child.

The moron know as Donald Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
You can like trump unless you like trump therefore you can’t like trump
So many are under the illusion that a vote for Joe will cure racism. I hate to burst that bubble but Donald Trump didn’t create racism! Contributed yes but it was here long long before him. This is a multi century crisis.
Over 20 women have accused Trump of rape  &amp; sexual assault. His helping Epstein victim in 2009 means nothing. It's a cover: in his twisted mind, the law applies to everyone else but not him.
Yes, so stop playing the game. When I bring up reasons why I don’t want Trump to be President, stuff like the fact that he can’t pronounce Yosemite is not what I talk about. I bring up things like he’s had 160,000 Americans die on his watch from Covid, with no end in sight.
Great 7 minutes:   black voters for Trump Enlightenment !
Did people blame the governors for Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy, no they blamed Bush and Obama.  When an US doctor returned with the ebola who did people blame, not the New York Governor... but Obama.  Only with Trump has this "Blame the governors" for disasters been a thing.
I'd wait in line for 8 hours to vote for a sack of wet leaves to get Trump out.  So for Biden? Maybe.

Trump trolls randomly coming to my profile thinking I'm gonna entertain their bullshit, NOPE. This is my space, go spread your feces in your own space.
And Trump’s intimate relationship with Putin, who was putting a bounty on the heads of our soldiers, and sharing intelligence, makes him a better choice for 4 more years? This is NOT a friggin game boys and girls. 💙🇺🇸❤️🇨🇦💔
I love how he calls it "hot mic" as though they caught something juicy that Trump doesn't say to the world all the time, practically daily. Poor Jim.
The best part for me is the country club members sitting there as Trump straight makes shit up.  They know he's lying. He knows he's lying.

I bet if you actually did a honest comparison of who is actually racist Trump or Biden. Unfortunately Biden wins that distinction. So besides the fact that you just hate Trump, which is absolutely fine. Find a honest way of doing it though.
How does it feel to be a puppet of the dictator trump.
Still nothing about massive gatherings of protesters though. Bunch of fucking hipocrites. Coronavirus doesn’t affect protesters, but it does affect everything else. What in the fuck does Donald Trump have to do with a 80 year old tradition. Please enlighten me
Too little, too late. Wheeler already handed the election to Trump, the House and the Senate.  Democrats inaction backfired.

Pretty simple, dolt....it’s a-holes protesting and rioting because trump is president...not for any particular cause. But just because he’s president. This is what you tardos do. But you already know that
Which is even stranger when you consider the pre-Trump era R’s all swore by things like fiscal responsibility and small government. Meanwhile, Trump just steals money and uses DHS to attack people he dislikes. Still fully supported by The R senate. It’s actual insanity.
Honestly this is election interference plain and simple. Even if Trump didn’t authorize it this man is clearly doing it in support of him. But obviously Trump authored it! Just days before basically saying he would!
I’n sure everyone appreciates your attempt at ... civility? But we’re just so far past that. There ARE other countries who handled it better and even with the economic hit they did better by far than we did. Trump lieing about masks&amp;cures has caused MANY people to spread it more.

The fact the republicans support this madness is hilarious. Your point is taken though, Republicans constantly complain about everything Obama did, but love it when trump does the same thing but slaps his name on it. Good chat.
Just pointing out the fact that the Trump Administration is actively suing to repeal the Afordable Care Act, while simultaneously issuing an executive order to keep protections for pre-existing conditions. You think healthcare is expensive now, just you wait. It’s comical.
Played 'bottom half winner'  1.95. So marginally beating the number, and the bottom half is still stacked compared to the top half. But while Trump is alive and kicking, so is the top!
Trump has gone his entire life thinking that the rules do not apply to him.
Trump is literally trying to take credit for Obamacare now.
Trumps English is broken, but not unintelligible. Biden, on the other hand, is just plain BROKEN. Can’t speak, can’t campaign, won’t interview for more than 10 mins at a time, and has no clue where he is at any given moment. I’ll take trump 7 days a week &amp; twice on Sunday
Because they know they’re going to be making sure the kids will get sick so they can blame trump
Trump doesn't care about anything that helps anybody else he doesn't think before he strikes things down and he doesn't have any disabilities so he's not losing anything. Trump's disability is ignorance.

Breaking news: The Trump administration is demanding that all white males who own property are considered equal!!
It’s both. When Schumer and Pelosi start caving in to Trumpiblican demands they don’t help the left at all. They just perpetuate a R belief that they can get away with anything. Pelosi didn’t even want to impeach Trump. Both of them believe the R’s are going to suddenly be fair.

Trump wants to win so bad he’s now taking notes from Obama. I hope y’all know this is a strategy to win the election and a bunch of fake promises. Notice the small changes he’s been doing lately. He wants to win democratic votes. It’s a game.
We’re not just fighting TRUMP - We’re fighting PUTIN too!!!
So let's say you have 60% of the nation agreeing Trump is an outright enemy of the people sitting in the White House.  BUT you have 30% vote for one alternative and 30% vote for another - you then have 40% voting for Trump.  Despite your agreement he has to go, he still wins.
Ah a very interesting take - Jerry clearly has some sexual “issues” that Trump might have used to his advantage!!!
One of the bad things about the Trump Presidency that doesn't get talked about is people looking back on the Obama Presidency with nostalgia  But at least this gif is kinda relevant again
Unfortunately, Trump lumps assholes like this with peaceful protesters. There is a big difference between attempted arson &amp; murder and peaceful protesters. Not everyone who protests is a radical leftist. Most want to keep things peaceful. These guys have no such intent.
If you pick Susan Rice I fear your chances of winning dwindle.  She will be looked at as another Obama Era and Bengazi will haunt you and trump will do enough with her to win the election..those are my thoughts but i fear I won't be wrong if you pick her.
It would if Trump were at the helm.  If you haven't seen how the country is moving to this conclusion in the last 4 yrs, I'm not sure if twitter is the right place to show you or explain.

Whoever of you were cheering Trump mistreating reporters attacking the #FirstAmendment,  that's Un-American Dictators are known for calling journalists "fake news" btw.

Ideally I would like to generate enough sales so as to donate a portion of its royalties to causes combating Trump over and above what I have and will donate anyway. If I'm ever not furloughed, I'd love to donate all its royalties, but it won't matter unless it sells.
THIS. IS. ALREADY. THE. LAW. (And Trump is fighting in court to stop it)
You have the sads Jimmy. Did Trump hurt your feelings? Big Ass Wuss
We have to put out one fire at a time and the more severe fire is the one that has to go first.  Trump is directly responsible for the wide spread coronavirus infestation we have and that's just a small fraction.
He's uniquely dangerous to the US.  And if the US falls, which it will if Trump remains, the stability of the globe WILL follow.
He's done no harm at all compared to what Trump has and will continue to do.
Trump couldn't repeal Obamacare, so he's just gonna announce it like it's a new thing and call it Trumpcare.

I would love to figure out how to superimpose Trump's head onto it.
Trump is a revolution of that stuff, yes.  But it's for the benefit of even worse, and certainly NOT the people.  But hey, at least you can admit you actually WANT Trump rather than trying to pretend like you actually have another option.
I’m gonna start calling them Trump Monkeys

tRump is still being a ass and not wearing a mask!!!! There your Caught up!!! Hahahaha
He actually posed the injection of bleach as a question at the same time he talked about getting light inside the body.  I hate Trump with a passion because he is a liar, fascist, treasonous piece of crap. But that statement has been skewed by a lot of people.
So by critics you mean supporters. Got it. Trump speak FTW.
Joe Biden has serious issues. If you are supporting him despite what is painfully obvious just because of your hatred for Trump, you are part of the problem.
Like that is Trump's fault?  Typical lame Progressive remarks.
Biden wasn't.  Trump on the other hand has been groomed by Putin for years.  This isn't just a simple case of collusion during the election or a little Russian manipulation because they 'favored him'.  He is a Russian Mob Operative and the Apprentice was to build his persona.
With all due respect, black folks ain't falling for that garbage🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  We know exactly who tRump and his crew are.  Plus were getting a black woman as vice president. tRump is wasting a lot of money #eyeswideopen #electbiden2020
Trump's golf club press conference was a social distancing disaster — until the tweet-shaming began
If that's the case then you simply don't understand what Trump actually is.

Trump installed this Postmaster because he needs USPS to fail then he can contest the election results if Biden wins.
Here is President Trump's full speech today in Bedminster, NJ. Enjoy!
New kneepads are in order..  She is so unlikeable that this guarantees a Trump reelection.
Are they peacefully protesting BLM while simultaneously giving Trump Corona? I hope so bc this is the only way I will accept this.
This is the nicest I’ve seen trump be to a reporter ever.
They played a game of chicken with all of our votes, and unfortunately they won. It breaks my heart, however I know the best thing for humanity is to vote trump out. Hold your nose and vote Biden. ❤️
Hey Republicans... Even Lindsey Graham is secretly voting for Joe Biden. He hates Trump, but is just scared Donald will out him. It’s ok Lady G, everyone already knows.   #RepublicansForBiden #RVAT2020
Ima pull up to a Trump rally like this 😂😂😂😂
What has been Christian about Trump at any point? The casino owning, trump university scamming, mob tied, extreme racist? Have we lost all sight of who Christ was? Could you protest more for your cause than getting nailed to a cross? Christ was a revolutionary progressive.
He eats his steak well-done, thinks taco salads are authentic Mexican. Know who attended elite universities and knew how to wear a suit and use chopsticks? This guy. Bourdain was blown away by  sophistication. Trump is Queens white trash.
Any other option is a throwaway vote and a throwaway vote is only possible if you are OK with the failure of the impeachment process to work simply because you have a jury of pre-biased party members engaged in the vote.  You absolutely cannot get worse than Trump - he needs 2go!
Would that also mean that Trump doesn’t have to worry about the College vote?
Thank you President Trump. You are the best president ever!
Final sentence could work for the entire trump presidency. In this particular case it’s just totally obvious pandering to sign an exec order for something popular that’s already on the books
In the next cycle of huge news, we're gonna hear about how Trump signed an executive order granting minorities the right to vote, even though his party tried to obstruct that in Kentucky and Georgia.
That damned Trump just snapped his fingers and put everyone out of work for the lulz.  Nothing else happened and no one else had control over the things that left to this unemployment rate.  Just Trump being Trump, amirite?
Not all Biden voters are Biden supporters.  He just happens to be anyone but Trump.

The military has been doing mail in voting for a long time. Please don’t spread misinformation. We get enough of that from Faux news and Trump doing nothing but lie.  or is the military wrong too?
why does brett favre have to explain why he golfed with donald trump?!
I particularly like the part where he says it must stop.  Not because it's wrong or evil but because it will help Trump's campaign.  So if that wasn't the case would it be okay?
TRUMP’s sabotage of USPS is literally putting more lives in damaged!  High risk folks getting their meds by mail are being targeted!!!
Trump will win 2020
Are there any REAL Republicans out there who have the backbone to stand against Trump? I'd follow them.
Anyone want to remind  about the Postal Act of 1792? And which POTUS signed it into law?  Hint: His initials were GW. What Trump, DeJoy, and  are doing is unconditional and would piss off the Founding Fathers.
I don't care about the parents. I am worried about the children. Incredibly irresponsible just like idiot Trump.
Goodnight to you as well!  Wow, I think your link was to the wrong document.  The document shows that there was Russian collusion.  I guess Trump really should have been removed from office.
Trump is a media whore!

How the Pandemic Defeated America  "Trump is a comorbidity of the COVID‑19 pandemic. He isn’t solely responsible for America’s fiasco, but he is central to it. A pandemic demands the coordinated efforts of dozens of agencies."
Trump is a total embarrassment
Right, and if Trump were racist, he would never had signed the “FIRST STEP ACT” to reform the criminal justice system that disproportionately affected African Americans during the Clinton-era crime bill. Trump is giving 1000s of unfairly sentenced black inmates a second chance
Unemployment extension, etc will happen with Trump Executive orders or with an actual bill from Congress? #Trump #congress
How the Pandemic Defeated America  "During a pandemic, leaders must rally the public, tell the truth, and speak clearly and consistently. Instead, Trump repeatedly contradicted public-health experts, his scientific advisers, and himself."

Not healthy to be that heavy as a child. Only will get worse. There's Anderson trying to figure how he can blame Trump.
Donald Trump is not able to come up with any health plan. It is beyond him. He almost destroyed Obama care but knew it will be too much burden for him to tackle and he didn't touch it. He can slam it all he wants but had no resource to come up with a better plan.
Trump goes further than the Democrats said thy would to help Americans in need and the Media $hits itself trying to process the announcements.

I am upset that  money is un accounted for and those victims deserve every penny of that. Our Governor is a liar! He is a thief. He is also destroying this city more and more as each day passes. My statement had nothing to do with Trump. I never mentioned him. Why did you?
STOP WORRYING ABOUT TRUMP Governor Sisolak your History of evil continues, hoarding meds through “pandemic”! let’s not forget the $12million(Commissioner at the time) that you stolen from the October 1 2017 Go-fund-me intended for victims! God knows it all &amp; Nevadans never forget

Stop Donald Trump. Vote on November 3rd!

We know where the trump viruscamr from
We seem to lose sight of the fact that Hillary and the DNC has paid for and used information solicitated from foreign governments on Trump in 2016. They are still trying to spread fake news. They are really desperate.
You know this is exactly what Trump and DeJoy want to happen, right?

Trump is doing exactly what he should do, taking charge making policy that benefit Americans, signing orders. My bet Biden never runs. He will be replace due to "medical condition"

Wtf? Projecting your own inadequacies onto others. The Trump defense.
Yes because the virus can differentiate between fifty people not wearing masks standing shoulder to shoulder that are Trump supporters vs fifty people not wearing masks standing shoulder to shoulder that are protesting.
I realize being in your position as Governor has to make a statement and call out Trump on his actions. But, he doesn't care for anyone other than himself! I believe he'd throw his own children under the bus if it benefits him! SAD!
We will all be judged when that day comes. And if Trump and his supporters get in, then those of us who genuinely care for all mankind have nothing to fear!

best indicator of this election is you hear plenty of stories of people saying they voted for Trump in 2016 but will not vote for him again but you never hear stories of anyone saying they didn't vote for Trump in 2016 but they will vote for him in 2020 after watching this mess

To be fair, Mormons seem to stick to their principles more readily than evangelicals — it's why Trump is not popular in Utah.  Might have something to do with the fact that they've been persecuted for what they believe and evangelicals pretty much never have.
Well, since Joe is not actually picking, she absolutely must be a radical, a socialist (otherwise she would not be selected). And if she is overly ambitious, a loudmouth or emotional then we will all see it, right? Trump can be vulgar. Aside from that, you’re wrong.

Joe Biden and the liberal Democrats are going to try to cancel Christmas, they have for years, Trump brought the greatness of Christmas back, we have to protect Christmas and America, Re-elect President Donald J. Trump
It isn’t a binary choice though. Trump doesn’t have to be less racist, just to make Joe look racist enough to either suppress voter turnout like he and Russia did in 2016 or detour voters from Biden to Kanye as they did with Johnson and Stein in 2016.
The overlords on the left want to disrupt the republican convention with violence so that the message is diluted. Trump should be smart enough not to let the left know where he will be.
This. So many of them acknowledge Trump is bad, but then they'll post lists like "here's who I endorse in the Senate contests" and I see a ton of senators who are just as racist as Trump is, and many who have actively helped him dismantle institutions.
He's just sick of Trump. We all are, so I can't be that mad at him.

Trump2020! The only one deflecting is you. I brought up Obama to some1 else and YOU responded to me w/ a tweet about Trump. I wasn’t talking about Trump, so why are you deflecting and bringing him up to me? Anything so you don’t have to admit Obama kept kids in cages. Pathetic
Forget the elections: Let's split the country in half. Democrats/Biden can have the left coast. Republicans/Trump can have the east coast.

Doesn’t take away the fact that Obama built and used those cages too. You all pretend to care about the children, but didn’t care about them when Obama did it. You only care about taking down Trump. Your tweet just solidified that. Pretty disturbing

That makes Murphy the racist. He's obviously insinuating that only colored people can be for low-income housing. I don't know if Trump is racist but this doesn't help your case against him. He is at-worst an man-child.

Over 20 women have accused Trump of rape  &amp; sexual assault. His helping Epstein victim in 2009 means nothing. It's a cover: in his twisted mind, the law applies to everyone else but not him.
Yes, so stop playing the game. When I bring up reasons why I don’t want Trump to be President, stuff like the fact that he can’t pronounce Yosemite is not what I talk about. I bring up things like he’s had 160,000 Americans die on his watch from Covid, with no end in sight.

I love how he calls it "hot mic" as though they caught something juicy that Trump doesn't say to the world all the time, practically daily. Poor Jim.

Pretty simple, dolt....it’s a-holes protesting and rioting because trump is president...not for any particular cause. But just because he’s president. This is what you tardos do. But you already know that
Which is even stranger when you consider the pre-Trump era R’s all swore by things like fiscal responsibility and small government. Meanwhile, Trump just steals money and uses DHS to attack people he dislikes. Still fully supported by The R senate. It’s actual insanity.
Honestly this is election interference plain and simple. Even if Trump didn’t authorize it this man is clearly doing it in support of him. But obviously Trump authored it! Just days before basically saying he would!
I’n sure everyone appreciates your attempt at ... civility? But we’re just so far past that. There ARE other countries who handled it better and even with the economic hit they did better by far than we did. Trump lieing about masks&amp;cures has caused MANY people to spread it more.

The fact the republicans support this madness is hilarious. Your point is taken though, Republicans constantly complain about everything Obama did, but love it when trump does the same thing but slaps his name on it. Good chat.
Just pointing out the fact that the Trump Administration is actively suing to repeal the Afordable Care Act, while simultaneously issuing an executive order to keep protections for pre-existing conditions. You think healthcare is expensive now, just you wait. It’s comical.
Played 'bottom half winner'  1.95. So marginally beating the number, and the bottom half is still stacked compared to the top half. But while Trump is alive and kicking, so is the top!
Trump has gone his entire life thinking that the rules do not apply to him.
Trump is literally trying to take credit for Obamacare now.
Trumps English is broken, but not unintelligible. Biden, on the other hand, is just plain BROKEN. Can’t speak, can’t campaign, won’t interview for more than 10 mins at a time, and has no clue where he is at any given moment. I’ll take trump 7 days a week &amp; twice on Sunday
Because they know they’re going to be making sure the kids will get sick so they can blame trump
Trump doesn't care about anything that helps anybody else he doesn't think before he strikes things down and he doesn't have any disabilities so he's not losing anything. Trump's disability is ignorance.

If you pick Susan Rice I fear your chances of winning dwindle.  She will be looked at as another Obama Era and Bengazi will haunt you and trump will do enough with her to win the election..those are my thoughts but i fear I won't be wrong if you pick her.
It would if Trump were at the helm.  If you haven't seen how the country is moving to this conclusion in the last 4 yrs, I'm not sure if twitter is the right place to show you or explain.
Trump didn't involve us in Neocon Wars, W did. Trump revived the economy, reformed trade &amp; demanded that our NATO partners pay their dues. W caused the implosion of the world economy in 2008. Trump is America First; W a globalist stooge. Trump appointed Conservatives to SCOTUS.
Thank you govoner for not being bullied by trump and for standing up for what's RIGHT and also for admitting when you make a mistake.  As you know our pussy president won't do such a thing. .. you are appreciated govoner.
By Election Day, Trump’s body count is expected to exceed American dead in World War II. Trump did in one year what happened in four years of combat.
Truth, but you have a large Trump supporting contingent with the Latino populace. We all need to vote to even that out
Typical dumb ass trump supporter comments... What was heard from Sisolak was that people were again not following rules to help protect people. What was heard by dumptRump supporters was bla bla Bla Bla  bla bla ..  always tell who trump supporters as soon as their mouths open
Trump said he's going to sign an executive order requiring health insurers to cover preexisting conditions. That's already the current law under Obamacare, which Trump has repeatedly tried to repeal.   The old OKIE DOKE, MR THREE CARD MONTE IN FULL DISPLAY
I don't give Trump much, well anything, but what the PNW Youth Liberation Front (slogan No cops. No prisons. Total abolition.) did Weds in PDX was awful. They tried to burn a police station down after locking police inside. The peaceful group of BLM protesters were not involved.
Looks like he’s trying real hard to not look gay after he got busted diddling the pool bit for years

We have to put out one fire at a time and the more severe fire is the one that has to go first.  Trump is directly responsible for the wide spread coronavirus infestation we have and that's just a small fraction.
He's uniquely dangerous to the US.  And if the US falls, which it will if Trump remains, the stability of the globe WILL follow.
He's done no harm at all compared to what Trump has and will continue to do.

Trump? Met him a few times, don’t really know him. Didn’t really agree with him on much.  Mostly spent my time on the hill. He wasn’t a real Republican.
He actually posed the injection of bleach as a question at the same time he talked about getting light inside the body.  I hate Trump with a passion because he is a liar, fascist, treasonous piece of crap. But that statement has been skewed by a lot of people.
So by critics you mean supporters. Got it. Trump speak FTW.

Like that is Trump's fault?  Typical lame Progressive remarks.
Biden wasn't.  Trump on the other hand has been groomed by Putin for years.  This isn't just a simple case of collusion during the election or a little Russian manipulation because they 'favored him'.  He is a Russian Mob Operative and the Apprentice was to build his persona.
With all due respect, black folks ain't falling for that garbage🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  We know exactly who tRump and his crew are.  Plus were getting a black woman as vice president. tRump is wasting a lot of money #eyeswideopen #electbiden2020

What has been Christian about Trump at any point? The casino owning, trump university scamming, mob tied, extreme racist? Have we lost all sight of who Christ was? Could you protest more for your cause than getting nailed to a cross? Christ was a revolutionary progressive.
He eats his steak well-done, thinks taco salads are authentic Mexican. Know who attended elite universities and knew how to wear a suit and use chopsticks? This guy. Bourdain was blown away by  sophistication. Trump is Queens white trash.
Any other option is a throwaway vote and a throwaway vote is only possible if you are OK with the failure of the impeachment process to work simply because you have a jury of pre-biased party members engaged in the vote.  You absolutely cannot get worse than Trump - he needs 2go!
9 million new jobs over 3 months for 30 million unemployed. That’s not strong. Based on reports Trump has lost $8 million in office, since those numbers are based on assets we know about, (hotels, property and golf courses) shouldn’t he have made money in such a good economy?
JOE, he listens to the women around him! Unlike Trump
Would that also mean that Trump doesn’t have to worry about the College vote?
Thank you President Trump. You are the best president ever!
Final sentence could work for the entire trump presidency. In this particular case it’s just totally obvious pandering to sign an exec order for something popular that’s already on the books
In the next cycle of huge news, we're gonna hear about how Trump signed an executive order granting minorities the right to vote, even though his party tried to obstruct that in Kentucky and Georgia.
That damned Trump just snapped his fingers and put everyone out of work for the lulz.  Nothing else happened and no one else had control over the things that left to this unemployment rate.  Just Trump being Trump, amirite?

When Trump loses Tucker what disgusting people does he have left?
What kind of stupid are the Democrats? They are holding the American people hostage to get the extras they want. Trump wants to end their tantrum by moving forward and they will go to court to stop it. Anyone who votes for them is no longer misguided. They are bat shit crazy.
FYI Pro Russua Ukranian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption, including through publishing leaked phone calls, to undermine former V P Biden's Tennessee and the Democratic Party. So Trump is not stopped with the quid pro quo from ukrainians! #TrumpQuidProQuo

Trump voters should understand that a vote for Kanye is really a vote for Trump.  They will be helping Trump if they vote for Kanye.
LOL you mean Obamacare? Republicans are in court trying to get rid of those protections and trump just wants to reinstate them and take credit? I don't think so.
Let s not forget about russia russia russia and DNC schemes for coo.  Thank God Trump bringing to our attention CCP worldwide overtaking of democracies
PURE EVIL!
Anti-maskers explain themselves  Not a conspiracy theory but here's a bunch of conspiracy theories, not political but I'm all for Trump and he doesn't like masks, businesses can mandate masks but they boycott businesses that require masks

Yep, President Obama cares about Americans more than he cares about getting credit. The polar opposite of Trump.
Not healthy to be that heavy as a child. Only will get worse. There's Anderson trying to figure how he can blame Trump.
Donald Trump is not able to come up with any health plan. It is beyond him. He almost destroyed Obama care but knew it will be too much burden for him to tackle and he didn't touch it. He can slam it all he wants but had no resource to come up with a better plan.
Trump goes further than the Democrats said thy would to help Americans in need and the Media $hits itself trying to process the announcements.
If Trump isn’t truly evil, he plays it well on TV. An Emmy is in his future.
And trump will disapear on November 3. In his words, “YOU’RE FIRED”!
Donald Trump will tell lies about Joe Biden every day until the election.  Ignore him.

What this article doesn't consider is that today there is a huge number of silent Trump voters. They are very anti-poll because of the toxic nature of the many Democrats and their allies. They didn't need to be so in 16' because Hillary was thought to be a shoein.
Lindsey Graham has made his mistake by endorsing the behavior and policies of our Godless Malignant Narcissist POTUS!!! He is the number one Trump Sycophant and deserves great responsibility for The Trump Virus as he has been the most complicit actor in the in the US Senate!!!

China fears President Trump, not because he's unpredictable, but because he has warned the world about china's designs on world domination! Whilst Biden has sold out to China!
Stop Donald Trump. Vote on November 3rd!

You know this is exactly what Trump and DeJoy want to happen, right?
If u think orange beast is going to help you lower drug prices, let me burst your magical bubble. Drug companies will be raising all international prices to match that of the US prices. Trump is on the side of greedy drug companies.

Kanye admitted he's working with republicans to be a spoiler and help trump win again. He's already committed fraud. He had one person fill out hundreds of signatures and has a bunch of electors that live at the same address.

A comment toward one person is nothing close to a comment re an entire race.  But you know that. You're a smart man. But you are also hyperbolic, agitating and a provocateur.  You make far more troubling statements than our President.
Kanye is completely in on it. He admitted he's trying to be a spoiler and help trump.

Trump is SO DESPERATE for media attention!!!
NJ police should shut this down. If nothing else to get the children out of this damn petri-dish. To hell w/ the rich parents that are foolish enough to believe in Trump. I don't want a child to die due to their stupidity. Time will tell.
My guess is that Trump held that political rally at his golf course tonight because he wants to distract us from this bigger and much more consequential news. #USPS
She’s behaving like a goddam divisive idiot.  She &amp; other Trump cronies have politicized a health pandemic which has continued to excerbate the increasing # of cases &amp; deaths!  We’re over 160K deaths.  LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS NOT TRUMP!!  Kelly Anne knows better - she’s dangerous
Trump is drawing "YUGE" crowds this year.
To hell w/ the parents. I am concerned about the children. When one of his club members loses a child from attending this rally will they regret attending &amp; believing in Trump? Not wishing for any of them to die, but they are tempting fate. Many of them put on masks way too late!

Explainer: Trump wants to bypass U.S. coronavirus aid talks with executive order. Can he?
Honest question: Does NJ actually make exceptions in those cases, or is this just Trump spouting nonsense as usual? (If they do, that's dumb, but it wouldn't actually surprise me that much.)
Microsoft are in talks to buy TikTok after Donald Trump said he wanted to ban the app
U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. U.S. officials also assess that China prefers that Trump not win a second term.
Just finished listening to President Trump's press conference, and I just LOVED the closing scene.  A snotty reporter asked about lots of people in the room not wearing masks, and President Trump put it down with "They are exempt - They are peaceful Protesters"
It wasn't turned "into a rally" it was a rally disguised as a news conference like all the rest of them paid for w/ our tax dollars. Trump needs to RESIGN.
Oh good God!  That’s exactly why Trump had them there.  This whole thing was wrong on so many levels.
Will trump actually debate Joe Biden?
At this point anyone can float an idea to trump on the golf course and two hours later he issues an Executive Order.
Trump has supported PEC since his campaign. Obamacare was a purchasing mechanism that limited the insurance options to boilerplate plans with stupid high deductibles. Totally ruined the small group and individual health insurance market. So, no, Trump isn't reinstating the ACA.
Trump just said his event was exempt from New Jersey’s coronavirus rules because political events are exempt and it’s also a peaceful protest. 😂 #Trump #PeacefulProtest
Reporter: where will you get the money for the unemployment benefits without congress?  Trump: we have the money
They're violating COVID-19 restrictions - this should be shut down now. Trump could care less about anyone &amp; enjoys wasting our tax $'s. His condolences are hollow &amp; meaningless. Trump must RESIGN! $'s spent on this could go a long way to feed the hungry &amp; shelter the evicted.
Trump just dropped some nice presents for err body :)
So this prick is at his golf club addressing the nation ???!!!! You are a walking POS Trump

Thank goodness Donald Trump is here to school me subjects I already know, but that he didn't know until 5 minutes before speaking.
Answering a reporter's question, President Trump says executive orders could be signed by 'the end of the week'. He says he expects to be sued over the legality but that lawyers say it's doable. He wouldn't put a $$ amount on the enhanced unemployment
Prescription prices are higher now that when Trump took office. He promised to lower them in his first year. Another failed Trump promise.
Oh and yeah I voted for Trump and voices like yours are the exact reason why. You’re also the reason I and a lot of others will do the same this round.
All at the expense of tax payers. Plus, he is violating COVID-19 restrictions. Campaign rally disguised as a presser - Trump needs to foot the bill for security. We need our tax $'s to protect people from the virus not expose them. To hell w/ the parents concerned about the kids.
Trump? WTF are you talking about? How does Trump have anything to do with this evil piece of shit stealing millions of dollars from the October mass shooting victims? You approve of stealing money through a go fund me that was intended for shooting victims? Really?

Trump is making such a fool of himself that Foxnews cut away from the press conference. Suing ACA to remove preexisting conditions. Issuing executive order to protect preexisting conditions. This is so sad. Someone please save him. Turn off the microphone.

At #Bedminster he pays tens of thousands of dollars less in property taxes because the property has a #goatherd, as well as hay #farming and woodcutting thus NJ law permits him to receive a farmland tax break. #Trump has a cemetery there as well to avoid #taxes.
Expect Trump to take any actions he deems helpful to being re-elected, with zero fucks given for long term consequences. We have just entered the "I'm going to give you all money and make damn sure you know it came from me" phase.
Share the shit out of it if you can please....we all need to do this!!! For the big accounts, for   the children and our future as a human species.....if we lose Trump.....the world as we know it will be lost again for god knows how long.

Honestly, that any leftists in America ever find the energy to apologize for far-right Pat Buchanan Thought is such a disgrace to me. And trump has banked off this too; Glenn Greenwald still thinks he’s ‘non-interventionist’ because he named his campaign after Lindbergh’s slogan.
You are right. The fed has been printing money out of control.   I hope Trump breaks the centralized banks and returns to the gold standard.
Trump has been a slimy conman, cheat, criminal and traitor his whole life and he ascended to the presidency. His ultimate fall is going to be spectacular.
Trump hates the same people they hate.
President Trump on  now in FOUR MINUTES.

Harry Reid on Trump’s Mental State: ‘There’s Something Wrong’ — He’s ‘Getting Worse’   You really think anyone is going to listen to Reid, since he did so much for Nevada. Isn't it amazing how he's a millionaire after he left Washington.
1-I agree with you and GWB is way up there on my list of horrible presidents, but he's not running.  Trump has created a divisiveness, has a total disregard for the the 1A and the Rule of Law. Remember bush was GOP too and Trump has Spent over a Trillion building up the military.
#TrumpIsLosing   It's laughable to think Trump is so desperate to win he would use   to cheat cause he's to Weak to beat   fairly. Imagine if Biden used Kid Rock to steal White votes from Trump, Trump would be crying Whauuuu Whauuuu Mommie!!!

I mean, Trump is giving Russia exactly what they want:  Destabilized Europe by UN &amp; troop withdrawal Won't say JACK about bounties on US soldiers Asked to have Russia back in G7  And the GOP is fine with that because... $$.

No actually I'm very busy right now. I would love to be there, I have about a dozen friends from Vegas who are there. I'm not afraid of a flu bug. I'm back to work and back in the gym and things are popping thanks to President Trump for keeping the economy going.
Our problems didn’t start 4 years ago, but will be made worse by zero-defect people like you. What you demand, doesn’t exist. Elections are local. All politics is local. Progress may be slow, but it’s still progress. You’re ideology, is the reason Trump got elected, in 1st place.

Today the temperature in Henderson Nevada  was ok. For the first time in 2 months I did some hiking. The view of Las Vegas is great from there. It was great to go out there and forget the TV, Trump, even if for a while.
Almost forgot my all time favorite.  Trump is a BILLIONAIRE that stole from CHARITY!!!  Let is sink in.    A Billionaire who steals from charity  Everybody has a right to their own opinion, but I prefer presidents that don't steal from charity.
Impossible? I would say President Trump is doing an excellent job. Look at the recent economic reports. In six months everyone will be back to work if not sooner. America will be back on track stronger having learned a lesson on outsourcing essentials.  Key is a Trump win #POTUS

I really would like somebody to run for president who is maybe in their 50s and not someone so geriatric they're liable to die in office of old age natural causes. Trump or Biden, I mean seriously these guys are so old they probably remember Butch and Sundance in their prime.

I hope. But how can you be so sure?  Corrupt politics have driven this all along. Why in the world would Trump Barr McConnell allow this to happen since both R and D culprits are involved in this decades long pedophile, rape and sex trafficking operation?
Have you considered the ramifications of a second Trump term?  I have.  If you’re in a purple state, not voting Biden is irresponsible.  This isn’t shaming or scolding or pandering, it’s just an intellectual fact.
Really? The tweet you're replying to asks if he has a history of doing vile and racist things. Trump literally has a history of doing vile and racist things. At least you tried.

Meanwhile, there has been plenty of mainstream media reporting that Trump &amp; his children have been illegally pocketing money from official campaign funds.  The victims of this fraud aren’t libs or Democrats. The victims are Trump’s donors &amp; voters.
I wish for the best for anyone trying to take out McConnell. I just wonder if Booker who could’ve really taken it to McConnell on policy and his neglect of working people would’ve done better than someone playing into the Trump xenophobic blaming China theory. Hope I’m wrong.

Tomorrow there is a BLM rally in Minden, NV, right next to my hometown of Carson. Minden is probably the whitest town on earth, mostly cowboy trump supporters with guns, so this will be interesting to see the dichotomy that takes place. I’m gonna go just to observe.

Even if there was an obscure remote isolated English-speaking province where they pronounce it “Thighland,” D’Souza is arguing that Mr Trump is aware of this unique place, and inexplicably following their customs, rather than pronouncing it the way EVERY American pronounces it

just read your commentary on the Reagan approach to negotiation. You continue to impress me with your clear headed strategy even after all these years. Trump needs you guiding his re-election campaign and providing the support he needs to keep the faith.
Yes. The rush to mail in voting without properly thinking it through will lead to many lawsuits and challenges post election.  Why can't people just admit that Trump is correct on this one?
The Trump campaign thanks you for your support!!
What would this look like if Trump had taken this pandemic seriously in March?
I don't really care, we'll find a way to pay the higher taxes. Trump is THE most dangerous president in the history of the United States. So, I don't just hate him, but I hate the things he does to us Americans.
If my taxes go up a little it's ok.  It's the rich that will start paying their FAIR share. And to be clear, I don't hate trump to just hate him. I grew up in NYC so I knew what kind of asshole he is when he announced he was running.  And he proved me right.
One of Trump's own lawyers filed for Kanye to get on the ballot in Ohio and Wisconsin this week.   So, yes - they are working together on this - even if Kanye's not aware of it.

Yes, Mr Trump chooses his pronunciations very carefully, he’s a real stickler for details.
Mr D’Souza’s business model is simple: sell stuff to Trump fans. So if Mr D’Souza needs to call it “Thighland” or say that Ted Cruz’s dad shot JFK or applaud Trump’s Greenland acquisition or agree that windmills cause cancer... Mr D’Souza is prepared to say whatever is necessary!
Mr D’Souza’s business model isn’t unique among rightwing pundits: lavish praise upon this Trump imbecile &amp; sell your products to MAGA nation.  If he says windmills cause cancer or Ted Cruz’s dad shot JFK or Joe Scarborough is a murderer or toilets need 12 flushes... you’ll agree!
Even the best of us mispronounce an easy word. By the standards of Trump scandals, this one is harmless.  But your obsequiousness is obviously insincere. You’re lavishing praise on him because you market products to his fans. So if he says windmills cause cancer... you’ll agree
Important to remember NOT to complain or express any disappointment about his choice. Our response it critical. Any negativity will be exploited by the trump team &amp; used against Joe. We all should simply respond with an outpouring of enthusiasm, excitement, &amp; support! #GoJoe2020
Mr D’Souza is correct. Every EDUCATED English speaker pronounces it Thighland when their mouth is full of Mr Trump’s Genitals
Quick question for Mr D’Souza: when Mr Trump finishes, do you swallow or spit?
Mr D’Souza agrees that Mr Trump has never been mistaken. For example, when Mr Trump said that Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the murder of President Kennedy, Mr D’Souza agrees that this is correct.
Donald Trump is a fake, period.

This is all very reminiscent of Donald using official campaign funds from donors to enrich his own pockets. That’s been reported on extensively by the mainstream media... but Trump’s supporters don’t trust the mainstream media, hence Donald’s success at stealing from his donors
Biden could choose a concussed, rabid squirrel as a running mate and he'd be a better choice than Trump.  Why would anyone take advice from someone who can't recognize the existential threat that 4 more years of Trump poses to this country - and the world?
Pro-tip: If you’re a self-described “progressive” who’s willing to let Donald Trump nominate Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s successor... than you’re not really a progressive
These dumb allegations are getting increasingly more pathetic. Trump will soon be reduced to accusing Joe Biden’s father of murdering JFK
Donald Trump taught us that taking responsibility is a sign of weakness
Donald Trump taught us that apologies are a sign of weakness
At this point, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the entire Trump presidency was just an incredibly elaborate episode of "Punk'd."
It's terrifying to realize there are people walking among us who are dim enough to believe a word Trump says.
Thanks to our Electoral College, only Trump or Biden will be the next president.  So - if you're not voting for one of them - you're not really voting at all.
This is soooo predictable! The Trump Administration just isn’t good at politics. Any halfway decent political strategist would know that the push to open the schools will backfire once kids &amp; teachers start spreading the disease

Trump says he doesn't need a VP because he plans on being President forever.  :)
In their mind, Biden is the lesser evil. I'm not so sure about that tbh, he might be even more dangerous than Trump, given the ease to manipulate his cognitive mental state,
Trump supporters: we shouldn’t reward illegal immigrants with citizenship after they’ve broken the law  Also Trump supporters: Donald Trump broke the law by hiring many illegal immigrants over many years and he should be rewarded with elective office

The Mayor who is blaming Trump is 100% responsible for this. It is his city, his responsibility. He needs to suck it up and take the problems that are his!
3 points that shape my thinking on this election:  Point 1: Donald Trump is a dangerous sociopath who is unfit for office &amp; needs to be removed immediately.  Point 2: It’s *possible* that Joe Biden is getting senile.  Point 3: Point 1 is far more important than Point 2.
trump really wants to sue a state in his own country...over a safer method of voting. i fucking hate that guy.
oh bc i thought a trump supporter said sum 🤔🥱
Isn't it  racist and sexist for Joe Biden to say he's going to pick a black female for his VP? Could you imagine the backlash if President Trump said he was picking a white old man for his VP? Whatever happened to the most qualified person.🤔
Now we must all get our votes in and counted! Every single vote matters—Our Nation needs Trump!
Lying Crying Trump 😭😭😭😭. #NobodyLikesTrump
I mean I knew trump was an idiot, but.... damn! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
If I’m playing devil (Trump)’s advocate here I guess you could say. Hey at least he didn’t say he objected to renaming the bridge named after a Klansman after John Lewis. And I honestly expected him to.
While this interview was indeed a giant dumpster fire, it will be inconsequential. Very few of Mr Trump’s supporters will ever take the time out of their day to watch this video. The GOP &amp; right wing media cocoon will continue to protect Trump
He’s still at 41% approval.  That level of deliberate, obstinate, self-delusion is a huge long term problem that transcends Trump.   Our citizens are getting less sophisticated over time. In August of 1974, Nixon was at 25%

And you can bet MORE will be uncovered!
This is what I want to hear!!!!
"The US Postal Service definitively said Monday that it had the capacity to handle the added volume of mail-in ballots in November's general election after President Donald Trump questioned its ability to do so."
Have any GOP politicians made a serious effort to prevent the President from firing inspectors general? No?   If the GOP is working hard to *prevent* oversight &amp; investigations of Mr Trump, I see no reason for voting for the GOP. They are his accomplices
No  you can't rerun an election!
Prediction: Mr Trump will be the first President in US history to have fewer buildings with his name on them *after* leaving office compared to before his inauguration

trump has always lived in an alternate reality.
Alexander Vindman lied in the Congressional Hearing against President Trump! But nothing is going to happen to him.  Lying, corrupt DemocRATS should all lose their seats in the up coming  election.  You should be the first to go, then Pelosi, Schumer, Nadler, Omar, OAC, etc.
Shifty Schiff, you are such a liar!  The Trump Administration would have extended it for a couple of months more but you Democrats wanted it extended into 2021.   It is always your way, or no way and then you blame the opposition.  You Democrats are liars, and obstructionists!!!
Stupid remark, snarky!  President Trump has done more to keep us safe then Clinton or Obama ever did.  Clinton has committed rape and you defend him!  Shows where your morals are, in the gutter!
Massive mail-in voting is subject to FRAUD!  Democrats are known to cheat.  The only way you think you can beat Trump is by cheating!  If we can stand in line at Walmart, we can stand in line at a polling station.  I will not mail-in my ballot but drop it off at the courthouse!
I hate it when they deliberately twist Donald Trump’s amazing words to make him sound like Donald Trump
Anything that makes republicans more complacent is fine by me. Let them believe that Trump's going to win in a landslide.
Trump isn’t human. Alien DNA, why he won’t give up a sample to attorneys for rape victims. ☺️
Yes, you will see Trump crying and screaming while being removed from the White House!!
You have a point. Have you looked at any polls of the public at large though? Trump certainly motivated a lot of people to flood the lines to speak out against it. Those of us who were for it didn’t call in cause we know you guys don’t have any power and that’s awesome/hilarious.

Oh look, trump's puppet it vomiting lies again!
Man that was a year ago?  There are so many bad things that have happened in this country  that Trump has done or inspired and we just forget all of them. Like, seriously we impeached him for Ukraine?! He’s a white supremacist who inspires other white Supremacists.
Almost thirty years ago, Trump publicly called for the execution of five minority teens AFTER they were exonerated.  He's always been a monster. And only a monster would be willing to ignore that.

The Trump campaign still seems to be unaware that many of the inner cities which used to have mostly low income minorities, are now filled with wealthy whites (after gentrification.) The GOP can’t win elections in cities... but for some reason, this doesn’t concern them 🤷‍♂️
🚨REMEMBER!!!🚨 He's DESPERATE to avoid PRISON!!! He'll stop at nothing!!!
Oh i know.  He cant answer my question simply because trump hasn't brought up a talking point to answer it. He can act all tough, but he needs his talking points spoon fed to him by a washed up reality TV host that couldn't even pass the SAT's on his own
Jesus wouldn't approve of guns... or Trump.

If tRump wins it’s going to be the electoral college only by a slim margin. He’s for sure losing the popular vote but unfortunately in our racist country that’s irrelevant.
Lib tears, "easier to kneel"... Trump supporters sure do spend a lot of time fantasizing about bodily fluids.
Biden is a racist pedophile
Try asking without answering in the same question. A question phrased that way is assuming I'm already agreeing with what's clearly a dug in position, and I don't play that game. Biden is consistently outperforming in neutral polls, seems like they picked right guy.
Can’t vote for a left wing radical like her,shame on Biden for picking her.

Ow. So you think Biden is a racist, and therefore Trump is the better choice?  Biden was not my choice, but I am voting for him. Because Trump is destroying the Constitution before our very eyes. Anyone is better than him.  Your turn. Are you voting for Trump? If so, why?
Please leave Biden alone, y'all!   Can a man finish his vital work without all the Tom Foolery?! Damn!
But Biden and Clinton said there’s nothing to worry about.... hmmm
In the beginning you all said virus doesn’t live in extreme heat. Obviously the media is a complete whore for ratings. After this year the media will be more hated than Trump and Biden combined
You left wingers gobble everything CNN says as fact. They lie to you everyday. Biden will be a disaster if he wins, if you want your life run by dictators vote Blue. If you stand for freedom and liberty Vote Trump2020
She's an actress. And not a very good one.  Her VP Joe Biden has the same phony laugh.  Very well practiced and obviously contrived.

Hillary Clinton called black men super predators many of these DNC politicians have always made it clear that black people are dumb by thinking blacks need a hand out Biden insulted the intelligence of black people by talking about how we aren't smart cause we live in the ghetto
You are mistaken.  Another point I need to make...by the time President Obama &amp; Vice President Biden took office, America was in a deep recession.  Their administration brought us out of that recession. During which time a stimulus check of $500. was mailed to those on S. S.
If joe biden is "so far ahead" in the polls, then why are you worried
Oh,  please! Many women are more than qualified to be other than barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. You aren’t speaking on behalf of most women. I’m embarrassed for you, thinking NO woman would be qualified to be on Biden’s ticket. #SitStillAndLookPretty
POLITICS NOW: On this week's episode, we have reaction from all across Nevada after Joe Biden picks California Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential running mate, plus much more.  WATCH:
Worst logic ever.  Kamala is an actual cop.  I also addressed his mention of Bernie's vote numerous times.  Actions. He fought to change the bad parts of the bill where Biden/Kamala defend those parts unabashedly.  I blocked him for good reason.  Please dont send me his tweets.
People supporting Biden don't have any specific issues or policies they can point to as the reason why they support Biden. To be fair he hasn't given them any. Free healthcare and free everything else is not a platform it's a pipedream. They have nothing. Only hate for Trump.

RNC Launches Website Exposing Biden’s ‘Disastrous Record, Hypocrisy, and Flawed Vision for America’
Joe Biden is white backlash, Donald trump is white nationalism. The backlash from the nationalism is a denial of the open racism, sexism, etc and a preference for systematic oppression. Joe Biden will make us (white people) feel like we aren’t a country ran by Donald Trumps.
Even Obama thinks Biden is a clown.  This is probably why he refused to endorse him during the primaries.
But Hillary tried "fumblingly" to get our votes after the primary.  Biden has completely abandoned us.  On purpose.
Thats the Democrat leaders of NYC. Get used to it if Joe Biden finds away to pull this off.  #Trump2020motherfuckers

Biden and now Harris are both hiding. What the hell are the Democrats trying to prove? They afraid of any questions from the media. They can’t win doing this BS
Of course they don’t want to expose Biden to live questioning. The less he says without editing or notes, the better his chances to win.

They will flat out complain that Joe Biden is too boring.
It would help Biden just as much. He's one of the architects of the present mass incarceration state, and his running mate a gleeful participant in it. Trump is continuing the wars crimes of Bush and Obama, adding new ones using Obama's immigration policy, even making it worse.
And if Biden does chicken out I would make sure the whole world knows about it!!
Agreed...  Pence would crush KH so I’m fine with it but under no circumstance should Biden be able to duck debating Trump.
They're on the same side.   The cop's comments about calling Biden a racist on stage during a debate should occasion you to think critically.  Voting will not solve this, because everyone on the government is committed to keeping power and increasing it when possible.

Hillary..... if Biden makes her SoS.  She would make Kamala, McConnell, and Pelosi (or whoever holds their seats) disappeared to take power.
Joe Biden is just as racist Hillary Clinton is just as racist none of these people that you want to support care about black people. Joe Biden  Stating that you aren't black if you dont vote for him  That's all I need to hear none of these democrats care for black people for real
I didn't wanna be the guy who has to tell you this, but Biden and Kamala have blood on their hands for literally all of these things.
I just came across a bunch of Biden followers and they're running the same exact losing strategy that got us Trump in 2016, but with an even less liked candidate.
Where was the mess up ? Every time Biden gets on the 🎤 he says something ridiculous. Unless you think kids playing with his leg hairs in a pool is cute ? He has no shot.... get your Kleenex ready.

A Nevada county mailed out 1.3 million ballots for its primary election but 1 in 5 were never delivered  If you think that is bad, wait until the postal union ( who backs Biden ) delays or stops delivery to republican strong areas. Has and will happen.
Does anyone see a clear-cut conflict of interest for the USPS union to endorse a presidential candidate - Joe Biden - while becoming part of the election process???
"WATCH: TRUMP SUPPORTERS ATTEMPT TO BREAK RECORD FOR LARGEST BOAT PARADE." I heard there were ~1800 boats.  Ya.......Poor Trump.  The media has him beaten by Bumbling Biden in almost every state. Nobody likes Trump. Democrat Pukes....Hold on to that thought....2016 to your peril.
You will NEVER see this for Joe Biden. EVER.
Right now the focus hasn't even began on the implications of GND, immigration, taxes.  Right now it's all criticism from the back seat. The SJW approach failed us and ruined OBAMAs "Hope" legacy. Oh wait a sec...Biden was there too...Biden has no legacy after +40 yrs in office
What unbelievably naive question. Here's some more: Do you think Biden has dementia? Do you think the CGI was pay for play? Do you think Obama is a Muslim? Do you think Kamala is really African American? Do you think BLM wants to damage our country? Bwahahaha!
Who gives a shit what this fuckimg liberal bitch thinks and says tell her to shut her ou hole and go home and count her money she earned in a free economy let Biden win and he will tax the shit out of her and her libtard entertainer friends

The consultant who picked the blue lives matter color font for Biden is either a fool, or massively trolling.
Oh wow trumpeters.. giving the liberals more reasons for Biden to win..  mess up old peoples mail delivery.. medication. retirement checks.. Pence?
So, Bidens pitch is Trump destroyed the economy and we need Biden to turn the economy around and his plan to do that is to shut down the economy even more? Yeah, that sounds like an argument from a man with no issues of cognitive ability .
you realize there are also a lot of rich democrats/liberals of all races, genders and lifestyles? they're not giving their fortunes back to the people now, why would they want to do it under biden?
Unfair stats since Biden did no mass testing &amp; since EVERY death in US since March has been "COVID" with huge financial incentives given to hospitals with specific instructions for death certificates. What IS fair Biden/Obama IGNORED their pandemic entirely Trump responded hugely
Trump has been raising money before Biden was even chosen as the nominee. 48 million is a lot because it was a record breaking amount for any democratic ticket ever in history. It’s significant
The President's plan, lay bare Mr. Biden's record so the American people can judge for themselves.

Joe Biden will not take questions or debate President Trump before early voting in Sept because he has Dementia and you and his handlers know President will destroy him-Kamala Harris -he will take her down.
You can't believe his words and not vote for Biden now. Biden, far from perfect, is the only chance you have to prove you mean this. Because Trump is the absolute opposite of all that Malcolm X stood for. And that's the truth.
#PresidentTrump slams #DementiaJoeBiden for Hiding from #FakeNews   #JoeBiden has had ZERO PRESS CONFERENCES that Require Answers to LIVE Questions ALL have Been Prepared and edited Video Responses   Is he even ALIVE at this Point ?  #SaturdayThoughts
Tell the world again how you and  Joe Biden who has dementia and getting worse -will beat President Donald J. Trump. DONT THINK SO!!!!! MAGA/KAG 2020
Yeah I miss James too but I wouldn’t cross the street for Joe Biden not even for the love of money.
It was kind even for solid journalism. Colbert phrased it as gently as he could. Harris didn't just attack Biden, she accused him of something horrid. Either making false accusations of that magnitude are nbd to her, or she's perfectly happy to make common cause with racists.
Absolutely. Hard left will vote biden allot of moderates wont. On  base, we are all in. So to win, dems will cheat. Ie... 112% of the voting population in Cali. 12% voter fraud already

We recently drove halfway across the country and did not see 1 biden sign...only Trump signs.
Basically lays out Biden as another LBJ. LBJ model produced high level of legislative outcomes; on flip side, the lack of understanding of the cultural revolution &amp; his foreign policy blunders depending on the pro-war establishment led to disasters on both fronts. Biden redux?
Biden: We brokered the deal!   Deal Signing: 3 1/2 years into Trumps FIRST term. 😂   Biden has been in public office for 60+ years, 8 of which were as VP in the White House, and NOW Biden claims he has all the answers.   Dems are desperate!   TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸
I love crazies so long as they aren't antifa and blm crazies of pedo politicians like Eric Swalwell or Biden the child sniffer.
please watch, retweet and/or favorite this worthy and worthwhile YouTube video: Democrats And Biden Are So UNHINGED And Broken That Even Obama SLAMMED Biden As Unfit For Office
3 as  spoke about on the panel? I'm good with it. We just have to make sure the current POTUS is a distant memory by next January. And then we can have President Harris start the Disclosure process. Wait, did I say that? I meant President Biden, if he wins. ;-)
Biden &amp; Obama failed miserably with the swine flu in 2009. No testing, no social distancing, no border closures. A minimum of 60 million Americans were infected with H1N1 and all we heard from Biden &amp; Obama was 🦗 🦗 (Crickets)
I agree. There are plenty of ways to attack Biden. She’s not important
I'm #NeverBidenNeverTrump, and Im in a swing state that rejected Biden in the primaries.   He's fucked here.
If its equal to or less support for Biden, he will lose.  He doesnt bring any more people in than Hillary did.
Well I am realistic and I realize that likely Biden may win so I just have to hope that you are right.
You need your meds adjusted lady . Biden can’t complete a sentence 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
The State of Nevada, with their large Latino population rejected Biden in the primaries.  I also am not voting Biden.  Nevada is a swing state.  You guys are fucked.
Arizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
Honestly Biden shouldn't do or say anything till election. Im astounded that 40% of people are still going to vote for Trump.
If everyone voted today, and there was no cheating.   would win, 70% TRUMP/30% Biden. #Trump2020  LANDSLIDE!!! ❤️🇺🇸🕺
I didnt do that.  Democratic Establishment did that.  They did it in 2016.  They are doing it now.  Do you really think they care if Biden loses?  They make a fortune if he loses.
That's exactly why they will never have my vote for Biden even if he DID have some redeemable qualities.  But even with that, he is still a racist.  He is still a rapist.  He is still a warmonger.  He is still going senile.
So....what do you think Biden is going to do about it?  And why do you believe him considering his track record of lying?
This! Obama/Biden totally misread the Middle East. Everything from Benghazi to the Arab Spring, Syria, Iran, the Palestinians... Trump realizes what is important to the Arab gulf states— it’s not the Pals, IT IS SECURITY! Am I right  ?????
Joe Biden Voters Need Trigger Warning For Blazing Saddles  via
Easy on Biden, he is an easy beat. Dems want him out so Harris can run. Don’t give the opportunity
Shows you how wrong Obama Biden were for 8 years when it came to ME foreign policy. That administration misread every single event in the ME, from Iran to the Arab Spring, to Bengazhi, to Syria ....
Biden still pronounces it wrong
Because I dont see Biden saving even one more life.
No.  He stripped it out with a majority in both senate and House.  Likely because of DEMOCRATIC DISSENTION.  Biden said he will VETO it.  Gtfoh
Its already being narrated for Kamala.  Which is why we dont care for Biden winning either.  A Biden loss may actually be taking the bitter pill for a better future.
Democrats in Congress...lzy stingy do nothing Democrats out for themselves only!  Don't be fooled by puzzled together Biden commercials...
You have to admit that whenever President Trump talks he answers all questions even assclown questions from Acosta, may not be the answers they want. You can NOT say that about Biden/Harris, they wont even let invited, fawning media ask softball questions, got to ask, WHY?

Biden’s whole campaign really is “I’m not Trump” LMAO
Then you should have chosen Bernie.  No one to blame but yourselves because we did warn you that Biden was NOT the most electable because we wouldnt vote for him.  Why are you so worried now?  This is what you asked for when you ignored us.
Probably good for people to know what Biden’s “BUILD BACK BETTER” is really tied to.  Unsurprisingly, The U.N. &amp; Globalism / #Agenda21

What part?  Bidens love of fracking?  The Paris Peace Accord, while a step in the right direction had no enforcement within it, so it is irrelevant.  Look at Biden's donors, and tell me he will fight against their interests.  "Nothing with fundamentally change".
Just got a text that Joe Biden needs my help in his nigh-postumous quest to make Kamala Harris president.
There is no law that says Biden has to sit for an interview same as there’s no law that says Donald Trump has to show his taxes.
During Biden's time as VP The  predicted the Affordable Care Act would hurt the economy and kill jobs The GOP was wrong again this act coincided with the best economic expansion and job creation in years.    I am voting for  and
Trump takes questions by lying and evading. Trump has run this country into the ground and is rarely ever challenged. Biden says “Uh” before giving an answer and the story is how he’s slipping.

"FNC’s Wallace: Biden ‘Not Doing Really Any Serious Interviews." I assume this is Chris Wallace's statement, word for word.  It SHOULD have said 'Not Really Doing..................' Hey, this Chris Wallace Dem. Liberal Puke on Fox News payroll needs to learn how to speak.
Biden is confused again. He’s not aging well.
When Biden was VP there was an increase taxes on the wealthiest Billionaires by 1% it was followed by strong job growth, shrinking budget deficits lower unemployment rates and one of the lowests poverty rates in history.   I am voting for   and
But would have been Pete.  Pete is advising Biden.
Joe Biden May be the fakest Democrat ever running for President! He has given some rants in the Senate that sounded likeGeorge Wallace!!
They 100% should. Biden/Harris isn’t going to stop this nonsense
Not looking good for Biden in Las Vegas Nevada 🤔😂😂😂
Obama was Pres in 2016, BIDEN Vice pres, Lynch AG, Comey Dir of FBI, Brennan Dir of CIA, Clapper Dir of NI, it was THEIR job to make sure the Russians did NOT interfere with the election. They KNEW about it! THEY FAILED! Investigate THEIR failure!

Kanye, I know Jared is telling you that you can do this, but you can’t. You won’t be President this time. Biden will. Then you, trump and Jared can get together and rail against him.  And in 4 more years you can run.
Well we won't survive another 4 years of Trump either, so it's a tough choice. Maybe have Biden fix things up after Trump in the next 4 years and then choose someone new?
The Trump death cult is raising more money than Biden.  Whichever campaign spends the most usually wins.
You got your facts mixed up. Obama and Biden inherited broken economy and they brought it back alive, creating millions of new jobs. In less than 4 years, Trump has destroyed it all. We need Biden to rebuild the economy after Trump, just like he did after Bush.
It's Trump's fault and he's raising more funds than Biden.  Get ready.
Very funny but who wasted their money even buying a Biden flag 🤦‍♂️

So no.  I won't be voting Biden.  I have real values, that don't weigh one kind of racism vs the other kinds of racism, and then determine with racism is the lesser evil and VOTE FOR IT.   No thank you.  I'd like each and every one of the #BidenHarris2020 to consider #VoteGreen
Biden without his meds.
Also Biden is extremely racist &amp; Harris abuses her power to oppress black/brown people. There is a lot of tension today about race issues now &amp; its tone deaf of the Dems to get all White Nationalist us.
Following!
Biden will NOT fix anything, and not with Harris as his VP, he becomes even more dangerous.  Because this is likely an attempt to recreate the "Obama got his shot, now #ItsHerTurn" bullshit from 2016 all over again.  Harris has proven herself to ONLY act in the interests of...
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Lets ask JOE biden ?
Now people rally for Biden to "stop Trump".  But what has Biden done?  Forbes suggests that he has AT LEAST 9 mil, and likely more since he started his campaign.  Yet the Democratic voter wants him to "fix" things?  Go back and look at how many Democrats voted for Trumps tax cuts
I will vote for Biden. I will even risk voting in person.
To make myself completly clear. I will absolutely concede that there have been a couple things done by this administration that were good. But the bad and poorly handled far outweigh the good in my opinion. Also I think Biden and Kamala are trash as well but just less trash.
Facts about the criminal.  The funny thing is you support Harris and Biden but then support BLM? Harris has kept black men in prison since 1990 at a rate of 5x of white men. Biden has been a lifelong racist.  Hypocrisy at an all time level.
Biden releases his taxes, so Trump should too... right?

Harris is too ambitious to fall for what’s coming. Your right she took the bait but I don’t think she’s capable of leading our Country on some one else’s moves.  Soon as the honeymoon is over she’s gonna realize she’s just a black prop with no say. Just what Biden was with Obama

I want to donate to the Biden/Harris campaign every day.
You are spewing far left propaganda due to a lack of a far left candidate on the ballot while failing to realize that both Biden and Harris have adopted considerably progressive agendas and will appoint a number of progressive experts to the executive branch cabinet positions.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
This is such a poorly misguided take.  The Biden/Harris campaign has done nothing to alienate the referenced age group - not to mention that you shouldn’t lump Millennials with Gen Z for obvious reasons.  There has been no attempt to compromise with the current right-wing agenda.
America needs a Biden/Harris national town hall titled "Brats, Beers and Hookahs".
He is a warmongering Clinton puppet. Vote Biden get Neoconservativism on steroids and likely a Nuclear Holocaust.
President Trump is not a empty vessel for anyone, They hate him because he beat Hillary..then helped set him up for a crime he did not commit-the real reason HE WILL NOT KISS THEIR ASS, Joe Biden has dementia-they can control him. That is what this piece of shit Jayapa is saying!
You're correct, we CANNOT afford to elect the corrupt demented pervert sleepy Joe Biden nor the lying corrupt phony Kamala Harris. They definitely would be a disaster for our county. They're extreme Socialists who would ruin our economy &amp; export jobs. We need to keep Trump-Pence!
"IF ELECTED &amp; YOU DON'T SURRENDER YOUR GUNS, I'LL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER &amp; THE POLICE WILL SHOW UP AT YOUR DOOR."  -KAMALA HARRIS.                      She is crazy ... &amp; if anyone votes the Biden ticket ... will be a sad day for Americans!
Add Harris for being a cop and using Biden's crime bill to its furthest extent to enslave imprisoned PoC.
COVID?  Blame goes to:  Trump for not alerting us to the issue earlier. Pelosi and McConnell for going on break while people are being evicted. Pelosi again for "Ice cream" commercials and torn up speeches. Biden for Corvette commercials. Every pol that pushed corp. interests

Postal Carriers Union endorsed Biden...what could go wrong with mail in voting!!!
This is not to say that Trump isn't abysmal.  Its to say that we have no champions of justice.  Police in the street?  The blame goes to:  Biden's Crime Bill Cheney's Patriot Act And every politician, including Trump who did not fix it.
My sincerest sympathies to you.  I hope that he will come to his senses and change his mind.  Vote Biden/Harris!!!
Well YOU SHOULD be concerned. Biden has dementia and Harris is a fraud. These two don't care about YOU at all.  Their plans would hurt MILLIONS of Americans. #SocialismKills   Kamalama Ding Dong wants to defund the police. HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR AMERICA??  You KNOW Biden is a pawn!

THIRSTY MARCO, I lived in Florida at the time you became a Senater and I do not remember you saying anything about our manufacturing leaving the country at that time. Biden has said he will bring it back. Do what you can to help him do it.

No honoring our past heroes! Only looting and destruction! Biden = Mobs - Trump = Jobs
I agree.  Though from what I understand, he was also a part of that "six figure" ad strategy to get us to "settle for Biden".  He's not perfect, but he is right in this instance.
Biden please... at least he can remember what he inherited.
This woman helps me feel sane in a gaslit world. She gets it. She's the President we deserve, and someday I hope to make that happen. I don't want to vote for Biden now, but if we're ever going to get to AOC, it's what has to happen. #aocforpresident #settleforbiden #byedon

Remarkable resemblance to Joe Biden about to take a nap
Abraham Lincoln has a famous quote: Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.  One candidate may ride this strategy to the White House and  the one in the WH should consider it  every now &amp; then
Biden not only has no intention of fixing the crime bill, or the student loan BK bill, he doesnt even acknowledge the damage its done.   Harris hasnt acknowledged the damage she caused to PoC lives by choosing to NOT parole someone because she needed cheap labor. Or scaring PoC..
OK Everybody, I'm organizing a Biden Boat Parade,  whose with me?
Did any of them detail that?  Or fight against it?  Or try to change it?  Bernie compromises. But when he explains his reason, and then goes to try to fix what he doesnt like, then his actions match his words.  Biden and Copmala have both doubled down on their mistakes.
Well, we already know he kept Hidin Biden hid for most of his VP term. Then endorsed Killary with open arms. Could barely utter a complete positive sentence for his former VP in the current endorsement....So, is ANYONE really surprised?
In the end it passed overwhelmingly. I can see Mr K calling Mrs H, but since day 1 of Trump's inauguration it's taboo for Dems to work with the white house.  In the end it was a Huuuge slap in the face to Dems after 8years of Obama/Biden.

He wouldn't know how to petition. It's the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN lawyers and operatives doing this. The BOTTOM LINE is, a bunch of white RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS are using a black man to stay in power and keep their stranglehold on American democracy.  I'm with Fightin' Biden' and Nasty!
The stuff they’ve rolled out on her after being selected validates Biden’s choice. Great pick!

And yet he does neither. If you expect the people to take the media seriously, you have to apply an equal standard, &amp; it's not even close, including Axios.   It's so obvious you guys are in the tank for Biden, it's why many people have signed off of listening to the media.

Would you let Joe Biden near your kids?
I think the perfect example is the recent pick for the Democrats pick for Mr. Biden’s running mate. Many Dems insisted it had to be a black woman. It shouldn’t matter what color or gender.
Please hurry this up. The idiots that voted for her are dumb enough to vote for Biden. Something needs to wake them from their slumber.

On Wednesday during the Dem Convention, Tulsi Gabbart seems slated to introduce Kamala Harris. That seemed lit, until I realized they won't even be in the same time zone and these speeches will likely be taped, not live. Biden's will NOT be live. It will be highly edited.

At least she hasn’t been shepherding her supporters &amp; campaigning for Biden. I’ll give Tulsi the benefit of the doubt through the November election while she still has her seat in Congress
Voting for Biden will solve nothing. You need to break the system.
How come  can expose all this stuff but couldn’t  expose joe Biden and help Bernie win
Agreed, we are personally accountable for our vote.   Aren't agency and charity signs of morality?   Does Biden support police dismantling, antifa and Palestine? His friends and party do.
In A Single Moment Of Truth, Ron Johnson Destroyed The Trump/Putin Plot To Smear Biden -
Voting other than Trump is a vote for Biden.   Although Trump has been immoral and not taken public steps to repent, he reps the greatest morality of agency.   The DNC nationwide dismantles police and talks of secession. Sedition and treason are not free speech.
so all of this happened only under trump.obama,Clinton,pelosi, schumar,biden, all extremely wealthy. That’s corruption it runs deep in both parties.government is corruption. People get rich with zero consequences.
Biden says we have to wear masks for 3 months. Newsweak says acquired immunity only lasts 3 months. Is there something important coming up in 3 months?...hmmm🤔

Kamala wants to be President. She will say and do anything to squash Biden like a bug if elected.
Time for a Biden to start ramping up the offensive attacks. Tiptoeing around Trump will not help him win.
as i think  has said: biden is running as mayonnaise. people aren’t excited about mayonnaise but mostly think it’s fine and good especially when the alternative is ammonium nitrate
closest you’ll get to that with biden is like a rally with springsteen and biden saying “nebraska was my favorite record man” or some shit and then going on to talk to people in eau claire about wearing masks and mailing checks because biden’s people aren’t dumber than pigshit
Biden lost two primary’s .. he was selected as VP and about to be your President...
No Bumbling Biden is. Even Obama is afraid he can’t do it. Foreign countries are hoping he wins because he’s so weak.
Every single one. He wants Biden to win because he’s so weak with foreign policy.
You will be broke and at war. Biden has no staying power and that is why Russia and China are hoping he wins. Weakness.
Let me explain: the majority of the US wants you “fired.” BTW: your “Sleepy Joe” references are falling flat, no one’s buying it.We finally have a future POTUS who speaks in complete sentences that make sense.  VP Biden also smiles, laughs, &amp; has a sense of humor. How refreshing

You have to admit that whenever President Trump talks he answers all questions even assclown questions from Acosta, may not be the answers they want. You can NOT say that about Biden/Harris, they wont even let invited, fawning media ask softball questions, got to ask, WHY?
Prediction:  If Biden/Harris wins, they will find a way to be worse than Trump.  You heard it here first.
Lol  So predictable I already knew Biden was gonna pick you as VP  Kamala Harris is technically the next president  Harris is the president in waiting lol hahaha
It was just a debate? Is she implying not to be taken serious about everything she says in front of national live television? Here's a full clip where she tried saving herself for calling Biden a racist.

Regardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?
If he is losing to Biden and the polls are correct, then why are the Dems going nuts trying to establish national mail in ballots, why are they panicking about the ability of the USPS to handle the mail in ballots.  Trump is going to win.
Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.

Fucking up a presidential campaign can be very educational.  Many have argued that Harris is a great lawyer for a client like Biden, but not sure how to argue her own case. I think there might be some truth to that. If they win, she has 3 years to figure out her own case.

Biden’s said he wants Republicans to continue to hold at least some power so I don’t know what I’m supposed to take from this
Yeah that’s fine, I think that’s where most people are at. Some people, like a handful of my friends, (I think especially true for veteran activist and advocates) view the Dems and Biden/Harris in particular as terminally compromised
dont know who needs to hear this but the decision isnt  elect biden and do nothing  or elect trump and resist   we can elect biden... and resist
The Biden/Harris ticket is probably gonna do just fine without any of these friends, it’s not like they’re a large voting bloc. I do think it’s kinda entertaining how worked up some other people have gotten just because they can’t imagine that actual anarchists actually exist

Ok ok... there’s a good point... (paraphrasing AF) like, the understanding is that the Biden/Harris people won’t be pressured. Like, they think that premise and kinda that whole concept is more of a Dem PR strategy than anything they allow to effect them
The choice has never been more simple. But mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting, and cheating, on a high scale, by dems, has never been MORE ominous and prevalent.  Biden-Harris are what's NOT RIGHT for America, positively.   But the cheating, to get them elected, looms large.

Hey Hill:  This guilty FBI Deep State Swamp Lizard is the tip of the Obama iceberg. This spying corruption leads all the way to Obama Biden.  Comey, McCabe, Clapper, Brennan, Rice, lots of others should be in jail for their treasonous crimes to bring down Trump. Disgraceful!  MJ
Police Unions endorse Trump. Biden is for lawless and disorder.
Kamala Harris is already bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
u really think joe biden is capable of fixing enough problems to keep the increasingly agitated middle class complacent? i dont
Can’t believe that you’re asking such a ridiculous question. If somebody needs to encourage you to vote for Biden then you’re probably still leaning towards Trump.
if trump gets re elected, all the libs will think the problems in this country are because of him. if biden wins, and none of the huge issues we face gets fixed, they will see that the problem lies deeper in the roots.
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Joe Biden for president.
Love this guy! Walking around with a MAGA HAT... CAN GET YOU SHOT IN THIS IS DAY AND AGE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN ONE YEAR PEOPLE!!!!!!! WE CANNOT LET BIDEN WIN!
She said Biden would be gone before the election, the only thing that's gonna be gone is the box of wine under her desk... by noon.  But seriously, she is one of the most vile persons ever to be given a microphone.
Are there any women of colour in the Presidential race, no, vice-presidential, yes.  Is Kyra telling us what we already know, Democrats already bailed on Biden.

Well what they're going to do is declare martial law probably, and then do whatever the hell they want! We cannot elect A BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET, OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT!

They've received orders from the top regarding how they portray Harris and Biden absolutely sickening!
Sounds like something Biden would say too
That’s an extremely bad faith reading of this writing.  Biden’s grades and his IQ comments expose how he understands himself and how DC people understand Biden (or don’t).  It’s an extremely relevant background to the Obama-Biden relationship. It is not an attack on Biden.
💙❤️Nevada born &amp; raised(proud American)&amp;family lived in Nevada for (41) forty-one years.💙❤️Vote for BIDEN/HARRIS whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. As a TRUE Nevadan,please vote for Biden(A genuinely good person&amp;very well-educated).Spread kidness!
Hey James:  WOW.  Beijing Joe was right years ago when he described the predators on our streets murdering people everyday.  He called it right then.  Now Biden refuses to say we need to crack down on these killers.  So we see the murders in many big cities.  MJ
I see only a few low level staffers getting indictments. 2-tiered CJ system and the big ones like, Comey, Clapper, Rice, Biden, Brennan, will only get the title - “UN-indicted co-conspirators”. This will be a wash for the American citizens.
Cynical move for alt-left and alt-right votes. It’s also another tell that his divide and conquer plans are failing because Bernie and most of his crew are backing Biden pretty forcefully. And there is no real third party challenge yet outside the Kanye fraud.
Hey Beijing Biden: Respect strong, smart women.   Have worked with many.  Kamela Harris showed us during various hearings that she is not likeable and a real Bitch.  She called you a racist and a sexual predator during debates. KH did not resonate with Socialist voters. MJ
I would eat cat poop before I voted for Biden👍
Joe Biden did all those things though....
Biden’s friend!
So Joe Biden is Super Liberal #coronavirus now? Your tweet is SO backwards
Just remember, you are not just a representative of Calif, you are representing women of color around the US. Black, Latino, Asian,  and Native American women are looking to you with hope. Praying that you and Joe Biden prove that we are making the right choice!
Biden will accept the nomination then step down, allowing the Dems to select a new candidate. He has to get the nomination first.
But Russia is involved.  Ypu can't fraud a mail in vote, but you can hack a electronic vote machine if you know what to do. That's my thoughts about it and I'm sticking to it. I'm voting for Biden/Harris by mail-in.
Lowbrow —— ( not quite humor, not quite satire, not informative, less interesting. How many rape cases have been filed against T——? How many settlements have been made to rape claimants on and off the record, how many shots of Biden with Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell? I’ll wait...
Fucken criminal.  I'm voting by mail just to spite and to  defy him "just because"  I refuse to stand in a Republican virus so reading line . Puke ass punk Trumpy.  What the Fuck is wrong with him.  I've had enough of his bullshit by his shithole administration.  I'm voting Biden
If you view this and you come away with the notion "I want to vote for Biden" then you get everything you deserve if he becomes president
There's going to come a time with the media where they're going to get so pissed off, even the left-wing media, with them not answering questions that they'll have to start attacking Kamala Harris and her puppet Joe Biden!
Of course no questions for Biden and Harris because it's a scripted event and they don't want to show what a blathering idiot Joe Biden is too soon! As if people don't already know already!
This totally makes sense for Nancy Pelosi's little slip of the tongue a while ago about being second in line for the presidency! Leftist liberal Democrats might want to rethink their choice of Joe Biden in November!
That's the thing about these idiots today voting for Biden and Harris! They could care less about those two and what they stand for and what they don't stand for! They just don't like Trump and that is not a qualification to vote anyone into the highest office in the land!!
Kamala Harris doesn't know what nationality or ethnicity Kamala Harris is,, she'll be whatever you want her to be as long as it gets her to be the president! She has no interest in the vice presidency she's just biding her time to deem Biden unfit if he wins!
I don’t care for trump but anybody “settling” for Biden is just showing the Democrats that they’re able to have anybody as a candidate which is the lowest standard, if you plan on being better than the Republican Party at least vote somebody in who is actually better
#PresidentTrump did this... Biden didn't.
Hey Laura:  Communist US Conference of Bishops missing in action.  Should oppose Biden Harris because of their support for unrestricted abortion.  But the Bishops support Open Borders,  Green New Deal and idiotic defunding Of police.  They are supporting Biden.  Disgraceful!  MJ
It’s trumps friend Alex Jones (QANON dude), trying to distract from from trumps rape charges, and too discredit Biden, trump &amp; Jones’s followers not only fall for it, but they run with it, adding fake articles along the way, it’s all evil, but God has final say🙏
Hey Bishop: Communist US Catholic Conference of Bishops missing in action.  Should come out against Biden Harris because they support unrestricted abortion. Pure evil! Since They Support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding Of police, they remain silent.  MJ
no you WONT be getting a Nobel Prize, you cannot compete with President Obama, and you cannot steal his Nobel Prize, you’ll never be a tenth of the man that President Obama is,  oh I’m sure President Biden will receive a Nobel Prize, &amp; Dr Fauci also, but not you
Hey Bishop:Waiting for the US Conference of Bishops to come out against the evil Biden Harris ticket. The Bishops are missing in action because they support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding of the police. What about unrestricted abortion infanticide!  MJ
Hey Bishop:  Why aren’t we hearing from the US Conference of Bishops.  Biden, who pretends to be Catholic and Harris support abortion right up until birth and even after.  Pure evil.  Deny Biden Communion.  Faith without action allows evil to prevail.  👿’s work.  MJ
Australia today - USA on Jan 20, 2021 if Harris/Biden elected.
Remember Biden made the statement, he was running for a senate seat. I don’t believe he knows he is running for President. Therefore we now have Kamala .
Can’t wait for the debates between Biden and President Trump!!!!
Biden plagiarizes all the time, he has done it for years. He never has decent thoughts of his own maybe that is a good thing.
Biden campaign raises $26m in 24 hours after announcing Kamala Harris pick
Trump begs Biden to stop ‘scoring political points’ on his own coronavirus failures. “It’s a shameful situation for anybody to try to score political points while we’re working to save lives,” said Trump. Traitor trump has nobody to blame but himself. He failed Americans !!

yes, hitting the phones would be MUCH more effective than a video advocating for biden being put on a platform for hundreds of thousands to see.
Sounds like something Joe Biden would say lmao
#RussianRepublicans #TreasonousTraitors #Lie #Steal #Cheat #ChangeTheRules and #Kill to “win”
I know that in general, more information is "always good." However, this information is meaningless.  If Biden wins, then the list is Biden 99.9%, All Others 0.01%. Why are we even bothering to talk about a presidential election that has no context?
I’m sorry. Maybe I’m not a true progressive thinker but wishing death on people like kamala and joe biden ain’t my cup of tea. That’s disgusting and just not my style.
This is what a Biden / Harris presidency will look like, A DICTATORSHIP FOR ALL. HE'S MAKING DEMANDS ALREADY AND HE'S NOT EVEN PRESIDENT YET!
i am participating in the election TO DISRUPT. i dont want the DEMOCRATS to win,i want the LITERAL FASCIST out of one of the most powerful offices on the planet. unfortunately, that means a vote for biden at the time being. im not planning on letting the dems sit pretty jfc
aaaaaand we are back to the false choice thing you did at the beginning. i am going to vote for biden AND THEN BULLY AND ADVOCATE AND PROTEST FOR THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF THE POLICE its not that complicated of a position to understand
Well, great! We only get to decide between two men accused of rape! And we have a rapist on the Supreme Court! But I think the world will be made worse with Trump, so I will vote for Biden and hope Harris will replace him...although I prefer Warren.
Lol. I would say the Dems are so desperate they would run a wooden dummy for president and and as it turns out they are, and they know it. Again want their way- hiding  Biden’s mental defects behind a wall of opacity.
If their going to blantly lie why stop at something this meaningless?  Why not say if they win, Kamala and Biden will put all the people who don't support BLM in concentration camps.  Fuck it if your gonna lie go big
IMO, the defining question (and presumptive lesson learned) that this election reprises is, “Will this prove to be a best foot forward?”
did you read my whole tweet or did u literally stop at "marx would advocate voting for biden" its really weird it seems like you only are responding to this tiny piece of my whole argument whats that called again?
marx would advocate for voting biden and continue doing social and leftist work outside of that. he disagreed with political accelerationism, because it doesnt really tend to work. he favored economic accelerationism, things like general strikes. maybe you need to read up
Ballet for Biden at the Nevada State Capitol #SignsAcrossAmerica #UnitedForBiden #WeWantJoe
Well then, get Trump out of office. Biden is the lesser of two evils.
Thank you for your service sir! You were so inspiring and touched my heart. Thank you also for voting for Biden!!
if you really think the material conditions of marginalized groups arent far worse off under trump than biden i dont even know where to start.
Thank you for your service Steve! Also, thanks for being a patriot and voting for Joe Biden
LIAR LIAR ON FIRE! No commie dem tells the TRUTH!  You know that Trump brought the economy back from the disaster that was Obama/Biden admin!  To the best economy in 70 years!  What a joke you are!I’m hearing you aren’t eligible to be a VP!  Imagine that. HEELS UP HARRIS!
you guys keep framing this as a choice, like if i vote i have to stop going to protests and shit. I CAN VOT FOR BIDEN TO SAVE SOME LIVES AAAAAANNNNDDDDD STILL ORGANIZE THATS THE WHOLE POINT
Thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden!
You are my only viewer. Also, who did Joe Biden rape? Feel free to talk about his crime.
these "Never Biden" people wouldnt piss me off so much if they werent so bad faith all the time. anyone participating in society in any way is a fucking liberal to these people.   "oh you pay taxes? LIB!!"
Trump calls out Biden for 'politicizing the pandemic': 'Appalling lack of respect for American people'
like i dont disagree with anything you said. its still better for the literal survival rate of trans/lgbt BIPOC with biden in office
do you really believe that the material conditions for marginalized people will be identical under either biden or trump?
and i advocate for both. but it is much easier for us to do real work under a milktoast liberal instead of an actual FASCIST. voting for biden is a utilitarian act to stop some bleeding in marginalized communities. i dont have any delusion of it being a radical move
BIDEN WOULD KILL JOBS : Joe Biden's tax policy puts these 16 consumer stocks at risk: Goldman Sachs  via
Biden supports Communism.
Trump desperately claims Biden will lock Americans ‘in their basement for months on end’
even if every leftist in this country voted green they would never get enough ground to even come close to competing with either of the established political parties. the sad reality is it is either biden or trump, and getting the fascist out is a top priority for me
okay and? they arent lying, they are deluded. the only people lying when they say biden is far left are conservatives
Joe Biden: For The Next 3 Months, All Americans Should Wear A Mask When Outside
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for nationwide mask mandate – live
Clinton was kinky, Bush wasn't (he was busy painting), Obama was and let's not even talk about Biden
Biden/Harris said:"We’ll create millions of jobs &amp; fight climate change through a clean energy revolution,"  Seems they started the partnership smoking crack together. This will kill millions more jobs.  p.s. They want union work = Sky-rocket cost
any actual leftists voting for biden are keenly aware he isnt progressive at all. the endless strawmanning is getting exhaustinggggg
Biden and Kamala represent the Dem. party very well.
Biden/Harris like our lives depend on it, because they do.
This is OUTRAGEOUS OVERREACH!   REQUIRE Montana, the Dakota's, &amp; rural areas a mask EVERY-TIME they step outside?  HALF of STATES: 1000 DEATHS OR LESS.  15 states LESS THAN 500. 5 less than 90.  #coronavirus  #kamalaharris
I couldn’t agree more!!  I don’t have time to listen to a bunch of negative crap about Biden and Harris. Anyone I see that says they better do this, I’m sitting this one out or they’re voting third-party I will immediately block. I’m done with the negativity.
In fact, I'd argue that Biden's plan should go a step further and abolish all homeowner's associations, because seriously, fuck those things.
Five thirty eight has given Biden the same exact odds of winning that they gave Hillary. Down to the exact number. And they’re supposed to get these things right?
He waited to endorse Biden in 2020 hrs.
Gotta love you, &amp; just for that, I too will go donate to Biden/Harris2020, you’re awesome, God bless you🙏
Also when i replied it had Biden at 68%
funny stuff in cartoon version but in real life Biden is a pedo
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia
Trump I understand you are busy but I feel you need to get rid of Biden and his new VP choice. I have a feeling if it can be done those two will raise taxes by trillions of dollars. If it can be done lock in it raise taxes only by a 1% -2% only no more lock in for 10 years
They didn't take them. We surrendered them.  " When you give up a little freedom for a little security, you deserve neither" "those who forget history are destined to repeat it" "Joe Biden is a pervert and Kamala harris has put more nonviolent Black people in jail than alabama"
Me filling out my ballot for Biden/Harris even though I don’t support them but they’re better than the nasty Cheeto in office and we’re stuck in a corrupt two party system so it literally comes down to the lesser of two evils
E) Biden will certainly win, barring extreme election interference, and I'm sick of all of this shit. My vote, like most American's is pointless. Democrats have been the centrist/conservative party since the 90s, when the GOP went full on batshit insane. Rabbitholes...

Fox “news🤡” is a clown car, a joke to all intelligent people and a playpen for mental midgets. I.e. Tucker Carlson the nut job.

Biden/Harris: a ticket every real American can vote for: good-bye fascism  #Biden #Harris #2020Election #Democracy #Trump #Fascism
I don’t know how DEM supporters can pretend to be excited about the Biden Harris ticket. Neither stand out as leaders, or visionaries. They have no ideas of their own. They will take their orders from the unseen powers.
Neither Biden or Harris will lead. They will take orders from their overlords.

Isn’t this how Biden selected his list of VP candidates? 😂 Georgia clothing store called 'racist' for appointment fee policy | Fox News
Maybe he really wants to see Biden/Harris in the WH? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I have a crazy theory, the other democrats were beating her up worse than expected, so biden told her to drop out, now that he's made her the VP nominee he'll drop out she'll pick coumo as VP
won't endorse Biden until he says we gotta push Israel into the sea
I have no talent for drawing comics but I’m realizing how much potential fame and fortune awaits anyone who can can weave the needle of “Ben Garrison, but for Biden”

This election is t about Joe Biden &amp; Trump. It’s Nationalism vs Globalism Socialism
This will come back and bite her and Joe Biden because they're counting on that millennial vote! Well this just destroyed it lol!
“Stip criticizing our very easily criticizable candidates for the highest title in the world, ya know the one with the power to deploy about 3 million troops worldwide? The one that’s funding concentration camps along our border? The shit that Biden won’t stop! Ohkaithxbai”
Only thing they were missing was one stuttering fool who can't compose two coherent sentences but wait a minute Joe Biden was there lol!
I agree I just don't want to waste my time with DHD, People's Party because its going to take them a while to think logically about this.  I rather focus on the people who are unhappy about voting Biden but will vote for him and grow from there.
We're on the same page as far as persuasion.  I want to influence Democratic voters and I think the way to do it is by being part of their circle not outside as DHD, People's Party. That means supporting Biden/Harris for now and pitching in Yang immediately after the election.
That's exactly my point. The people who are voting for Biden/Harris have a close relationship with the Democratic party and each other. It's its own bubble. And it's easier to influence if we're inside that circle.  We won't be able to do it as outsiders.
Biden/Harris...somehow, I feel like I’ll finally be able to get a full nights sleep after they take out the trash on January 20th. 😉
This is the kind of control we do not want a BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET WILL RESULT IN ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY! THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
This poll is gross. How could anyone vote Biden/Kamala? They must be blind and deaf!
Watching news media publish Biden/Trump poll numbers is honestly laughable but also annoying. I don’t have a short memory and 2016 is too fresh. I don’t see much trust in these polls.
I live In a rural area.  I'm voting for Biden.  Call me a cowboy, call me whatever.. it's that Wild West thing that drives me for Biden and Harris.   Not Trumpy's Regime of violence.   I'm on a self serving lockdown at our homestead from the Republican virus.  I'll live to vote.
Thank god for Biden. I feel so warm and comfortable again. It's amazing. I see the promise land coming. .  I don't see Mexico paying for a wall, or health care in his first 100 days or a "rock head" on Mt Rushmore
I'll take Biden/Harris over the fascist GOP any day!
Kamala Harris could get up there and stutter and spew gibberish just like Joe Biden and they would say it is all gold! This media has no shame!
Just saw ad saying Biden/Harris will lead us out of the covid-19 pandemic. I wonder how they can do that!!! Are they going to breathe in all the germs so that the rest of us no longer have to worry????
I give it 10 years and Iraq will be carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, unless Biden gets elected and decides to restart us interventionism.
HEY!! Everyone settle down. Joe Biden just called her CARMELLA. 😎🇺🇸
Joe Biden just pronounced it CARMELA. What? No reply?
I'm now over 60% convinced Biden will not be the nominee, Cuomo the executioner will end up being kamel toes VP
You're exactly right and we're not only fucked because of Biden possibly winning but the fact that Kamala Harris will take over as president shortly thereafter!
I hope America wakes up before November because if not Biden and Harris will destroy this country!
CNN and MSNBC will cover Biden and Harris up until the point to where questions need to be answered then they'll cut away to something else!
I have noticed that both Biden and Harris now will not take any questions at all or if they do take some they'll all be softball questions?? They will continue to hide from the media until November if they're allowed to!
That's exactly right, Kamala Harris will do and say anything to become president even having to denigrate herself and work under Joe Biden until she deems him unfit and is president herself!
Rest assured Kamala Harris is in this to be President she could give a shit less about being vice president she will be there to deem Joe Biden unfit less than a year in office!
Nothing; and I mean nothing scares me more than Biden and Harris winning the election.
Biden’s not a rapist, Harris isn’t transphobic; vote for the one who will do less harm to the marginalized.
You don’t care because it doesn’t fit your narrative. Obama was eager for Hillary and more than reluctant for Biden.
it’s depressing you let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Don’t back the orange turd, remember all the appointments Biden would make #SaveThePostOffice

Both parties are far right and serve corporate donors. They’re literally the same party. As far as the candidates go this time around, they’re both senile warmongering racist rapists so there’s not a lot of difference there either. Biden just rapes less.
And I just cried off my night cream.  Thank you for making the calls and sharing it with us. Heart wrenching and inspiring. Joining my Biden Harris phone banking training tomorrow afternoon!

You need background. Biden will support and enhance Obamacare. A US version of UK’s NHS? Great idea, but will never survive a Republican filibuster. We’re talking about a country that can’t even agree to wear masks in a pandemic. Trump wants to eliminate Obamacare. Biden doesn’t.
The possible trap I can see is if Biden wins, the left hammers down harder with their ideology and socio-pressures.  If Trump wins, then they hammer down with the riots and violent socio-pressures.

what's great is I predicted all of these replies in  my 2nd tweet.  It buys us time. Biden and Harris buy us time. trump keeps the clock ticking against us.
Notice Joe says, "If," not "when." And KAMALA is "ready to lead on day one." Your vote is for a far left VP who will take over quickly, bc they won't have a minute to lose. Biden's. Own. Words.
I remember Black groups harping on the fact that Kamala locked them up in record fashion...so did Biden for that matter.
I'm sorry but if you think Kamala Harris is a good pick for VP then you're actually a fucking idiot. She called Biden a racist that is guilty of his sexual harassment cases, imprisons a ton of small offenders, lengthed sentences for prison labor and jailed/fined parents.
To all at Fox Lies, your lame ass attacks on Biden &amp; Harris are totally, damn ignorant &amp; just plain moronic! America knows you are paid whores &amp; prostitutes for Ruppie Murdoch!  You will  burn in HELL! 11/3/2020 is Defeat Day for Drumpf!🇺🇸✌️

Question:  If Warren had been a POC, do you think Biden would have picked her?
You're very confused as usual Mr. Biden, HE SAID I QUOTE THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE, THE ISSUE BEING WHETHER TO TAKE DOWN THE STATUE OR NOT IN QUESTION.
With Joe Biden's very toxic VP pick  can't really support the Biden/GoldDigger ticket with a straight face. The two will make for "The Greatest Show on Earth" until #November3rd when it all ends. Glad to see Trump will get 4 more years now. #DemsElectionFraud

for you saying you didn’t watch Biden &amp; Harris speech, you sure comment on every single subject, on everything thing said, you are sure a pathetic loser, I can’t wait for the day you’re escorted (in handcuffs) off the people’s property, Americans property🙏🇺🇸🙏
Looking forward to her Biden administration replacement, who will be capable and ethical.
Harris is a phoney. Biden just lost his bid for president by hand-picking a gold digger whose been handed everything including every job she ever held. Her prosecutorial record of putting away innocent black men in California ended her nomination. Buh bye.

(2)I've said it before: Biden and the DNC are holding us hostage. trump is the gun. But if you give me the choice, I'll choose the hostage taker over the gun any day, because with the hostage taker, I at least have a chance at survival.  The gun has to fucking go.
You're preaching to the choir. I have a lot of trouble voting for Joe Biden. He's awful. AWFUL. He's responsible for some of the worst legislation in US history.  I 100% maintain he is 𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘣𝘢𝘥 than trump, however, and that with Biden, we'll at least have a chance to live.
Trump doubles down after being confronted with his claim Biden wants an ‘invasion’ of suburbs
well its ridiculous because its a mischaracterization of my position. im not voting for biden to shake up the system. im voting for biden to save lives while we shake up the system. a vote will 0bviously never change systemic issues. its a utilitarian action to reduce harm
well you are right about 1 thing, next year WILL be better because YOU WONT BE IN OFFICE, President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris will make it better, they put themselves aside &amp; work for the American people
Donald Trump is a liar liar liar, you’re evil, you are DONE, hey Diaper Don, you’re a LOSER! bye bye Donny Done! Stop you’re lying, EVERYONE knows you’re lying, so many, SO MANY Republicans are swearing to vote for Biden, so many say “I’m an ex-republican because of trump”
I see you’re as handsy as Biden.
Nevada political leaders respond to Biden's VP pick
It's not about Joe, or Kabala, or any of that.  The dems're gonna rig this election with ballot harvesting, fake mail-in ballots, and then PUSH THAT SOCIALSIST AGENDA!   THAT'S what it's about!   They don't care about Joe Biden or Kabala Harris.  Those two mean nothing.
Who wants to listen to donny downer after hearing from Biden and Harris?  Hope Love and Unity vs whiney self serving liar!  #BidenHarris2020
Biggest corrupt candidate team this side of Obama Biden. Democrats have been taken over by Marxist progressive thugs. #Trump2020Landslide
She checked all of Biden's boxes. Unfortunately.
this take is dumb and i dont have enough characters in a tweet to debunk it but basically, not a single lefty on earth is voting for biden and expecting systemic change from it. lefties are voting biden to save marginalized lives. organizing happens outside electoral politics.
Joe Biden/Kamala Harris is a conservative ticket. Paleo Republican if you will...
Who is trump?  After listening to Biden and Harris today I feel hope again. Why listen to donny downer?
Biden and Harris going after Trump is exactly what they need to do, bully the bully, its the thing Hilary didnt do enough of, go after him and make him lose his shit and prove how incapable his is to lead
OUTSTANDING🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️🙏ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Biden/Harris2020 give me hope for our country, hope for the world, I know our allies watched and they too now have hope, &amp; our enemies &amp; djt &amp; co are running scared now, praise God, #Biden/Harris2020
Biden and Harris enter the stage with this:  Curtis Mayfield - Move On Up  via
Joe: Biden: Kamala Harris' story is "America's story."  It is AN American story, a little words' meaning being critically important to understanding America, it rules and exceptions to its rules.
I love that  and  are going old school with Harris attacking the orange cur in the  That leaves Biden free to talk big picture, unity, vision stuff. It also sets up Harris for a future presidential run from day 1.  This team is smart and exciting
Kamala Harris has been critical of Biden and he still chose her as VP which shows he doesnt mind being challenged and wants to have a different point of view.  Trump has surrounded himself with yes men and fired anyone and fires everyone who dare disagreed with him.
Hey FN:  We listened to Beijing Biden and Phony Kamela Today spewing nothing but lies.   These two Socialists would turn America into Venezuela.  Poverty, misery and the murder we are seeing on our streets.  Riots, looting and arson all over our country.  This is the choice.  MJ
Everybody knows Biden is unfit to be president. If he won,(LOL), within 2 months,  he would step down and Harris would become president! Think about that, folks!!!!
U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey agrees with that assessment: “The Biden-Harris ticket is a powerful return to leadership competence and integrity and the rule of law. Sen Harris very experienced. Tough. Extremely intelligent. Also fully qualified to serve as President.
I can’t wait for Biden to sniff her hair
I think it is great news for the Trump campaign. Also I am not sure the Biden camp listened to Harris say that Uncle Touchy is a pedo and a racist.
CNN seems to think Biden will step aside for Harris shortly.

Correct. Now, do Biden quotes from 28 years ago.
It’s all good I get it. And yeah specifically on war corporate dems like Biden would likely be as bad or worse.
It seems that you’re correct. I had in mind if they chose a white woman like whitmer. Harris is a great choice and it has generated a lot of excitement. I was originally for her for president though I think that Biden could have chosen her for DOJ once again if white were chosen.
Yes, my point is just don’t downplay trump’s horrible foreign policy to make Biden seem worse. Trump tried to start a war with Iran, praises dictators, sent more troops to the Middle East before pulling some out to get it back around the number when he took office, etc
I more worried about younger people’s obsession with the kardasians. That will get him votes for sure. But I will not vote for Kanye, biden, or trump. They are all horrible people.
I still don't understand how someone can think Biden and Kamala ARENT centrist-right leaning.... But then I remember...
I agree with Laura on the international reputation point. That being said I think a Biden presidency would be equally as bad for foreign policy. They’re both senile warmongerers. I don’t trust either to not embarrass the US on the global stage, or to start/perpetuate war.
Biden has no chance to win.
Biden did not pick her she was picked for him it was planned and biden can not debatentrump he will lose .  And kamala is not african american she has a jamanican dad and indian mom
President Biden ain't into gold kitsch.
A Biden win will Kill the Market . Huge sell-off .I cant believe those that have enjoyed the the Great Trump economy and improved trade deals would B dumb enough to vote for this new Radical left agenda😱
I think we are close. Don't know if it will happen, but there are people that are trying to force a lot of things they shouldn't be.  It's almost feels like a trap whether Trump or Biden wins.
Biden, not my first choice. Harris, again, not my first choice. But they have experience, can put 3 words together and make a comprehensible sentence. They can also put together a team, which makes them a whole lot better than orange and wall paper paste.
That is the start of Season 46, followed by the "who's Biden this season" contest between Sudeikis and Woody Harrelson

BBC News - Why Kamala Harris is a historic VP pick for Joe Biden
Biden doesn't lie. If he misspeaks he immediately corrects himself.  Biden would take down an incorrect remark, before Twitter cld, &amp; immediately apologize. But mostly, Biden wld have done his research, conferred with the scientists &amp; make official announcements, not a  tweet
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
It’s remarkable that he is so unaware of his own propensity to project that he projected his personal value system onto Biden’s choice process without question and then justified it with hyper-local demographic specific wishful thinking.
Why would you vote for Biden?
"Percieved in Frisco"? Among WHO? Pelosis' followers? Maybe it's street scum, numbered in the hundreds, who don't know how to vote, much less how to change their drawers.  The "Biden/Harris Ticket" ain't nothing!  Ballot harvesting and fake mail-in ballots is the REAL problem.
Biden's not the only one with early dementia.
If Biden wants to lose, sure
I agree with you about Biden, Klobuchar, and Harris.
You are clearly unfamiliar with Biden/Harris ticket's deep ties to the prison industrial complex
No more bailouts for these criminals this is absurd anyone with common sense should understand, except for these extreme leftist communists. I want reality back! Look at what has occurred in the last 6 months can you imagine what would happen if Biden wins!!!
No. I am, however, disgusted that he chose a California cop with a shameful record of exploiting young black males to feed the disgusting &amp; bloated  prison industrial complex in California. Biden is responsible for entry of the same nationwide. What a terrible ticket
What bothers me about Biden is not exactly his sponsorship of the 1994 crime bill--I think the social conditions and realpolitik of 1994 complicate some of the after-the-fact criticisms--but how he reveled in its most brutal implications, like new death penalty cases.
Now there's a black woman involved, yeah, I think you can pretty much bank on trump's attention being less focused on Biden.

Republicans File Emergency Request With Supreme Court Over Vote-By-Mail Ruling
A short time after Joe Biden's announcement yesterday, Pres. Trump was asked about Senator Kamala Harris as a vice presidential pick. He said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
But she wants those people to vote in her favor.  Voting for Biden would be one of those "really bad decisions"
If Biden is really losing his mental sharpness I call he steps down somewhere between Year one and two, Kamala takes over and gets re-elected for a 2nd term.
Surely, now that Harris and Biden are together on one super strog, magnificent, golden ticket to heaven, their supporters will reach out an olive branch of peace to Sanders' suppprters, seeking our allyship and cooperation because they care deeply about policy and party unity.
Trump would never hire a woman who had been critical of him. Therefore he assumed Biden would not choose Harris. Wrong again!  He sees everything through the prism of his own narcissism.
T*ump, Biden, and Harris agree on I*rael. If you bring up the embassy relocation under t*ump, you're oversimplifying the situation. I do not have a fuck to give anymore. I am once again outside of the political realm and my ppl's humanity removed from public discourse.
Now that the Veep pick is in and is (unsurprisingly) also a Zionist, telling me to vote for Biden is literally telling me to choose your comfort over mine. For those of us whose lives are heavily affected by decisions around Palestine, the threat of worse does not exist.
Hey James:  If Biden wins, the day after Fake News and Other Socialists will begin pointing out his dementia.  Choosing a half Black woman will insure his demise.  They will not wait 4 years to get rid of him,  voting for Biden is really voting for Harris.  MJ
The Trump campaigns paid surrogates posing as  caricature of the “radical left” are not doing #SleepDon any favors portraying  as a cop. The memes Trump and his illegal  Russian ad agency trolls are flooding the info space with boosts Biden/Harris LE cred.
Dude. Look around Twitter. This is actually being talked about.  No bot here, just a pissed of Dem who can't believe this shit. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for 45. It's simple. #BidenHarris2020  Btw- just because someone says something you don't like doesn't make them a bot.
Do you think she was choosen based on her level of corruption &amp; willingness to be (potentially) compromised? It’s obvious to me. Kamala Harris is the obvious choice. I’m a former democrat, that’s just my option. I left the party when Bernie conceded to Biden. All I see is decept.
Hey Bill:  Biden’s VP choice is a critical issue given his dementia. If he wins, Kamela Harris will be President in the first year.  They will use the 25th Amendment to push him out, or he will just Resign.  So those voting Biden are really voting Harris.  Scary.  MJ
We're you shooting up.dope during the debates? Warren and Sanders absolutely mulverized Biden multiple times
Watch out people!!  Biden and kamala  are on a : " TRUMP ATTACK! ".  Fully loaded with A big gun;  The American Constitution!🇺🇸  Trump better go hide in his bunker!  And build a higher-useless wall around our White House!  You need to understand Trump: Our constitution lives on!
Agree, I’ve been referring to them as President Biden and Vice President Harris for months, looking forward to the next 4yrs, then for the following 8yrs of Madam President Harris, Amen, Amen, Amen🙏
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Yesterday afternoon, Joe Biden announced that his running mate in this year’s presidential election will be California Senator Kamala Harris. What do you think of the choice?
Text Biden if you want a hood ..
Biden picks a literal slave driver that doesn't care about black lives. The Dems have given a huge🖕to the progressives. Calls for defunding the police met with an AG a terrible history of keeping POC in prison for cheap labor...
I can't imagine listening to them together  or separately giving any kind of campaign speech! Especially compared to Trump, no passion, no message that appeals to real Americans, in 15 minutes it'll all fizzle out and then BIDEN will ask "Where am I"?
Suffering from the same long term illness that owns Romney.. Sore Loser TDS. A vote for Biden is a hard vote for socialism communism
Mr. President, the democrats will have Harris bully you because Biden doesn’t have it all together. Please ignore her, just keep after Biden. No matter what she states, just keep your statements and tweets on Biden.
Joe Biden has no problem with a woman by his side. trump is petty and vindictive. Joe is man enough to listen to the POV of women. trump is too insecure and sexist to see a woman as his equal.  And then there's Pence...1st of all he wld have to ask for mother's permission.
Trust me Biden/Warren not my top choice either. But I am playing the hand I was dealt. Disappointed but not disaffected. ✌
Does Joe Biden know who Joe Biden picked for VP running mate?
Why did team Biden choose to exclude diversity from the stage? Especially following your endorsement. Lame
Biden will win only with extreme VOTER FRAUD IN PLACE..
Example ballot:  Progressive - 1 Biden - 0 Trump - 0  Please explain how this equals a vote for Trump. I'll spare your brain the agony: it doesn't
Everyone you must vote this is a very critical time good vs evil,  whatever you think of Trump, if you vote for Biden you will be reimagining your world literally!
They will both share different basements however she will be a little bit more out in the public as she's not a gibbering idiot like Joe Biden is
Joe Biden doesn't even know what he had for breakfast let alone who he actually picked to be his vice presidential nominee. Someone did it for him and he's just playing along!
Kamala Harris is neither a moderate nor is she pragmatic,, she is a fake politician that will say anything and do anything to obtain power! She will deem Biden as unfit if he wins the presidency and she's looking to be president make no mistake!
If these questions do not get answered in the next two to three months rest assured they will never get answered if Biden and Harris win!
I know right! Everyone knows a couple of months into the Biden presidency, if he does win, she will deem him unfit and she will be the president!
Of course he and all the other liberal Democrats know that Joe Biden will say a bunch of batshit crazy things in a debate with Donald Trump so this is one of their arguments to stop that!
The DNC Monster needs to be abolished. They're only good at picking the worst possible candidates POTUS anymore. You should totally be speaking after going to the mat for Biden. Sad
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris believes she is going to be President of the United States not Vice President! I guarantee you one thing, 6 months to a year into Biden's presidency and she will deem him unfit!
I'm Riden with Biden Harris Ticket, you need to stop spreading Conspiracy Theories, you are the Problem.
The ones she locked up for pot or the innocent ones she sent away by denying exculpatory evidence? She is a favorite of the prison industrial complex!  With Harris pick, Biden reaches out to young Black Americans
Black activists praise Biden's pick of Harris, but warn challenges remain #SmartNews
Kids in school already in Florida and elderly homes have gone up 130% in cases of virus in the last 4 weeks. Are they better off in low income? No Vote Biden/Harris for a better future. Wear a mask. It only will continue if you dont. We are watching this extremely close in NV
Eh it’s honestly more like -98% Biden, -100% Trump. They are both extremely opposed to my values and beliefs, with the negatives greatly outweighing the positives. The truth is, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I voted for either of them.
Hey Smarter:  96% of Republicans are for Trump.  50% of Catholics.  90% of Evangelicals.  Predict Trump EC victory between 353 - 362.  Socialists. Biden - Harris will Be rejected.  MJ
Hey David:  Biden - Harris are nowhere near the middle.  They are evil Socialists so far left that they would turn our country into Venezuela.  Read the Socialist manifesto Biden had adopted.  They are Bernie/AOC.  MJ
Hey Matt:  No real Conservstive could possibly vote for evil Socialists Biden - Harris.  They support everything Conservatives oppose.  They would destroy our country!  MJ
They only picked her because they know Biden is not able and legally she is not able to be president if Biden has to step down, which means Pelosi is next in line. God help us. #Trump2020
There was never any bait. Biden was just the placeholder.
Biden picks Kamala Harris or Virgin Mary Republicans would find a million flaws.
They don’t even pretend that Biden abdicating to a female running mate wasn’t the plan from the start. They know that no one on the left will care anyway.
I love how the Biden supporter talks about abuse. Takes one...
Biden could pick Virgin Mary as a running mate and Republicans would find her not so full of grace.
Imagine thinking the country would somehow survive a Biden presidency. Like yes, the senile warmongering racist rapist who wants people to die due to lack of medical care and wants to lock up black people totally won’t also cause a revolution. This country is doomed either way.
Biden’s strength is tha he knows how the Executive branch of 🇺🇸 works, he know what being head of a state and commander in chief is about. He knows what can lead to mistakes or disasters. And most importantly, he isn’t looking to glorify himself because there will be a lot to fix
Don’t waste my time. You have a choice you can either vote for Biden or you’re voting for Trump there is no in between. I’m done with you.
Listen. I'm not a fan of Biden and Harris. Not even remotely. But we are once again in a position of choosing the lesser of two evils where one evil, if re-elected, will actively contribute to the deaths of minorities, LGBTQ+, POC, etc. So you cannot sit this one out.
Agreed. It’s like Illinois: you could win every county except Cook, but if your opponent wins Cook by a lot you’re toast. And I’m sure Biden takes Delaware.
Progressives, most, are learning to tolerate Biden (oops). This one, me, I'm so glad to see someone so fucking smart and articulate running for office. She scares the right people with good reason.
Without mentioning Trump give me three good reasons I should vote FOR Biden and Harris.
Oh lord. Mystery Science Theater meets  presser with Biden and Harris providing satirical commentary and laughing at him? He’d never leave his room again.
You make a stupid statement and then try to follow it up with a hit piece. I have every intention of supporting Biden and Kamala. I really try not to waste my time with Trump supporters.
I feel like Biden saw Maya Rudolph in SNL singing, “you could have had a bad bitch” and told himself he’d never be as stupid as the American people. #theclencher
I love Amy!  Love her. She was my 'want' as President and VP. She will be a positive and fierce advocate for the Biden/Harris ticket. 💙
I don’t know that  would’ve been comfortable in a Biden administration.  She’s cut from a different cloth.
Hey James:  If Biden was Elected, Fake News and the Socialists will do him in within the first 6 months to get the first half Black Woman President.   All of a sudden, Biden’s Dementia will be obvious.  Just wait.  MJ
Hey Alarreid:  Hiden Biden is no Catholic.  Beijing Biden supports abortion right up until birth and even after.  Biden must be denied communion.  Really should Never attend a Catholic mass.  MJ
CONGRATS ON KAMALA HARRIS BEING NAMED BIDEN'S VP. I HOPE BIDEN FINDS A PLACE FOR SEN, ELIZABETH WARREN ON HIS CABINET.
Biden’s would be DORY
I’m voting for Biden/Harris and so excited about it, I can’t stop smiling
Honestly Biden would likely put conservatives on the bench to appease the right anyway. And even if they were dems, they’d align with him politically so they’d be republican light.
No matter which one Biden picked Obama would say it was a perfect choice.  Not touching the nailed it comment at all.
Stop it dude. You are being completely dishonest or just incredibly naive. They could put 100 choices on every ballot. This is about Trump and Biden now. Any other vote is just wasted. Too many people died for me to vote, for me to just throw it in the trashcan.
Not to diminish Biden, but I am way more excited about Kamala.
Couldn’t care less there Biden Jr.
I need a crafty person or a campaign team to make me a Biden/Harris rainbow sequin tote bag. I don’t think it’s too much to ask.   Anyway here’s a picture of clouds.
Government is not perfect. It is ran by humans, so it is flawed. That is a fact. But look around you today. Is this what you want from your country? I dont. Biden is not perfect, he is flawed, but he is decent. I believe he is a better leader than 45. So I will vote for him.
How about a brain fight tough guy? I'm in Reno. Come look me up. Until then, we can disagree here.  Do you actually believe a Green Party candidate has a candles chance in a hurricane of winning this? They don't. So vote Biden. Anything else is straight Trump love. It's simple.
Okay!  In this case, I will yield to identity politics. This tandem gives you a perfect illustration for the true meaning of 'Uncle Tom.'  There is no ‘do no harm’ VP pick
Wow. Do you really need me to explain this big guy? How many Trump voters are going to flip to a green party candidate? I can tell you. ZERO You are here actively trying to persuade people to not vote Biden, and vote a 3rd. Trump, same # of votes, Biden now, less votes.  Simple🤔Biden is a racist pedophile
Try asking without answering in the same question. A question phrased that way is assuming I'm already agreeing with what's clearly a dug in position, and I don't play that game. Biden is consistently outperforming in neutral polls, seems like they picked right guy.
Can’t vote for a left wing radical like her,shame on Biden for picking her.
I saw a unicorn 🦄 today. A Biden flag. I couldnt believe it. I was like no way...they do exist.
This country does not need Joe Biden, that's for damn sure.
Ummm she +4 when you balance both. She’s not in a sinking ship like Trump... besides it’s Trump vs Biden , Kamala vs Pence
And we’re supposed to be AOK with  endorsing Biden and the only approved ballot delivery system? So, USPS will be in physical control of Republican ballots? No conflict of interest there...WTF
Ow. So you think Biden is a racist, and therefore Trump is the better choice?  Biden was not my choice, but I am voting for him. Because Trump is destroying the Constitution before our very eyes. Anyone is better than him.  Your turn. Are you voting for Trump? If so, why?
Please leave Biden alone, y'all!   Can a man finish his vital work without all the Tom Foolery?! Damn!
But Biden and Clinton said there’s nothing to worry about.... hmmm
In the beginning you all said virus doesn’t live in extreme heat. Obviously the media is a complete whore for ratings. After this year the media will be more hated than Trump and Biden combined
You left wingers gobble everything CNN says as fact. They lie to you everyday. Biden will be a disaster if he wins, if you want your life run by dictators vote Blue. If you stand for freedom and liberty Vote Trump2020
She's an actress. And not a very good one.  Her VP Joe Biden has the same phony laugh.  Very well practiced and obviously contrived.

B. No doubt!  The TP “hides” (like Biden) in the “A” model.  Especially for a dude standing who just needs one little square after number one.   My wife is on the wrong side of this argument. Ticks me off.
Which we have a better chance of getting under Biden/Harris than trump ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
WELL, NO....JUST THE DEMOCRATS MAKE AMERICA LOOK AWFUL.  ALWAYS HAVE FROM THE DAYS OF SLAVERY TO KKK TO NOT SUPPORTING VOTING RIGHTS FOR ALL, TO SCHOOL SEGREGATION (OF WHICH BIDEN WAS A PART).  AND THEIR BLATANT RACISM TODAY.  DEMOCRATS.....

POLITICS NOW: On this week's episode, we have reaction from all across Nevada after Joe Biden picks California Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential running mate, plus much more.  WATCH:
Worst logic ever.  Kamala is an actual cop.  I also addressed his mention of Bernie's vote numerous times.  Actions. He fought to change the bad parts of the bill where Biden/Kamala defend those parts unabashedly.  I blocked him for good reason.  Please dont send me his tweets.
People supporting Biden don't have any specific issues or policies they can point to as the reason why they support Biden. To be fair he hasn't given them any. Free healthcare and free everything else is not a platform it's a pipedream. They have nothing. Only hate for Trump.

Propaganda CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC? Biden has NOT denounced the likes of ANTIFA, Marxist BLM, or the destruction of statues, church burning, bible burning, looting, rioting, attacking law enforcement, attacking people. Biden said he would support additional funding with strings
I understand.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!

RNC Launches Website Exposing Biden’s ‘Disastrous Record, Hypocrisy, and Flawed Vision for America’
Joe Biden is white backlash, Donald trump is white nationalism. The backlash from the nationalism is a denial of the open racism, sexism, etc and a preference for systematic oppression. Joe Biden will make us (white people) feel like we aren’t a country ran by Donald Trumps.
Even Obama thinks Biden is a clown.  This is probably why he refused to endorse him during the primaries.
But Hillary tried "fumblingly" to get our votes after the primary.  Biden has completely abandoned us.  On purpose.
Thats the Democrat leaders of NYC. Get used to it if Joe Biden finds away to pull this off.  #Trump2020motherfuckers
The dysfunction of American “democracy” paired with systematic voter suppression and disenfranchisement of poc means that the system literally cannot create the change we need but yes let’s “push Biden to the left” like Bernie’s tried to do for 45 years and failed
Sarah, where have you been? The President has taken more questions in one day than Biden has in his entire campaign.
Is that the USS BIDEN?
I’m Never President Biden   I approve my message!
That makes her black dear. When the police pull her over. This doesn’t matter. Educate yourself you racist trash... but nonetheless.. Biden and Harris thank you for the donations
Biden and now Harris are both hiding. What the hell are the Democrats trying to prove? They afraid of any questions from the media. They can’t win doing this BS
Of course they don’t want to expose Biden to live questioning. The less he says without editing or notes, the better his chances to win.
Biden’s Navy
Racism exists, media fanning the flames, Biden is a racist, he cannot help himself, it's embedded in his brain which is turning to mush. If that's your choice then so what. I don't give a funion what you think of my grammar.
When Biden speaks!
Naaa if Jesus hates someone it's Nasty old Biden Trump 2020
Biden is a flat out loser. Harris a socialist. Not what America wants. He’s hiding from any journalist he doesn’t no. What a leader? Lol not
Dems are dead in water. They just don't know it yet. Kamala was worst pick in history. No one cares. Even black voters don't like her. And of course, no one likes Biden. Old feeble man w/dementia ready for Assisted Living, not WH.
Why do you think Biden’s Campaign has hired 600 Lidigators?
well of course. if they wear masks joe biden will do The Antifa to them
Adam can you do a deep dive into Biden? I want to know just how bad this man is.

Wrong! It’s Biden! Can you imagine this guy running our country? It’s gonna be Disaster for Americans!
Sounds like Biden supporters getting worried
They will flat out complain that Joe Biden is too boring.
It would help Biden just as much. He's one of the architects of the present mass incarceration state, and his running mate a gleeful participant in it. Trump is continuing the wars crimes of Bush and Obama, adding new ones using Obama's immigration policy, even making it worse.
They're on the same side.   The cop's comments about calling Biden a racist on stage during a debate should occasion you to think critically.  Voting will not solve this, because everyone on the government is committed to keeping power and increasing it when possible.
Joined in 2011 and only 134 followers.   Odd, but so common among the disinfo/misinfo propaganda accounts.  Biden/Harris 2020! :)
I will switch and vote for  I just realized that Biden is joke!
That's always been the case but it's probably worse now than ever.  There was this thing where the New New Left kids were sneering at Old Old Left people who urged the aging youngsters to vote for Biden and I was like "guys that's you in 2050."
I don't believe any claims Biden makes.
Let’s ask Biden some off the cuff questions.... no coaching, no earwig, no teleprompter.  SHOW US in at least a 45 minute question and answer who Biden really is. Live. Not video that is cut and edited.

I want you to be a part of the Biden administration. I waited in line in the cold for four hours to vote for you. Even after you dropped out.
Here we Clinton said a black name were super predators. But many black people still want her to get back in the game. Joe Biden has had so many Racially motivated scandals but Black people still want to vote for him. He can't even remember what he is half the time.
Hillary..... if Biden makes her SoS.  She would make Kamala, McConnell, and Pelosi (or whoever holds their seats) disappeared to take power.
thks For supporting Biden !! Your Great, excellent show today !!!
Joe Biden is just as racist Hillary Clinton is just as racist none of these people that you want to support care about black people. Joe Biden  Stating that you aren't black if you dont vote for him  That's all I need to hear none of these democrats care for black people for real
I didn't wanna be the guy who has to tell you this, but Biden and Kamala have blood on their hands for literally all of these things.
I just came across a bunch of Biden followers and they're running the same exact losing strategy that got us Trump in 2016, but with an even less liked candidate.
Biden doesn’t have to answer to you gum boy

Trump Smears Biden-Harris As ‘Pro-Crime’ At ‘Cops For Trump’ Rally, Urges Cops To Fight Back: ‘I Swear You’ll Be Protected’ -
The dumb...it hurts. We all know how reliable the USPS is, nod, nod, wink, wink. They also endorsed Biden, so that sounds fair. Voting is too precious...it must be done in person.
A Nevada county mailed out 1.3 million ballots for its primary election but 1 in 5 were never delivered  If you think that is bad, wait until the postal union ( who backs Biden ) delays or stops delivery to republican strong areas. Has and will happen.
Does anyone see a clear-cut conflict of interest for the USPS union to endorse a presidential candidate - Joe Biden - while becoming part of the election process???
You will NEVER see this for Joe Biden. EVER.
If Obama has doubts about Biden, that's all I need to know. Having seen Biden's "vetted" ad, yeah, there isn't any doubt. #BidenHarris2020
What unbelievably naive question. Here's some more: Do you think Biden has dementia? Do you think the CGI was pay for play? Do you think Obama is a Muslim? Do you think Kamala is really African American? Do you think BLM wants to damage our country? Bwahahaha!
No conflict here....  is worried NYC Police decided for the first time to support a presidential candidate. USPS who delivers BALLOTS supports Biden?
please stop conspiring to steal votes from Joe Biden.
Daily Reminder: Joe Biden Admits He is Dumb #4
It isn't possible.  Biden/Harris won't win 30% of the states.
I'd rather have Donald from any day in the week then Joe Biden. All he would be is a puppet for Hillary Clinton and God knows I wouldn't vote for her nobody should
Obama/Biden knew about spying on PRESIDENT Elect Trump. Biden has  to be held accountable!
Trump hasn't done any worse than anybody else in office and Joe Biden can't remember who he is half the time
If Biden wins you not only see your pay check smaller. Your see a decline in USA. China will be world leader.
yet, so instead of dealing with the flood we build a dam and leave the poorest most marginalized to drown in the water. “OH but we’ll be constantly pushing them left and organizing and demanding-“ says the Biden supporters who aren’t v left in the first place, don’t organize, and
I kinda want Trump to win a second term because the people who’re voting for Biden are literally removed from the actual problems, LITERALLY. Y’all don’t want trouble knocking at your door so you’re taking the easy way out. You know what’s gon happen but you know it hasn’t began
Did he just endorse Biden for president?
The consultant who picked the blue lives matter color font for Biden is either a fool, or massively trolling.
Oh wow trumpeters.. giving the liberals more reasons for Biden to win..  mess up old peoples mail delivery.. medication. retirement checks.. Pence?
So, Bidens pitch is Trump destroyed the economy and we need Biden to turn the economy around and his plan to do that is to shut down the economy even more? Yeah, that sounds like an argument from a man with no issues of cognitive ability .
you realize there are also a lot of rich democrats/liberals of all races, genders and lifestyles? they're not giving their fortunes back to the people now, why would they want to do it under biden?
Unfair stats since Biden did no mass testing &amp; since EVERY death in US since March has been "COVID" with huge financial incentives given to hospitals with specific instructions for death certificates. What IS fair Biden/Obama IGNORED their pandemic entirely Trump responded hugely
Trump has been raising money before Biden was even chosen as the nominee. 48 million is a lot because it was a record breaking amount for any democratic ticket ever in history. It’s significant
The President's plan, lay bare Mr. Biden's record so the American people can judge for themselves.
We pray for President Trump as we did President Obama FYI President Trump has many men and women of God around him and he has done more for this nation even while being under attack by 90% of the media socialism is one step from communism Biden cant even take questions
And Joe Biden knows how to rape a country!
You can't believe his words and not vote for Biden now. Biden, far from perfect, is the only chance you have to prove you mean this. Because Trump is the absolute opposite of all that Malcolm X stood for. And that's the truth.

Yeah I miss James too but I wouldn’t cross the street for Joe Biden not even for the love of money.
It was kind even for solid journalism. Colbert phrased it as gently as he could. Harris didn't just attack Biden, she accused him of something horrid. Either making false accusations of that magnitude are nbd to her, or she's perfectly happy to make common cause with racists.
Absolutely. Hard left will vote biden allot of moderates wont. On  base, we are all in. So to win, dems will cheat. Ie... 112% of the voting population in Cali. 12% voter fraud already

Basically lays out Biden as another LBJ. LBJ model produced high level of legislative outcomes; on flip side, the lack of understanding of the cultural revolution &amp; his foreign policy blunders depending on the pro-war establishment led to disasters on both fronts. Biden redux?
Biden: We brokered the deal!   Deal Signing: 3 1/2 years into Trumps FIRST term. 😂   Biden has been in public office for 60+ years, 8 of which were as VP in the White House, and NOW Biden claims he has all the answers.   Dems are desperate!   TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸
I love crazies so long as they aren't antifa and blm crazies of pedo politicians like Eric Swalwell or Biden the child sniffer.
please watch, retweet and/or favorite this worthy and worthwhile YouTube video: Democrats And Biden Are So UNHINGED And Broken That Even Obama SLAMMED Biden As Unfit For Office
3 as  spoke about on the panel? I'm good with it. We just have to make sure the current POTUS is a distant memory by next January. And then we can have President Harris start the Disclosure process. Wait, did I say that? I meant President Biden, if he wins. ;-)
Biden &amp; Obama failed miserably with the swine flu in 2009. No testing, no social distancing, no border closures. A minimum of 60 million Americans were infected with H1N1 and all we heard from Biden &amp; Obama was 🦗 🦗 (Crickets)
I agree. There are plenty of ways to attack Biden. She’s not important
I'm #NeverBidenNeverTrump, and Im in a swing state that rejected Biden in the primaries.   He's fucked here.
If its equal to or less support for Biden, he will lose.  He doesnt bring any more people in than Hillary did.
You need your meds adjusted lady . Biden can’t complete a sentence 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
The State of Nevada, with their large Latino population rejected Biden in the primaries.  I also am not voting Biden.  Nevada is a swing state.  You guys are fucked.
Arizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
Honestly Biden shouldn't do or say anything till election. Im astounded that 40% of people are still going to vote for Trump.
I didnt do that.  Democratic Establishment did that.  They did it in 2016.  They are doing it now.  Do you really think they care if Biden loses?  They make a fortune if he loses.
That's exactly why they will never have my vote for Biden even if he DID have some redeemable qualities.  But even with that, he is still a racist.  He is still a rapist.  He is still a warmonger.  He is still going senile.
So....what do you think Biden is going to do about it?  And why do you believe him considering his track record of lying?
This! Obama/Biden totally misread the Middle East. Everything from Benghazi to the Arab Spring, Syria, Iran, the Palestinians... Trump realizes what is important to the Arab gulf states— it’s not the Pals, IT IS SECURITY! Am I right  ?????

Because I dont see Biden saving even one more life.
No.  He stripped it out with a majority in both senate and House.  Likely because of DEMOCRATIC DISSENTION.  Biden said he will VETO it.  Gtfoh
Its already being narrated for Kamala.  Which is why we dont care for Biden winning either.  A Biden loss may actually be taking the bitter pill for a better future.
Democrats in Congress...lzy stingy do nothing Democrats out for themselves only!  Don't be fooled by puzzled together Biden commercials...
Biden’s whole campaign really is “I’m not Trump” LMAO
Then you should have chosen Bernie.  No one to blame but yourselves because we did warn you that Biden was NOT the most electable because we wouldnt vote for him.  Why are you so worried now?  This is what you asked for when you ignored us.
Probably good for people to know what Biden’s “BUILD BACK BETTER” is really tied to.  Unsurprisingly, The U.N. &amp; Globalism / #Agenda21

What part?  Bidens love of fracking?  The Paris Peace Accord, while a step in the right direction had no enforcement within it, so it is irrelevant.  Look at Biden's donors, and tell me he will fight against their interests.  "Nothing with fundamentally change".
Just got a text that Joe Biden needs my help in his nigh-postumous quest to make Kamala Harris president.
There is no law that says Biden has to sit for an interview same as there’s no law that says Donald Trump has to show his taxes.
During Biden's time as VP The  predicted the Affordable Care Act would hurt the economy and kill jobs The GOP was wrong again this act coincided with the best economic expansion and job creation in years.    I am voting for  and
Trump takes questions by lying and evading. Trump has run this country into the ground and is rarely ever challenged. Biden says “Uh” before giving an answer and the story is how he’s slipping.
"I VOTED FOR BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 AND GOT RID OF TRUMP!"
During the Obama and Biden administration  They fixed the greatest (at that time) economic turmoil since the great depression.  All while the GOP did everything in their power to hinder Obama and Biden.  I am voting for  and
Wearing Biden Kamala paraphernalia is like wearing a Browns jersey
Biden is confused again. He’s not aging well.
When Biden was VP there was an increase taxes on the wealthiest Billionaires by 1% it was followed by strong job growth, shrinking budget deficits lower unemployment rates and one of the lowests poverty rates in history.   I am voting for   and
But would have been Pete.  Pete is advising Biden.
Joe Biden May be the fakest Democrat ever running for President! He has given some rants in the Senate that sounded likeGeorge Wallace!!
They 100% should. Biden/Harris isn’t going to stop this nonsense
Not looking good for Biden in Las Vegas Nevada 🤔😂😂😂
Kanye, I know Jared is telling you that you can do this, but you can’t. You won’t be President this time. Biden will. Then you, trump and Jared can get together and rail against him.  And in 4 more years you can run.
Well we won't survive another 4 years of Trump either, so it's a tough choice. Maybe have Biden fix things up after Trump in the next 4 years and then choose someone new?
The Trump death cult is raising more money than Biden.  Whichever campaign spends the most usually wins.
You got your facts mixed up. Obama and Biden inherited broken economy and they brought it back alive, creating millions of new jobs. In less than 4 years, Trump has destroyed it all. We need Biden to rebuild the economy after Trump, just like he did after Bush.
It's Trump's fault and he's raising more funds than Biden.  Get ready.
Very funny but who wasted their money even buying a Biden flag 🤦‍♂️
It’s an honor to run against [not Joe Biden] lol
If you don't listen to me, listen to Taylor Swift. Vote Biden/Harris.
When the USPS union endorses Biden, I have a problem.  This is just a prelude to voter fraud including vote harvesting.  You, Sir, would do yourself a favor and stay away from a mess happening.

Biden will NOT fix anything, and not with Harris as his VP, he becomes even more dangerous.  Because this is likely an attempt to recreate the "Obama got his shot, now #ItsHerTurn" bullshit from 2016 all over again.  Harris has proven herself to ONLY act in the interests of...

Lets ask JOE biden ?
Now people rally for Biden to "stop Trump".  But what has Biden done?  Forbes suggests that he has AT LEAST 9 mil, and likely more since he started his campaign.  Yet the Democratic voter wants him to "fix" things?  Go back and look at how many Democrats voted for Trumps tax cuts
I will vote for Biden. I will even risk voting in person.
To make myself completly clear. I will absolutely concede that there have been a couple things done by this administration that were good. But the bad and poorly handled far outweigh the good in my opinion. Also I think Biden and Kamala are trash as well but just less trash.
Facts about the criminal.  The funny thing is you support Harris and Biden but then support BLM? Harris has kept black men in prison since 1990 at a rate of 5x of white men. Biden has been a lifelong racist.  Hypocrisy at an all time level.
Biden releases his taxes, so Trump should too... right?
Voting Biden supports Trump.  Not because of any acid induced math algorithm that only assumes two parties, but instead supports the system that got us here.  Voting Biden supports Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, and Trump.  Why? They are all funded by the same people.
Harris is too ambitious to fall for what’s coming. Your right she took the bait but I don’t think she’s capable of leading our Country on some one else’s moves.  Soon as the honeymoon is over she’s gonna realize she’s just a black prop with no say. Just what Biden was with Obama

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review

You are spewing far left propaganda due to a lack of a far left candidate on the ballot while failing to realize that both Biden and Harris have adopted considerably progressive agendas and will appoint a number of progressive experts to the executive branch cabinet positions.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
This is such a poorly misguided take.  The Biden/Harris campaign has done nothing to alienate the referenced age group - not to mention that you shouldn’t lump Millennials with Gen Z for obvious reasons.  There has been no attempt to compromise with the current right-wing agenda.
America needs a Biden/Harris national town hall titled "Brats, Beers and Hookahs".
He is a warmongering Clinton puppet. Vote Biden get Neoconservativism on steroids and likely a Nuclear Holocaust.
You're correct, we CANNOT afford to elect the corrupt demented pervert sleepy Joe Biden nor the lying corrupt phony Kamala Harris. They definitely would be a disaster for our county. They're extreme Socialists who would ruin our economy &amp; export jobs. We need to keep Trump-Pence!

Add Harris for being a cop and using Biden's crime bill to its furthest extent to enslave imprisoned PoC.

This is not to say that Trump isn't abysmal.  Its to say that we have no champions of justice.  Police in the street?  The blame goes to:  Biden's Crime Bill Cheney's Patriot Act And every politician, including Trump who did not fix it.
My sincerest sympathies to you.  I hope that he will come to his senses and change his mind.  Vote Biden/Harris!!!
Well YOU SHOULD be concerned. Biden has dementia and Harris is a fraud. These two don't care about YOU at all.  Their plans would hurt MILLIONS of Americans. #SocialismKills   Kamalama Ding Dong wants to defund the police. HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR AMERICA??  You KNOW Biden is a pawn!

THIRSTY MARCO, I lived in Florida at the time you became a Senater and I do not remember you saying anything about our manufacturing leaving the country at that time. Biden has said he will bring it back. Do what you can to help him do it.

No honoring our past heroes! Only looting and destruction! Biden = Mobs - Trump = Jobs

Joe Pinion a guest on Newsmax hit the nail on the head discussing Biden's stupid choice, woman only!!!!?
Biden not only has no intention of fixing the crime bill, or the student loan BK bill, he doesnt even acknowledge the damage its done.   Harris hasnt acknowledged the damage she caused to PoC lives by choosing to NOT parole someone because she needed cheap labor. Or scaring PoC..
OK Everybody, I'm organizing a Biden Boat Parade,  whose with me?
Did any of them detail that?  Or fight against it?  Or try to change it?  Bernie compromises. But when he explains his reason, and then goes to try to fix what he doesnt like, then his actions match his words.  Biden and Copmala have both doubled down on their mistakes.
Well, we already know he kept Hidin Biden hid for most of his VP term. Then endorsed Killary with open arms. Could barely utter a complete positive sentence for his former VP in the current endorsement....So, is ANYONE really surprised?

#Schumer giving #Obama credit for the stock market. #Pelosi taking credit for the #USMCA trade deal. #Biden taking credit for the #UAEIsrael peace agreement. Will #Schiff &amp; #Swalwell take credit for #OperationWarpSpeed &amp; a #Covid19 vaccine and blame #Trump for the #pandemic too?
Hey dude you a big mouth trump lover! What will happen when November comes and he loses? Tucker you then be a brown nose Biden lover. So big behind the camera but alone you’re shitting your pants.
That means you’re for Socialism and communism, That’s what these radical left democrats have turned Sheep Biden into.

President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
TRUE STORY   Joe Biden past run for President was unsuccessful because he wasn’t Qualified   In 2008 he was chosen as Obama’s white prop for name recognition   Today Biden’s name is running for President and Harris is the Black prop for the same reason   déjà vu in reverse◀️
He wouldn't know how to petition. It's the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN lawyers and operatives doing this. The BOTTOM LINE is, a bunch of white RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS are using a black man to stay in power and keep their stranglehold on American democracy.  I'm with Fightin' Biden' and Nasty!
The stuff they’ve rolled out on her after being selected validates Biden’s choice. Great pick!
Did he vote for segregation or nah?

This is the ultimate reason why I’m voting for Joe Biden.  You ready?  It’s pretty simple.   He was Vice-President to the greatest president of my lifetime for 8 years.   That’s enough for me.   #ThanksObama #BidenHarris2020
Former President Obama gave Joe Biden a strong, thoughtful endorsement; “Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f--k things up."  I see a serious lack of confidence in poor Joe?
Still trying to figure out how Kamala calls Biden racist then accepts the nomination.
i still don’t know what a biden presidency means. why is he so bad at this.
YES, AND HE SHOULD STATE THAT AS THE REASON.  TELL THE MEDIA THAT THEIR DAYS OF RUNNING INTERFERENCE FOR BIDEN ARE OVER.
How can America people vote for Biden without hearing question. Guess they scare Biden can’t answers without teletype
Harris won't need any.  Biden won't be there.
Ah, you mean more damage. The RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS already damaged The Party by embracing the BIBLICAL BEAST occupying the WASHINGTON CHANCELLERY (courtesy of Russia).  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!

Unfortunately, I think it is too late to save the Post Office for the election.  No matter what funding it is given Trump's flunky will undermine it.  We need to think outside the box and work around the Post Office.  The Post Office will need to be fixed under President Biden.

Fox News’ Demonization of Kamala Harris Is Off to a Fast Start  A cold, calculating, dangerous, far-left radical is how hosts and guests—including the president—portrayed the Democrats’ V.P. pick, as Jeanine Pirro floated a bizarro theory that Biden won’t even be on the ticket.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
Was watching YouTube yesterday. The Joe Biden ad of him driving a corvette amazed me. America is burning: unemployment, 'rona, business closed, industry destroyed. Joe Biden driving around in a gas guzzling corvette, talking about his dad could really drive. #amazing #JoeBiden
Have you geniuses considered the #vets and #seniors who depend on the mail being on time? I didn't think so.  Guessing I can't use #PostalService to send back the #Trump posters cause now I'll be voting #Biden. Nobody messes w/ my meds!!
And where is Joe Biden? Out driving around in a gas guzzling corvette. This ad sums up the 2020 election.
So you're voting for Joe Biden?
I wish the BLM revolution went harder and we took down the entire government and started over. Fuck TRUMP HARRIS PENCE AND BIDEN. fuck the house and the senate. Fuck em all. Okay sorry for the f-word.
That’s the face of a man who knows he’s going to lose this election in the biggest landslide in the history of this country 🤣🤣 ... so please keep up all the stupid remarks about Joe Biden and keep opening your mouth and sticking your foot in it you’re just making it easy
I hope they finally nail him. He brought this country down and will encourage Biden to send us back to the dark ages. We will be using horse drawn carriages again As theytake that away fossil fuels from us.  Hopefully horses don’t create too much gas !!!
Obama shares his troubling private doubts on Biden to inner circle
My meaning exactly. Why address Biden as if he was the one making the horrible decisions of the last 4 years. Although Biden will have a lot of fixing he will have to do.
#Biden people. Listen up! And read this entire thread. Btw  I'll NEVER vote against my principles. That means I'm NOT voting for #BidenHarris2020
Jump from Clinton to Biden????
America is burning. Joe Biden is out driving around in a corvette. Don't see how much more proof is needed to show just how much he is out of touch with reality. Unless you drive a corvette. Then Joe Biden is the man.
Vote Biden. This is what Democrats give you. Funny, I lived in California for 13 years- never had blackout. U know difference between then and now? Ignorant liberal idea of "green energy." Total fraud. Doesnt work. And triples cost, bankrupts middle class.
Just vote for Biden that the logical thing to do

Since 1920 a estimated 5 million Americans have died just from second hand smoke.  We had a 100 years to fix this problem. Joe Biden or Obama did nothing to save those people. In fact Obama certainly got kids to smoke cigs because he smoked.  What a role model right

Tbh. Biden will not do anything truly better. His policies and current, modern day opinions have told us that.  Only thing gonna ruin this country is yall continuing to believe we can vote our way out of this.
Im so sick of vote shaming. A non vote is not a Trump vote. A green vote is not a Trump vote. A Trump vote is the only Trump vote. Stop telling marginalized people who have been harmed directly by Biden and Harris that they MUST CHOOSE OR RUIN THE COUNTRY!

On Wednesday during the Dem Convention, Tulsi Gabbart seems slated to introduce Kamala Harris. That seemed lit, until I realized they won't even be in the same time zone and these speeches will likely be taped, not live. Biden's will NOT be live. It will be highly edited.

At least she hasn’t been shepherding her supporters &amp; campaigning for Biden. I’ll give Tulsi the benefit of the doubt through the November election while she still has her seat in Congress
Voting for Biden will solve nothing. You need to break the system.
How come  can expose all this stuff but couldn’t  expose joe Biden and help Bernie win
Agreed, we are personally accountable for our vote.   Aren't agency and charity signs of morality?   Does Biden support police dismantling, antifa and Palestine? His friends and party do.
In A Single Moment Of Truth, Ron Johnson Destroyed The Trump/Putin Plot To Smear Biden -
Voting other than Trump is a vote for Biden.   Although Trump has been immoral and not taken public steps to repent, he reps the greatest morality of agency.   The DNC nationwide dismantles police and talks of secession. Sedition and treason are not free speech.
so all of this happened only under trump.obama,Clinton,pelosi, schumar,biden, all extremely wealthy. That’s corruption it runs deep in both parties.government is corruption. People get rich with zero consequences.
Biden says we have to wear masks for 3 months. Newsweak says acquired immunity only lasts 3 months. Is there something important coming up in 3 months?...hmmm🤔
Let's see, who was in the White House for 8 of those 13? Why wasn't it fixed then? Oh, the Obama/Biden "empty suit team" was in control.
Well you know Muhammad married a 6 year old girl so Biden will fit right in with the Muslims.
The choice in Nov is now set: Biden-Harris or 4 more years of the corrupt, anti-science, and anti-democratic Trump-Pence administration.   Every single committed Democrat MUST show up to the polls in Nov so we can reclaim the White House, take back the Senate &amp;save our democracy!
Seriously...it was a debate therefore disregard the fact that I called Biden a rapist and a racist. You really can’t make this stuff up! 🙄 #HeelsUpHarris
Yet 100% will still vote for Biden. Great tweet, deadbeat.
Maybe he's in Biden's basement.
Kamala wants to be President. She will say and do anything to squash Biden like a bug if elected.
Time for a Biden to start ramping up the offensive attacks. Tiptoeing around Trump will not help him win.
as i think  has said: biden is running as mayonnaise. people aren’t excited about mayonnaise but mostly think it’s fine and good especially when the alternative is ammonium nitrate
closest you’ll get to that with biden is like a rally with springsteen and biden saying “nebraska was my favorite record man” or some shit and then going on to talk to people in eau claire about wearing masks and mailing checks because biden’s people aren’t dumber than pigshit
Biden lost two primary’s .. he was selected as VP and about to be your President...
No Bumbling Biden is. Even Obama is afraid he can’t do it. Foreign countries are hoping he wins because he’s so weak.
Every single one. He wants Biden to win because he’s so weak with foreign policy.
You will be broke and at war. Biden has no staying power and that is why Russia and China are hoping he wins. Weakness.
Let me explain: the majority of the US wants you “fired.” BTW: your “Sleepy Joe” references are falling flat, no one’s buying it.We finally have a future POTUS who speaks in complete sentences that make sense.  VP Biden also smiles, laughs, &amp; has a sense of humor. How refreshing

How many blame Trump? When it's the Gov. or Mayor who makes the mandate for masks  And will vote for Biden who will make a mask mandate for us all... forever  Scary stuff here
Regardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?This will get a million times worse if Biden / Harris win!!
She received 2% during her presidential run, what has changed! Teaming up with Biden certainly hasn't made her more attractive to people that's for sure!
Oh yeah furthermore they've been ordered actually how to treat Biden and Harris, this is not the America I grew up in!

Fucking up a presidential campaign can be very educational.  Many have argued that Harris is a great lawyer for a client like Biden, but not sure how to argue her own case. I think there might be some truth to that. If they win, she has 3 years to figure out her own case.

Biden’s said he wants Republicans to continue to hold at least some power so I don’t know what I’m supposed to take from this
Yeah that’s fine, I think that’s where most people are at. Some people, like a handful of my friends, (I think especially true for veteran activist and advocates) view the Dems and Biden/Harris in particular as terminally compromised
dont know who needs to hear this but the decision isnt  elect biden and do nothing  or elect trump and resist   we can elect biden... and resist
The Biden/Harris ticket is probably gonna do just fine without any of these friends, it’s not like they’re a large voting bloc. I do think it’s kinda entertaining how worked up some other people have gotten just because they can’t imagine that actual anarchists actually exist
its not "elect biden and sit on our ass OR elect trump and resist"

Ok ok... there’s a good point... (paraphrasing AF) like, the understanding is that the Biden/Harris people won’t be pressured. Like, they think that premise and kinda that whole concept is more of a Dem PR strategy than anything they allow to effect them
The choice has never been more simple. But mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting, and cheating, on a high scale, by dems, has never been MORE ominous and prevalent.  Biden-Harris are what's NOT RIGHT for America, positively.   But the cheating, to get them elected, looms large.

Trump you and Biden both get on stage and have the audience ask one question at a time and then you both answer the question. I only say this so no one gets the questions ahead of time
If you want to be taxed to death, to pay for healthcare for all including illegals vote for Biden / Harris! That is just the beginning.
Professor predicts 2020 election winner - CBS News
I can’t believe people are still battling over Bernie and Biden. The truth is a third-party or write in vote helps Trump. If Biden wins progressives live to fight another day if Trump wins you’re living in La La Land if you think you will ever have another opportunity to vote.
Joe Biden wants to implement sharia law at all nascar events. Still not scared? This means not hot dog 🤬
Fucking hell, Biden sucks ass. I kind of keep myself from paying too much attention to the news mainly because it usually makes me sad. But even in these small doses the amount of pessimism I feel is immense. Why the fuck did Bernie have to throw in the towel early. -_-
JC, Biden sounds like Otis from the Andy Griffith show staggering into one of the cells to sleep it off.

Postal workers' union endorses Biden, calling him a "defender of the U.S. Postal Service"
These 2 are fucking idiots. How do you go from such strong opponents to best buds all of a sudden. They will ruin this country if Biden is elected #trump2020
She's REALLY good at this government stuff.  I hope she has a REALLY big role in the Biden admin.
Trouble with that is ... Biden has to be actually coherent in order to be "extreme". Biden rarely even knows where the Hell he is, much less be able to think on any kind of "extreme" scale.   This election is about Trump verses the Deep State push for a One World Order.

Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
why haven't we talked at all about biden winning stepping down, harris being president and Pelosi being vice president... we've all talked about biden saying he's a transition president.. but we've not talked about what that means..
Hey Laura:  Obama knows Biden best.  He has watched Biden deteriorate which is why he told Biden not to run. Now the hope is just get him elected so he can step aside.  That is the plan.  MJ
Hey Hill:  This guilty FBI Deep State Swamp Lizard is the tip of the Obama iceberg. This spying corruption leads all the way to Obama Biden.  Comey, McCabe, Clapper, Brennan, Rice, lots of others should be in jail for their treasonous crimes to bring down Trump. Disgraceful!  MJ
Police Unions endorse Trump. Biden is for lawless and disorder.
Kamala Harris is already bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
u really think joe biden is capable of fixing enough problems to keep the increasingly agitated middle class complacent? i dont
Can’t believe that you’re asking such a ridiculous question. If somebody needs to encourage you to vote for Biden then you’re probably still leaning towards Trump.
if trump gets re elected, all the libs will think the problems in this country are because of him. if biden wins, and none of the huge issues we face gets fixed, they will see that the problem lies deeper in the roots.
A major union representing U.S. postal workers has endorsed Joe Biden for president.

Sounds like something Biden would say too
That’s an extremely bad faith reading of this writing.  Biden’s grades and his IQ comments expose how he understands himself and how DC people understand Biden (or don’t).  It’s an extremely relevant background to the Obama-Biden relationship. It is not an attack on Biden.
💙❤️Nevada born &amp; raised(proud American)&amp;family lived in Nevada for (41) forty-one years.💙❤️Vote for BIDEN/HARRIS whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. As a TRUE Nevadan,please vote for Biden(A genuinely good person&amp;very well-educated).Spread kidness!
Hey James:  WOW.  Beijing Joe was right years ago when he described the predators on our streets murdering people everyday.  He called it right then.  Now Biden refuses to say we need to crack down on these killers.  So we see the murders in many big cities.  MJ
I see only a few low level staffers getting indictments. 2-tiered CJ system and the big ones like, Comey, Clapper, Rice, Biden, Brennan, will only get the title - “UN-indicted co-conspirators”. This will be a wash for the American citizens.
Cynical move for alt-left and alt-right votes. It’s also another tell that his divide and conquer plans are failing because Bernie and most of his crew are backing Biden pretty forcefully. And there is no real third party challenge yet outside the Kanye fraud.
Hey Beijing Biden: Respect strong, smart women.   Have worked with many.  Kamela Harris showed us during various hearings that she is not likeable and a real Bitch.  She called you a racist and a sexual predator during debates. KH did not resonate with Socialist voters. MJ
I would eat cat poop before I voted for Biden👍
Joe Biden did all those things though....
Biden’s friend!
So Joe Biden is Super Liberal #coronavirus now? Your tweet is SO backwards
Just remember, you are not just a representative of Calif, you are representing women of color around the US. Black, Latino, Asian,  and Native American women are looking to you with hope. Praying that you and Joe Biden prove that we are making the right choice!
Biden will accept the nomination then step down, allowing the Dems to select a new candidate. He has to get the nomination first.
But Russia is involved.  Ypu can't fraud a mail in vote, but you can hack a electronic vote machine if you know what to do. That's my thoughts about it and I'm sticking to it. I'm voting for Biden/Harris by mail-in.
Lowbrow —— ( not quite humor, not quite satire, not informative, less interesting. How many rape cases have been filed against T——? How many settlements have been made to rape claimants on and off the record, how many shots of Biden with Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell? I’ll wait...
Fucken criminal.  I'm voting by mail just to spite and to  defy him "just because"  I refuse to stand in a Republican virus so reading line . Puke ass punk Trumpy.  What the Fuck is wrong with him.  I've had enough of his bullshit by his shithole administration.  I'm voting Biden
If you view this and you come away with the notion "I want to vote for Biden" then you get everything you deserve if he becomes president
There's going to come a time with the media where they're going to get so pissed off, even the left-wing media, with them not answering questions that they'll have to start attacking Kamala Harris and her puppet Joe Biden!
Of course no questions for Biden and Harris because it's a scripted event and they don't want to show what a blathering idiot Joe Biden is too soon! As if people don't already know already!
This totally makes sense for Nancy Pelosi's little slip of the tongue a while ago about being second in line for the presidency! Leftist liberal Democrats might want to rethink their choice of Joe Biden in November!
That's the thing about these idiots today voting for Biden and Harris! They could care less about those two and what they stand for and what they don't stand for! They just don't like Trump and that is not a qualification to vote anyone into the highest office in the land!!
Kamala Harris doesn't know what nationality or ethnicity Kamala Harris is,, she'll be whatever you want her to be as long as it gets her to be the president! She has no interest in the vice presidency she's just biding her time to deem Biden unfit if he wins!
I don’t care for trump but anybody “settling” for Biden is just showing the Democrats that they’re able to have anybody as a candidate which is the lowest standard, if you plan on being better than the Republican Party at least vote somebody in who is actually better
#PresidentTrump did this... Biden didn't.
Hey Laura:  Communist US Conference of Bishops missing in action.  Should oppose Biden Harris because of their support for unrestricted abortion.  But the Bishops support Open Borders,  Green New Deal and idiotic defunding Of police.  They are supporting Biden.  Disgraceful!  MJ

Hey Bishop: Communist US Catholic Conference of Bishops missing in action.  Should come out against Biden Harris because they support unrestricted abortion. Pure evil! Since They Support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding Of police, they remain silent.  MJ
no you WONT be getting a Nobel Prize, you cannot compete with President Obama, and you cannot steal his Nobel Prize, you’ll never be a tenth of the man that President Obama is,  oh I’m sure President Biden will receive a Nobel Prize, &amp; Dr Fauci also, but not you
Hey Bishop:Waiting for the US Conference of Bishops to come out against the evil Biden Harris ticket. The Bishops are missing in action because they support Open Borders, the Green New Deal and now idiotic defunding of the police. What about unrestricted abortion infanticide!  MJ
Hey Bishop:  Why aren’t we hearing from the US Conference of Bishops.  Biden, who pretends to be Catholic and Harris support abortion right up until birth and even after.  Pure evil.  Deny Biden Communion.  Faith without action allows evil to prevail.  👿’s work.  MJ
Australia today - USA on Jan 20, 2021 if Harris/Biden elected.
Remember Biden made the statement, he was running for a senate seat. I don’t believe he knows he is running for President. Therefore we now have Kamala .
Can’t wait for the debates between Biden and President Trump!!!!
Biden plagiarizes all the time, he has done it for years. He never has decent thoughts of his own maybe that is a good thing.
Biden campaign raises $26m in 24 hours after announcing Kamala Harris pick

I know that in general, more information is "always good." However, this information is meaningless.  If Biden wins, then the list is Biden 99.9%, All Others 0.01%. Why are we even bothering to talk about a presidential election that has no context?
I’m sorry. Maybe I’m not a true progressive thinker but wishing death on people like kamala and joe biden ain’t my cup of tea. That’s disgusting and just not my style.
This is what a Biden / Harris presidency will look like, A DICTATORSHIP FOR ALL. HE'S MAKING DEMANDS ALREADY AND HE'S NOT EVEN PRESIDENT YET!
i am participating in the election TO DISRUPT. i dont want the DEMOCRATS to win,i want the LITERAL FASCIST out of one of the most powerful offices on the planet. unfortunately, that means a vote for biden at the time being. im not planning on letting the dems sit pretty jfc
aaaaaand we are back to the false choice thing you did at the beginning. i am going to vote for biden AND THEN BULLY AND ADVOCATE AND PROTEST FOR THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF THE POLICE its not that complicated of a position to understand
Well, great! We only get to decide between two men accused of rape! And we have a rapist on the Supreme Court! But I think the world will be made worse with Trump, so I will vote for Biden and hope Harris will replace him...although I prefer Warren.
Lol. I would say the Dems are so desperate they would run a wooden dummy for president and and as it turns out they are, and they know it. Again want their way- hiding  Biden’s mental defects behind a wall of opacity.
If their going to blantly lie why stop at something this meaningless?  Why not say if they win, Kamala and Biden will put all the people who don't support BLM in concentration camps.  Fuck it if your gonna lie go big
IMO, the defining question (and presumptive lesson learned) that this election reprises is, “Will this prove to be a best foot forward?”
did you read my whole tweet or did u literally stop at "marx would advocate voting for biden" its really weird it seems like you only are responding to this tiny piece of my whole argument whats that called again?
marx would advocate for voting biden and continue doing social and leftist work outside of that. he disagreed with political accelerationism, because it doesnt really tend to work. he favored economic accelerationism, things like general strikes. maybe you need to read up

Thank you for your service sir! You were so inspiring and touched my heart. Thank you also for voting for Biden!!
if you really think the material conditions of marginalized groups arent far worse off under trump than biden i dont even know where to start.
Thank you for your service Steve! Also, thanks for being a patriot and voting for Joe Biden
you guys keep framing this as a choice, like if i vote i have to stop going to protests and shit. I CAN VOT FOR BIDEN TO SAVE SOME LIVES AAAAAANNNNDDDDD STILL ORGANIZE THATS THE WHOLE POINT
Thank you for your service and thank you for voting for Biden!
You are my only viewer. Also, who did Joe Biden rape? Feel free to talk about his crime.
these "Never Biden" people wouldnt piss me off so much if they werent so bad faith all the time. anyone participating in society in any way is a fucking liberal to these people.   "oh you pay taxes? LIB!!"
Trump calls out Biden for 'politicizing the pandemic': 'Appalling lack of respect for American people'
like i dont disagree with anything you said. its still better for the literal survival rate of trans/lgbt BIPOC with biden in office
do you really believe that the material conditions for marginalized people will be identical under either biden or trump?
and i advocate for both. but it is much easier for us to do real work under a milktoast liberal instead of an actual FASCIST. voting for biden is a utilitarian act to stop some bleeding in marginalized communities. i dont have any delusion of it being a radical move

any actual leftists voting for biden are keenly aware he isnt progressive at all. the endless strawmanning is getting exhaustinggggg
Biden and Kamala represent the Dem. party very well.
Biden/Harris like our lives depend on it, because they do.
This is OUTRAGEOUS OVERREACH!   REQUIRE Montana, the Dakota's, &amp; rural areas a mask EVERY-TIME they step outside?  HALF of STATES: 1000 DEATHS OR LESS.  15 states LESS THAN 500. 5 less than 90.  #coronavirus  #kamalaharris
I couldn’t agree more!!  I don’t have time to listen to a bunch of negative crap about Biden and Harris. Anyone I see that says they better do this, I’m sitting this one out or they’re voting third-party I will immediately block. I’m done with the negativity.
In fact, I'd argue that Biden's plan should go a step further and abolish all homeowner's associations, because seriously, fuck those things.
Five thirty eight has given Biden the same exact odds of winning that they gave Hillary. Down to the exact number. And they’re supposed to get these things right?

Trump I understand you are busy but I feel you need to get rid of Biden and his new VP choice. I have a feeling if it can be done those two will raise taxes by trillions of dollars. If it can be done lock in it raise taxes only by a 1% -2% only no more lock in for 10 years

E) Biden will certainly win, barring extreme election interference, and I'm sick of all of this shit. My vote, like most American's is pointless. Democrats have been the centrist/conservative party since the 90s, when the GOP went full on batshit insane. Rabbitholes...

Neither Biden or Harris will lead. They will take orders from their overlords.

Only thing they were missing was one stuttering fool who can't compose two coherent sentences but wait a minute Joe Biden was there lol!
I agree I just don't want to waste my time with DHD, People's Party because its going to take them a while to think logically about this.  I rather focus on the people who are unhappy about voting Biden but will vote for him and grow from there.
We're on the same page as far as persuasion.  I want to influence Democratic voters and I think the way to do it is by being part of their circle not outside as DHD, People's Party. That means supporting Biden/Harris for now and pitching in Yang immediately after the election.
That's exactly my point. The people who are voting for Biden/Harris have a close relationship with the Democratic party and each other. It's its own bubble. And it's easier to influence if we're inside that circle.  We won't be able to do it as outsiders.
Biden/Harris...somehow, I feel like I’ll finally be able to get a full nights sleep after they take out the trash on January 20th. 😉
This is the kind of control we do not want a BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET WILL RESULT IN ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS BEING TAKEN AWAY! THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
This poll is gross. How could anyone vote Biden/Kamala? They must be blind and deaf!
Watching news media publish Biden/Trump poll numbers is honestly laughable but also annoying. I don’t have a short memory and 2016 is too fresh. I don’t see much trust in these polls.Biden is a racist pedophile
Try asking without answering in the same question. A question phrased that way is assuming I'm already agreeing with what's clearly a dug in position, and I don't play that game. Biden is consistently outperforming in neutral polls, seems like they picked right guy.

POLITICS NOW: On this week's episode, we have reaction from all across Nevada after Joe Biden picks California Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential running mate, plus much more.  WATCH:
Worst logic ever.  Kamala is an actual cop.  I also addressed his mention of Bernie's vote numerous times.  Actions. He fought to change the bad parts of the bill where Biden/Kamala defend those parts unabashedly.  I blocked him for good reason.  Please dont send me his tweets.
People supporting Biden don't have any specific issues or policies they can point to as the reason why they support Biden. To be fair he hasn't given them any. Free healthcare and free everything else is not a platform it's a pipedream. They have nothing. Only hate for Trump.

Well I heard Obama, Biden, Schumer.  And Clinton say subhuman but I’m sure you are itching to tell me.  OK, I’m ready for your big burn GO Ahead and enlighten me
BIDEN MISPRONOUNCED HER NAME TOO.  LET'S NOT SWEAT THE NONSENSE.
No fakery,will be nice to have true love  and dignity back in the White House,Biden/Harris.

Michael Novogratz: Stock-Market Bubble Will Probably Pop If Biden Wins
Another dumb comment by a dumb family member. A women is insulted that Biden picked a women for V.P. Not to mention he picked a strong intelligent woman! That is one crazy ass family!
Look at Biden and Clinton. So you think they are pure and sweet people? Do you think they have your best interest?
Biden was never too bright, and age has not helped. It’s up to the media to hector them, until they do
I’m wondering how long you will allow #Biden not do Sunday shows, or answer questions. Don’t you want to interview the Democrat nominee for President?
Who could have known! Biden was not smart before become senile
Joe Biden as vp resulted in 25 million more on healthcare that Trump is trying to take away. He wants to improve on that. If that’s your main issue there’s one choice

Just to make it fair. I think Trump should send in Barron to debate Joe Biden
Daily Mail is tabloid "journalism" at its worst. This back-handed attack on Biden reminds me of Donald Trump prefacing his lies with, "Many people are saying...". Donald Trump is a monster who is dismantling our democracy, and Joe Biden is a good man who will be a fine President.

What kind of cheese does Pete like?  Is he technically a rat, or a mouse?  And.....Does that make Joe Biden the Mad Hatter?
Propaganda CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC? Biden has NOT denounced the likes of ANTIFA, Marxist BLM, or the destruction of statues, church burning, bible burning, looting, rioting, attacking law enforcement, attacking people. Biden said he would support additional funding with strings
I understand.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!

RNC Launches Website Exposing Biden’s ‘Disastrous Record, Hypocrisy, and Flawed Vision for America’
Joe Biden is white backlash, Donald trump is white nationalism. The backlash from the nationalism is a denial of the open racism, sexism, etc and a preference for systematic oppression. Joe Biden will make us (white people) feel like we aren’t a country ran by Donald Trumps.
Even Obama thinks Biden is a clown.  This is probably why he refused to endorse him during the primaries.
But Hillary tried "fumblingly" to get our votes after the primary.  Biden has completely abandoned us.  On purpose.
Thats the Democrat leaders of NYC. Get used to it if Joe Biden finds away to pull this off.  #Trump2020motherfuckers
The dysfunction of American “democracy” paired with systematic voter suppression and disenfranchisement of poc means that the system literally cannot create the change we need but yes let’s “push Biden to the left” like Bernie’s tried to do for 45 years and failed
Sarah, where have you been? The President has taken more questions in one day than Biden has in his entire campaign.
Is that the USS BIDEN?
I’m Never President Biden   I approve my message!
That makes her black dear. When the police pull her over. This doesn’t matter. Educate yourself you racist trash... but nonetheless.. Biden and Harris thank you for the donations
Biden and now Harris are both hiding. What the hell are the Democrats trying to prove? They afraid of any questions from the media. They can’t win doing this BS
Of course they don’t want to expose Biden to live questioning. The less he says without editing or notes, the better his chances to win.
Biden’s Navy
Racism exists, media fanning the flames, Biden is a racist, he cannot help himself, it's embedded in his brain which is turning to mush. If that's your choice then so what. I don't give a funion what you think of my grammar.
When Biden speaks!
Naaa if Jesus hates someone it's Nasty old Biden Trump 2020
Biden is a flat out loser. Harris a socialist. Not what America wants. He’s hiding from any journalist he doesn’t no. What a leader? Lol not
Dems are dead in water. They just don't know it yet. Kamala was worst pick in history. No one cares. Even black voters don't like her. And of course, no one likes Biden. Old feeble man w/dementia ready for Assisted Living, not WH.
Why do you think Biden’s Campaign has hired 600 Lidigators?
well of course. if they wear masks joe biden will do The Antifa to them

Vote Biden / Harris on November 3rd and let’s put an end to the Chump administration crime spree! We must stand up now! We must reclaim common decency, justice and altruism for our nation. We must vote Biden / Harris come November 3rd!
Sounds like Biden supporters getting worried
They will flat out complain that Joe Biden is too boring.
It would help Biden just as much. He's one of the architects of the present mass incarceration state, and his running mate a gleeful participant in it. Trump is continuing the wars crimes of Bush and Obama, adding new ones using Obama's immigration policy, even making it worse.
And if Biden does chicken out I would make sure the whole world knows about it!!
Agreed...  Pence would crush KH so I’m fine with it but under no circumstance should Biden be able to duck debating Trump.
They're on the same side.   The cop's comments about calling Biden a racist on stage during a debate should occasion you to think critically.  Voting will not solve this, because everyone on the government is committed to keeping power and increasing it when possible.
Joined in 2011 and only 134 followers.   Odd, but so common among the disinfo/misinfo propaganda accounts.  Biden/Harris 2020! :)
I will switch and vote for  I just realized that Biden is joke!
That's always been the case but it's probably worse now than ever.  There was this thing where the New New Left kids were sneering at Old Old Left people who urged the aging youngsters to vote for Biden and I was like "guys that's you in 2050."
You may as well join in. I’m sure there’s plenty of Canadians voting for Biden.  😂
I don't believe any claims Biden makes.
Their agenda is to hide Biden as much as humanly possible.    How long before we hear this from the DNC?  “How dare anyone expect Biden to debate Trump! You insensitive assholes!”    Believe me. It’s coming.

I want you to be a part of the Biden administration. I waited in line in the cold for four hours to vote for you. Even after you dropped out.
Here we Clinton said a black name were super predators. But many black people still want her to get back in the game. Joe Biden has had so many Racially motivated scandals but Black people still want to vote for him. He can't even remember what he is half the time.
🚨 Don't fall for this crap during the DNC. Keep the focus on Biden/Harris, don't be distracted. 👀 at you media.  Trump the distracter brings his act to the DNC
Hillary..... if Biden makes her SoS.  She would make Kamala, McConnell, and Pelosi (or whoever holds their seats) disappeared to take power.
thks For supporting Biden !! Your Great, excellent show today !!!
Joe Biden is just as racist Hillary Clinton is just as racist none of these people that you want to support care about black people. Joe Biden  Stating that you aren't black if you dont vote for him  That's all I need to hear none of these democrats care for black people for real
I didn't wanna be the guy who has to tell you this, but Biden and Kamala have blood on their hands for literally all of these things.
I just came across a bunch of Biden followers and they're running the same exact losing strategy that got us Trump in 2016, but with an even less liked candidate.
Where was the mess up ? Every time Biden gets on the 🎤 he says something ridiculous. Unless you think kids playing with his leg hairs in a pool is cute ? He has no shot.... get your Kleenex ready.

Trump Smears Biden-Harris As ‘Pro-Crime’ At ‘Cops For Trump’ Rally, Urges Cops To Fight Back: ‘I Swear You’ll Be Protected’ -
The dumb...it hurts. We all know how reliable the USPS is, nod, nod, wink, wink. They also endorsed Biden, so that sounds fair. Voting is too precious...it must be done in person.
A Nevada county mailed out 1.3 million ballots for its primary election but 1 in 5 were never delivered  If you think that is bad, wait until the postal union ( who backs Biden ) delays or stops delivery to republican strong areas. Has and will happen.
Does anyone see a clear-cut conflict of interest for the USPS union to endorse a presidential candidate - Joe Biden - while becoming part of the election process???
You will NEVER see this for Joe Biden. EVER.
If Obama has doubts about Biden, that's all I need to know. Having seen Biden's "vetted" ad, yeah, there isn't any doubt. #BidenHarris2020
Right now the focus hasn't even began on the implications of GND, immigration, taxes.  Right now it's all criticism from the back seat. The SJW approach failed us and ruined OBAMAs "Hope" legacy. Oh wait a sec...Biden was there too...Biden has no legacy after +40 yrs in office
What unbelievably naive question. Here's some more: Do you think Biden has dementia? Do you think the CGI was pay for play? Do you think Obama is a Muslim? Do you think Kamala is really African American? Do you think BLM wants to damage our country? Bwahahaha!
Who gives a shit what this fuckimg liberal bitch thinks and says tell her to shut her ou hole and go home and count her money she earned in a free economy let Biden win and he will tax the shit out of her and her libtard entertainer friends
No conflict here....  is worried NYC Police decided for the first time to support a presidential candidate. USPS who delivers BALLOTS supports Biden?
please stop conspiring to steal votes from Joe Biden.
Daily Reminder: Joe Biden Admits He is Dumb #4
It isn't possible.  Biden/Harris won't win 30% of the states.
I'd rather have Donald from any day in the week then Joe Biden. All he would be is a puppet for Hillary Clinton and God knows I wouldn't vote for her nobody should
Obama/Biden knew about spying on PRESIDENT Elect Trump. Biden has  to be held accountable!
Trump hasn't done any worse than anybody else in office and Joe Biden can't remember who he is half the time
If Biden wins you not only see your pay check smaller. Your see a decline in USA. China will be world leader.
yet, so instead of dealing with the flood we build a dam and leave the poorest most marginalized to drown in the water. “OH but we’ll be constantly pushing them left and organizing and demanding-“ says the Biden supporters who aren’t v left in the first place, don’t organize, and
I kinda want Trump to win a second term because the people who’re voting for Biden are literally removed from the actual problems, LITERALLY. Y’all don’t want trouble knocking at your door so you’re taking the easy way out. You know what’s gon happen but you know it hasn’t began
Did he just endorse Biden for president?
The consultant who picked the blue lives matter color font for Biden is either a fool, or massively trolling.
Oh wow trumpeters.. giving the liberals more reasons for Biden to win..  mess up old peoples mail delivery.. medication. retirement checks.. Pence?
So, Bidens pitch is Trump destroyed the economy and we need Biden to turn the economy around and his plan to do that is to shut down the economy even more? Yeah, that sounds like an argument from a man with no issues of cognitive ability .
you realize there are also a lot of rich democrats/liberals of all races, genders and lifestyles? they're not giving their fortunes back to the people now, why would they want to do it under biden?
Unfair stats since Biden did no mass testing &amp; since EVERY death in US since March has been "COVID" with huge financial incentives given to hospitals with specific instructions for death certificates. What IS fair Biden/Obama IGNORED their pandemic entirely Trump responded hugely
Trump has been raising money before Biden was even chosen as the nominee. 48 million is a lot because it was a record breaking amount for any democratic ticket ever in history. It’s significant
The President's plan, lay bare Mr. Biden's record so the American people can judge for themselves.
We pray for President Trump as we did President Obama FYI President Trump has many men and women of God around him and he has done more for this nation even while being under attack by 90% of the media socialism is one step from communism Biden cant even take questions
And Joe Biden knows how to rape a country!
Joe Biden will not take questions or debate President Trump before early voting in Sept because he has Dementia and you and his handlers know President will destroy him-Kamala Harris -he will take her down.
You can't believe his words and not vote for Biden now. Biden, far from perfect, is the only chance you have to prove you mean this. Because Trump is the absolute opposite of all that Malcolm X stood for. And that's the truth.

Yeah I miss James too but I wouldn’t cross the street for Joe Biden not even for the love of money.
It was kind even for solid journalism. Colbert phrased it as gently as he could. Harris didn't just attack Biden, she accused him of something horrid. Either making false accusations of that magnitude are nbd to her, or she's perfectly happy to make common cause with racists.
Absolutely. Hard left will vote biden allot of moderates wont. On  base, we are all in. So to win, dems will cheat. Ie... 112% of the voting population in Cali. 12% voter fraud already

Basically lays out Biden as another LBJ. LBJ model produced high level of legislative outcomes; on flip side, the lack of understanding of the cultural revolution &amp; his foreign policy blunders depending on the pro-war establishment led to disasters on both fronts. Biden redux?
Biden: We brokered the deal!   Deal Signing: 3 1/2 years into Trumps FIRST term. 😂   Biden has been in public office for 60+ years, 8 of which were as VP in the White House, and NOW Biden claims he has all the answers.   Dems are desperate!   TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸

3 as  spoke about on the panel? I'm good with it. We just have to make sure the current POTUS is a distant memory by next January. And then we can have President Harris start the Disclosure process. Wait, did I say that? I meant President Biden, if he wins. ;-)

I agree. There are plenty of ways to attack Biden. She’s not important
I'm #NeverBidenNeverTrump, and Im in a swing state that rejected Biden in the primaries.   He's fucked here.
If its equal to or less support for Biden, he will lose.  He doesnt bring any more people in than Hillary did.
Well I am realistic and I realize that likely Biden may win so I just have to hope that you are right.
You need your meds adjusted lady . Biden can’t complete a sentence 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
The State of Nevada, with their large Latino population rejected Biden in the primaries.  I also am not voting Biden.  Nevada is a swing state.  You guys are fucked.
Arizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
Honestly Biden shouldn't do or say anything till election. Im astounded that 40% of people are still going to vote for Trump.
I didnt do that.  Democratic Establishment did that.  They did it in 2016.  They are doing it now.  Do you really think they care if Biden loses?  They make a fortune if he loses.
That's exactly why they will never have my vote for Biden even if he DID have some redeemable qualities.  But even with that, he is still a racist.  He is still a rapist.  He is still a warmonger.  He is still going senile.
So....what do you think Biden is going to do about it?  And why do you believe him considering his track record of lying?
This! Obama/Biden totally misread the Middle East. Everything from Benghazi to the Arab Spring, Syria, Iran, the Palestinians... Trump realizes what is important to the Arab gulf states— it’s not the Pals, IT IS SECURITY! Am I right  ?????

Biden still pronounces it wrong
Because I dont see Biden saving even one more life.
No.  He stripped it out with a majority in both senate and House.  Likely because of DEMOCRATIC DISSENTION.  Biden said he will VETO it.  Gtfoh
Its already being narrated for Kamala.  Which is why we dont care for Biden winning either.  A Biden loss may actually be taking the bitter pill for a better future.
Democrats in Congress...lzy stingy do nothing Democrats out for themselves only!  Don't be fooled by puzzled together Biden commercials...
You have to admit that whenever President Trump talks he answers all questions even assclown questions from Acosta, may not be the answers they want. You can NOT say that about Biden/Harris, they wont even let invited, fawning media ask softball questions, got to ask, WHY?

Then you should have chosen Bernie.  No one to blame but yourselves because we did warn you that Biden was NOT the most electable because we wouldnt vote for him.  Why are you so worried now?  This is what you asked for when you ignored us.

Well we won't survive another 4 years of Trump either, so it's a tough choice. Maybe have Biden fix things up after Trump in the next 4 years and then choose someone new?
The Trump death cult is raising more money than Biden.  Whichever campaign spends the most usually wins.
You got your facts mixed up. Obama and Biden inherited broken economy and they brought it back alive, creating millions of new jobs. In less than 4 years, Trump has destroyed it all. We need Biden to rebuild the economy after Trump, just like he did after Bush.
It's Trump's fault and he's raising more funds than Biden.  Get ready.
Very funny but who wasted their money even buying a Biden flag 🤦‍♂️
It’s an honor to run against [not Joe Biden] lol

Biden will NOT fix anything, and not with Harris as his VP, he becomes even more dangerous.  Because this is likely an attempt to recreate the "Obama got his shot, now #ItsHerTurn" bullshit from 2016 all over again.  Harris has proven herself to ONLY act in the interests of...

Now people rally for Biden to "stop Trump".  But what has Biden done?  Forbes suggests that he has AT LEAST 9 mil, and likely more since he started his campaign.  Yet the Democratic voter wants him to "fix" things?  Go back and look at how many Democrats voted for Trumps tax cuts
I will vote for Biden. I will even risk voting in person.
To make myself completly clear. I will absolutely concede that there have been a couple things done by this administration that were good. But the bad and poorly handled far outweigh the good in my opinion. Also I think Biden and Kamala are trash as well but just less trash.
Facts about the criminal.  The funny thing is you support Harris and Biden but then support BLM? Harris has kept black men in prison since 1990 at a rate of 5x of white men. Biden has been a lifelong racist.  Hypocrisy at an all time level.

You are spewing far left propaganda due to a lack of a far left candidate on the ballot while failing to realize that both Biden and Harris have adopted considerably progressive agendas and will appoint a number of progressive experts to the executive branch cabinet positions.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
This is such a poorly misguided take.  The Biden/Harris campaign has done nothing to alienate the referenced age group - not to mention that you shouldn’t lump Millennials with Gen Z for obvious reasons.  There has been no attempt to compromise with the current right-wing agenda.
America needs a Biden/Harris national town hall titled "Brats, Beers and Hookahs".
He is a warmongering Clinton puppet. Vote Biden get Neoconservativism on steroids and likely a Nuclear Holocaust.
President Trump is not a empty vessel for anyone, They hate him because he beat Hillary..then helped set him up for a crime he did not commit-the real reason HE WILL NOT KISS THEIR ASS, Joe Biden has dementia-they can control him. That is what this piece of shit Jayapa is saying!
You're correct, we CANNOT afford to elect the corrupt demented pervert sleepy Joe Biden nor the lying corrupt phony Kamala Harris. They definitely would be a disaster for our county. They're extreme Socialists who would ruin our economy &amp; export jobs. We need to keep Trump-Pence!
"IF ELECTED &amp; YOU DON'T SURRENDER YOUR GUNS, I'LL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER &amp; THE POLICE WILL SHOW UP AT YOUR DOOR."  -KAMALA HARRIS.                      She is crazy ... &amp; if anyone votes the Biden ticket ... will be a sad day for Americans!
Add Harris for being a cop and using Biden's crime bill to its furthest extent to enslave imprisoned PoC.
COVID?  Blame goes to:  Trump for not alerting us to the issue earlier. Pelosi and McConnell for going on break while people are being evicted. Pelosi again for "Ice cream" commercials and torn up speeches. Biden for Corvette commercials. Every pol that pushed corp. interests
sure was reaching this morning, trying to defend Biden's hiding in his basement all this time. Never thought I would agree with #LelandVittert on anything, but good that he pressed Garamendi. #FoxNews
Postal Carriers Union endorsed Biden...what could go wrong with mail in voting!!!
This is not to say that Trump isn't abysmal.  Its to say that we have no champions of justice.  Police in the street?  The blame goes to:  Biden's Crime Bill Cheney's Patriot Act And every politician, including Trump who did not fix it.
My sincerest sympathies to you.  I hope that he will come to his senses and change his mind.  Vote Biden/Harris!!!
Well YOU SHOULD be concerned. Biden has dementia and Harris is a fraud. These two don't care about YOU at all.  Their plans would hurt MILLIONS of Americans. #SocialismKills   Kamalama Ding Dong wants to defund the police. HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR AMERICA??  You KNOW Biden is a pawn!
Are you talking about Biden he is wearing diapers he should be okay but you never know LOL
The Postal Carriers Union just endorsed Biden...omg
Here's Biden's Boat Parade
Biden hits back at reporter asking if he took a cognitive test: ‘Are you a junkie?’  via  Are the “journalists” in the media going to allow Biden/Harris to take no questions?
Not gonna watch anyway..... Biden already has my vote..... at this point Biden would have to kill more people than pres dipshit..... fuck it stilll voting Biden
The ones that r loyal to china,,so far i think thats all of the big ones,i been to china in 2012,all wore masks,no pandemic,virus n masks come from china,biden on china payroll,big stores sell mostly china products,the math dont luk good
THIRSTY MARCO, I lived in Florida at the time you became a Senater and I do not remember you saying anything about our manufacturing leaving the country at that time. Biden has said he will bring it back. Do what you can to help him do it.
Camelface Harris believe JOE BIDEN actually picked her as his running mate???  Joe Biden doesn't pick what socks he wears in the morning, the only thing he can pick is his nose
No honoring our past heroes! Only looting and destruction! Biden = Mobs - Trump = Jobs
I agree.  Though from what I understand, he was also a part of that "six figure" ad strategy to get us to "settle for Biden".  He's not perfect, but he is right in this instance.
Biden please... at least he can remember what he inherited.
This woman helps me feel sane in a gaslit world. She gets it. She's the President we deserve, and someday I hope to make that happen. I don't want to vote for Biden now, but if we're ever going to get to AOC, it's what has to happen. #aocforpresident #settleforbiden #byedon
People, it will not matter if the popular vote is for Biden if the electoral college supports Trump. We saw that last election. We have to bombard our elected representatives to vote him out.
Be aware of this video on Biden
Need a new leer jet do they?
The bumper stickers are at the printer now: Joe Biden for President Pro Tem
Bernie doesn't want your trivial gestures, he wants you to vote for Biden. Bernie can't get shit done with Trump in office. If you love Bernie, you'll vote Biden. He's at least worked with Bernie on the platform. Trump would never consider it.
Time for Biden to start firing cabinet members and West Wing staffers (especially those disloyal to the country and our Constitution)-via Twitter ...Trump does it, so Biden should, too.
Remarkable resemblance to Joe Biden about to take a nap
Abraham Lincoln has a famous quote: Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.  One candidate may ride this strategy to the White House and  the one in the WH should consider it  every now &amp; then
Joe Pinion a guest on Newsmax hit the nail on the head discussing Biden's stupid choice, woman only!!!!?
Biden not only has no intention of fixing the crime bill, or the student loan BK bill, he doesnt even acknowledge the damage its done.   Harris hasnt acknowledged the damage she caused to PoC lives by choosing to NOT parole someone because she needed cheap labor. Or scaring PoC..
OK Everybody, I'm organizing a Biden Boat Parade,  whose with me?
Did any of them detail that?  Or fight against it?  Or try to change it?  Bernie compromises. But when he explains his reason, and then goes to try to fix what he doesnt like, then his actions match his words.  Biden and Copmala have both doubled down on their mistakes.
Well, we already know he kept Hidin Biden hid for most of his VP term. Then endorsed Killary with open arms. Could barely utter a complete positive sentence for his former VP in the current endorsement....So, is ANYONE really surprised?
In the end it passed overwhelmingly. I can see Mr K calling Mrs H, but since day 1 of Trump's inauguration it's taboo for Dems to work with the white house.  In the end it was a Huuuge slap in the face to Dems after 8years of Obama/Biden.
Joe Biden C'mon Man REMIX - WTFBRAHH  via  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #MAGA2020 #BidenVP #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #BidenHarris2020 #Trump
WHY would Trump need to rig the election? Up until the China Virus the economy was booming. Unemployment lowest ever. He just made a treaty with Israel and UAE.  Biden has dementia and Harris is a flip flopping fraud who comes from SLAVE OWNERS.  The DNC is the party of the KKK.
#Schumer giving #Obama credit for the stock market. #Pelosi taking credit for the #USMCA trade deal. #Biden taking credit for the #UAEIsrael peace agreement. Will #Schiff &amp; #Swalwell take credit for #OperationWarpSpeed &amp; a #Covid19 vaccine and blame #Trump for the #pandemic too?
Hey dude you a big mouth trump lover! What will happen when November comes and he loses? Tucker you then be a brown nose Biden lover. So big behind the camera but alone you’re shitting your pants.
That means you’re for Socialism and communism, That’s what these radical left democrats have turned Sheep Biden into.
EMGAGE endorsed Biden and he gave a speech to them. EMGAGE is a front for Hamas and The Muslim Brotherhood Video a bit long but fully detailed.
Biden is the best that we have Buttiplug?! We can’t win with him.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
TRUE STORY   Joe Biden past run for President was unsuccessful because he wasn’t Qualified   In 2008 he was chosen as Obama’s white prop for name recognition   Today Biden’s name is running for President and Harris is the Black prop for the same reason   déjà vu in reverse◀️
He wouldn't know how to petition. It's the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN lawyers and operatives doing this. The BOTTOM LINE is, a bunch of white RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS are using a black man to stay in power and keep their stranglehold on American democracy.  I'm with Fightin' Biden' and Nasty!
The stuff they’ve rolled out on her after being selected validates Biden’s choice. Great pick!
Did he vote for segregation or nah?
(2 of 2) Will all states count ballots postmarked November 3?  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
This is the ultimate reason why I’m voting for Joe Biden.  You ready?  It’s pretty simple.   He was Vice-President to the greatest president of my lifetime for 8 years.   That’s enough for me.   #ThanksObama #BidenHarris2020
Former President Obama gave Joe Biden a strong, thoughtful endorsement; “Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f--k things up."  I see a serious lack of confidence in poor Joe?
Still trying to figure out how Kamala calls Biden racist then accepts the nomination.
i still don’t know what a biden presidency means. why is he so bad at this.
YES, AND HE SHOULD STATE THAT AS THE REASON.  TELL THE MEDIA THAT THEIR DAYS OF RUNNING INTERFERENCE FOR BIDEN ARE OVER.
How can America people vote for Biden without hearing question. Guess they scare Biden can’t answers without teletype
Harris won't need any.  Biden won't be there.
Ah, you mean more damage. The RUSSIAN REPUBLICANS already damaged The Party by embracing the BIBLICAL BEAST occupying the WASHINGTON CHANCELLERY (courtesy of Russia).  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
The one thing Kamala Harris brings to the ticket is a platform &amp; an agenda.   She actually has policy positions. Uncle Joe just has "I'm not Trump."  #Biden #BidenHarris #Kamala #Election2020 #VPPick
It’s absolutely not based. Biden is trash.
Donald Trump campaign's poll-watching plans spark fears of voter suppression  So Fucking what! Nobody scared of some Bitch Russian Trump Supporter watching me cast my vote for Biden and Harris! 😅
ABSOLUTELY!!! The states, not the federals, because the IMPEACHED, FAILED, CORONAVIRUS-AWOL "president" will abuse his power to pardon DEJOY.  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!

Biden Faces A Convention Test, To Offer A Vision Beyond Beating Trump
DJT ran for President once in 2016 and got elected. Crazy Joe has been running, lying, thieving &amp; humiliating himself since for decades. DJT built his business &amp; earned a fortune. Biden sold his govt. office, enriched &amp; corrupted his siblings &amp; children.
Anyone notice how with the pandemic and race riots that nobody talking about Hunter Biden or sex island? Democrats destroyed America to distract from their shady dealings
Only Hannity was actually saying these words against Biden.😂
She is a psychopathic warmongering. A Clinton clone just like Biden. And as corrupt as the DNC.
This is as fake as fake can get. Mostly what he said was actually about Biden.😂
China owned Trumpy and his band of drifters. We are importing more from China now than ever. The tariffs were  boom for China. They own more of our debt now then ever.  Biden has no secret deals he is trying to cut with China. They own the Trumps
Democratic National Convention: What you need to know  What we KNOW : It and Biden's campaign is a Hollywood scripted special effects show. I'm waiting for the stand ins and puppets.
Joe Biden's America...
Unfortunately, I think it is too late to save the Post Office for the election.  No matter what funding it is given Trump's flunky will undermine it.  We need to think outside the box and work around the Post Office.  The Post Office will need to be fixed under President Biden.
Biden is and always has been a racist...c'mon man
Fox News’ Demonization of Kamala Harris Is Off to a Fast Start  A cold, calculating, dangerous, far-left radical is how hosts and guests—including the president—portrayed the Democrats’ V.P. pick, as Jeanine Pirro floated a bizarro theory that Biden won’t even be on the ticket.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
Was watching YouTube yesterday. The Joe Biden ad of him driving a corvette amazed me. America is burning: unemployment, 'rona, business closed, industry destroyed. Joe Biden driving around in a gas guzzling corvette, talking about his dad could really drive. #amazing #JoeBiden
Have you geniuses considered the #vets and #seniors who depend on the mail being on time? I didn't think so.  Guessing I can't use #PostalService to send back the #Trump posters cause now I'll be voting #Biden. Nobody messes w/ my meds!!
And yet he does neither. If you expect the people to take the media seriously, you have to apply an equal standard, &amp; it's not even close, including Axios.   It's so obvious you guys are in the tank for Biden, it's why many people have signed off of listening to the media.
And where is Joe Biden? Out driving around in a gas guzzling corvette. This ad sums up the 2020 election.
So you're voting for Joe Biden?
I wish the BLM revolution went harder and we took down the entire government and started over. Fuck TRUMP HARRIS PENCE AND BIDEN. fuck the house and the senate. Fuck em all. Okay sorry for the f-word.
That’s the face of a man who knows he’s going to lose this election in the biggest landslide in the history of this country 🤣🤣 ... so please keep up all the stupid remarks about Joe Biden and keep opening your mouth and sticking your foot in it you’re just making it easy
I hope they finally nail him. He brought this country down and will encourage Biden to send us back to the dark ages. We will be using horse drawn carriages again As theytake that away fossil fuels from us.  Hopefully horses don’t create too much gas !!!
Obama shares his troubling private doubts on Biden to inner circle
My meaning exactly. Why address Biden as if he was the one making the horrible decisions of the last 4 years. Although Biden will have a lot of fixing he will have to do.
#Biden people. Listen up! And read this entire thread. Btw  I'll NEVER vote against my principles. That means I'm NOT voting for #BidenHarris2020
Jump from Clinton to Biden????
America is burning. Joe Biden is out driving around in a corvette. Don't see how much more proof is needed to show just how much he is out of touch with reality. Unless you drive a corvette. Then Joe Biden is the man.
Vote Biden. This is what Democrats give you. Funny, I lived in California for 13 years- never had blackout. U know difference between then and now? Ignorant liberal idea of "green energy." Total fraud. Doesnt work. And triples cost, bankrupts middle class.
Just vote for Biden that the logical thing to do
How did they handle H1N1 Obama/BIDEN? No lockdowns, no masks!  It had more cases and more death. What else was missing?  The mass hysteria brought on by the mainstream media. Wake up!! #Electioninfection PS...Ebola was never a pandemic!
Scranton cheers hometown hero Joe Biden on to the White House
Pay attention to Andrew Weismann! Weismann is to the Mueller report as Kamala Harris is to Joe Biden. Weismann has started a campaign to discredit Barr and what is about to happen.
Where is your breathless coverage of biden never taking questions.
To all of Joe Biden supporters... remember when Kamala called joe out for supporting segregation? Here is why in case you didn’t know, now you know🥴
There was better numbers than that just a.but ago. Biden had been higher. It’s a been a couple weeks since I looked.
Best hope for our nation in the short term... Biden long term

Since 1920 a estimated 5 million Americans have died just from second hand smoke.  We had a 100 years to fix this problem. Joe Biden or Obama did nothing to save those people. In fact Obama certainly got kids to smoke cigs because he smoked.  What a role model right
Vote for Biden
Read #2 please.  Either she was lying then or she’s lying now.  Either way she certainly seems to play it the way which is most advantageous at the time.
You mean how he's continuing all the wars, including participation in a genocide in Yemen, continuing the racist drug war, continuing mass incarceration built in part by Biden, failing to pardon whistleblowers prosecuted by Obama?   Nothing new under Trump except rude tweets.
What a Racist Douchebag!  #Biden #BernieBros #BidenIsARacist #HarrisBiden
But Polosi said that China wants Joe Biden on record on the news
Tbh. Biden will not do anything truly better. His policies and current, modern day opinions have told us that.  Only thing gonna ruin this country is yall continuing to believe we can vote our way out of this.
Im so sick of vote shaming. A non vote is not a Trump vote. A green vote is not a Trump vote. A Trump vote is the only Trump vote. Stop telling marginalized people who have been harmed directly by Biden and Harris that they MUST CHOOSE OR RUIN THE COUNTRY!
WATCH: Biden Repeatedly REFUSES To Answer Reporter’s Questions. Trump Shreds Him.
I hope you realize that Harris and Biden will soon be getting PDB brief and most of your bull shit will start coming out
Dem Platform: "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump was presiding over a recession in the manufacturing sector, after years of growth in the Obama-Biden Administration"  🤣🤔🤡
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
Have you heard about "The Thing" yet! Biden really makes a convincing argument there!
Not always pal. Obama IS/WAS totally corrupt and should be made to answer for his abuse of power. Biden too!! Obama is trying to preserve what little is left of a disastrous legacy he attempted to foist upon our great country!

Would you let Joe Biden near your kids?
I think the perfect example is the recent pick for the Democrats pick for Mr. Biden’s running mate. Many Dems insisted it had to be a black woman. It shouldn’t matter what color or gender.
Please hurry this up. The idiots that voted for her are dumb enough to vote for Biden. Something needs to wake them from their slumber.

On Wednesday during the Dem Convention, Tulsi Gabbart seems slated to introduce Kamala Harris. That seemed lit, until I realized they won't even be in the same time zone and these speeches will likely be taped, not live. Biden's will NOT be live. It will be highly edited.
so Biden gets to storm out of the press conference like a two year old, not answer and ignore  questions he doesn’t like, attack female reporters he doesn’t like, and lie the whole time his is behind the podium like

Really biden for women. God help all if he gets in. don’t worry though biden has zero chance of winning. wish dems could b honest already and get the real candidates out there. Cause there is going to b a switch
At least she hasn’t been shepherding her supporters &amp; campaigning for Biden. I’ll give Tulsi the benefit of the doubt through the November election while she still has her seat in Congress
Voting for Biden will solve nothing. You need to break the system.
How come  can expose all this stuff but couldn’t  expose joe Biden and help Bernie win
Agreed, we are personally accountable for our vote.   Aren't agency and charity signs of morality?   Does Biden support police dismantling, antifa and Palestine? His friends and party do.
In A Single Moment Of Truth, Ron Johnson Destroyed The Trump/Putin Plot To Smear Biden -
Voting other than Trump is a vote for Biden.   Although Trump has been immoral and not taken public steps to repent, he reps the greatest morality of agency.   The DNC nationwide dismantles police and talks of secession. Sedition and treason are not free speech.
so all of this happened only under trump.obama,Clinton,pelosi, schumar,biden, all extremely wealthy. That’s corruption it runs deep in both parties.government is corruption. People get rich with zero consequences.
Biden says we have to wear masks for 3 months. Newsweak says acquired immunity only lasts 3 months. Is there something important coming up in 3 months?...hmmm🤔
Let's see, who was in the White House for 8 of those 13? Why wasn't it fixed then? Oh, the Obama/Biden "empty suit team" was in control.
Well you know Muhammad married a 6 year old girl so Biden will fit right in with the Muslims.
The choice in Nov is now set: Biden-Harris or 4 more years of the corrupt, anti-science, and anti-democratic Trump-Pence administration.   Every single committed Democrat MUST show up to the polls in Nov so we can reclaim the White House, take back the Senate &amp;save our democracy!
Seriously...it was a debate therefore disregard the fact that I called Biden a rapist and a racist. You really can’t make this stuff up! 🙄 #HeelsUpHarris
Yet 100% will still vote for Biden. Great tweet, deadbeat.
Maybe he's in Biden's basement.
Kamala wants to be President. She will say and do anything to squash Biden like a bug if elected.
Time for a Biden to start ramping up the offensive attacks. Tiptoeing around Trump will not help him win.
as i think  has said: biden is running as mayonnaise. people aren’t excited about mayonnaise but mostly think it’s fine and good especially when the alternative is ammonium nitrate
closest you’ll get to that with biden is like a rally with springsteen and biden saying “nebraska was my favorite record man” or some shit and then going on to talk to people in eau claire about wearing masks and mailing checks because biden’s people aren’t dumber than pigshit
Biden lost two primary’s .. he was selected as VP and about to be your President...
No Bumbling Biden is. Even Obama is afraid he can’t do it. Foreign countries are hoping he wins because he’s so weak.
Every single one. He wants Biden to win because he’s so weak with foreign policy.
You will be broke and at war. Biden has no staying power and that is why Russia and China are hoping he wins. Weakness.
Let me explain: the majority of the US wants you “fired.” BTW: your “Sleepy Joe” references are falling flat, no one’s buying it.We finally have a future POTUS who speaks in complete sentences that make sense.  VP Biden also smiles, laughs, &amp; has a sense of humor. How refreshing

Three times there was no cost of living increase for seniors.  I believe each time under Obama/Biden. I am sure it’s easy to fact check by looking at the history of SS.

You have to admit that whenever President Trump talks he answers all questions even assclown questions from Acosta, may not be the answers they want. You can NOT say that about Biden/Harris, they wont even let invited, fawning media ask softball questions, got to ask, WHY?
Prediction:  If Biden/Harris wins, they will find a way to be worse than Trump.  You heard it here first.
Lol  So predictable I already knew Biden was gonna pick you as VP  Kamala Harris is technically the next president  Harris is the president in waiting lol hahaha

Regardless, it is still President Trump. Biden wins the polls and the popular vote and Trump wins the Electoral College, you happy with that?
If he is losing to Biden and the polls are correct, then why are the Dems going nuts trying to establish national mail in ballots, why are they panicking about the ability of the USPS to handle the mail in ballots.  Trump is going to win.
Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.

Biden will probably accept the money in an effort to shut down Hunters baby momma in Arkansas. I hear that stripper has expensive taste.
They will continue to Hide Biden from mics and cameras questions and debates as much as possible to keep his obvious dementia and racism down to a minimum. Extremely weak ticket. Just going through the motions.
Only those who do not NOT know how to read, research and figure out the truth will vote for Biden.  Wake up!  🤯 #Trump2020
What’s at stake: fixing America (Biden) or revolution (Trump). Republicans should announce at the convention that you Mikey are the nominee. You would be a way better choice than Traitor Bloody Donny.
Mass exodus if Biden elected ? Belize get ready for some money !!
So by that logic, you’d better not be voting for Joe Biden and Kampala Harris...🤔
Can we get subtitles on ALL Biden ads ?
I feel like my high school class president did a better job campaigning than Joe Biden did.
Trump will go to prison after he loses to Biden!
Because Chinese people are not the backbone of the Democratic party or saved Biden's dead campaign in South Carolina.
Biden - Warren  - Sanders delegates in the twin cities are urging all national delegates to vote no on the party platform until it includes #MedicareForAll  bravo! Thank you for fighting for US!
Apparently Twitter is now censoring calling Biden s e n i l e. But... he obviously is, so... 🤷🏼‍♀️
This pandemic has killed Vegas! Biden will sell out to China
I will probably vote for  for ballot access, and because she is the closest to my values. I will also vote against ballot initiatives that spend money, or outlaw a noncrime... But, if Nevada goes for Biden, and he invades Syria, I'll feel guilty 🤷
Mostly state not federal issues but I wouldn't expect Biden to know that. Renters rights already exist in most states. Check out how the federal sexual assault survivors bill of rights was passed. As usual, had very little to do with the president at the time (Trump).
Biden and Harris thanks you for all of the donations
322 times in 60 days??? So he was going to his basement 5 times a day...  I have been out my house 4 times since beginning of march....  I probably walk through my house 100 times a day...   I don't get their point   I hear Biden every day: TV, twitter, emails, text, zoom, etc
He’s cut taxes so we get more money on paychecks. He’s built the wall like he said. He’s dropped prices of medical supplies. Created more jobs. Unemployment at an all time low until COVID. Biden has been in politics 40 years and done nothing.
has pissed me off. Biden has a new on YouTube. It's a fvcking joke. My camera is not here. Filed 2 complaints on sellers. Trying to get money back. Nothing working today.
I'm very curious what some, possible Biden voters think about this...        If Biden invades Syria, in 2021, and nothing else changes... You were conned by the greater evil, right?
I mean..   ... Do you actually believe this insanely optimistic estimate?  Trump went 4 years without starting a new immoral war of choice as president... Obama didn't with Biden as Veep. Did Biden ever complain?  I'm pretty sure Biden still gets me 20k Syrians dead+
I'll wait while you find the quote from Biden 'hollering' about closing flights to China.  The racist calling started when he extended the ban to some African countries for no reason (they still have nowhere near as many cases as us) a couple of weeks later, because it was racist
Notice how it’s ACTUALLY #Tulsi supporting media    KimIversen  who aren’t  compromising their beliefs for Biden. While, we continue to get the shepherding lessor of 2 evils narrative from

Does Biden know his VP's name?   #dementiaJoe
The USPS Workers Union has endorsed Biden. Conflict of interest wouldn’t you say?
Soooo what you’re saying is you’d rather vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR Biden? And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a republic dies a slow death. Biden is doing as little as possible and thinks it will be enough to earn the highest office in the world. I don’t think so.
On betonline Biden is -135, Trump is +1.05. They have odds on each state too. FL -1.55 Dem, AZ -145 Dem, etc. Based on state odds, here is how EC map looks. Biden easy winner.
FWIW, betonline has odds:  -135 Biden, +105 Trump. Was -180 Biden last week. Doesn't make sense as they have odds for each state. Biden in -155 FL, -145 AZ, etc. Based on state odds, here is EC map. Biden wins easy.
Whack job lefty who is trying to brain wash her viewer's. She's the idiot!!! We will have nothing left if Biden becomes president. She knows Tump is going to win.shes about to cry!!!! TRUMP 2020!!!!

Um...since Cardi B is  favorite rappers - will WAP be the new theme song for the Biden/Harris dynamic duo?  🤔

Now why is it you report on this but you don't report on  hiding in his basement and refusing to debate  or Biden ignoring questions about having cognitive testing done. He has brain damage and should be disqualified from race. Unfit for POTUS.
I see a problem with the postal union endorsing Biden when Democrats are trying for mass mail-in vote fraud.
You got one thing right, you’re a bitch.  The Trumps have done more for the Black Community than you, Obama and Biden ever have. You are a disgrace to your race. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
IDK, Biden is +4.5 in AZ and 9.2 here. It's a dramatic turn.   Either way, wear what you wear and don't apologize.
🤣🤣🤣🤣oh, 🐴💩 Get your head out of Biden's arse, and see what is really going on!
I personally don’t dislike him, he has debated some right winger and completely smashed them, but when debating other leftists, well, it’s a lot messier. Rn I think he’s getting a lot of flak because of his support for Biden and using Marxist theory uphold his position
Truthfully - he has spent his entire life dividing this great country of ours - and adding you to the ticket, will only further that divide!  BTW:  you were so certain about your low opinion in Biden, what changed your mind?  🤔
When Biden steps aside, I will be so excited.
Team Biden announced several new hires in Nevada today, including former members of Teams Warren, Kamala and Castro.

This should show every American how little respect Biden has for we the people. He thinks if he lies to you your stupid enought to believe him. Pelosi said in hot mic Americans are the stupidest people in the world. Dem are LYING
Except FedEx is aloud to open any package they want meaning they can open voting mail if it went through them and just throw out ones for Biden to skew the votes. USPS is not aloud to open private mail
22 emails from Biden's campaign today with 6+ hours still to go.
He signed to executive orders to force the Democratic leader back to negotiate a fair bill for America. He is a great negotiator, unlike Biden he can spell it!
CCP and the Kuomintang hated each other but came together to fight Japanese Imperialism, once they won that conflict they got back to vying on who was going to run the country. So are you so disillusion that you think 4 more years of Trump will make your life than with Biden/Harr
Your anecdotes mean nothing to me. I don’t know or care what your credentials are. Your argument about Biden has been ass the whole time I’ve been corresponding with you. You assume I take you as an enemy so I treated you like that. But you’re wrong on Biden.
I Will Vote Democrat But Will not Donate until Biden Harris promise publicly they will PROSECUTE everyone that have broken the law including Treason We need JUSTICE, they need to be made an example, this cant happen again 45 is leaving behind a HowToGuide to detroy our country
Shove your statue. I want universal health care, pro-choice, a fucking functional USPS, expanded unemployment benefits, increased CV19 testing, a coherent CV19 plan based on SCIENCE, protection of SS and Medicare, no more nepotism, and Biden as Pres.
You have to prove Biden is harm reduction. From historical analysis we can say that’s definitely not a thing to accept as a given.
As usual you are awesome Rose💙💙💙💙
The double standard the media has for Biden and trump is astonishing.  Biden has to be perfect; trump, no.
Biden/Harris is closer to my values then Trump. Not a 100% which nothing ever is. Obama wasn't but definitely more than Romney and McCain could ever be. Revolutions invariable have counter revolutions but 2 parties come together to fight an enemy despised by both. 1/2

Kamala said Catholics were a criminal enterprise. She said the Knights of Columbus were a racist, sexist fraternity and said being Catholic might exclude someone from public office. Biden said its ok to ignore the Commandments. They are not compatible with Christian values.

Biden Will Be A ‘Constructive Player’ On #Marijuana Reform, Congressman Predicts #MarijuanaNews  via
Best voter database, Catalist, shows non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout. So to get Biden up by 11, they had to oversample minorities by 13 pts.  Pollsters rig by undersampling whites, oversampling young, oversampling women, oversampling college grad+, usually a combo.
Shooting straight won’t do a lot of good when Biden takes away your guns while setting the Bible on fire on his way to hurt God.  Isn’t funny how scared these tough guys are?
I want a presidential Debate  Biden  vs Trump so we can just this election #Trump2020Landslide
Wow just basically got told to shut up about politics because I'm an immigrant by an ex Bernie campaign staffer (who I referred to the campaign) because I won't support Joe Biden. Damn she is a confused mess. LOL
According to Catalist, which studies have shown is most accurate on voter data, non-whites were 24% of 2016 turnout.  Every pollster showing Biden with a lead is undersampling whites by 7 pts or more.
You can hypothesize all you want but Biden’s actions directly gave the police authority to kill PoC indiscriminately, you don’t get to use utility as a bargaining chip. You have to admit you are using arbitrary ideas to select one equivalent evil over another. It means nothing.
Is that why rapist Biden takes and answers so many questions?
I think everyone appointed by Trump should go to jail when Biden crushes him
I'm being honest - I'm not thrilled with these options, I'm more left than Biden or Harris.  Im literally just asking what makes the most tactical sense? And what will help the most people RIGHT NOW?

why don’t you just call them Mr Biden, and Miss Harris. Try this instead of just insulting those running against you and actually discuss policies. Wait I understand you don’t have any policy other than cutting taxes for the Ultra Rich. That and erasing Pr.Obama.
It's as crowded as a Joe Biden rally. 😀
Biden is the candidate because nobody was willing to step away so Pete could finish Bernie, starting with NH which the press somehow made a 3 way race with Amy. I don’t know anything anymore after this fucking primary.
Laughing and crying (figuratively speaking) because there are democrats who are actually going to vote for two failed candidates for the Presidency! This Biden Harris ticket is a gift to the GOP! Don't fuck it up GOP!
Gawd, I hope so! It looks like they're doing more than the democrats in washington. Seems like the dems are out maneuvered by the RUSSIAN REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS and The Party "leader".  I'm with Fightin' Biden and Nasty! Make Democracy and the Rule of Law Great Again!
I literally just saw a quote from Biden taking partial credit for this. Ridiculous!
Are you talking about the same usps that officially endorsed biden? The same usps that biden is telling President Trump is out to destroy? The primary ballots I received, (6 for a house w/2 registered voters) had party affiliation on the envelope. Nope!
Obama, Biden as well.
He probably shouldn't unless his internal polling show it a reasonably close race.  If he does make a play, it will scare the shit out of the Biden campaign, force them to spend money there, and spread Joe and Kamala....ahem...thin.
I’m also not a fan of Biden, but hasn’t tRump done enough damage already? He had his shot, he drove our nation to the ground. He’s done. Why is that so hard to understand?
You still not back on? The last thing I posted, I think, is that Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP. I was neither overly joyous nor distraught in that post either.
We have built a criminal legal system specifically designed to oppress people of color???  You’re 100% right, both you and Biden have been in the politics for like 40 years! So give yourself a pat on the back for your racist policies! 😂🤣😂 freakin 🤡
Joe Biden: "We are better than this moment than we are in."
Okay so you are voted for racist Joe Biden in good concise. Make that one make sense?
Our kids have been in cages since Biden wrote the crime bill bitch, what have you done to stop that?
Yes. This is what leftists mean when they say “voting Biden is harm reduction” It’s not “vote Biden then stop everything we’re doing” It’s “vote Biden so less people die while we keep pushing, even harder.”
Someone telling you that you are wrong is not cyber bullying Jacqueline
In the NV primary I received 6 ballots with only 2 registered voters in the house. They also had a checkbox on the outside of the envelope for party affiliation. The USPS union has endorsed biden and all the leftists are screeching that potus is trying to destroy the USPS. 🤔
I know y’all don’t like Fox News I can get you a different source 👀 or 👁👄👁
Reuters/Ipsos poll sample is 50% Democrat-leaning, only 37% GOP leaning, to get Biden to +7.  Biden is down bigly, not just a couple of points.
In 2012 I was working out of state and had to prove to NV that I was by sending a pay stub from my employer in UT to get a ballot. What they want to do is send ballots out like those landscaping service flyers you get every day in your mailbox. USPS endorsed biden. It’s a scam.

If Trump can have his acceptance speech in the White House then the DNC should request that Biden should be able to have his in the White House. He is a former Vice President after all. Equal time.
You’re correct, and he has broken the law so many times no one could keep track.  There’s nothing Biden &amp; Harris could do to come close.  I don’t want to hear complaints from magats.  I can play “what about,” too.
I’m serious, I just can’t take black folks voting for Biden serious, when his track record is well known. Voting for him is literally the definition insanity.
Nick Adams  · 2h Mail-in voting is not safe or secure.   Joe Biden will say anything to steal the election from  !

It is good to know that  mail carriers who endorsed Joe Biden for president will be handling my mail in ballot. I'm sure they will be honest.
So excited for Biden-Harris!
Biden should be nervous, we now know he was involved in FBI LYING to get a warrant. Biden and Comey hopefully will see for prison time. More coming soon!!
The USPS union endorsed Biden.  Conflict of interest?
A deranged imbecile criminal and traitor is what we have now. Biden and Harris are going to change that.

I better get my Biden Harris sticker this time 😒
I believe the specific words he said was "In certain cases" which is way different than the blanket bill Biden wrote.
Yes he did.  At that time, he explained his vote (women domestic abuse provisions, if I remember), trashed the part resulting in mass incarceration, and SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO FIX.  Biden/Harris still embrace that bill to this day.
Hell, they're already calling Joe Biden a commie, and he's about as conservative as the Dems come  What makes anyone think the black lady cop who once endorsed M4A is going to attract people who think Joe Biden was pals with Joe StalinMy aunt said Biden was a communist. Then said Biden will die and Bidens party is communist. She is 70+ and is uber-indoctrinated from all those years of propaganda.

You are speaking of all the Laws Obama/Biden Admin &amp; 9th Circuit had overturned because they were unConstitutional. True, never let a Democrat near a position of Power—it is always abused by them.
I wish.  I know this giant headed 12 year old in a suit doesn’t remember how they tried that same trick on Obama and it didn’t work then either. Her and Biden would be Center right in most European countries. Still better than a far right fascist wannabe dictator.

These script writers for this final season are just lazy &amp; predictable. Igor &amp; Lev? A deadly pandemic that forces Trump to cancel TWO Republican conventions? Trump questions the citizenship of Biden’s running mate? Too many cliches!
lies 24 f'n 7! He lied about: •Kamala Harris not be qualified         to run for VP •Biden politicizing #TrumpVirus •HIS administration following the science •EVERYTHING regarding #TrumpVirus cases, the death toll, &amp; testing •Voter fraud Did I miss anything?
“My lies are fabulous, absolutely amazing, believe me, they’re very luxurious lies! But creepy Joe Biden’s lies are sad, lazy, unAmerican socialist lies.”
It’s so odd that Mr Trump has never accused Joe Biden of birth certificate fraud, but Biden’s running mates’ birth certificates are both “suspicious” 🤔
That is 100% garbage!  Creepy Joe Biden and Chameleon Kamala do not have a chance to beat President Trump and VP Pence.  The Democrat leadership supports anarchy, defunding the  Police, open borders, higher taxes, China over America and late term abortion.  It’s appalling!!
It’s probably just a “coincidence” that Trump never accuses Joe Biden of forging a birth certificate, but Biden’s running mates are both engaged in birth certificate fraud? 😉
Remember the time Joe Biden tried to prevent states with governors he disliked from receiving vital medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic?
trump calls for barr to investigate  Obama &amp; Biden. The AG should NOT be paid to conduct an investigation of one of trump's conspiracy theories! The  has gone completely off the rails!!! HE MUST BE STOPPED!!!
He’s accusing Mr Biden of having a vegan diet? That’s an odd, easily refutable allegation
Trump’s strategy is to shrink his party until all that’s left are the white supremacists  Biden’s strategy is to earn the votes of both leftists &amp; centrists  Is Biden’s strategy realistic? Maybe. Or maybe not. But at least he’s not deliberately leading his party on a suicide pact
All the things you're claiming will happen in a Biden administration we're dealing with right now under your administration!
Utah being the only one on the map with a D plus 40 is amusing to me. (Too bad it’s still not near enough to win, they just really love Romney there). Don’t like that Nevada’s a little redder but Obama won by 12 and 7 here and Hillary by 2. I think Biden’ll still take it)
wow I almost changed the channel. Biden’s words for the souls of America could mean something to me. Damn I don’t know what to think. Time will tell. LUC
This guy can't pronounce the word, 'fatalities'! He said, "fatilities", twice! Yet he challenges Biden's cognitive ability and brags about 'acing' a cognitive test. 🙄 Person*Woman*Man*Camera*TV🙄
I would be *delighted* if Donald Trump made Hunter Biden the main centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Voters don’t care about the virus, they care about Hunter Biden! It’s a winning issue, guaranteed to resonate with the 30 million unemployed Americans who can’t pay rent
Too much is "off-limits." Who cares what the Angry Mob says the rules are? We should be discussing Biden's crooked deals and Harris's racist policies. We should discuss child sex trafficking, long a taboo topic.
Remember the funny little videos obama and biden did. Those we were good times.  What I'm wondering is, WHEN he's elected, will Biden make some new videos with Harris? Cuz I'd like that 😁
Loss is a universal trait that all of us must occasionally endure. No matter your political views, we all experience grief.   For example, Joe Biden mourns the death of his son Beau Biden while Donald Trump mourns the death of his close friend Jeff Epstein 😢
Joe Biden mourns the death of his son Beau Biden while Donald Trump mourns the death of his close friend Jeff Epstein 😢
I realized after I said that, that if you don't know what venmo is...this sounds like a total scam haha so I don't fault you for declining. But you can check it out on an app store and see that its an accredited...so if you ever change your mind...Go Biden Harris! Best of luck!
More people turn out for high school football games than they did for a Biden-Harris rally.
Your last snort didn’t go well.   Who do you think will replace Joe Biden on the ticket?  Some say Michele Obama. As Ukraine closes in on Biden and actor Biden gaffs up more he will be able to use his diminsa as a defense.
Biden/Harris all the way
At the federal level, I doubt that the Biden Justice Dept will prosecute Donald. Biden will do the old “Lets look forward, not backward” nonsense.  I’m more optimistic about NY state charges
My cousin has the worst case of TDS I’ve ever seen- threw me out of her house last night when I asked her what Biden is going to do to solve all her problems after she told me he would do so if elected
....got away with stealing this election and they're now under the rule of Biden. It is NOT going to be pretty. A Biden regime WILL NEVER SEE ONE THING DONE IN TAX MONEY FROM ME and I have a bunch there are millions who feel the same. WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BIDEN IS IN...
Biden wants to fund the police MORE. Has he discussed his plan for reform at least?  Im not ecstatic about it, but they have my vote.
She did a lot of awful shit as AG and DA. Let’s get that out of our system  There’s two options.  I’m not going to trash her or Biden till after the election if I can help it. This isn’t Romney or McCain. We’re talking about a guy forming a dictatorship here. He needs to go
C’mon Man as Biden would say. You don’t have to bend over backwards to justify or excuse her sketchy past. Just point to Trump and say “You want more of that?!” And that oughta do it. “It is what it is” as a bigger jerk might say
I'm not even going to watch this POS because Joe Biden is not a racist. YOU are the RACIST. In fact, you were SUED for refusing to rent apartments to blacks!
I hope so cause Biden just made her the presumptive next President (if we’re lucky and the Cotton/Carlson ticket doesn’t sneak in).  She has been pushing (with Bernie and Markey) for UBI during the pandemic and has supported Medicare for All before so I do have some hope.
I mean not for nothing but Harris has signed on to a lot of Bernie’s bills. Biden seems to actually respect him.  That does give me a little hope. Also I would like Trump to not be President anymore so I’m definitely in favor of that.
Harris is fine. She’s shown she can be moved left when the occasion calls for it. I mean, it’s Biden, we could’ve done a lot worse (and I’m not overjoyed cause she’s a cop but like I said, she’s fine). Plus it’lll he fun seeing her take Pence down a peg.
My definition of a scandal: Trump invited the Taliban to America on the anniversary of 9/11!   Donald Trump’s definition of a scandal: Biden prepared some written remarks for an important historic phone call!
is a liar. No one watches pressers anymore because it's always the same old shit. LIE ABOUT #TRUMPVIRUS, BASH DEMS, LIE ABOUT ECONOMY, INSULT SOMEONE, LIE ABOUT JOBS, CALL SOMEONE NAMES, LIE ABOUT RELIEF BILL, BASH BIDEN, LIE ABOUT VACCINE, &amp; BABBLE ON &amp; ON! 🙄
god bless America go! Biden Harris.
Wait a minute didn't she accuse Joe Biden to be racist in the presidential debate? 😆🤣🤡
Biden still has a cabinet to fill. Odds are good she'll be a part of that
Biden learned to do this from Obama
OHHHHHHH MY GAWD!  Extra joy!!!!  Can’t wait for Biden/Harris to KICK SOME ASS!
Congratulations biden/Harris 2020
I'm just saying,  Biden read my mind and picked my first choice for VP. You're welcome
Thank god biden/Harris 2020
Yes, I have issues with Harris, particularly around FOSTA/SESTA.  Nevertheless I wholeheartedly support and endorse Biden's decision.  Period.  End of discussion.
As I commented on Facebook, whoever Biden's pick is, it's not going to be Susan Rice. Choosing her would just give the Republicans an excuse of umpteen more rounds of BENGHAAAAAZZZIIIIII!!!!
Okay, Tweetbrain, Biden has chosen his running mate. Who do you think it's going to be?  My guess is Tammy Duckworth.
First, let me be clear, I'm voting #Biden2020 no matter who his running mate is. That being said,... COME ON BIDEN! PICK HARRIS!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
They’re using Johnson and Grassley to keep the dirt spreading about Biden...
Voting for Trump is voting for a racist Voting for Biden is voting for a pedophile   There IS NO HUMILITY IN AMERICA
I hope the Democrats realize that too. I wish Biden was more vengeful.
I'm also sick and tired of all the Biden commercials on TV.
Hearing the news the Mayor Pete met with biden makes me think he's getting the nod for either DOD or VA. So  whats the word? Am I right? #Biden2020
Now, if BIDEN had said this Gym, Rudy, Eric, and the whole trump peanut gallery would be vomiting snarky comments all night!
From the looks of it that's Joe Biden campaign!
The POTUS, who is NOT a financial analyst, keeps insisting the entire financial system will collapse under Biden. He needs to be reminded that Obama &amp; Biden rebuilt the damaged economy left to them by a Republican president who put the country in a recession!
Rep. Matt Gaetz Likens Joe Biden's Campaign to 'Elder Abuse'
Since  decided to bring up one of the greats of comedy to bash biden, I decided to show Mr. Williams thoughts on trump. We miss you Robin Williams.
Biden's up in every swing state. Even Texas is up for grabs this year.   So yeah, I'm doing great - thanks for asking!!  #TrumpIsLosing  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica  #TrumpHasNoPlan
If someone could prove that 77 year old Joe Biden &amp; 74 year old Donald Trump were BOTH battling dementia, (but neither man dropped out of the race) I would still vote for Joe Biden
“I was about to vote for Joe Biden, but once the President started tweeting nonsense about Anthony Scaramucci, I changed my mind and now I’m gonna vote for Donald Trump,” said no voter ever

Scoop: Inside Trump's debate prep...
Yes. China would prefer Biden. So would virtually every other country - including America.   This isn't some sort of "secret."
Biden EMBODIES RACISM, PEDOPHILIA, RAPE AND CORRUPTION! HE IS JUST PLAIN GROSS!
Biden = CORRUPTION.
I think Biden is a decent guy at heart and I’d take him over any Republican not just Trump.
Yes, Weekend at Biden's will be what we get. The rad dummies will be dragging him around and continuing to prop him up. In other words, nothing will change and we'll go back to a Democrat stagnant country.
“It’s going to be an absolutely AMAZING sunrise very luxurious, just fabulous, believe me. But Joe Biden hates the sun, if we elect him he’s going to ban sunrises. Of course the fake news CNN &amp; failing New York Times won’t tell you that, it’s just another witch hunt, believe me.”
Accusing Biden of being "to the left of Bernie Sanders" was also a nice gift to the Biden campaign.
But then who will remind us of all the "concerns" we should have regarding a Biden presidency while ignoring the fact that Trump's presidency is a complete disaster?  ...oh, right. Literally dozens of other talking heads on TV.
There's no point in watching #DictatorTrump's news conferences. Nothing but lies about #TrumpVirus/testing/jobs/economy/Dems/Biden/voting, conspiracy theories, verbal attacks, self-congratulation, &amp; a smokescreen of empty promises to distract the people. S.O.S.D.D.!
Ya gotta watch this if you have any doubt that Joe Biden could be President-you’re doubts are well founded!
AAN Daily Recap: Biden Defers to Voters on Question of Mental Fitness
So, you'll blame China for YOUR negligence regarding #TrumpVirus, lie about the number of new cases &amp; deaths, paint a rosy economic picture, lie about job numbers without mentioning over 1M filed for unemployment last week, &amp; bash mail-in voting &amp; Dems &amp; Joe Biden. S.O.S.D.D.!!!
