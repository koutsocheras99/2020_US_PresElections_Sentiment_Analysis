Yang dropped out to make way for Joe Biden when Bernie was still beyond viable and the best hope we had of someone actually being a little on the left making it. He sold out to Biden &amp; CNN. He‚Äôs also surprisingly right leaning. Bernie is only very moderately Left/Libertarian
I no longer care who Biden picks for VP. I just wish he would retire.
There is literally no planet in which I vote for Biden or Trump.
Biden should tweet as much as possible so everyone can know what ‚Äúthey are getting‚Äù.
IMHO, any Christian who believes solely on faith what Trump said about Biden and God today is violating at least two of the ten commandments and is tacitly accepting a false idol in place of God. The Word is clear that pretenders will come to fool the faithful for his own gain.
Why aren‚Äôt those accusing Joe Biden of having cognitive decline doing the same here???
Wait dude, this is fake. We have plenty political ammo to take on Biden with the excellent COVID response where only like 500,000 tops people will die, booming economy and record high trust in government. Look at this chart. This says everything üëá owned the libs AGAIN!
If she can convince you Benghazi was because of a video, she can convince you Joe Biden is perfectly normal and sane.
Do your homework and Biden and you realize he's nearly as bad as Trump would you buy in voters will put Biden into office but not me. I did my homework.
The New York AG shouldn't and doesn't coordinate with the Biden campaign.
I‚Äôm clear what‚Äôs happening here. You are supporting a candidate who believes all Black people think alike.
Don shows us daily he does not care about Americans. He only cares about himself. His life is a series of lies and cons. He will destroy what‚Äôs left of America if he‚Äôs re-elected. Vote for Biden not #DonsNextCon
Missing you and  on The Five. I so wanted to hear your take on the new Biden interview this morning where he went crazy....again. "come on man"
That Biden should drop out and you should take the mantle because you could actually win.
If you vote shame people for not voting for Biden, you aren't a comrade.   I said what I said.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Lmao. The fact that you think Biden will be any better. Sweetie, stop drinking the Koolaid. Democrats don't give a fuck about you and you're rewarding them for it. Biden said nothing will fundamentally change. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.
When will you acknowledge Joe Biden's clear signs of dementia?
Propping up Joe Biden is elder abuse.
I don't understand. This is literally how Joe Biden talks.
#MAGA don't you ever say he is intelligent or that Biden is senile. This man is gone. He doesn't know how to pronounce the word and national Park Yosemite..
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
And what proof is there that Biden can't do this assumption of yours?
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Welcome new followers. I don't care if you're voting for Biden or Green. Your vote is your choice, (except Trump.) All I ask is you don't come in my page and vote shame me. That will earn you a hard and fast block. Also, I'm poor, so please consider checking out my Etsy shop. :)
Dumb.  The majority of Americans want M4A.  Biden wants to help his oligarch friends.   It is that simple.
Biden: *Announces VP*   Twitter, five minutes later: "So, who's gonna be in Joe's cabinet?"
Every time a Joe Biden ad comes on my TV I feel the overwhelming urge to jump off the closest bridge.
I said yes for the few Biden bumper stickers I've seen in the midwest to south Texas...... I just drove from a west suburb of Detroit to Muskegon MI and didn't see one Biden sign or bumper sticker.....
Biden couldn't get a sentance out in 10min to debate Trump.....and it would mostly be rambling anyway.....
And then we all make sure to live to see inauguration of BidenüòÖü•µüòÖ
AZ primary is tomorrow! Y‚Äôall just vote for Biden and we can go to Uncle Bernie‚Äôs on the weekend!
Just wait until Biden is elected, no decent will be televised.
Biden hears you!   But Republican majority in DC when you were there wdn't listen to your demand for humanity at border.
üòÇü§£ he has been a politician for almost 50 years, he doesnt know the difference between a lie or telling the truth. A vote for Biden is a vote for China. He doesnt care about Americans.
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
the bank sees a Biden win and starting to CYA
I'm not sure why they think this is a strong argument. Don't vote for Biden or the terrible stuff happening under Trump might continue. Uh, okay...and?
Stronger under President Biden, yes.
Biden is a 1968 Republican replica. Republicans in 2020 are fascist. Trump is an anomaly invented by advertising &amp; mass media. Only women can lead in this predicament. Capitalism in a pandemic  -  is gas to the fire.
Yee I feel you, man. The reason for my repost was because it‚Äôs a protest in AZ for child trafficking. Not necessarily because I agree 100% with that sign. I haven‚Äôt seen any of my peers say anything about these protests. Just about trump &amp; Biden.
Is it Trump? Biden? Nope. It's Jo Jorgensen  via
just because someone is liberal, doesn‚Äôt mean they like joe biden  üòó‚úåüèª
It‚Äôs important for Biden to debate Trump. If Biden is mentally fit, that should prove it. We should know how Biden currently handles confrontation and situations where he needs to think on his feet. I fear, however, today‚Äôs Biden will fare poorly.
As much as I hate to say it, it would not be just the truth Trump would destroy but Biden as well. Once again the Dems have given us the choice of a brand name candidate rather than the best candidate.
I really want to know if all the people telling everyone to vote for Joe Biden have actually been able to finish a video of him talking
If they were doing that, I think they'd be doing about something that's actually important and is putting us in immediate danger. But I doubt the intelligence community is playing some sort of mind manipulating, 3D chess. If that was the case, they'd be briefing Biden too.
You used to be all for Biden, was part of the force to make him the nominee while you bashed Bernie.   Amazing to see the switch.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
"Vote for Biden! He's the only thing standing between us and Fascism!"  Cute how you think electoral politics will stop a Fascist that doesn't want to be stopped. Voting won't save us if he goes full tilt Hitler. Sorry.
The union may have endorsed Biden but that doesn't mean the union members will vote for him....
I am voting for Joe Biden and every down-ballot Democrat, not out of spite, not out of some loyalty to party, but to save my country from destruction. There is no other way. We all must do this. We must send a message that the GOP is irreparably broken and needs to lose badly.
November. But I personally think dems shot themselves in the foot by propping Mr. Biden up, they can‚Äôt honestly think he has a chance right? The guy is a joke, a walking punch line, and that‚Äôs only if he‚Äôs not taking a nap at a press conference or something.biden just lost his own state whit that statement
But Biden is going to hurt God and take away hamburgers!
nop that is what would be under biden and fema death camps with china runing the country no more america under biden
Are you mad because you‚Äôll never be president are you mad because you have all timers are you mad because you can‚Äôt have your sniffing children what‚Äôs really going on Joe Biden?
Someone told me 2 neighbors in CA had Biden signs in their yard.   They had both moved away from Santa Barbara because it was too expensive to live there.    So they packed up and took their poison politics to infect an affordable,  conservative area.
This infuriates me beyond reason! This from a man who sins as a way of life! Pray for his damned soul.  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #TrumpleThinSkin   Trump says Biden is 'against God'  via
It‚Äôs not very cool that our lives are in the hands of a deranged, moronic lunatic.  Bidens going to hurt religion and hurt God?  I haven‚Äôt seen any Biden supporters waving confederate flags with white hoods on either, how about you?
REPUBLICANS FOR JOE BIDEN ..... you ARE NOT REPUBLICANS...   YOU STAND FOR EVERYTHING AGAINST...
Market manipulation, to make Biden look bad when he stops the corruption.
I just read a bunch of Biden supporters trying to trash talk President Trump and it is ridiculous. People who aren‚Äôt even Christian are making remarks about whether he knows any Bible verses. What is that to them? Morons!
Joe Biden is catholic they don‚Äôt read the Bible. Also he thinks he is running for the senate so naw...don‚Äôt think so. What about Joe calling black people the N word and all the other racial slurs. That is something real to talk about.
It was probably a die hard trump fan but there‚Äôs no way trump was like ‚Äúphotoshop joe Biden for me.‚Äù
Awww Michelle Obama has some low grade depression and it‚Äôs because of President Trump. What a scam. A last ditch attempt to get people who like her ü§Æ to vote for Biden. So sick and disgusting.
no becouse dopie joe biden clamed last week that he would pick his vp this week and has not boom
Did you ask him why he hasn't taken down videos of biden sniffing kids
Just because a bunch of teens punked him on his rally!!  Look out, I heard Biden likes chocolate shakes!  He wouldn‚Äôt dare!?
Joe Biden didn't invent systemic, unconscious racism.  But, he did perfect it 30 years ago.
fyi i know q and inter group that is so deep state is just like oil on the water we are cleaning it up biden will not make it nor will pelosi and all who back both them they are cursted QANON UNITED WE STAND UNDER JESUS SON OF DAVID  AMAN GOD IS WITH US
this country is 329,000 people i been keeping track of the nation of those who will vote and who they chose biden # is falling at one time he was at 75,000 at this time biden is now at 26,000 voter. as of this time trump is setting almost at 250,000 voters and still growing boom
Every Democrat initiative for the last century has worked to suppress the poor and disadvantaged, particularly POC, .  Racism has never been a deal breaker for a Democrat candidate.  Quite the opposite.  Biden is safe.
The White House has a basement, Biden would be safe.  No one actually believes Biden would run the country if he won the election.  That would be retarded.
If Joe Biden can hurt your god, it‚Äôs time to admit you don‚Äôt really believe in or have trust in your god and either find one that‚Äôs not so weak or just decline to bow to any of them.
Biden is a Chinese muslin? What‚Äôs his thread count?
Every time Joe Biden attempts to put a paragraph together it disqualifies him.
Biden has always been systemically racist.    Dementia has not cured him of this.
This is overwhelmingly depressing! It makes me feel hopeless. How do we guarantee a win for Biden, for American democracy?
All in Under One Minute: New Biden Clip Packed With Shocking Gaffes, Lies, and Accusations   Well it is good to see he is improving at his cognitive decline.  Good for America that is.
The only person who‚Äôs going to be able to translate what Joe Biden is saying is a Democrat. Are you absolutely certain you want to sit in the presence of one of them and listen to them tell you about politics?
Joe Biden‚Äòs dementia may be something new but his inability to think and reason logically goes way way back.
Your campaign people and all the GOP operatives trying to get Kayne West on the ballot to run for President and try to take votes especially the black vote away from Biden isn't going to work!
biden is grand wiserd of kkk and unless u what to be band on here dont post on biden
yes becouse biden is one too

Biden isn't really a celebrity, but he does put a lock on Trump's 2020 victory.
Absolutely ruined the truck driver's life just to maintain Biden's political appearances.
I‚Äôm not sure if my tweet went through or not, but I was wondering if you could reach out to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign and offer for him to use your awesome virtual zoom arena for his convention. Just a thought. Thanks for considering the idea.
Biden is off his rocker, someone needs to get him help. He's not fit for the grueling task of POTUS. DNC needs to pick another candidate SOON. No matter, Trump is going to win 11/03/2020!

Boy Eric, at first I thought you were talking about Biden! Oh well... we disagree, but I still love ya!
Some good would def come because of Biden for sure. It isn't all negative.
Joe Biden is so confused that if you placed his wife in a police lineup before him he would probably pick another woman. Just to be sure I would have as well any woman that would want Joe Biden to be president is obviously not a very intelligent woman.
Biden is senile and doesn‚Äôt know what day it is. Most of the time his mask is hanging off if his ear.
First, Biden has been dealing with stuttering his entire life. Second, Trump supporters look utterly ridiculous and clueless when they post these types of Biden posts.
Is Biden the spokes person for the Indians ?
I‚Äôm sorry went off the rails when I asked that question? Joe Biden has not been on the rails for years. He doesn‚Äôt have both orders in the water. He‚Äôs not dealing with a full deck. He‚Äôs three aces short of a full house. Need I continue?
Biden has always been stuck on racist.
Biden just told us a few weeks ago he'd taken lots of cognitive tests.  Guess he forgot.
That‚Äôs because he knows Biden will look like an idiot ! You people really should have him throw in the towel  !
We live indoors 99% of the time.
I bet they did ! Could you imagine  Biden going up against President Trump !
It Is What It Is - Which is a souped up Flu Virus made in a Lab in Wuhan China !  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . Joe Biden Is What HE IS - A CORRUPT, SNIFFING LITTLE GIRLS AND EARLY ALZHEIMER's TYPE OF PUPPET OF the Radical Left.
Biden was kneeling down to talk to a child. Not during the national anthem! Once again a "Trump" spreading lies!!!
Biden has had 40 plus years in government,  tell me his accomplishments!!!
Why do the Far Left support Biden?  It's a mystery!
relly thats nothing new to me both joe biden and oboma sent money to wohon befor leving the white house along with A Fruit
My only concern is a trump victory and a Republican Senate majority for four more years. In that time, he could destroy the Republic. Between now and January? You‚Äôre right, the odds are so small as to be unworthy of attention. Eye on the prize. Vote for Biden.
You think Joe Biden is ready for the debates? Obviously you‚Äôre not paid to think.
August 2015 I bet we'd have Trump- Biden race with debates and everything.   Didn't know Obama promised the race to Clinton.    We were cheated.  Now Biden is no longer competitive.
2 cars in a parking lot,  one with a Biden sticker,  one with Trump.   Which one gets keyed?   It's a rhetorical question.
i think all videos of joe biden where done in 2015  becouse thy knew joe would not make it to 2020 election and to coverup that joe biden is dead thy cameup with fake pandamic covdit so no one would investgate it so thy kept the videos lockedup until election yer vote for deadman
If they talk, Trump will fire them. If they don‚Äôt, Biden will fire them.   Too late now, they‚Äôve made their beds.
Joe Biden and his cronies are nothing more than used car salesmen. They pander to what they think the buyers want to hear. Their spiels change with every audience. This should be a red flag to anyone with any sense. President Trump remains the same and has integrity. #MAGA2020
Biden can no longer think freely and those who love him should REALLY have a conservatorship placed on him. It‚Äôs not long before he can‚Äôt dress himself and will need to be fed with a straw.
I called that as soon as the debates were scheduled. Biden can‚Äôt free think any longer. He‚Äôs a full blown dementia patient and his VP pick is who the Dems want as President. Biden would be a drooling idiot on any debate stage. He will NEVER debate, let alone debate Trump.
Theatrical interpretation of Biden supporters?
I have yet to see any support for Biden in AZ either.
There isn't going to be a Biden-Trump debate, is there?  We're going to be cheated out of that, too.
Just plain old ‚ÄúCreepy Joe Biden ‚Äú!
Biden. Sanity over an insane dictator. This election is one that dem or republican shouldn‚Äôt matter.
Please tell your supporters that not voting for Biden is fatal. Trump will give them the opposite of what you stand for, and Biden will at the very least give them some of what you stand for..
All I know is Vindman should hold a cabinet position in Biden's administration
Anyone who has a child over 18 that asks you if Trump is going to ban Tik Tok, tell them only if they don't vote for Biden and any Democrat running for the senate
AND VOTE FOR BIDEN!
During Trump's term there has been more mass shootings, racial motivated murders, and mass deaths due to his failed response to this pandemic. Who do you think kills more people, or does more damage? Biden or Trump? You're out of your mind contributing to another 4 for Trump! üñï
Only people who are crying about raising taxes are the rich and big companies! Funny that jobs HAVE disappeared under your watch. Bush put America in a recession, Obama/Biden got us out! What a DUMBASS!
Moscow Mitch and the GOP must fund the Postal service NOW. We can change the law when Biden is in office and Dems. take over the Senate.
I'm so tired of all the opinions about who Biden should pick as VP. It's his decision! Never has any other presidential nominee had so much pressure to pick someone else's choice! Leave it be. Let him decide who's the best fit for him.
It‚Äôs the other way around... who is going to investigate Biden &amp; years worth of his quid pro quo &amp; dishonest dealings ???
Weekend at Biden‚Äôs
Because democrats don‚Äôt feel the need to jump Biden‚Äôs leg like trump supporters do for trump
He immediately turned it into a political fight. The total failure to lead in a time of crisis is on the entire Republican party! #VoteBlue2020 #VoteOutTheGOPCowards #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPBetrayedAmerica #Biden
(3)helps you. Sincerely a Biden supporter.
I called that the day they agreed to the debates. Biden is a drooling idiot or a full blown dementia patient, which is it?
They may be the same polls that have Biden in a double-digit lead over Trump. Fake polls.
Moms for Biden should have psychological evaluations to see if they are fit to be parents. In fact their kids are lucky to be alive and not aborted.
Joe Biden literally said the words, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I am.‚Äù  And this is the best the socialists have to offer you, people.
Seems to me that Biden already failed the vaccine test...#H1N1
Twisted Fisters
Amazing that Trump would use this racist tatic. Doesn't he know that Biden was in office for 8 yrs. as VP and nothing that Trump is saying happened. Doesn't he know this is the yr. 2020 NOT 1955?#SuburbsForBiden
Black mold and Biden
Ah, it‚Äôs all Trumps fault. Everything was great before Trump. I thought blacks were being killed by police under Obama? But no one including Biden did anything.
Biden just shot himself in the foot picking Harris!! She‚Äôll be his Palin...bye bye Joe
Even though he was it winning Biden just made President Trump‚Äôs victory a bigger landslide.
Are those Biden‚Äôs cue cards?
And now they have discovered the vents actually did worse damage...the Democrats don‚Äôt want a cure they need Biden in the basement till the election..üôÑ
Congrats on 100 Episodes, well done guys.  Welcome to the HHWhite side  and  , 1) Daryl doesn't eat Soul Food, 2) Biden made it official, and now 3) Virgil prefers Indian food. Man, you two have issues üòÇü§£üòÇü§£

Biden I can‚Äôt believe it we actually agree on something.Joe Biden is 'against God,' Trump says. God laughs hysterically
The left isn‚Äôt anti-racism unless it‚Äôs from the right.  They excuse it more than the right.  Biden says multiple times black people all think they same, Blackface Ralph and Jimmy, Biden assault claim, Biden criminal justice record, all get a pass from the Dems.
That is a Shame!  I live N Arizona &amp; i too fear that if i put a Biden sign in front of my house it may B vandalized or someone would come at night to do damage.  That's how bad it is in Arizona.  If i put a sticker on my car it may be keyed i fear.  The Republicans have no Shame!
Thank You TRUMP Every time you open your mouth it reaffirms my faith and dedication into  VOTING FOR BIDEN and RIDDING THE USA of YOU and YOUR PILE OF SHIT CORRUPT FAMILY ! You are seriously DERANGED , AND MENTALLY UNFIT TO DO ANYTHING ! FUCK YOU AND YOUR ADMINISTRATION TRUMP
Yesterday you said that if Biden was elected that he would hurt the Bible and would hurt God. First of all those are just insane Words, which is no surprise coming from you. And secondly Biden is more of a God-fearing man that you will ever be. Resign. Biden 2020
Reason enough not to vote for biden
Think! What the HELL does Biden bring to the table? He‚Äôs been in DC over 40 dam years, nothing to his name, done BUBKAS! Dementia -being ignored by the Media! He‚Äôs a shell being run as a puppet by others!

Who could possibly believe that Joe Biden doesn't believe in God or that Donald Trump does!
Bishop Stowe accuses Trump of being "anti-pro-life" but says nothing at all about Biden being pro-abortion that is even more anti-pro-life Democrat bias?

It's Joe Biden
sorry, disagree.  Biden has no content ... he stumbles .. sorry for you democrats... you could do better.
trump puts hiself and Russia fist. Biden puts America first. GOP have sold their souls to trump. Sad.

I agree, responding to Trump is like fodder to him. If Biden wants to speak about his faith, it should be on his terms.
Thank you for pointing this out.  There R too Many Republican Ads that R putting out Lies &amp; false claims.  They are super imposing voices from something onto an Ad &amp; it's Just a Lie!  I'm talking about the people not getting help from Police &amp; they have Joe Biden saying yes.

You see only what you want to see.  It's sad you choose not to see the entire country's citizens.    Biden has more supporters than you do, per most polls, and they aren't supporting a person that shows many symptoms of a sociopath/psychopath (see DSM-5).

Joe Biden did this, becuz he wants to end education as we know it. He will get rid of private schools &amp; make everyone go to public schools.
Well you go right ahead and believe your CNN propaganda. An while at it remember Biden been in DC for over 40 years and DONE NOTHING. Accomplished NOTHING. An currently he is a shill of his former self. He will be a puppet controlled by others. Unable to resist
Really?? Biden been in DC for over 40 years. He has done NOHTING and accomplished NOTHING. HE will be a puppet for the radical far left. Doing their bidding.  An well...sniffing girls...
Phony polling AGAIN.  Biden's been in DC for over 40 years. Doing exactly NOTHING. Accomplishing NOTHING.  What's he going to do as POTUS. NOTHING. HE will be a puppet, strings being pulled by others.
"She needs to smile more...." and so it begins.  Gender-fits all comments on Biden's running mate are already starting.  Doesn't matter who he picks, the greatest hits will apply.  Been hearing this $hit all my life.  We need leadership, not smiles.
Is it just me or is the comment I originally commented on for deleted? I'm sorry if it looks like I'm arguing with you, I swear I thought there was another comment about how biden didn't fight for religious freedom
I hope so, I look forward to Trump moppin the floor with Biden

Kamala Harris is gonna be Biden's vp mark my words
I would!  Especially Biden!
I love the kindness and restraint these guys had. She on the other hand will be voting for trump. This is how far our country has Tanked. We can heal with Biden!
I'm questioning that.  I'm not sure.  Joe Biden might choose someone that thinks more in his direction.  In fact that what he said more or less.  I could be wrong, but i know he wants someone who has many ideas that mesh with his.
Yes, they do and one trait should be Very capable of taking over for Joe Biden if necessary.
Read the article. Biden going to the "truth" teller. Trump not so much. LoL! Biden been in DC for his entire career and has accomplished ZERO. An NOW he is going to DO SOMETHING! Biden totally mixed up with Ukraine.  AN has lied all over about this. Won't go into the girls
How about this Kevin, Obama and Biden had placed scientist in Chinese Laboratories. Trump removed them prior to the pandemic. If Trump had not done that we would have had more known sooner.  It is not Pelosi &amp; Schiff or even China's fault, this is all on Trump and the GOP!

More lies from Cheetos puff wanna be dictator. "The left" supports all 3, the only difference is that Biden actually cares about America and Americans. Sit down, shut up, and resign.
We need to stand together against Trump. Unfortunately Americans at this time are alone together without leadership. We must stand strong against Trump. Biden 2020

I'll rethink my vote if he does "debate" him. I'm definitely voting for Biden if it kills me but the resulting incoherent trump word salad and tantrum is just an unnecessary waste of time and air space.
I will vote for Joe Biden if we never hear another peep out of him. Trump must go!
Maybe Mr Biden does not come on your shoe because you re a phony journalist? And he knows you interview people like Jason Miller. Who would want to be associated w/ people like that. By the way. Putin owns Trump. Did you know that?
I will assume Biden will choose a black woman as his running mate  The only question is which?  I bet he will choose Michelle Obama if she agrees
Folks are getting into some serious beefs here about Biden‚Äôs VP pick.Just muted someone I‚Äôve followed for a long time.Unnecessary vitriol causing divisiveness we don‚Äôt need!Biden is going to choose the VP based on many things.I doubt what Twitter randos think is one of them.

this guy and joe biden killed the metoo movement.  too many libs getting called out
Did your taxes drop? Did you get a COVID stimulus? At this point you could replace Biden with some Cabbage an no one would notice! What pray tell are the great thing the Dems going to do?
Just finished a  Zoom thing on veterans and military families with  and  and I just have to say that Senator Duckworth is absolutely delightful and a goddamn national treasure.
GDP dropped 33%. More trump "magic"? Vote vote vote, like your life depends on it...because more than ever it matters now. Biden 2020
Susan Rice is looking like  pick for VP.  Some analysts believe this is the smartest choice.  Via   #VoteBlueToSaveAmericaIn terms of actual words meaning something, advantage Biden.
This is the third time I'm going to tell you this because you Must've missed this too ...I am not supporting Biden. I hate it when people assume shit.  Don't you know how to ask questions ?
Did you miss it when I said I'm not in line to vote for Biden or Trump?
I have NEVER been accosted in my emails by the Biden campaign.  Ever. I didn't sign up to support EITHER of them. Also explain why someone would send my daughter a hand written postcard AFTER i sent off our applications to the registration office ? We live in a red state.
I'm not planning to vote for Biden but maybe you can tell me since you are a die hard Trump supporter why aftr I mailed off my daughters' and my mail in applications I started getting a mails from the Trump Administration offering me free accomodations to his rally for donations
When did Biden build projects?
If you had read the article instead of just the damned title ...  Also...I take issue with Biden saying "if you don't vote for me you ain't black" ... But you sit there talking about how Trump isn't a racist and people are making accusations against him up. Trump hates minorites
Is that what you believe about Biden saying he doesn't want his kids growing up in a jungle, or around blacks?
Yep Biden said that bullshit and Trump around the same time was in deep shit for discrimination against black renters.  He told someone that he'd never let a black count his money.  But you keep telling uneven stories.
Biden‚Äôs cogntitive state should be enough for people to realize he cant do it!
Ive already been banned! I made the same comment as someone else. Wanna know the difference? I support Trump and them Biden!
Biden said Arizona wasn‚Äôt diverse?    I‚Äôve lived here for five years and he is wrong.    Maybe the different attitude about immigration is really pertaining to drugs and human trafficking?
I‚Äôd just hate for Biden to lose your vote because you don‚Äôt like his potential pick.
Biden campaign needs an ad that scrolls through every horrendous thing he's done with its emotional toll on the public. Maybe it will need to be a documentary film?
I guess his new WH plywood wall doesn't cut it when staring down peaceful protestors. He'll need to inspect the bunker again.
Joe biden is god believing catholic your the one that goes golfing instead going to church on sundays everbody everything trump says about Biden and the democrates Is just the opposite trump is this way , he dont like blacks,Hispanics dont believe in the bible .
She‚Äôll complain about trump but it‚Äôs only because of how he treated her father, not his politics.   I think her mother has come out for Biden.
The ads are already on my nerves and  it‚Äôs only going to get worse. The trump ad with someone breaking into a house &amp; police message saying they aren‚Äôt coming is particularly offensive.  Biden has never called for defunding the police.
Trump is buying the election. His handlers want to continue Koch's plan. Their goal is to destroy our democracy. Absolute power &amp; the riches it confers by rewriting our constitution into a #TheocraticKleptocracy  of rigid Christianity &amp; oligarchical rule.
This is simply Biden's stereotype of blacks that vote for him-victims, helpless, dependent, hooked on drugs, needing liberals to save them. If you don't vote for him you're not his stereotype of black. Disgusting racism from the racist party. This is not true of black Americans
The thought of a Biden presidency is terrifying

They are such fools if they think this will sway anyone already voting for Biden.
Nope. It's Biden's stereotype of blacks that vote for him.
Biden asked the black reporter if he had been tested for cocaine. Joe's stereotype of blacks that vote for him
Philosophically, I would be open to a viable 3rd party candidate. Realistically, a trump win could mean the end of everything you've been talking about. Biden wasn't my first choice, nor 2nd or 3rd. But if he loses, trump wins. That's reality.
If you see a moral equivalence between voting for trump and voting for Biden, then there's no point in any further discussion. If trump wins, it'll be because of people that think like you. And then it won't matter. Have a good day
I love Elizabeth Warren, but I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed. I can see her as Sec of the Treasury, or Biden's economic advisor. VP will most likely be Harris or Rice. They check off more boxes, and both are eminently qualified. As long as we all #VOTE for Biden, we're safe
Too many believed the polls in '16 and didn't vote. That can't happen this time. GET OUT AND VOTE LIKE BIDEN'S DOWN BY 2 IN EVERY POLL
How bout this? We're stuck with an asshole that has filled his admin with people dedicated to destroying the dept's they run Biden, if he is declining (he isn't), will be surrounded by people who know what they're doing A vote for anyone but Biden, or no vote, is a vote for trump
Wait, according to Biden they're not black. False advertising!
The media should treat these for what they are: campaign rallies. Don't ask questions, just let Fat Donny talk, then cut away. And give free, equal time to Joe Biden.
You are on fire! You are right on the money with Trump. Please continue to urge your younger followers to vote Biden.
Sandra Smith on Fox News does not do her homework she repeats socialist Democrat talking points she's a never Trumper Fox News is changing their not being fair and balanced anymore she confronts Trump supporters and she doesn't confront creepy Joe Biden supporters
American people see exactly who Joe Biden is and what he stands for
You don't fit Joe Biden's stereotype of blacks so you are not really black but something inferior. I don't agree the white liberal's stereotype of blacks so I am a racist with "privilege" cursing through my veins. We both get called names and we both get canceled. If we let them
If Biden is elected I don't think his tweets will be what we're worried about
There shouldn't be debates with Trump. He will lie, bully &amp; rely on blatantly racist remarks. There is no upside for Biden.
if Biden cant talk clearly or even make sense why do we think he can be president?   #trump2020 #MAGA #trumptrain
'24...Cotton vs. Hawley vs. Pence vs. Haley...vs. Biden/Harris, or just Harris
Right. But Biden's comment "you're not black" and the idea of "white Privilege" to me show a disdain for and superiority over blacks, independent of experience. They must come from deep rooted racial beliefs Democrats have always held
Mr biden is there a law on who could CV run for president this is about you but why is there a law on who can run for president so we dont ever ever get another trump for president I want to start this please CV reply
Wonder why we don't see videos like this from the Biden camp? Oh, that's right - he doesn't leave his basement or stays in his hometown...
Wait, Biden said it would be a woman of color? So if someone is not the right gender or the right race they are not considered. Isn't that racist and sexist? Isn't that what the liberals have supposedly been fighting against? Is this total hypocrisy or what?
I'll assume the veep pick will be fine..after that if Biden holds his own during the debates and comes out with sizable state and national leads the exodus would happen in October..the October surprise I hope
You are not black the way the democrats see blacks-dependent, incapable of succeeding on their own because of systemic racism, victims of evil white men. That's what Biden meant. No, you don't fit that description. You are the heretic
Biden would sniff it before opening.
That makes sense since Biden says you're not even black
Because according to Biden you're no longer black"A force of nature" Shit all Biden has to do to win the debate is stay silent.
I support Trump over Biden. When Trump loses you and the threepers will be back on the side of the Libertarians,  just like when Obomber was President.

Understandable, but please consider this... Every 3rd party or write-in is taking 1 vote is helping trump stay in office. Protest votes are a big part of the reason trump got elected in the 1st place. Please, vote Biden, don't help trump.  Thanks.
If the election were held today, I think the Senate would be 50-50, with Biden's VP as the tiebreaker. That gives democrats a majority but it would be incredibly difficult to get anything done.   #2020election

It will be fun watching media (and the blue check-mark army) be-clown itself to cover for Biden.
Biden's thinking in a nutshell.
I really don't want to.....but I've spoken to enough brainwashed dems...to know that he's gonna get like 75% of the dem vote.....no matter what I do , yell, protest.  So I'm gonna vote green....to help that party in 2024.  The only thoughtful vote left to me. Biden is more trump
S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
I completely agree. Let's do our best to ensure that scrutiny of Biden's female VP pick doesn't become sexist.
WaPo has ignored Karen Attiah‚Äôs racist comments about white people so I‚Äôm not surprised y‚Äôall continue to ignore Joe Biden‚Äôs racist come#ments against blacks people. Why is WaPo condoning racism?

Biden weighs in on trump &amp; Ducey and #coronavirus in Arizona. Definitely shows Democrats increasing confidence of their chances and pushes Trump to defend.
And if Biden loses the White vote (like all Democratic candidates since 1976) and "only" gets 51% of the Black vote, White pundits will blame Black voters because those pundits favor the status quo over liberty and justice for all.

And I say he can be a Catholic just fine without having to agree with everything his church has ever felt. I‚Äôm pretty sure no one (including the popes) could ever have been a Catholic under these standards. Which is the #1 reason your entire hit on Biden is just so dumb.
You sure make a lot of assumptions about Biden and his church. Again, I‚Äôd love you kind of inside info. Everything is a political football and they are mostly all dumb. This one is particularity stupid.

This has been a mess in so many ways. Biden‚Äôs first mistake was to make his VP pick all about identity politics. I understand the reasoning for it but I still think it was a bad idea and out there for too long. The process has only gotten worse the longer it has gone on.

Biden is a hypocrite. Says he‚Äôs a Catholic but has gone even farther left concerning abortion. Biden has also been refused communion.
Democracy evolves.  But it sure shouldn‚Äôt move backwards.  If you think Biden won‚Äôt do as much in the area of rights for all groups, you have your head in a dark crevice somewhere.  That‚Äôs as romantic as I‚Äôd ever get with you.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS OUT, Mr. Biden. Ducey is killing Arizonans left and right and he only cares about pleasing the idiot in the Oval.
You have a serve and retirement economy that is unable to or afraid to go back to work. To your credit, you listen to Biden and asked AZ to wear masks and ramped up testing. Who hold a rally at a AZ mega church and  encouraged traveling on the 4th. That‚Äôs what caused a spike.
Joe Biden: ‚ÄòUnlike the African American Community ‚Ä¶ the Latino Community Is an Incredibly Diverse Community‚Äô (VIDEO)
For all you pointing out that this tweet is pointless.   That's the point.   What's the point of this public exchange?: Politics.   Obvious: Biden was VP for an entire country. Ducey is governor of AZ. Biden has more followers. And, has been around in politics a lot longer.
Biden owning up to a mistake places him light years ahead of his opponent.
There is no way having Joe Biden in the White House wouldn‚Äôt be better for anyone who is of color.  You sit on your ass on Election Day, and should Trump win, enjoy watching him tear up what is left of the Bill of Rights.

If Biden wins, so many people will just shut right back down and go back to sleep. Putting off any sort of hope for change for another 8-12 years and cementing neoliberalism in the Democratic Party for another decade at least.
2/ Biden will fill his cabinet, judge appointments, key positions with women and men who reflect the diversity of this nation. Not a bunch of old white men and millionaires and billionaires. People who know what it‚Äôs like for struggling families. So let‚Äôs PLEASE support the VP.
Still waiting, if anybody has a criminal record they are barred from serving...but since Biden won‚Äôt announce who will run the country if he wins, I don‚Äôt expect a speedy reply from you...enjoy

Biden should be praising Arizona's progress, not rooting for our state to fail. Glad to see Governor  calling him out for it!
I so hope North Carolina turns blue. Hopefully Biden and Democrats have better ads.
All of the things leading up to this are his fault.  Even Biden, last October, posted a tweet about how foolish it was for Trump to eliminate the pandemic response team because Obama bad.
uhoh.  Clyburn trying to take out  .  hope hes thought this through well.  his voice is very significant this cycle.  not sure she should be knee capped by him.  let Biden decide from top candidates.   seems call.  but dont force...
when Obama won you could feel the hype and love. That's what you need to win. Trump got a lot of that right now. there's no Joe excitement or hype. No bumper stickers, no lawn signs, no crowds cheering on the streets, no side organizations like "black voices for Trump". Biden L
I heard #MichelleObama  will be Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate!  That‚Äôs why the wait. I‚Äôd love to see Trump get smart mouthed with her. LOL.
Margaret, you just need to get over his personality and look at everything that he has accomplished the last 3 1/2 years. If you truly were a conservative Republican, then I don‚Äôt believe you could remotely even think about voting for Biden
in case anybody‚Äôs following the biden vs. ducey discourse about covid in az, things are still bad here. people don‚Äôt get test results for 2 weeks, and the main reason for slight improvement is that the mayors were finally allowed to mandate masks, which ducey blocked for months.
So... basically you are wavering between a vote for Biden and a vote for trump?  Bernie would say you suck...
Because Biden could rape a dead cow on 5th Avenue and I will still vote against you.
That's why Biden needs a woman of color for a running mate, to sort of balance out his deeply rooted bigotry.

The Dems have botched every aspect of the election AND the Covid economic recovery.   If Trump wasn‚Äôt record-setting incompetent they would be getting trounced.   Biden represents a Clinton/Obama fifth term ‚Äî but, that‚Äôs far from what most people want (or need).
Joe Biden is a "devout Catholic" who supports the killing human beings in the womb.  There, I fixed it for you.
Joe Biden has a communist platform your not Republican.
I like Harris and hope he picks her not Rice. Rice's connections with Benghazi is a PR disaster and a field day for the Republicans. It could cost Biden the election.
Proud to be a signer of this.  No other VP candidate has Bass's breadth of support across the Party. Joe Biden &amp; all who want to unify Dems should take that to heart.  You can still add your name as a delegate or DNC member to support #BassForUnityVP:

Biden hits a nerve and Ducey, sadly, gets down to Trumps level. Man he just keeps being more and more disappointing.  What if you just, ya know, admit we opened too fast and people died because of it.
they're both at least partly full of crap, though biden's criticism would be spot on if it were levied a month ago
I live in AZ and Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Testing has never been readily available and contact tracing doesn‚Äôt exist. But there‚Äôs more: if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have a test, it take sup to 2 weeks for the results. ONE lab     Processes results!

Thanks, Vice Pres. Biden: you are absolutely accurate. I almost choked on my coffee when Ducey was praised...role model my ass! And by the way, last I checked, the Navajo people wouldn‚Äôt be giving any governor gold star awards either.
v.  Twitter battle:  Biden wins !!!!!!
Yes, but Joe Biden blew me away when he was VP &amp; was asked if he supports abortion &amp; same sex marriage &amp; he said yes, even tho it‚Äôs against his church. That doesn‚Äôt sound very ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù or ‚Äúdevout‚Äù to me. Sounds more worldly. Against the church doctrine. Political, not godly.
Joe Biden flubs his intentions again.
Doug went to brown-nose Trump and now he's mad that Biden mentions how incorrect they were to act like Arizona is doing fine? Lapdog Doug failed Arizona!
I have to laugh at the ads Donald has about  Joe Biden. True to trumps nature they make for really good stand up comedy. Maybe after he loses the election he can work for SNL as a straight man.
Listen to me when I say that #team obama is a nothing burger. We all know that biden and Obama are on the same page.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a shadow third term. But if there were, George H W Bush and George W Bush would be the most guilty of it
The whole Phoenix metro area has become more centrist. Biden will win the City of Phoenix, Tempe as well as Tucson and Flagstaff. Trump will win rural areas and most of the Phoenix suburbs. AZ has a great chance of going blue.

Governor Ducey and Joe Biden are arguing on Twitter this morning.   LISTEN:
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Yup, trump found innocent every time, Biden should be in court and maybe will be soon thanks to Ukraine charging him, we have to see I guess..
For sure! That is why I have so much fear! The fat poopy bastard in the WH isn‚Äôt going to say ‚ÄúThank you for allowing me to be your president for 4 years. I wish Joe Biden every succes.‚Äù and then leave quietly. Not gonna happen
Do you know anything about hunter Biden... the apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the Biden scumbag tree
Hey, Hey whataya say?  Let's give Trump a bad day!  Hey, Hey whataya gonna do? Vote for Biden, make Trump stew

Is this your way of making me believe the fear? If Biden &amp; Trump both tell me it's raining while the skies are clear, I'm still not going to believe it. #IndependentThinker #Rimmer
From what my Soros Antifa Thug Newsletter said, Biden is going to hide the identity of his VP for the duration of his term kinda like Masked Singer. That way we can continue the FDR presidency that HAS NEVER ENDED!
Hopefully you'll win Mr. Biden.
Joe Biden is a racist! His words yesterday:  ‚ÄúUnlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."

It's been a bad week for Biden: Biden canceled the Wis convention.  Biden was massively outraised by Trump.  Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline was publicly questioned.  Biden made a racist comment.  Biden made another racist comment.  Biden was forced to apologize for racist comments
Give the biden thing a rest, Kristen!  If I didn't know better I would think she was reporting for Fox.
I mean, I‚Äôm a statistician, I know how the numbers work. What Ducey is saying is a boldfaced lie just as much as what Biden is saying is. We have improved but we are so far from out of the woods here.
Now is not the time to be tripping over your own feet Biden.  We can‚Äôt have that right now.  Don‚Äôt give any fuel to any possibility for trump to get re-elected.
The vulture circling his prey....Biden.
Joe Biden basically said that all black people think alike, and the media did not report on it at all until after he tried to 'walk back' his comments some time later.  And the media reports read like defenses of Biden.  Imagine what would have happened if Trump had said that.

Predictable and transparent. Biden citing outdated numbers because the current trends don‚Äôt help him politically. Improvement in AZ is a detriment to Biden‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî simple as that.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'.
Is that the sound Biden makes when sniffing little girl‚Äôs hair?  Pshaw?
Joe Biden just said the most racist thing a presidential candidate has ever said in the era of modern elections.  How does it make you feel that none of the big news organizations are covering it at all?
Unlike African Americans, Latinos are incredibly diverse with incredibly different attitudes about different things.‚Äù  -Joe Biden
Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities   keep talking Joe  you numbers look worse everyday Great job !
Ducey and Biden yelling stats at each other. Ducey using the good stats, Biden using the bad ones. Only one that looks wrong to me is when Biden said AZ still has nearly 20% positive rate. Yesterday was 14% PCR positive rate.
79 new COVID-19 deaths are being reported today in Arizona for a total of 4,081 known deaths.  And Ducey and Biden are in a Twitter feud.  Good morning, Arizona.
why am i not surprised he‚Äôs a biden supporter but anyways this is soo cool!!
So, hi, Arizona resident here. You shouldn‚Äôt be bragging about anything. You‚Äôre doing everything Biden just mentioned. One of my friends had to take 3 Covid tests before it came back positive. You‚Äôre such a joke.
That‚Äôs not Biden tweeting.
How many times in a week does Joe Biden have to mention Obama?

Donald Trump mispronounces Thailand and Yosemite and it‚Äôs wall to wall coverage about his incompetence. Joe Biden literally can‚Äôt speak full sentences, is gaffing every time he‚Äôs in public, making clearly racist comments, &amp; the media covers it for about 52 seconds.
Your father is doing a wonderful job. At this rate if your dad keeps talking Biden could win this election taking a nap.
Just pointing out the truth. On 7/23 Brigette Gabriel posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo moment by voting for Trump. On 7/26 Lori Hendry posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo movement by voting for Trump.   Joe Biden would be proud of Lori‚Äôs plagerism.

Yes Biden does. Democrats don't want to say it.   And Trump does Not have dementia
How many would have died from corona with Biden as president? Do tell.
I don't understand anyone who will vote for Biden, Republican or not.
Literally anything is safer than Donald Trump. And Biden is about as center as they come.
He was particularly droll last night.
Woke up hoping today is the day we learn Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Then immediately worrying about how cruelly this woman will be attacked. And a second later realizing there‚Äôs no need to worry, she‚Äôs already a BOSS. Let‚Äôs GO!
I‚Äôm Joe Message and I approve this Biden.
Biden is not going to be President Captain!

Yes along with Obama, Biden and Hillary.

Thank you Mr. Biden... you nailed it. Also, Ducey is ok with opening schools with an unsafe 7% positivity.

I think Americans choosing both Trump and Biden as their respective ‚Äúleaders‚Äù puts the fantasy of wyt supremacy to bed for good.   If that‚Äôs your best, well, I don‚Äôt even need to continue...  Supremacy, lmbo. #Trump #Biden #MAGA #Supremacy
Who watches  or MSNBC. Is it okay she will  not ask Biden a real question? Does anyone doubt what it takes to work for this outlet? Fake news is helping Trump get reelected.
Thank you. Biden said we all think the same which is bs. Never vote blue

The Democrats in the far left movement including Biden I'm sorry I meant puppet think they have the upper hand. Not so conservatives are the silent majority no calls to Riot don't burn buildings businesses. Just watch will turn out at election time and Trump will win a landslide.
Yay Biden's "Tim Kaine" moment, Susan Rice would be a gift to the right. It was rough today for Biden supporters. Yelling at a reporter asking him if he was a junkie, flip flopping on the cognitive test thing, having to backpedal from saying African Americans aren't diverse ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúAnd Biden isn‚Äôt ‚Äúis the kind of answer you get when you can‚Äôt defend Trump.   Donald John Trump is the worst human being ever to be born in the history of the United States. A lifetime career criminal who became President of the United States.

biden is bread in a dishwasher.
Agree. I have been a Biden fan since day 1. He's the only one who could build the kind of coalitions you are talking about. And, he has the right resume as well as being a very decent person. He can run our country. The best and brightest Dems will surround him. #Biden2020
Laughing is not worth engaging. What she fails to realize is others are Laughing ignorance. As a female SS agent, requesting reassignment is unfair and bad for her career. The onus for decency was on biden to wear a swimsuit. No brainer. Geez.
While I may like Biden's numbers, this map has problems. States like Oregon and Connecticut shouldn't have the same rating as North Carolina and Florida. What is that based off of? Overall, it's too optimistic for Biden at this point in the race.
You ever get the sense that Obama is parading out incompetent Biden is to hand the election to Trump so that he isn‚Äôt prosecuted for his crimes????
Haven't seen many of any, from either party. I have seen some Trump stickers, but definitely none for Biden.
I never thought I would say this.  I actually feel kind of sorry for Kim Kardashian.  She has 4 kids, and their Bipolar father is manic and being widely exploited by the GOP, along with various media organizations (including Forbes!)
This clown has to go, racist Joe Biden, you have plundered your whole personal life as well.
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic.  Donald Trump held the Bible upside down at a photo op in front of a church after using his secret police to clear away peaceful protesters.  These are the words of a fascist, and he's hoping that you've drunk enough racist Kool-Aid to believe him.
Joe Biden has also publicly said the N word, made racist jokes towards Indians, said you ain‚Äôt black if u vote for trump, he touches and smells little kids, and he said the black community isn‚Äôt diverse. I could keep going but I don‚Äôt have room.
Joe Biden has been unfit for elected office since the beginning of his career. That‚Äôs why the mob selected him to be a Delaware senator in 1972. They found him an easy tool to manipulate.
Joe Biden picking a host of black women for his running mate for office.  Michelle Obama heard the call? ü§£üòÇ.   Remember? Black lives matter!  ü§£.  Joe Biden can't remember what his wife's name is .
Didn‚Äôt know this was English class.. You support Biden? How about you pay attention to the errors he makes when he talks
So with that logic you don‚Äôt listen to what Joe Biden says out of his mouth... dude can‚Äôt spit out a sentence correctly without stuttering
Difference is Obama and VP Biden send a lot of jobs to China Trump brought them back
I need people to actually vote for Biden... if you for Kanye, you might as well just vote for Trump.
Keep religion out of the damn debates, the presidency isn't a religious title and shouldn't be treated as such. If journalists want to press Trump and Biden on their religious views, fine, but not in the debates for presidency.
Just like what happened when Obama was President and Biden was VP?  Laughable. No one wants your guns. He‚Äôs playing you and your money is getting stolen by the NRA. Keep your guns. We don‚Äôt care. Love, A Democrat.
So it starts.... #Biden2020 #biden #Biden2020Landslide #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020 #Trump #MailInVoterFraud #GoJoe2020
Can I jump on this bandwagon too‚ÄùI want to vote for Biden, it will come down to his Secretary of HUD pick, and if satisfied it will come down to his Interior pick‚Äù
Just make sure Trump should set the agenda.  Its not like Biden has the upper hand in debates.  Dont let Trump wuss out by giving in into the leftist demand.  You should be moderator otherwise no debate.
This is very gracious. We need more of that in civic life today.  It was also important that Mr. Biden  clarified his remarks.
Trying to peg  Biden with a nickname might not be the recipe for success.
We are prone to fight the last war. Does it feel like  , trump campaign are running in 2016 against Hillary. 2020 is obviously quite different. Biden has challenges but his negatives are nowhere near Clinton‚Äôs. Trump now has a record and #COVID__19 to defend.
It means there are a good number of people voting because of dislike instead of looking at facts. They simply hate trump or Biden. It is pretty sad when candidates with a 40 year record of racism are the ally of black lives matter. Stop and think about it.
As Joe Biden one question about the current White House operations and he'll sit there quietly for half an hour trying to figure out an intelligent approach to the answer .
You don‚Äôt have to like Trump. But he‚Äôs done a pretty dang good job considering all the adversity. He gave up a billionaire lifestyle to serve and he‚Äôs not a communist like Biden‚Äôs puppet master.
What would you think of Trump if he said the things Biden has?#TrumpIsLosing
From CNN's archives and it's not fake news. I'm a member of the Democratic party.  Just one who believes in telling the truth. Lying about what happened won't change anything.
Disqualifying comments from Biden today. #JoeBidenIsARacist
That campaign is in autopilot bro Biden gets to leave the basement a couple hours here and there back at home by 16:00 with his slippers on and a brandy lol
In the end, people thought they had a voice and it was obviously, ineptly, and callously taken away from them by typical backroom politics. People are angry, our country is on fire, and neither candidate wants to stand up for what's right. So don't vote shame. Biden isn't the key
People want to know that their voice is heard, they want their representatives to REPRESENT them, and all Biden can do is cozy up to corporations and offer milquetoast platitudes about how things will be better. The DNC would rather have trump than Bernie and they torpedoed him.
It‚Äôs funny how Biden can be so articulate in a Tweet but barely put a sentence together during an interview ü§î
Honestly doubt Biden himself even knows this tweet exists lmfao
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."¬†...   Biden said it, whether you accept it or not. It's truth, it killed his 2008 campaign.
Gravitas: Joe Biden: Good or Bad for India?  via
Nope. But it will be painful til them. I'm seeing a thousand percent increase in annoying unskippable ads on YouTube that are just attacking Biden for everything from mass murder to insanity. Very annoying.
People want M4A, people want real systemic change in law enforcement, people want the government to take COVID-19 seriously and start paying people to stay home like Europe and Canada did, and Biden won't do any of that. Is he better that trump? Of course, but that's a low bar.
There you go with the assumptions again. Despite everything wrong that you just said, you still insist that people are what you want them to be so your point "looks" better. Biden and Trump are both terrible. Biden refuses to make any concessions that would lead to real change.

It's all fine and dandy. But remember there are 3 months to go which is a lifetime in politics.Polls and battleground maps don't vote. Think Biden in 10 points behind and work accordingly.
Sick of the Biden thing.  He has hidden in the basement because He has had plastic surgery.  Have you noticed his old photos in comparison to the new ones?  No under eye wrinkles, and no howls now.  Maybe they have him T cell therapy so he could have better brain function.

Pelosi has been on the record denoucing Antifa violence in the past and there's not one Dem who has praised them. But you missed my original point. Biden is not against God or guns. That's a stupid thing to say.
Biden already made a gaff and stupidly stuck his foot in his mouth.  # If you ain't black ?  You don't deserve to vote?  "  the asswit isn't very subject savvy in conversation.
‚ÄòA lying draft dodger‚Äô: Republican military veterans slam Trump and declare their support for Biden in new attack ad ‚Äì Raw Story
So now Trump is a prophet? Or perhaps he is referring to himself as God and knows Biden will definitely investigate the hell out of him when he wins.
Somebody has to lol  Nobody understands what the fuck Biden is saying lol you speak gibberish and making up what you are hearing Lololol
the Biden Taj Mahal
That was Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden that cozied up to Robert Byrd! Get your facts straight!!!
Every time Joe Biden leaves the safety of his basement:
My gosh, this is ridiculous. Biden is going to have to spend the first few years to sanitize and scrub the presidency from the stain and destruction that you left behind. You are so desperate!
Welcome! We appreciate the help and look forward to electing Mark Kelly and Joe Biden.
See that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna make this VP selection so interesting cause obviously they can‚Äôt hit Biden with anything so far so they will def shift strategy to hit his VP, even more if she is a black women their is about to be a whole another level of disrespect we‚Äôre gonna see soon.
What you are saying, you agree with Joe Biden. ‚ÄúLatino‚Äôs are More Diversified Than Aferican Americans,‚Äù is this true?
Liberal Democrats: the real racists.  They call us racists in hopes that it will stick- but then Biden goes and reveals where they really stand on the matter.  Grab your popcorn, it‚Äôs getting good!
Dumpf is trying to inflame the people of the Bible belt against Biden. But they need to ask dumpf what he knows? Chapter and verse!!! Like John 3: 16!
1. Because he whipped their asses at the ballot box. 2. He's beating Trump in nearly every swing state. 3. If you say that's all he has to offer, you're not doing your homework. Start with Biden's website on the issues.
Why are democrats always putting down black people Biden is on a roll this week! Hypocrisy
jagoff gop hacks talk big game,fox interv Biden wife, they don‚Äôt hammer her.dems attack Barr like sharks,do nothing  don‚Äôt ask shit,Microsoft Amazon gets asked nothing.they don‚Äôt bring clinton foundation. it‚Äôs fukd 2 apease us,
For president they have Trump+9 in KY (50-41), Trump+5 in SC (47-42), and Biden+15 in ME (52-37).
Not word for word but certainly implied.  Biden has never been a friend to Black Folks. Nor have Democrats for that matter.

If Biden reaches office, we still have to hold that mf accountable. I get everybody being stressed about the Trump presidency. The Presidencey is an inheritlety evil position because it‚Äôs an illusion provided by oligarchs to hide their special interests.
Great interview with the intelligent, articulate, and kind Dr Jill Biden on PBS. A beautiful person who cares about people.
strange how some parents might have thought sick Biden was giving a compliment to their daughter?   When someone uses the word 'horny'...  it means sexual. Parents must guard their young children. KAG KAG KAG so glad the hot mic picked up the conversation.
If he picks Harris, I would consider voting for Trump over him. If it‚Äôs Rice, I could maybe vote Biden but I will likely go with Jorgensen.
You must know Biden is not able to say or do any of this. It has OBamas hands all over it b
Great clip from AZ Teacher of the Year. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to uphold and support Public Educ. Equal opportunities for ALL students. #Biden2020
Well.. this will be the first time he will be wrong in a long time. No one wants Biden in anything, dude is literally off his rocker.
biden is bread in a dishwasher.
That‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôm grateful Biden has never been credibly accused of such things. But your bullshit insinuation is boring.
Is there anyone who ACTUALLY believes the polls showing Biden leading?  The guy pulls less than 50 people on his live videos. Who are you voting for?
Did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same?
That's definitely not true if you actually watch the entire unedited video. Biden's clips, even with softball questions, are far worse!
Watch  broadcast: "Biden Racism, DNC Secret Weapon? Jobs Report, ObamaGate and more!" w/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
This organization needs to be destroyed!    BUT  This announcement would be better in Dec.     Trump has a new message for all his cult members,  look for his polls to go up :(    Good intentions but made the race harder for Biden.   Trump will be the protector of the guns.
Also why are you giving people like me false hope? This makes me to now want to vote for Biden more.
Hey, Junior, reporting this ad as misleading because it includes photoshopped elements designed to make Biden look bad.
Excellent!! Excellent!! Excellent!!  If America doesn‚Äôt prosecute Donald Trump to the full extent of the law, they shouldn‚Äôt prosecute anybody.   I love Joe Biden!!
biden is a pedophile and rapist. In this public record C-SPAN footage biden brazenly pinches this little girl‚Äôs nipple. And he raped Tara Reade. #ibelievetarareade #metoo #lyinbiden #BlueMAGA

Trump's failing culture wars
LOL! Your comments are absurd and false. DYK biden dropped out of his presidential run bc he was outed for lying, yet again. His history is filled with lies if you actually cared to look. You are revealing how misinformed you are.
here is said ad apparently Biden is taking the go for head thanos advise
#Biden just put up a new ad running here locally here in az where a women and her family are talking about her grandma dying of covid and her calling #Trump out his name for downplaying the threat and it‚Äôs very clear Biden fittin to go for the jugular with these ads üò±
He is slipping and no one in the media wants to admit it!  Sarah Sanders: If Biden can't handle basic questions, how can he handle being president?
Lmfao Does this policy include Biden sniffing little girls???
People can‚Äôt handle the truth about Harris. She will backstab Biden the first chance she gets.  Biden needs to stay far far away.  And if you want to block me because of this, cool, bye.  Biden is going to be great as long as he stays far away from Harris!
True. He should have been running ads about the China flights while running Biden opposing it. He should have been running ads with dem governors praising him how ventilators and Newsom saying he got what he needed while Biden criticizing. Time lost he will never get back
Come on you know this guy Biden has lost his marbles . I know you hate the President but how could you want a man like that for President, you are a patriot and know we need a leader not a puppet who won‚Äôt come out of his house .
Should bother everyone that Biden is just a ploy
I am worried what they will do next. Don't trust them. Biden won't make it to the end. They will have hold him and guide him around, like a lost dog. It is sad though.
And Biden wants less cops/ no cops at schools!! Wake up !! How will that save the children?
Live look . #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #HidinBiden #ChinaJoeBiden
Wow! An entire family that‚Äôs corrupt as hell! Biden‚Äôs need heavy investigation.
Wow Bill you have LOW standards and dangerous intentions. YOU have accepted dementia in the person interviewing for the most important job in the free world?  It‚Äôs ok. We will protect you from yourselves! We will send Beijing Biden back to work in November. Not where you think!
Unlike you, Obama and Biden don't see the FBI or the Justice Dept as political levers. Nothing was done at their direction, which is a claim you would be really struggling to make for yourself at this point.
Beijing Biden is a Trojan horse &amp; we all know this!!
WATCH: CNN fact checker shows how Trump campaign ‚Äòegregiously altered‚Äô Biden photos in new ad
Has anyone checked when Biden filmed his video??
Yeah I‚ÄôM sick... sick of tranny‚Äôs and child molesters... I‚Äôm really not sure on Michelle Obama but the videos of Biden around children are disturbing you should check them out YOU‚ÄôRE sick if that doesn‚Äôt bother you
You being jealous that Biden has a Corvette. What‚Äôs wrong with admiring an American classic?
Biden wants to eliminate all tariffs against China defund police departments as crime is rapidly growing in major cities. China is not our friend Joe they're Communists seeking to destroy the USA. Stop the building of the wall? You've lost all common sense if you've ever had any.
I'm still disappointed that the presidential election has come down to two men with the cognitive capacity of week-after-Halloween Jack O'Lanterns. That said, Biden building a strong coalition and not being a white supremacist makes him the vastly superior moldy pumpkin.
As the Democrats continue to trip on their own shoelaces polls show Trump gaining momentum. No surprise there. As Biden stays in the basement Trump is working for Law and Order the basics of free Society. Without it we all decay into a free-for-all violence crime will escalate.
Hope they get the Biden‚Äôs and Obama too!
You mean the concentration camps that were literally a part of the 8 year Obama/Biden legacy of family separation and immigrant detainment? What exactly is your point here? Did you think this just didn‚Äôt happen under the deporter in chief Obama?
luckily Biden will declare victory too.
Says the Biden Staffer who tweeted this since   can't do it himself unlike President Trump can!  Blah Bah Blah...
I think both of them would be a good pick, my only qualms are that with Rice she has the stupid "tarmac" baggage, which even though it's bullshit, could stick... and Harris was a cop.  But I would trust either of them to take over after Biden.
I watch everything Trump says. You should do the same for Biden.
#LincolnVoter Lifetime Republican.  First vote for Eisenhower.  Former precinct captain. Signed pictures from every Republican President. Certificate of Appreciation from CREEP.  Trump has destroyed my beloved country!  Vote Biden.

May want to look up how 0bama &amp; Biden handled swine flu H1N1 virus outbreak. Just saying. At 60M infected, stop testing.
There is no bottom. The tRump campaign has nothing positive to say about their own candidate so they lie about VP Biden (soon to be President Biden).
That is such a great point I happen to think Michelle Obama is going to fly in and save the day. Run for Pres. - Biden is just holding the spot. Michelle won‚Äôt check in until right before the election because she doesn‚Äôt want to have to campaign. Nomination without any effort
There really isn‚Äôt much you can say about her except that she fits right in. Liars all around.  #SaveUSPS #Biden
So? It's a really stupid point. Honestly who cares if Biden shows his face when Trump is hanging himself. And, you know, is Trump.
At this point, I hope Biden loses, and I‚Äôm not ashamed of that. If the DNC gets away with rigging their primaries and shunning any and all quasi-progressive policy positions when things are THIS bad, fuck em. Let them lose. The blood is on their hands, not ours.
Good article which confirms, once again, that trump lies and slanders. He will cheat and play dirty at any time. He doesn't follow rules, or tell the truth, and thinks he is above the law. Fact check him all day and it's lie after lie.
I am not voting for Joe Biden
Joe Biden says build America back better?  Quit turning jobs over to foreign countries and investors.
I think that if Joe Biden becomes president, he should appoint Governor Andrew Cuomo to be the coronavirus czar. The numbers in the state of New York prove that he knows what he‚Äôs doing.
Do your job and respond to me, your constituent that Biden. Seriously Travis, I hope we vote you out. You are the problem of why government is broken.

Do you honestly think you can compare the two?  Be honest with yourself. Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but biden is seriously lost/ old/ demented/senile.  You don‚Äôt see that?!  He can not run anything.
But she doesn't. She bangs against Biden and Harris.  OK wait.  We have a 240 year trainwreck in the WhiteHouse right now.  Don't bang on Biden NOW.  You want to influence VP?  K.  Whom do you support?  Be POSITIVE.  Bang on Harris and Biden?  Why?  Yeah, she's in a "SAFE" dist.
Like Biden was my last choice, but he's the only true democratic choice, so I'm holding my nose and voting for my neighbors who cannot take another four years of this nonsense. I'm voting for him and then demanding he not make me regret it in 2024.
I‚Äôm not wasting any more of my time. When Biden wins on Election Day and raises taxes I want you to remember something. We voted for it, and we want it. We are done here, not wasting anymore of my time on you.
You just don't seem very bright. 1) These ads are for those who haven't chosen their candidate 2) You obviously have not been paying to anything Trump and the Trump campaign has been mocking Biden about. It's this. This is just clear lying with non-existent photos to make a point
Mark Kelly has nothing to gain by accepting her debate challenge. She's already toast and she knows it. No candidate initiates 7 debates unless they're in desperation mode. Trump tried the same trick on Biden and the Biden campaign didn't take the bait.

Nah, Biden doesn't sin, trump on the other hand...never stops!
If this isn't proof that the Kanye West candidacy was manufactured and aided by the Trump campaign to siphon off black voters from the Biden campaign, this tweet reinforces it. Trump is prepared to exploit anything to reduce prospective Biden voters. Don't fall for Trump's dirt.
He's making sure he leaves it as bad as possible so they can blame Biden next year.

How do you reconcile his continued racist remarks? I cant stand Trump, but Biden is moving closer and closer to being equally disgusting. Ive been a lifetime democrat but these last couple election cycles have proven many on the left dont count. Really hate our 2 party system.
He also apparently thinks that black voters will choose Kanye over Biden. Clearly he thinks black voters are ignorant but to be fair he thinks everyone who isn't him is ignorant when in reality he's the ignoramus.

Voting for Biden is moving left compared to whatever it is we have now. Ryan said that the D party itself is moving right, which is true and has been since Clinton.
I‚Äôm liberal. I can see the difference between Trump and Biden very clearly.
I really wish Biden would just stfu when it comes to the Black community bc he keeps saying dumb shit
The real issue is that with our bad two party system we are forced to just vote for who we think is "less bad."  Biden is FAR from a role model or a good politician.
Biden is trying, He's clearly not capable, mentally, I think he means well, But shit just comes out the wrong way,  I think he means well.
I remember Obama referring to naval medics as "Corpse-men" instead of corpsmen ("core-men"). People mispronounce things all the time. It is not pertinent to the meaning of what they are saying. Biden's words, on the other hand, have everything to do with meaning...
It's not one or the other, they can both be awful leaders. 40 years in politics and biden has done nothing of note except push laws that were tough on the classes of people he is now saying he is the savior for.

Biden actually sounded lucid, and he still stepped in it
I‚Äôm sorry who did the Democrats put up to run against Obama/Biden when Obama went for reelection? You‚Äôre complaining about some thing that nobody ever does. The incumbent always gets the nomination do you know what an incumbent is?
Biden: "All people of a certain group think the same way"   Media: He clarified that, that's not what he meant  Trump: "Thighland"  Media: "HoOkEd oN pHoNiCs MuCh?"
Biden truly is racist. Remember the "you ain't black" (if you prefer Trump)? Then: "unlike the black community", where he describes blacks as all being alike. He believes (with notable exceptions) black people are identical. He is telling you he is racist. Take him at his word.
"In no way did I mean the thing that I explicitly said. Don't believe your lying ears" - Joe Biden probably

What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran
Because one belongs to a church -- even catholic -- doesn't mean they believe in God. They just attend because it looks good socially, business wise and in the hopes it will get them points with Someone. Besides biden believes in murdering little babies. That hurts God!
No. You don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs unacceptable to mock the disabled specifically for being disabled, sure, and Trump didn‚Äôt. He mocked the reporter‚Äôs character flaws. Biden mocks people specifically for and about the color of their skin.  You‚Äôre either blind or partisan.
Sure he insults people, based on their stupidity and incompetence. Biden insults people for the color of their skin. Maybe neither should be applauded but one is definitely worse than the other.

As soon as Biden chooses his black female Marxist running mate, the blacks will shut up about any of his so-called "racism". If he wins the election he will shortly resign and the VP will become president. That is the game plan of the Democrats.

Oh and I agree with you that you can trace the rise of fascism to modern conservatism. It‚Äôs the reason that I want Joe Biden to win, and am willing to let some never trumpers do their thing. Bc I actually believe in progress, unlike privileged faux socialists.

Cardi B Reveals She's Spoken To Joe Biden, Talks VP Candidates
How right we're they last time though? How can you dismiss multiple recent polls right now in swing states that show Biden declining? On their website btw. That's not crushing it.
Lmao not really. Also, 538 got it so wrong last time. It's amazing you all still go there and trust it. The latest polls are starting to show Biden dip. And I mean several in the same states.
Nobody said that lmao.  You're the one that thinks national polls are great. But only if Biden is doing well in them. üòÇ
I already said that national polling is a dumb way to think a candidate would win because of the electoral college. You are the one bragging about how well Biden is doing nationally.
Trump will give $10m to anyone that has good information on Biden.
Biden is still down by a lot in the latest poll though
Poll: Young Minorities Overwhelmingly Support Biden
??? Biden is slipping in the latest polls. How did you not know that? All I'm pointing out is that what he's doing is not connecting and the polls show that.
I think you should spend more of your time volunteering for the Biden campaign and try to persuade voters in swing states instead of calling Bernie voters names if you're so bothered by these obvious truths.
This Pandemic has hurt the American People and Congress needs to come to some agreement. Without an agreement children are going hungry and families are losing their homes. If a longterm agreement can't be reached, pass a shortterm one. The American people can't wait. Help Now!!
The lights are on but no one‚Äôs home.  Biden has Alzheimer‚Äôs. I say that because of the anger you see on his face and when he clenches his fists when he is trying to think of the right words.
They damn sure did and Biden laid it on them too. He nailed it!
I posted that video yesterday.  With the anger and rage on Biden‚Äôs face I have one word to say. ALZHEIMERS!!
Say what? Why do you need context when he thinks Byrd was a great man? Byrd gave an hours long speech on the House floor about how blacks have smaller brains than whites which explained why they shouldn't mix with whites. Biden praises this nut. How's that for context?
Where's your poll where Biden is trouncing Trump though?
Why do you keep acting as if the election has happened and Biden already won?? He is slipping in the polls here was my original point. Lmao this has got to be a troll account.
Hey, remind me which president got us out of that Great Depression, how many terms he had, what kind of policies he had and how different those policies are from what Biden is offering.  Maybe we should be pushing those policies instead of wanting dumb corvette ads.
Biden did not apologize, his statement was clarified by him (his staff most likely) but I‚Äôm not aware of any apologies from him regarding his statement over Latinos and African Americans.
You kept saying Biden was trouncing Trump in AZ. No he's not. Source that or shut up.

For his best chance at winning, Joe Biden shouldn't be within 100 miles of a debate stage.
Biden is within the margin of error in AZ. It's not likely he will win here. It's incredibly conservative here in most of the state.  Y'all need to stop fooling yourself and demand Biden be a better candidate instead of acting like he's already won.
Yeah anyone thinking this ad plays well to starving people who are about to be homeless calling someone else an idiot is someone who doesn't understand the hierarchy of needsand can't be taken seriously.  As for Biden winning AZ handily.... The polls are close.
"Normie America" is starving. That you have zero capacity to understand that none of Biden's policies address that is on you. He should work on that instead of bragging about some expensive car while people can't eat.

Ask him(?): Who supports the current system?   And, watch the drool flow!  Note: Biden DOES NOT support the current system, even as he doesn't support the m4a model.
Biden is mentally compromised and yet still leads in the polls by double digits?? What does that say about Trump??

Biden is supposed to announce his VP pick this week. She may become the first female President. She may be the first Latinx or Black female President. Biden's choice may be the last big choice he makes this year and unless he chooses the best, I still see Trump winning.

Trump is the worst president ever. He only cares about himself and has his base convinced that anything negative said about him is also said about them. Sounds like the REPs drank the Koolaid. Athletes kneeling for a cause is 100% American. It is a form of peaceful protest.
We need to follow the science. We don't need to push our children back to school to aid Trump's political agenda. If one child dies from getting Covid at school is it worth it? No! It may be more difficult for us to oversee teaching our kids at home but safety first. We can do it

It's wrong to believe many republicans will vote for Biden. Trump has mantained an extremely high approval rating with republican voters. Meanwhile programs like Medicare for All are favored by a high percentage of republican voters. So both your points are wrong.
Biden should be talking about all kinds of social programs right now. He's not. He won't. He's not even talking about the post office when it's so obvious Trump is gonna try to steal the election. Joe and his campaign are not prepared to fight the fascist.

BIDEN ‚ÄúTHAT GIRL‚Äù 2020
Trump is not going to debate Biden period.
Republicans are scrambling to put Kanye on the ballot in as many states as possible (he's in Colorado tonight) in order to siphon off votes from Biden, keeping Don in the WH. That's a real danger, more than Donnie not leaving if Biden wins.
Covid is out of control in AZ??? SMH! Biden must have gone to the  school of reading stats.
The GOP is pushing him on the ballots in as many states as they can so he'll (hopefully) siphon off Black voters who would have voted for Biden. The Republicans are scared to death and trying every trick in the book to push Trump to victory.
Probably a good idea to have the White House thoroughly searched and gone through by experts to determine if Trump "stored" anything in the event that he is forced to leave when Biden trounces him...
Again  pushes a false narrative. Covid cases have been on the decline since mid June, but won't tell you Biden is way off in his statements
If Joe Biden could form one complete sentence and it began with ‚Äúbro‚Äù I‚Äôd be fine with it.
Once bitten, twice shy. We want to understand Biden's evolution and test its genuineness. And when your answer to the question "How did you come to this position?" is "I was first, therefore I didn't have to evolve." You can understand the skepticism. /end
And Biden's statement on Meet the Press in 2012 isn't exactly a profile in political courage. Otherwise he wouldn't have deflected when pressed if he'd like to see Obama change his stance.  It is more a testing of the political waters than a standing up for the LGBTQs moment./3
Don't get it twisted, the LGBTQ community is definitely going to vote for Biden over the Green party and Trump. We've picked up the whole "vote with your head, not your heart" thing that the Black electorate had going after we got shafted on DADT and DOMA by Clinton./2
Thread: Apparently, only  is allowed to question the motives of Democratic politicians and criticize them, not the communities whose very lives are affected by Biden's LGBTQ policies. /1
Is Biden looking at California stats?  Az numbers have been declining since June.  What an idiot...

Trump undermined our standing with the world with his poor leadership. All he wants to do is distract us from the facts of his failure as President. Remember to let your voice be heard in November. Get out and VOTE.

We have been without a president for almost 4 years now. Please vote Joe Biden for president 11/3/20. Thanks. We need a real leadership and Democrats will when we VOTE DEMOCRATS all across the board. Thanks üôè
You should try going to school do that you can learn to pronounce "YOSEMITE" ‚ÄòIdiot‚Äô   ‚ÄòAnd he questions Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities?‚Äô  Biden can pronounce Yosemite while drinking water with one hand. Pass it on.
Should Joe Biden participate in a debate with  He‚Äôs willing to. But why would you give one more platform to a lying, insecure loser like Trump?
Of course AND THEY WILL PUSH that Just as HARD as they are pushing Mail-in FRAUDULANT Voting. Biden couldn't debate with 10 grade civics student! And EVERY ILLEAGL, DEAD Over 100 yr old and NON-EXISTANT Voters HAVE ALREADY FILLED OUT THEIR BALLOTS And ALL VOTED DEMONCRAT! DAH
Excellent observation! She is a puffed acolyte of the sly, underhanded Obama/ Biden twins!
more Biden signs in lots of areas...I am so hopeful..üåäüá∫üá∏üòéüá∫üá∏üåäThe national political landscape has clearly significantly shifted in Joe Biden's favor since he emerged as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee back in March just as the public health emergency was taking hold.
US death rate per 100k.  ..... looks better than most countries .... Thank you Mr President !!   #Trump2020 .... Biden is a cognitive lost case
:THEY" haven't told HIM who he has to PICK YET! Biden doesn't have a Clue what is going on. He is the TRUE Trojan Horse the VP will Immediately TAKE OVER! They country will become a hell hole!
Of course THEY dont want Debates They know Trump will Destroy Biden. Biden's dementia is getting worse! They keep him HIDDEN while they try to find a Drug to get him through personal appearances! He is a Trojan Horse there is NO WAY IN HELL he can handle being president.
If Biden isn't capable to face Trump, how can he possibly face ruthless leaders of countries like North Korea, Turkey, Iran, etc?
I agree  just remember to stop trying to sell your medicare for all. It is not what this is about. You gave your support to Joe Biden. Stop talking about what you want you are no longer running for office.
Why bother campaigning?  You and your family better get use to the idea of being passed around in prison.
I'd be okay with Sec'y of Defense Vindman in the Biden Administration...
Never let polls make you think we don't need every vote. Never assume Biden doesn't need your vote, because he will have enough. We need to defeat Trump by a land slide, to let the world know.
Biden is a living caricature....an empty vessel playing to a receptive media like Pelosi does!
Report it. You see they caught that kid that hacked into Twitter and sent all those Bit Coin tweets out under Obama‚Äôs, Biden‚Äôs, Musk‚Äôs, etc accts?
Demings‚Äô police career will have on her chances of becoming Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick.  ‚ÄúIs Demings enough of a reformer? ... Or will critics potentially see her as embodying enduring problems inside American policing?‚Äù
We had that with Clinton and Obama... Clinton made China a strategic partner in 1990! Biden is a puppet of something or someone like Pelosi....
Count stopped when Obama/Biden told them to.
Joe Biden is right. The pandemic has shown that the entire 'Trump economy' was built on sand. The economic pain, fear and loss we are all feeling (and the worst GDP drop in history) is a direct result of  failures.
More H.P. Propaganda Biden wont Tweet UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE WRITES it FOR HIM. He is TOO far gone to Engauge in any Intelligent or even cognizant discussions. If he gets elected IT WILL BE THE END of DEMOCRACY! And we WILL BANKRUPT!
BIDEN PLEASE GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE
WHY WON'T BIDEN GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE????
There is no other way of saying it.  He will do anything to win The GOP will use the chaos resulting from mail in ballots  The only way to avoid this is Biden winning in a landslide in many states for this to work.
Democrats are idiots. I voted for Warren but can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden. Heaven forbid we can‚Äôt project an air of optimism about voting out Trump.
Comedy Central the Biden microphone!
You're great at throwing out statements about Biden, but you NEVER back them up. You have no clue that you're a big joke, or possibly a stupid Russian troll. You're failing to convince anyone to support Trump. Give it up.
'THEY'  Are Using this MAXCIST BLM Movement to Intimidate, scare, and create anxiety! ,they WILL right up until the election! Sell the IDEA that THEY WONT STOP if Trump is RE-Elected! Make no mistake A vote for Biden is SOCIALISM and TRUMP is Democracy TRUMP MUST WIN or we LOSE!!
If Biden gets elected I dont want to LIVE IN what will be the "HELL HOLE" "They" will create! We will BANKRUPT, Get Hyper-Inflation, 1st become Venezuela (with guns) Become a SOCIALIST country and ULTIMATELY Communist. Biden WILL DESTORY OUR ECONOMY!"A force of nature" Shit all Biden has to do to win the debate is stay silent.
I support Trump over Biden. When Trump loses you and the threepers will be back on the side of the Libertarians,  just like when Obomber was President.

Understandable, but please consider this... Every 3rd party or write-in is taking 1 vote is helping trump stay in office. Protest votes are a big part of the reason trump got elected in the 1st place. Please, vote Biden, don't help trump.  Thanks.
If the election were held today, I think the Senate would be 50-50, with Biden's VP as the tiebreaker. That gives democrats a majority but it would be incredibly difficult to get anything done.   #2020election

Biden's thinking in a nutshell.
I really don't want to.....but I've spoken to enough brainwashed dems...to know that he's gonna get like 75% of the dem vote.....no matter what I do , yell, protest.  So I'm gonna vote green....to help that party in 2024.  The only thoughtful vote left to me. Biden is more trump
S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
I completely agree. Let's do our best to ensure that scrutiny of Biden's female VP pick doesn't become sexist.
I refuse to be an armchair quarterback. And you should refuse too. It is up to Biden.
WaPo has ignored Karen Attiah‚Äôs racist comments about white people so I‚Äôm not surprised y‚Äôall continue to ignore Joe Biden‚Äôs racist come#ments against blacks people. Why is WaPo condoning racism?
If you vote for Joe Biden, what do you think you are voting for?

Damn! Biden knows more about Arizona then Governor two scoops.
Biden is confused, leave him alone.

Biden weighs in on trump &amp; Ducey and #coronavirus in Arizona. Definitely shows Democrats increasing confidence of their chances and pushes Trump to defend.
And if Biden loses the White vote (like all Democratic candidates since 1976) and "only" gets 51% of the Black vote, White pundits will blame Black voters because those pundits favor the status quo over liberty and justice for all.
Decency out numbers ignorant cult members. Joe Biden will be our next president. We're also flipping the senate.
And if Biden loses both the White vote (like all Democratic candidates since 1976) and "only" gets 51% of the Black vote, White pundits will blame Black voters because those pundits favor the status quo over liberty and justice for all.

And I say he can be a Catholic just fine without having to agree with everything his church has ever felt. I‚Äôm pretty sure no one (including the popes) could ever have been a Catholic under these standards. Which is the #1 reason your entire hit on Biden is just so dumb.
You mean like they're exploiting Joe Biden for political expediency?
Biden is definitely going to hurt the self proclaimed false god of the fake evangelicals &amp; that is DONALD TRUMP.
You sure make a lot of assumptions about Biden and his church. Again, I‚Äôd love you kind of inside info. Everything is a political football and they are mostly all dumb. This one is particularity stupid.
It‚Äôs well known that BIDEN stutters. That doesn‚Äôt mean cognitive function is impaired. Two different things. The clips here are too short to demonstrate those issues. What‚Äôs your excuse for being a mean- spirited petty Jerk? Oh right .... dad.

I did that last time with Trump because Hilary Clinton is evil-minded. I want to vote Biden because I don't want Trump to win again. Biden is the lesser of 2 evils but I just can't vote for either of them. What if my vote counts as the single vote that could shut Trump down? LOL
STOP with the juvenile and divisive comments about Joe Biden in the basement. Your perpetuation of this shameful behavior hurts all Arizona.  We are better than that. If you aren‚Äôt, leave now.
We all know Joe Biden is not writing these tweets. He thought Arizona was a city.
Absolutely. Sleepy Joe Biden is so confused he'll vote for Trump.

There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind - Tr*mp told you to start a fight with Biden during your visit since your BFF is losing support in AZ.
Biden‚Äôs social media caretakers points are false. There was free testing available and no one showed up. #clueless
Neither was I, but you spoke with so much certainly about Biden, his faith and his standing as Catholic that I figured you must have had some inside information.
This has been a mess in so many ways. Biden‚Äôs first mistake was to make his VP pick all about identity politics. I understand the reasoning for it but I still think it was a bad idea and out there for too long. The process has only gotten worse the longer it has gone on.

Biden is a hypocrite. Says he‚Äôs a Catholic but has gone even farther left concerning abortion. Biden has also been refused communion.
Democracy evolves.  But it sure shouldn‚Äôt move backwards.  If you think Biden won‚Äôt do as much in the area of rights for all groups, you have your head in a dark crevice somewhere.  That‚Äôs as romantic as I‚Äôd ever get with you.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS OUT, Mr. Biden. Ducey is killing Arizonans left and right and he only cares about pleasing the idiot in the Oval.
You have a serve and retirement economy that is unable to or afraid to go back to work. To your credit, you listen to Biden and asked AZ to wear masks and ramped up testing. Who hold a rally at a AZ mega church and  encouraged traveling on the 4th. That‚Äôs what caused a spike.

Biden owning up to a mistake places him light years ahead of his opponent.
There is no way having Joe Biden in the White House wouldn‚Äôt be better for anyone who is of color.  You sit on your ass on Election Day, and should Trump win, enjoy watching him tear up what is left of the Bill of Rights.

If Biden wins, so many people will just shut right back down and go back to sleep. Putting off any sort of hope for change for another 8-12 years and cementing neoliberalism in the Democratic Party for another decade at least.

in case anybody‚Äôs following the biden vs. ducey discourse about covid in az, things are still bad here. people don‚Äôt get test results for 2 weeks, and the main reason for slight improvement is that the mayors were finally allowed to mandate masks, which ducey blocked for months.
So... basically you are wavering between a vote for Biden and a vote for trump?  Bernie would say you suck...

That's why Biden needs a woman of color for a running mate, to sort of balance out his deeply rooted bigotry.

Doug went to brown-nose Trump and now he's mad that Biden mentions how incorrect they were to act like Arizona is doing fine? Lapdog Doug failed Arizona!
I have to laugh at the ads Donald has about  Joe Biden. True to trumps nature they make for really good stand up comedy. Maybe after he loses the election he can work for SNL as a straight man.
Listen to me when I say that #team obama is a nothing burger. We all know that biden and Obama are on the same page.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a shadow third term. But if there were, George H W Bush and George W Bush would be the most guilty of it

When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Yup, trump found innocent every time, Biden should be in court and maybe will be soon thanks to Ukraine charging him, we have to see I guess..
A policy that existed for all 8 years that Biden was VP. Do your homework!
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.

2020 Election ‚Äúreality‚Äù‚Ä¶  HI, WA, OR, CA, IL, NY, NJ, DE, VT, MA, MD, CT, will certainly ALL go for Biden. That's 175, of the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the election right there.   As such, Biden needs just 95 more to win the White House.  BIDEN. Really?

Just going to remind you all that a vote for Kanye is a vote for trump. He literally said in the past week that he‚Äôs running to siphon votes from Biden, and he‚Äôs literally being funded by several GOP campaign organizers. Don‚Äôt be stupid. Don‚Äôt fall for it. For the love of God.
Obama won Indiana in 2008, but I think you are right. Indiana should stay red this year. If it goes blue, Biden will have won 400+ Electoral College votes.

Actually, it is the difference between someone with reach but no authority (Biden) doing more than someone with statewide authority but no guts to use it (
Biden could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and I would still vote for him over Bonespurs. üòâ
It's been a bad week for Biden: Biden canceled the Wis convention.  Biden was massively outraised by Trump.  Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline was publicly questioned.  Biden made a racist comment.  Biden made another racist comment.  Biden was forced to apologize for racist comments
Give the biden thing a rest, Kristen!  If I didn't know better I would think she was reporting for Fox.
I mean, I‚Äôm a statistician, I know how the numbers work. What Ducey is saying is a boldfaced lie just as much as what Biden is saying is. We have improved but we are so far from out of the woods here.
Now is not the time to be tripping over your own feet Biden.  We can‚Äôt have that right now.  Don‚Äôt give any fuel to any possibility for trump to get re-elected.
The vulture circling his prey....Biden.
Joe Biden basically said that all black people think alike, and the media did not report on it at all until after he tried to 'walk back' his comments some time later.  And the media reports read like defenses of Biden.  Imagine what would have happened if Trump had said that.
The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community by
The idea of a conservative voting for Biden, is very un-conservative. I‚Äôm a conservative libertarian, I hate Trump, but I‚Äôm not gonna vote for a socialist!! There are 3rd party candidates people.
Predictable and transparent. Biden citing outdated numbers because the current trends don‚Äôt help him politically. Improvement in AZ is a detriment to Biden‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî simple as that.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'.
Is that the sound Biden makes when sniffing little girl‚Äôs hair?  Pshaw?
Joe Biden just said the most racist thing a presidential candidate has ever said in the era of modern elections.  How does it make you feel that none of the big news organizations are covering it at all?
Unlike African Americans, Latinos are incredibly diverse with incredibly different attitudes about different things.‚Äù  -Joe Biden
Biden is no Catholic.  However I‚Äôve no doubt he‚Äôs sniffed dozens of them.
Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities   keep talking Joe  you numbers look worse everyday Great job !

Ducey and Biden yelling stats at each other. Ducey using the good stats, Biden using the bad ones. Only one that looks wrong to me is when Biden said AZ still has nearly 20% positive rate. Yesterday was 14% PCR positive rate.
79 new COVID-19 deaths are being reported today in Arizona for a total of 4,081 known deaths.  And Ducey and Biden are in a Twitter feud.  Good morning, Arizona.

why am i not surprised he‚Äôs a biden supporter but anyways this is soo cool!!
So, hi, Arizona resident here. You shouldn‚Äôt be bragging about anything. You‚Äôre doing everything Biden just mentioned. One of my friends had to take 3 Covid tests before it came back positive. You‚Äôre such a joke.
At least Biden is not the Cold Stone Killer, Mr. Ducey
That‚Äôs not Biden tweeting.

Donald Trump mispronounces Thailand and Yosemite and it‚Äôs wall to wall coverage about his incompetence. Joe Biden literally can‚Äôt speak full sentences, is gaffing every time he‚Äôs in public, making clearly racist comments, &amp; the media covers it for about 52 seconds.
Your father is doing a wonderful job. At this rate if your dad keeps talking Biden could win this election taking a nap.
Just pointing out the truth. On 7/23 Brigette Gabriel posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo moment by voting for Trump. On 7/26 Lori Hendry posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo movement by voting for Trump.   Joe Biden would be proud of Lori‚Äôs plagerism.

And let's not talk that OBAMA could have chosen a woman, but instead picked a groping old man &amp; Biden is NOT LATINO! LOL
Public figures like Biden, Pelosi, &amp; AOC know what was taught. They just oppose it. In another age, they would all be excommunicated for their actions &amp; public policy decisions. The church within the Church, however, supports them &amp; condones their beliefs. The remnant suffer.

Agree. I have been a Biden fan since day 1. He's the only one who could build the kind of coalitions you are talking about. And, he has the right resume as well as being a very decent person. He can run our country. The best and brightest Dems will surround him. #Biden2020

While I may like Biden's numbers, this map has problems. States like Oregon and Connecticut shouldn't have the same rating as North Carolina and Florida. What is that based off of? Overall, it's too optimistic for Biden at this point in the race.
Sorry for the confusion, I was referring to myself in my first post. I should have articulateed that better. I won't be supporting Trump(or Biden, or Jorgensen, for that matter), but I'm definitely a staunch Republican and will continue to try and get Republicans elected.
Poor Joe Biden. Looking at people who likes your tweet are tweeter trolls paid by tweeter. They are bots! Just like you they are racist.

Joe Biden is not pro-abortion.  I get so tired of this spin.  He (and I) are pro-choice.  That means we are pro the woman and only the woman affected gets to make that decision.  I don't know anyone who is pro abortion.
Yay, Bill Kristol. I think it‚Äôs absurd to wait for Biden‚Äôs VP pick to make a decision. Democracy itself is at risk.
In the end, people thought they had a voice and it was obviously, ineptly, and callously taken away from them by typical backroom politics. People are angry, our country is on fire, and neither candidate wants to stand up for what's right. So don't vote shame. Biden isn't the key
People want to know that their voice is heard, they want their representatives to REPRESENT them, and all Biden can do is cozy up to corporations and offer milquetoast platitudes about how things will be better. The DNC would rather have trump than Bernie and they torpedoed him.
It‚Äôs funny how Biden can be so articulate in a Tweet but barely put a sentence together during an interview ü§î

Sorry, Trump has proven he isn't a racist 1,000 times over.  Only a moron would think he is at this point.  Biden clearly is one.  And one with full blown Dementia.  You guys probably should have stuck with Bernie... at least he was coherent.
The crazy stuff Trump says is because he‚Äôs an entertainer to the public.  You know Biden is a pandering, babbling leftie..he will do more harm.
Biden cannot be a practicing Catholic and hold to beliefs contrary to church teaching. As I recall, he's been denied communion for that. Having had 12 years of Catholic education, I find it difficult to understand how any real Catholic could be a Dem. Sorry. Don't buy Pelosi too.

People want M4A, people want real systemic change in law enforcement, people want the government to take COVID-19 seriously and start paying people to stay home like Europe and Canada did, and Biden won't do any of that. Is he better that trump? Of course, but that's a low bar.

If you had to choose Biden or Trump who would it be? I know many of you will tell me third party but the last time a third party had a decent showing was 1912. So who will you support? I despise Biden but I absolutely hate Trump. It‚Äôs 2016 all over again. Which asshole to choose?
Joe Biden is a racist! His words today:  ‚Äúunlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."
NEW: Kanye West indicates, in a Forbes interview via text, that he is in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
What a dork!  Palmer Report?  I hope people are not actually funding you as some sort of intellectual.  It is pronounced Thighland dumbass.  Biden hurts God every time he bounces little girls in his lap and smells their hair.  Only God has seen what goes on behind closed doors.
Fascinating content by Biden here
right now,  if Joe Biden made a mistake in  his speech, ad libbed,  and said that Zorro played Tenor  w/ Basie,  I would STILL vote for him. if he said that Jaco played Tuba..  yes.  STILL  &amp; i yam something ofa #Biblicalidiot
If you vote for Biden you are more of a traitor than your father.
Okay. Somehow the Democrats and Joe Biden need to stop Trump's approval numbers from going up. This is freaking me out. Big time!!!!! If they or groups like Republican Voters Against Trump &amp; The Lincoln Group need more money, then billionaires like Bloomberg need to help out! Now
Now Biden is pissing me off. Yes, the criminal who has been in the oval office for four years must be prosecuted.
Like, someone draw me this dope ass god-killing Biden poster honestly. Sounds amazing

C‚Äômon S.E. ! Are u that worried Joe Biden might not be able to finish his term?
There he goes projecting again.  How stupid is Trump to use his major personal weakness to attack Biden?  Trump is always going to come in second in comparison to Biden no matter what b.s. he spews.
Are you privy to information that isn't available to the rest of us? Is there some accusation out there against Biden that I don't know about, or are you just making this up?   Because i know about the actual accusations against Trump.
It's all fine and dandy. But remember there are 3 months to go which is a lifetime in politics.Polls and battleground maps don't vote. Think Biden in 10 points behind and work accordingly.
Mentally compromised is being kind. Biden is mentally unfit to serve and ignoring it only serves trump.
What do we say? Biden has a mental lapse nobody talks about it Trump spells Frorida it's front page news. Hell give them both cognitive test on live TV. Lol.
Sick of the Biden thing.  He has hidden in the basement because He has had plastic surgery.  Have you noticed his old photos in comparison to the new ones?  No under eye wrinkles, and no howls now.  Maybe they have him T cell therapy so he could have better brain function.
I won't be vote shaming people, but I won't tolerate claims that Biden is some great candidate either. He is garbage. He is slightly better garbage than our current garbage, but still garbage. It is almost certainly going to take protests/sit ins/walkouts/strikes to make him "ok"

Why does Joe Biden have an ad that at the bottom says Joe Biden/COVID-19...
Yeah, we need someone sharp......like Biden to handle a pandemic.
Biden supporters don‚Äôt care to see you. Get over yourself.
No matter how hard trump and his cronies try to paint Joe Biden as weak, Biden is still going to kick Trump butt this November election.
I find his analogy of being tested for cocaine bazar..then he says are you a junkie? That‚Äôs exactly what happened to his son Hunter Biden.. he was tested in the military..kicked out because he‚Äôs a junkie.
Joe Biden uses the analogy of being tested for cocaine..are you a junkie? That‚Äôs an interesting analogy considering his son Hunter was tested for cocaine in the military ...kicked out because he is a junkie...
The keyword is interview. When was the last time you interviewed Joe Biden.. or anybody interview Joe Biden?
Colorado has colored ballots and the USPS said they endorse Biden. Dems will SWEEP Colorado with mail in ballot fraud!
I watched in utter disbelief when he did his "I'm not a puppet. You're the puppet. You're the puppet" routine. It should have been over by then. I don't see how any debate with Biden will be good for Drumpf. I mean, look at his latest interviews. He's lost it.
It's a pandemic,  are you going to blame every world leader because their citizens are dying? Biden isn't posting these comments, the real power players are. Didn't the Bubonic Plague go away?
The schools were left open during the swine flu. Obama Biden did nothing to stop the swine flu from infecting children in school. Make Dr. Fauci explain that publicly!
So when is this in-depth interview with Joe Biden going to take place? So you can watch it in depth and give everyone a bravo. Where is it Jonathan? Why aren‚Äôt you doing your job? Because it‚Äôs not a job is it it‚Äôs your position as a propagandist for the DNC!
Choose Anyone and we still voting for Biden. #VoteTrumpOut2020

Would Biden consent to debate a 5th grader?
What the Democrats will do if they win in November is give Biden about three months in office and then invoke the 25th amendment... and BINGO... The United States will have its first female president... i‚Äôve been saying it for months now, this is their ultimate plan!
Yes, voting Biden all the way. No matter what
You are such a liar Jake Tapper. It was the sheriffs and law-enforcement that told Democrats Joe Biden goodbye forever ..you criminals! Lmao!!! What does it do for you to be such a liar..

So funny If you think that‚Äôs going to happen with someone like Joe Biden.
Oh is he running for president again now? Biden is not doing so well..let‚Äôs push hom out-of-the-way and feature Obama every two seconds. You forget people don‚Äôt like him anymore..
It's going to take Biden's administration a year or more just to undo all the shit Trump has done.
We no longer have friends...you just stated all of the countries that have been our enemy with the exception of Ukraine. What‚Äôs interesting about that Joe Biden and his son have been to just about every single one of those countries stuffing money in hunters pockets!If the election were held today, I think the Senate would be 50-50, with Biden's VP as the tiebreaker. That gives democrats a majority but it would be incredibly difficult to get anything done.   #2020election
Biden's thinking in a nutshell.
S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
Proud to be a signer of this.  No other VP candidate has Bass's breadth of support across the Party. Joe Biden &amp; all who want to unify Dems should take that to heart.  You can still add your name as a delegate or DNC member to support #BassForUnityVP:
Let‚Äôs see, Biden is not for banging hookers, stealing from Americans, cavorting with evil foreign leaders and he is not for telling blatant lies with every word he would say as president.
And, he spelled ‚Äúseparated‚Äù wrong.  Any racist Bloomberg/Biden fan is no loss.  Bye, Felicia.
Biden weighs in on trump &amp; Ducey and #coronavirus in Arizona. Definitely shows Democrats increasing confidence of their chances and pushes Trump to defend.
Absolutely. Sleepy Joe Biden is so confused he'll vote for Trump.
Lol some girl said ‚Äúit‚Äôs good vs evil at this point‚Äù. She was referring too trump vs Biden. Girl it‚Äôs evil vs evil what are you talking about.
Ok that is fair I will take the L on the one! Honestly really doesn‚Äôt matter who wins the election both of them are clowns. You got Biden that can string along sentences. Then you have trump making up words. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Evergreen: "Neither politician told the whole story."  via
Biden don‚Äôt worry about Arizona. You have had 50 years to implement your plans with no results
This has been a mess in so many ways. Biden‚Äôs first mistake was to make his VP pick all about identity politics. I understand the reasoning for it but I still think it was a bad idea and out there for too long. The process has only gotten worse the longer it has gone on.
Biden owning up to a mistake places him light years ahead of his opponent.

There has been 1 charge of sexual assault against Biden and it went nowhere, because it was made up.  Now let's do trump.
Margaret, you just need to get over his personality and look at everything that he has accomplished the last 3 1/2 years. If you truly were a conservative Republican, then I don‚Äôt believe you could remotely even think about voting for Biden
The Dems have botched every aspect of the election AND the Covid economic recovery.   If Trump wasn‚Äôt record-setting incompetent they would be getting trounced.   Biden represents a Clinton/Obama fifth term ‚Äî but, that‚Äôs far from what most people want (or need).

Biden hits a nerve and Ducey, sadly, gets down to Trumps level. Man he just keeps being more and more disappointing.  What if you just, ya know, admit we opened too fast and people died because of it.
Weird its almost like Biden is using the pandemic for votes and doesn't care at all about it.
Doug went to brown-nose Trump and now he's mad that Biden mentions how incorrect they were to act like Arizona is doing fine? Lapdog Doug failed Arizona!
I have to laugh at the ads Donald has about  Joe Biden. True to trumps nature they make for really good stand up comedy. Maybe after he loses the election he can work for SNL as a straight man.
Listen to me when I say that #team obama is a nothing burger. We all know that biden and Obama are on the same page.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a shadow third term. But if there were, George H W Bush and George W Bush would be the most guilty of it
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
A policy that existed for all 8 years that Biden was VP. Do your homework!
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.
Do you know anything about hunter Biden... the apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the Biden scumbag tree
Well Joe Biden isn‚Äôt even tweeting. The guy can‚Äôt even remember who he is.  The truth is that if the leftists crazies would stop vilifying the effective usage of hydroxychloroquine, less people would be dead.  It has worked for 30+ years to treat other corona viruses.
Hey, Hey whataya say?  Let's give Trump a bad day!  Hey, Hey whataya gonna do? Vote for Biden, make Trump stew
Biden did hangout w/ Epstein at fundraisers &amp; such as did Obama &amp; Clinton. The policy of separating parents &amp; children at the boarder happened for all 8 yrs of his time at the Whitehouse &amp; he &amp; Obama took away much of the military benefits for members &amp; fam. I am military fam.
Joe Biden is a racist! His words yesterday:  ‚ÄúUnlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."
Biden could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and I would still vote for him over Bonespurs. üòâ
I mean, I‚Äôm a statistician, I know how the numbers work. What Ducey is saying is a boldfaced lie just as much as what Biden is saying is. We have improved but we are so far from out of the woods here.
Now is not the time to be tripping over your own feet Biden.  We can‚Äôt have that right now.  Don‚Äôt give any fuel to any possibility for trump to get re-elected.
The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community by
The idea of a conservative voting for Biden, is very un-conservative. I‚Äôm a conservative libertarian, I hate Trump, but I‚Äôm not gonna vote for a socialist!! There are 3rd party candidates people.
Joe Biden just said the most racist thing a presidential candidate has ever said in the era of modern elections.  How does it make you feel that none of the big news organizations are covering it at all?
Unlike African Americans, Latinos are incredibly diverse with incredibly different attitudes about different things.‚Äù  -Joe Biden
Biden is no Catholic.  However I‚Äôve no doubt he‚Äôs sniffed dozens of them.
So does Sleepy Joe Biden
At least Biden is not the Cold Stone Killer, Mr. Ducey
Your father is doing a wonderful job. At this rate if your dad keeps talking Biden could win this election taking a nap.
But then people will constantly be saying "WhErE's BiDeN???".  He just can't win with the people who already want to hate him, so imo he should just keep doing what he's doing which has him way ahead in the polls.
Interesting historical context, worth the 2 min read up..   With his veep choice, Biden must face the odds
Proud to be a signer of this statement.  No other VP candidate has Bass's skill in building coalitions or breadth of support, from progressive activists to the Congressional Black Caucus. Joe Biden and all who want to unify the party should take that to heart.  #BassForUnityVP

Mr. President.  Hold rallies again.  Make all spectators wear masks when entering.  Give them out at doors. Takes away critic from fake media! Rallies work Sir!  Will again! Leave Biden in his basement!

Yay Biden's "Tim Kaine" moment, Susan Rice would be a gift to the right. It was rough today for Biden supporters. Yelling at a reporter asking him if he was a junkie, flip flopping on the cognitive test thing, having to backpedal from saying African Americans aren't diverse ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

biden is bread in a dishwasher.
Agree. I have been a Biden fan since day 1. He's the only one who could build the kind of coalitions you are talking about. And, he has the right resume as well as being a very decent person. He can run our country. The best and brightest Dems will surround him. #Biden2020
Laughing is not worth engaging. What she fails to realize is others are Laughing ignorance. As a female SS agent, requesting reassignment is unfair and bad for her career. The onus for decency was on biden to wear a swimsuit. No brainer. Geez.
While I may like Biden's numbers, this map has problems. States like Oregon and Connecticut shouldn't have the same rating as North Carolina and Florida. What is that based off of? Overall, it's too optimistic for Biden at this point in the race.
You ever get the sense that Obama is parading out incompetent Biden is to hand the election to Trump so that he isn‚Äôt prosecuted for his crimes????
Haven't seen many of any, from either party. I have seen some Trump stickers, but definitely none for Biden.
I never thought I would say this.  I actually feel kind of sorry for Kim Kardashian.  She has 4 kids, and their Bipolar father is manic and being widely exploited by the GOP, along with various media organizations (including Forbes!)
This clown has to go, racist Joe Biden, you have plundered your whole personal life as well.
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic.  Donald Trump held the Bible upside down at a photo op in front of a church after using his secret police to clear away peaceful protesters.  These are the words of a fascist, and he's hoping that you've drunk enough racist Kool-Aid to believe him.
Joe Biden has also publicly said the N word, made racist jokes towards Indians, said you ain‚Äôt black if u vote for trump, he touches and smells little kids, and he said the black community isn‚Äôt diverse. I could keep going but I don‚Äôt have room.
Joe Biden has been unfit for elected office since the beginning of his career. That‚Äôs why the mob selected him to be a Delaware senator in 1972. They found him an easy tool to manipulate.
Didn‚Äôt know this was English class.. You support Biden? How about you pay attention to the errors he makes when he talks
So with that logic you don‚Äôt listen to what Joe Biden says out of his mouth... dude can‚Äôt spit out a sentence correctly without stuttering
Difference is Obama and VP Biden send a lot of jobs to China Trump brought them back
I need people to actually vote for Biden... if you for Kanye, you might as well just vote for Trump.
Just like what happened when Obama was President and Biden was VP?  Laughable. No one wants your guns. He‚Äôs playing you and your money is getting stolen by the NRA. Keep your guns. We don‚Äôt care. Love, A Democrat.

Can I jump on this bandwagon too‚ÄùI want to vote for Biden, it will come down to his Secretary of HUD pick, and if satisfied it will come down to his Interior pick‚Äù
Just make sure Trump should set the agenda.  Its not like Biden has the upper hand in debates.  Dont let Trump wuss out by giving in into the leftist demand.  You should be moderator otherwise no debate.
This is very gracious. We need more of that in civic life today.  It was also important that Mr. Biden  clarified his remarks.
Trying to peg  Biden with a nickname might not be the recipe for success.
We are prone to fight the last war. Does it feel like  , trump campaign are running in 2016 against Hillary. 2020 is obviously quite different. Biden has challenges but his negatives are nowhere near Clinton‚Äôs. Trump now has a record and #COVID__19 to defend.
It means there are a good number of people voting because of dislike instead of looking at facts. They simply hate trump or Biden. It is pretty sad when candidates with a 40 year record of racism are the ally of black lives matter. Stop and think about it.
You don‚Äôt have to like Trump. But he‚Äôs done a pretty dang good job considering all the adversity. He gave up a billionaire lifestyle to serve and he‚Äôs not a communist like Biden‚Äôs puppet master.
What would you think of Trump if he said the things Biden has?#TrumpIsLosing
From CNN's archives and it's not fake news. I'm a member of the Democratic party.  Just one who believes in telling the truth. Lying about what happened won't change anything.
Disqualifying comments from Biden today. #JoeBidenIsARacist
That campaign is in autopilot bro Biden gets to leave the basement a couple hours here and there back at home by 16:00 with his slippers on and a brandy lol
In the end, people thought they had a voice and it was obviously, ineptly, and callously taken away from them by typical backroom politics. People are angry, our country is on fire, and neither candidate wants to stand up for what's right. So don't vote shame. Biden isn't the key
People want to know that their voice is heard, they want their representatives to REPRESENT them, and all Biden can do is cozy up to corporations and offer milquetoast platitudes about how things will be better. The DNC would rather have trump than Bernie and they torpedoed him.
It‚Äôs funny how Biden can be so articulate in a Tweet but barely put a sentence together during an interview ü§î
Honestly doubt Biden himself even knows this tweet exists lmfao
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."¬†...   Biden said it, whether you accept it or not. It's truth, it killed his 2008 campaign.
Gravitas: Joe Biden: Good or Bad for India?  via
Nope. But it will be painful til them. I'm seeing a thousand percent increase in annoying unskippable ads on YouTube that are just attacking Biden for everything from mass murder to insanity. Very annoying.
People want M4A, people want real systemic change in law enforcement, people want the government to take COVID-19 seriously and start paying people to stay home like Europe and Canada did, and Biden won't do any of that. Is he better that trump? Of course, but that's a low bar.
There you go with the assumptions again. Despite everything wrong that you just said, you still insist that people are what you want them to be so your point "looks" better. Biden and Trump are both terrible. Biden refuses to make any concessions that would lead to real change.

Strongest economy ever, lowest unemployment rate ever, created 6 million jobs, got millions of Americans off food stamps, lowered crime and human trafficking rates. How is biden better than trump ?

That may be but Rice is low on charisma, unlike Harris.  Rice can participate in the Biden Admin in other ways.  Rice has no campaign experience.  Nope, not happening.
Meanwhile at least twice now Biden has insulted the African American community this year alone and CNN refuses to cover it

It's all fine and dandy. But remember there are 3 months to go which is a lifetime in politics.Polls and battleground maps don't vote. Think Biden in 10 points behind and work accordingly.
Sick of the Biden thing.  He has hidden in the basement because He has had plastic surgery.  Have you noticed his old photos in comparison to the new ones?  No under eye wrinkles, and no howls now.  Maybe they have him T cell therapy so he could have better brain function.

Did you spell "Trump" wrong? Because Biden is not protected from anything. Trump is.  Everything you said applies to Trump. Everything. He doesn't even hide his perversions. He brags about them.  So which troll farm are you a part of? Do they pay well?
I saw a tweet the other day from someone I used to follow, saying just because Trump is bad doesn't mean Biden is good, always "he's not progressive enough". Beginning to think they want Trump to win. The next election can be about ideology. Now has to be about saving the US.

True. He should have been running ads about the China flights while running Biden opposing it. He should have been running ads with dem governors praising him how ventilators and Newsom saying he got what he needed while Biden criticizing. Time lost he will never get back
Come on you know this guy Biden has lost his marbles . I know you hate the President but how could you want a man like that for President, you are a patriot and know we need a leader not a puppet who won‚Äôt come out of his house .

Biden wants to eliminate all tariffs against China defund police departments as crime is rapidly growing in major cities. China is not our friend Joe they're Communists seeking to destroy the USA. Stop the building of the wall? You've lost all common sense if you've ever had any.
I'm still disappointed that the presidential election has come down to two men with the cognitive capacity of week-after-Halloween Jack O'Lanterns. That said, Biden building a strong coalition and not being a white supremacist makes him the vastly superior moldy pumpkin.
As the Democrats continue to trip on their own shoelaces polls show Trump gaining momentum. No surprise there. As Biden stays in the basement Trump is working for Law and Order the basics of free Society. Without it we all decay into a free-for-all violence crime will escalate.

I think both of them would be a good pick, my only qualms are that with Rice she has the stupid "tarmac" baggage, which even though it's bullshit, could stick... and Harris was a cop.  But I would trust either of them to take over after Biden.

That is such a great point I happen to think Michelle Obama is going to fly in and save the day. Run for Pres. - Biden is just holding the spot. Michelle won‚Äôt check in until right before the election because she doesn‚Äôt want to have to campaign. Nomination without any effort
There really isn‚Äôt much you can say about her except that she fits right in. Liars all around.  #SaveUSPS #Biden
So? It's a really stupid point. Honestly who cares if Biden shows his face when Trump is hanging himself. And, you know, is Trump.
At this point, I hope Biden loses, and I‚Äôm not ashamed of that. If the DNC gets away with rigging their primaries and shunning any and all quasi-progressive policy positions when things are THIS bad, fuck em. Let them lose. The blood is on their hands, not ours.
Good article which confirms, once again, that trump lies and slanders. He will cheat and play dirty at any time. He doesn't follow rules, or tell the truth, and thinks he is above the law. Fact check him all day and it's lie after lie.

I think he will take votes from Trump not Biden.
Joe Biden LOSES over COGNITIVE TEST COMMENT  via
Yates lies her ass off today in a futile attempt to take blame away from her and Biden and solely put blame on Comey. She is going down hard as well as the rest of them, and they all deserve to go down for creating a false narrative and pushing it on the public.
And why the fuck is Biden wearing a mask in his car
Where is my Biden decoder ring?
And, what‚Äôs Biden gonna do? ... the VP pick of Harris will provide a good indication of the pandering to IP elites that working class people of all stripes could not care less about   He should be picking Bernie, but he‚Äôs a neoliberal globalist elite and cannot even stomach it
If you're referring to the fact that I said I was voting for Biden in AZ I was being somewhat of a troll to the original request. But I shouldn't have to explain this.
I've had several family members pass away from dementia. Joe Biden dies not suffer from dementia.
This virus has been the best thing ever for Biden cause he hasn‚Äôt had to make many public appearances. He‚Äôs losing his mind.
Why in the heck is this okay? Once again trump slanders and lies. No one stops him. It's up to us. We stop him and kick his butt out in November.  #Biden2020  "Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
Thanks to Bernie and Co getting on board and campaign for Joe Biden. #Biden2020
The joe Biden driving video is really giving me some ptsd
At first I thought it said Biden's head is shrinking which is not far from the truth!
Instagram insists 'bug' that negatively affected Joe Biden was 'not¬†partisan'
Republican operatives are helping Kanye West get on general election ballots   So the GOP is resorting to using a bipolar guy to try to siphon votes away from Biden
Brennan, one of the masterminds of the failed Trump impeachment coup attempt, believes Biden, who‚Äôs done nothing in Washington in 50 years, is going to ride into the Oval Office on a platinum unicorn and fix everything. Nothing could be further from the truth. #ObamaGateIsReal
We are going to send Beijing Biden back to work but not where you demolition rats think! Now put your face over your mask and welcome to Target lol
Kasey, you better bring 80 plus million votes with you. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take for Beijing Biden to win!
Do you honestly think you can compare the two?  Be honest with yourself. Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but biden is seriously lost/ old/ demented/senile.  You don‚Äôt see that?!  He can not run anything.
But she doesn't. She bangs against Biden and Harris.  OK wait.  We have a 240 year trainwreck in the WhiteHouse right now.  Don't bang on Biden NOW.  You want to influence VP?  K.  Whom do you support?  Be POSITIVE.  Bang on Harris and Biden?  Why?  Yeah, she's in a "SAFE" dist.
Like Biden was my last choice, but he's the only true democratic choice, so I'm holding my nose and voting for my neighbors who cannot take another four years of this nonsense. I'm voting for him and then demanding he not make me regret it in 2024.
I‚Äôm not wasting any more of my time. When Biden wins on Election Day and raises taxes I want you to remember something. We voted for it, and we want it. We are done here, not wasting anymore of my time on you.
You just don't seem very bright. 1) These ads are for those who haven't chosen their candidate 2) You obviously have not been paying to anything Trump and the Trump campaign has been mocking Biden about. It's this. This is just clear lying with non-existent photos to make a point
Mark Kelly has nothing to gain by accepting her debate challenge. She's already toast and she knows it. No candidate initiates 7 debates unless they're in desperation mode. Trump tried the same trick on Biden and the Biden campaign didn't take the bait.
Sanders supporters launch six-figure ad campaign explaining why they're voting for Biden
By now I think we all know Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the one send these tweets out. They‚Äôre too coherent to be Joe with his rapidly diminishing faculties due to his rapidly progressive dementia occurring.
Joe Biden does not have a speech impediment... all the tapes of his speeches his political career will tell you that. You don‚Äôt develop a speech impediment at 70+
When are the "Joe Biden is hiding in his basement" people going to figure out that most Americans can relate with not being able to go out as much as they used to?  A lot of political attacks can be ineffective and that's normal, but the rise of this one genuinely confuses me.
Biden won't be tough on China because it his his family's gravy train.
haha lol lol did you know biden is old lol haha lol
I‚Äôm glad Biden hit back. That‚Äôs a stupid ridiculous question.
Except #Russia, and If it means dirt on Biden, then #Ukraine, too.  #CorruptionKills #Corruption
I feel like history has enough of a sense of humor that if this is the case, Biden will outlive his VP while serving two full terms.
much like trump, joe biden is actively striving to strip millions of their health coverage.  there is not a single positive materialist argument that can be made in favor of joe biden, unless you just straight up lie about his record and everything he actually says.
You gotta fight for your right.......... Come On Man!!........ Joe Biden... Lol
In case you needed another reason to like Joe Biden...
told......  and biden hes a fucking retard too fuck evil .
"bUt BiDeN wAnTs tO dEfuNd tHe pOLice"
That will be a nope by Biden he ain‚Äôt falling for trumps tricks the way democrats have in the past.
Scene: Conservatives foaming at the mouth about Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline as Trump struggles to hold his own in two confrontational interviews. The mental gymnastics it takes for someone on the right/disaffected left to overlook this... Talk about cognitive decline.
Trump had to have another news conference to tell us "it is what it is" about this deadly pandemic? Seriously?  I am sure it included massive Joe Biden jabs and misinformation.   Just like yesterday and before.
Not happy, most of us are mad about Kanye being exploited &amp; Biden. It is unethical and sad.
This was all passing the buck. She put blame solely on Comey for everything even though her 302 didn‚Äôt say anything about Biden being at the meeting. I think she knows the gig is up and is trying to save face
Trump is so fucked
She‚Äôs too risky. What the heck was she doing speaking at a Scientology event? Tammy Duckworth with her military background and minority status as a Thai American and Trump‚Äôs total disregard for the military is Biden‚Äôs best pick.
It never ends.
It was Hillary Clinton wearing a Joe Biden mask the entire time
I like a President who‚Äôs cognitively clear. As a cognitive test Biden should challenge Trump to a race. Joe in his Corvette and Trump in his Golf cart.
People that find Trump abhorrent and are voting Biden are abhorrent to me.
Rice would be a great VP, but she would fit right into the GOP narrative. They‚Äôll smear any of the candidates, like they have w/ Bass, but Rice gives them too much fodder. Biden is too difficult to attack, so they‚Äôll go hard after his VP #BidenVP
Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
It's time to stop bragging about all the eyes and ears you have and use them.  While you're arguing that Flynn did nothing wrong, I'll bet you'd scream your head off if someone from Biden's team pulled the same stunt before inauguration day, and then lied about it.
#BIDEN ADVOCATES TO ADD TRUMP TO MOUNT RUSHMORE MONUMENT: Biden, the man who told Americans, ‚Äúyou ain't black," said that OUR President is the most RACIST in history.  The Democrats also said that Mount Rushmore is a monument to racism. Does this mean they plan  to add #TRUMP?
But Biden is running for president with the most progressive presidential platform in history! üôÑ as if we should settle for the crumbs that they tossed at us
Well said James Woods ! 'a tsunami of voter fraud.' That's the only way Biden can get anywhere  close to the white house. KAG KAG KAG
Dem voters:  "Biden is totally gonna crush Trump in the debates and then in November!"  Also, Dem voters:
Biden should debate him as many times as delusional don wants. Trump can only show what a moron he is. With no script he cant complete a sentence.
yeah, I saw old sniffing Joe Biden trying to sniff out Idaho...   I like that term 'unsee' it... nope, I now cannot unsee it either...  forever now MT will be sniffing ID.  ugh !
When Barr announces an investigation into Biden in October, remind your Trump friends and family members that Trump has been (and still is) under investigation for more than 4 years.
.   June 30, Biden was asked by a reporter if he had taken a cognitive test. "I've been tested and I'm constantly tested," Biden said. "Look, all you got to do is watch me...‚Äù
Have you seen the latest gaffe from Biden?
Oh, that would make Biden come across as very presidential. In one sentence, you‚Äôd have Biden destroy everything he‚Äôs done in the past six months to come off as a better man.
Which is fine because I‚Äôm not supporting Biden. It‚Äôs literally in my bio  All I‚Äôm doing is pointing out that your argument for Shahid is almost verbatim the #BlueMAGA argument for voting for Joe  No need to continue the argument though so you‚Äôre welcome to the last word.
Kayleigh, this is for you. Straight from a group of Republicans. And don't talk about the Biden family.  Wipe the slime off your mouth.
This list includes Larry Elder and Hugh Hewitt, two people are who openly supporting Trump. The Biden Campaign shouldn't take this list seriously.
It risks changing voter perceptions of Biden. Voter perceptions of Trump are locked in because we see him all the time but Biden has kept such a low profile a lot of voters might not have a current view of him. If Biden looks old and confused vs Trump that could hurt him.
Below is what a REAL president tells his people.
Biden to Black Journalist: ‚ÄòAre You a Junkie?‚Äô
I'm pretty sure Joe Biden can pronounce Y-O-S-E-M-I-T-E #DumpTrump2020
I‚Äôve known about rapist 45 since before he ran. I‚Äôm no fan of any rapist, red, blue, or otherwise. We don‚Äôt know if Reade‚Äôs claim can be proven bc biden is shielding records. If you actually educated yourself, you‚Äôd already know that. Please learn.
photoshopped photo...   Yes, but who cares!?  The ad is true, Biden is being abused by his wife,  , forced to jump in front of cameras, and read whatever she tells him to...   #ElderAbuse
You‚Äôre overstating this issue. If you don‚Äôt have something nice to say, say nothing. Don‚Äôt push people to Trump because you don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs style. There‚Äôs a big difference between being a little awkward and being an evil tyrant.
yep that's about what I'd expect from a Biden shill. "I'll settle for less, so should you!"
Joe Biden is 93 days away from being elected as the 46th President of the United States of America. #Biden2020

I don‚Äôt think so. Biden a genius?? Why don‚Äôt you try looking into everything Trump has done since taking office. It‚Äôs amazing how he gets zero credit for the good things he‚Äôs done.
Joe Biden is winning.
Now who is trying to get out of the debates???? It seems trump is lying already. Fact check him all day. And he still lies ALL DAY.
Trump said he would debate Biden but he wants to do it in writing like he did with Mueller.   LolYou mean like they're exploiting Joe Biden for political expediency?

Keep religion out of the damn debates, the presidency isn't a religious title and shouldn't be treated as such. If journalists want to press Trump and Biden on their religious views, fine, but not in the debates for presidency.
As Joe Biden one question about the current White House operations and he'll sit there quietly for half an hour trying to figure out an intelligent approach to the answer .
Biden cannot be a practicing Catholic and hold to beliefs contrary to church teaching. As I recall, he's been denied communion for that. Having had 12 years of Catholic education, I find it difficult to understand how any real Catholic could be a Dem. Sorry. Don't buy Pelosi too.
Biden sucks something terrible. Daily gaffes, has zero ground game, DNC is broke and shambles after Hildabeast,Economy is roaring back, the Shamdemic is up. You‚Äôre Fucked!
Biden already made a gaff and stupidly stuck his foot in his mouth.  # If you ain't black ?  You don't deserve to vote?  "  the asswit isn't very subject savvy in conversation.

Yeah, but voting for Regressive, Rightwing, Corporatist Biden, whose first act will be to cut Social Security.
I wish the repubs would  hit Biden on the Real issue. By his very record he's screwed workers, blacks, students, the poor and wants to cut Social Security. Unfortunately, that aligns him with them so they can't mention it üòÄ
I was surprised but I guess I shouldn't have been one of my neighbors has a Biden flyer in his front yard they're good people I've known him for five years but they're highly medicated people they are not in touch with the world.
Biden is never tested.  He's only thrown softball questions from the press when he decides to take questions at all.
F*** Joe Biden somebody should just give him a third eye. We have a constitutional right to protect American citizens each and every one of us.
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president

If Joe Biden is elected for president remember I said this he said he will let 11 million illegal immigrants and immigrants asylum in our country. He will also raise taxes for low income and middle class people. He will also make a point to take our guns away.

Be nice if Americans discussed policies and actions instead of stupid memes. I can think of some from Trump I don't like, but even worse ones from Obama and Biden. But hey, vote based on bullshit and bullshit is what you'll get.

Biden's washed up and frankly stupid.
Poor Trump supporters have nothing  to say but they wish President Biden does the same things as Trump.  Lol
People prodding Congressman to back Biden are asking to load an atomic bomb on the White House.
Democrats know he's a turd so their new campaign is they hate Trump so much they'll "Settle for Biden."

Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Why isn't Trump just replaying this idiot as his own campaign ads. Just replay what Biden says then announce at the end, "I approve this message"
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.

Just saw segment on ‚ÄúInside Edition‚Äù about your interview with VP Biden and the Cognitive Test question.  Given the context vis a vis the President, I think it was entirely appropriate to ask.  VP Biden‚Äôs response was a little over the top.  You did ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Yes can‚Äôt wait for Biden to make you look üëÄ like the babbling fool you are
It‚Äôs Shrodingers Biden. Until he and He face off, he‚Äôs both a normal Biden and a Superior Biden.
Joe Biden should start a debate with this verse:
Joe Biden is not a devout Catholic because he does not accept the Church's teaching on abortion and same sex marriage.
You are the driver of a trolly, on one set of tracks is a rabid dog, on the other set of tracks are the squad, Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, Sanders, Schiff, and Nadler. You have a choice switch tracks and kill rabid dog or switch tracks and save rabid dog but kill the group just named

I just don‚Äôt know how Biden will be able to take your guns if Obama already took them.
We need the $ since Biden has the MSM propaganda for free!
I feel like us conservatives are starting to call things racist that aren‚Äôt actually racist. We‚Äôre starting to use a more obscure, ambiguous definition of racism instead of the actual definition. I‚Äôm pretty sure even Candace has said something to the same effect as VP Biden did.
I‚Äôm with Biden! All the way Biden!
Be after almost 4 years the debate doesn‚Äôt really matter most good Americans already no who they want and the debate won‚Äôt change anything and we are tired of your lies / Joe Biden for president
Democrats party may need to elect a new presidential candidate quickly, Biden is losing it at a alarming rate. They will be begging the Republicans to delay the election.
Why is Joe‚Äôs wife, a doctor, displaying Joe‚Äôs in complement medical condition, it‚Äôs embarrassing for him and the Democrats party. Joe Biden will NEVER NEVER NEVER debate President Trump.
So do we really have to settle for Biden...........?
Biden is a disgrace to the American people. He has a just in politics for political and self interest gain.

You where suppose to do that about 3 years ago and now that you‚Äôre loosing against Biden your getting desperate and I‚Äôm still not voting for you
The first thing I want President Biden to do is to appoint a commission of Republicans and Democrats to find every official hired under Trump so they can be fired and review every agency rule changed and due process that change to ascertain if it‚Äôs a necessary change.
I WANT HIM, HIS FAMILY, AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TO CONTRACT COVID-19 AND DIE!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
I actually was sort of being sarcastic. I don‚Äôt think people will bitch because a) Biden has a penis and b) pandemic (please note which is the secondary reason!), but I will HOWL with laughter if they do.
Great point.  Bernie's actions after he dropped out and shamed his Berners to vote for Biden should give Berners pause on who to believe in the "women can't win a POTUS campaign" feud.
Oh, hush.
Yup. Who ever it is will be selected by Obama/.Hillary Biden's whole team and cabinet if he wins will be an extension of the Obama/Hillary regime.   My long long shot as crazy as it sounds is Warren.

It should read ‚Äúlet‚Äôs scrap the presidential debate since sleepy, creapy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt hold his own against Trump‚Äù
As for me I am voting "one time" for Trump and hopefully we do get twice as many votes that will out match the double votes for Biden.
I agree but doubt Biden will ever debate at all.  Unless the Dems have a magic wake-up potion, Biden is incapable. If he does debate, watch out for the earpiece he'll be wearing so his handlers can feed him all his responses.
It's not only cognitive. Most of the time Biden is mumbling and slurring his words so we can't understand what he's even trying to say.  A sure sign of dementia.
I mean sure, but the issue is that they constantly accuse Biden of being senile and declining mentally.  He did take 2 tries at it and still couldn't get it.
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS, NARCISSISTIC, SUBHUMAN POST ABORTION SCUM!!!!!  WE MUST RID OURSELVES OF THE CANCER WHICH IS YOU!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020

People will tell you everything they hate about Trump but can‚Äôt tell you what they like about Biden üòÇ
All Bernie fans stay home and dont vote.  We know u truly dont think Biden is competent.
Biden should be in prison. Lock him up! He was involved in the COUP to over throw a President, backrooms China dealing for his son, Ukraine threatened to lose billions in America aid if Hunter‚Äôs criminal investigations isn‚Äôt stopped.
You‚Äôre right Trump is on Earth while Biden is lost somewhere in the universe üòÇ
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.
I do not support democrats giving out a payment check for a Joe Biden vote.  Know what I am say make sense. And here's why.  It is only those that have been laid off because of COVID-19.  That would require some kind of stimulus to supplement their income for the moment.

Biden has already signaled Larry Summers will have a role in his further demolition of the American serf.
Yep, they need to protect Biden from his gaffes. Also, he would do very poorly against Trump even on his best day.
Biden‚Äôs pick for VP is not based on abilities, it‚Äôs based on color and sex
Maybe just maybe Dem never Trumpers should grow a spine and run a candidate that can win by and for the people. Not a sheepdog (Bernie) or a basket case (Biden). The people you know are cowards and hypocrites that are the problem not the solution.
The sad thing is EVERY Biden voter will be waiting in line for this...
IF he debates, he'll wear an earpiece and his handlers will be telling him what to say. If he doesn't, we all know why. Any of his VP possibles would be a disaster for U.S. (and the world) yet one would take over w/in months of a Biden election.
IF Biden debates, he'll wear an earpiece and his handlers will be telling him what to say. If he doesn't, we'll all know why.  The VP short list is a disaster, any of the possibles, for our country and the bet is Biden won't hold the presidency more than a few months.
According to Lincoln Project folks all they need do is persuade 3% of Trump voters to vote for Biden and Trump will be handily beaten.
Like I said I wasn‚Äôt a big Biden fan but you trump supporters are all the same no brains about what a conman is bu most Americans will remind you in November BOY
Well your not to bright when it comes to you support on trump but first of all you can say what ever you want about Biden I‚Äôm not a big supporter of hi ms but I‚Äôm voting for him over conman trump  get ready for a big let down in November
Schumer is a Sinophobe Zionist same as Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, Hoyer and the rest of the D's. They are trying to show they are tough on China while Israel continues with their ethnic cleansing and apartheid of the Palestinian people.
IS THER NO WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO YOU HOW MUCH PERIL, TRUMP HAS PUT US IN, IS THERE?????  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, 2020 AND VOTE BLUE!!!!!
Trump created better jobs for ALL, a strong economy and a reinforced military. despite your maliciousness and crucifixion of our president Mr. Trump has been MAGA! He did away with the divisive identity politics of Obama/Biden and was working hard to bring us together again.
Incompetent?  LOL that you'd think Biden w/ his half-mind working could have done even 1-% of what Mr. Trump has accomplished for our country.
See re Evan McMullin. Why are racists trying to help Biden win, why are GOP helping Biden win primary {or at least taking credit}, why are CIA officers backing this other GOP bag of white supremacists? They have a good thing going, Don‚ÄôT is too open.
...  or Covid19. You are as corrupt as they come with a page out of Hillary's book. Under a Biden presidency our country is lost - gone to the highest bidder.
#Vote Even if you‚Äôre not a Biden fan, vote Trump out and well sort it all out later. A non vote is a vote for Trump and we can‚Äôt do another 4 years with him. We‚Äôll be in a dictatorship!
I am not voting for Trump, Biden, or Howie even though I am a registered Green and have voted Green in the past.  I would not have voted for Bernie either as he is also a Dem. Maybe Biden will call Bernie to be his VP as a reward for being his sheepdog. :-)
Trumps now banning tik tok, so to now watch 15 year olds belly dance, now you‚Äôll have toget on a plane with Joe Biden
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS NARCISSISTIC SUBHUMAN POST ABORTION SCUM!!!!!!  YOU HAVE OVER 154,500 DEATHS ON YOUR BLOODY HANDS!!!!!  CONTRACT COVID-19 AND DIE!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Biden is a President for all Americans not just a racist base #EveryonesLaughingAtYouDonald
That being said I wonder what Vegas has the odds at for Biden announcing Charli D‚ÄôAmelio as his pick for VP.
Chatter has it that Biden will pick Bernie.  Bernie is waiting for the call.
More lies like your last ads.  Biden supports police no defunding
YES VOTE BIDEN 2020. #Biden2020Landslide #BlueWave2020 #JoeBiden2020
My updated non expert (but again no one knows more than me) opinion on who Biden should pick for VP
It's time to stop laughing and making fun of Biden's obvious mental decline and focus on his new leftist policies.  What's happened to him will happen to many of us and making fun of it will only alienate many older voters...and it's not really funny.  Seriously.
Come on...Harris is quite unlikeable, has tons of baggage and is very off-putting to many voters.  The only good thing about her as VP pick is that she will help Biden lose.
BACKFIRED, AND IS NOW DEVASTATING MOSTLY RED STATES, SQUARELY PUTTING TRAITOR TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, THANK YOU!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!

JOE BIDEN WILL LOSE! Trump 2020 Biooch!
I don't need anybodies propaganda or talking points as I look at the facts on the ground to make my own judgements. Biden was behind the 1990s crime bill that put many Blacks in prison, yet DNC is hiding that point.
Joe Biden seems to be having some serious issues with memory loss and possible dementia. The DNC knows this better than we do so I'm wondering if they'll pull a switch at their convention meeting.
And by that you mean like two or three people, none of which is the candidate, several of which are Warrenistas, right? Joe Biden has not been ‚Äúdrumbeating‚Äù against her for 12 straight months. He has had her front and center campaigning with him.
Well turnabout is fair play. Biden (Obama) is going to kick his ass in November as long as we get out the vote. So we need to make sure everyone votes.
How could she even be considered.  Biden campaign should have know this long ago!  Un-Figgen-believable!  Here‚Äôs to hoping he doesn‚Äôt have morons running his campaign.
Fr Joe just mad his only good song got remixes by Jay Z and he dissed tf outta him on his own beatüòÇüòÇüòÇbut what‚Äôs funny was that Joe Biden could even come back cuz Hov was the president of Def Jam at the time so if Budden dissed him back he was gonna be firedüòÇüòÇ

I'm ridin' with Biden amd just made my first donation!!
I think of Biden as the sorbet after bad oysters - a light, unobtrusive  palette cleanse to settle the nerves before embarking on dessert.
I see people saying it's a deal breaker, but what do you mean by that? If Biden picked her, you'd vote for Trump? Just trying to understand.

Biden's dementia must be catching.  Don't get too close, Bette.
I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
As I sit in the waiting room at the tire shop, they had the news on.  The news only talked about the same 3 things over and over.   1. Covid Bullshit  2. Trump is a bad person and president  3.  Vote Biden  Shit is annoying.
This is the truth behind why CHINA JOE BIDEN is acting how he is acting  To say he has DEMENTIA would lesson the jail sentence he might get if POTUS TRUMP &amp; true REPUBLICANS would investigate a life time 40+year government official&amp; family has become a millionaires on tax dollars
I do agree with you that Biden is a bad candidate. So, we do have something in common there.

I am an old white haired white guy that is so tired of a bunch of old white haired white guys keeping the left down. Trump, Mitch, Biden, Bernie, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer.....should all be living in the basement of their grandkids.
Exactly.  Plus his handlers knew in advance and ran a scam and they should be held accountable. To me It is obvious that Biden is a front man for the Obama/Hillary cabal.
You literally tweeted a Biden ad....
"Only serve one term" ? ? I don't think he will even finish his term.  Should Biden win, why do some assume he'll only serve one term?
LOL! Dems can lead?! The most corrupt, self-interested hypocrites on the planet can lead?  Obama/Biden sure did a great job w/ H1N1, right? You have to be 50 paces behind stupid.
The 2007-2009 housing crash created more suburban rental properties in our neighborhood than any Obama-Biden fair housing initiatives. Our beautiful neighborhood is still being bought up by investors. #45LIES
Yes, a local Walmart here in Phoenix has a very bright autistic young man as their greeter. He is friendly and alert. I think Biden could do just as well as this young man. Maybe not better but just as well.

A $600 bonus, being paid not to work, is the most stupid idea ever. Obviously you are joining Biden in using half brains.
Once again we have proof that Biden does NOT think for himself and needs his handlers to give him printed talking points to get out a coherent word.  If Harris is his VP choice all the better. Not only is she very unlikeable, she has a ton of her own baggage to add to his.

Biden is amazing!  I bet he puts on his Superman costume and flies
With all those deaths, why are we worried about the kung flu again?  Why does our population continue to grow as well?  It's like we're losing over 10% of our population every year.  Are you sure that's not joe biden?
Just a Trump ploy to siphon votes from Biden. Maybe if there was a normal candidate, it would be a good try.  Voting for Kanye would be a waste of time
I've also endorsed Mr. Biden.
I am a delegate in my precinct and I will be voting for Mark Kelly and Joe Biden this year. I wish them great success.

What a wicked web they weave...blast in Beirut, Biden's, Ukraine....the Storm is coming
Agreed. It would be a waste of time, for Biden
Looks like the Dems are preparing for Biden not to attend the debates.
The debate would be a no contest for Biden. Biden would out show Trump.
üëã Biden probably says he has said that from the start.
You need to be in Biden Admin
Agreed. Biden would have answers and Trump would spew lies. It would be a waste of time
Yeah, for your information I'm a retired Marine,  who works a full time job.  The fact that I like playing games, sure does irritate biden supporters though.

Typical Biden supporter.  He says we are all the things he supports.  Biden is 100% evil, so he supports evil.  He also is portraying himself as a murderer from a comic book (evil).  You can't make it up.

Protecting Joe Biden From a Debate, and Susan Rice, 'by the Book'
Pls think about this. DJT gets the airtime every day now to lie. Would love to see Joe Biden do a press conference after his or maybe the next day to refute the lies. I live in Az. Today everything he said about covid in Az was a complete lie.
Everything he said about Arizona's cauvet numbers was a lie. Yet the media keeps giving him free airtime for lies and then there's no correction. I would like to see Joe Biden do a press conference after trump and correct all the lies.
What if Joe Biden did a press conference after trump everyday and  Corrected his lies in his exaggerations and his facts and figures. It's starting to be too much. For example I'm from Arizona in today everything he said about Arizona was totally incorrect.
But she doesn't support Biden. Not ok.
At the risk of sounding tin foil hatish, Jill biden said Joe will definitely debate trump, we don't even know the date but we know Joe isn't real cognitive now &amp; is getting worse, are they considering a joe biden impersonater?
Trump is scared to death to debate biden....  worst economy in American history.
look how he tries to sneakily tries to find out if this narrative will work especially on biden fans to get biden out of debating,  knowing full well Biden isn't healthy enough to debate
But, will biden pass the sniff test?

People who hate Biden are the ones who would write stuff under "creepy Joe". There are so many conspiracy theories and lies on the internet. I try to stay away from all of them.

Even if he's running as an independent. I believe he's going to pull votes from Biden. Like I said earlier I don't believe there is a single Republican out there they would vote for a black man. So all votes will be from Independence and Democrats

Omg, he is not going to be on all 50 states. Therefore he has no chance of being president. His main reason with the help of the Trump campaign is to siphon votes away from Joe Biden and putting asshole back in the White House
I figure the electoral college will steal the election from Biden.  Best hope, concentrate on Senate races.  Even if Joe wins he‚Äôll be needing a majority there or it‚Äôll be four years of spinning his wheels.
If Kanye West is not going to be on all 50 states, he is not a serious candidate. Can't the states that he is on remove him because he has no chance of being president and it's just a ploy to take votes from Joe Biden.
What y'all need to consider is that Biden isn't free from criticism; nobody, for that matter, is, including Bernie.

Biden knows exactly what he is doing

I heard what i heard and you both mocked his stutter. Stuttering is a disability. Mocking a disability has no place on radio. As someone who had delayed speech and still has issues speaking at times similar to Biden you cant change my mind.
FYI, this isn't a #Trump vs #Biden issue  this is about mocking disabilities. Those comments made by  and  about questioning Biden's ability based on a stutter is bigoted and just plain wrong.
yall should be ashamed of yourselves.  and  should be off the air for mocking those with speech issues. I had delayed speech and it was disgusting  that #GaydosAndChad mocked Biden's stutter. I am NEVER listening to this station again. #Boycott
I'm sorry I disagree. I think Kamala Harris is a very intelligent lady and very capable of being VP and the president of the United States in 2024. That's right I said it. she's going to run for president in 2024!  We all know Joe Biden is a one-term president.
Republicans are helping Kanye West get on the ballots in key States. This will take votes away from Joe Biden, given Trump the win. He's not going to be on every state, just the key States. No one vote for this idiot Kanye West. Democrats need to band together and vote together!
I pretty much loathe Biden and his politics.  He is a liar and a dim bulb, but Democrats are heartless and cruel running this guy. It's appalling.  And our shit media is doing everything they can to ignore, prop up and promote this potted plant. Shameful.

Sometimes I wonder if both Trump and Biden actually want to be elected...
Presidents who have lacked electoral experience have a tendency to be overmatched in domestic politics. If you care about the outcome of a Biden presidency if his brain hemorrhages two weeks in, it matters. This isn‚Äôt tearing anyone apart if I vote the ticket anyway. Get a grip.
Seriously, cut the shit: I would pick any of the women Biden had over Rice. My preference would be someone who has served as either a member of Congress or a Governor
Jill Biden should be ashamed of herself!
Pay close attention to Biden's choice for VP, that's who is really running for President since Biden would be lucky to last long past inauguration day since any cabinet will invoke the 25th amendment quickly.
Just like Republicans to pick on people. You know Joe Biden has a stutter, that you want to make fun of handicapped people. Republicans are nothing but assholes and hypocrites. Have you heard Trump trying to speak
I hate that by criticizing biden people assume you're a trump supporter. UM, NOA
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden but I can‚Äôt honestly blame anyone for not voting for him because he sucks. About the only reason why I‚Äôll bother is that stacking the Supreme Court with ok justices may be a necessary precondition to the kind of changes I would like to see.

That is the way I look at Biden supporters!
Beth, just curious if you‚Äôd still vote for Biden if he does 0 interviews and 0 debates before the election?
No loss to explain Granma, laindslide in 2020 for Trump. Biden will need all the excuse's to explain his loss to all his money loss to his doners !!
the longer he waits the more it re-enforces trumps claim that biden is 'slow'  he needs to move already on this

biden is trying to get the muslim vote......why isnt he more concerned with America and not muslims.???? biden is a puppet for the muslims and the chinese....he is not for America.

Mr Biden, please select a good candidate for your vice-president. None of the ladies shown on your list will win you any votes, as a matter of fact they will cost you my vote and most likely a bunch of others.  I am a registered Republican, willing to vote for you.
Not a subscriber, so I can‚Äôt read all of it... but I don‚Äôt need to.  Until the system is fixed, this is always a vote for the lesser of two evils. Now is not the time for mental masturbation on the woulda, coulda or shoulda... now is the time to make things better. Biden is that.
I‚Äôm confused. Why would Biden want a Republican as a running mate?
You are right trump shifted course but from March to early June he let fauci run the country and supported lockdowns which hurt him politically because the economy was his best bet. I still hope trump will win because we can‚Äôt afford senile Biden to win that would be a disaster.
The economic devastation caused by the lockdowns has hurt trump and helped Biden‚Äôs chances. Also you keep citing polls to defend your policies on covid instead of defending the efficacy of the policy. You seem to not care what the best policy actually is but what polls say.
Imho Warren is not a great choice.  She can do much more for Biden, as AG.  The VP should be someone younger, just in case .  My fav. is gone (Stacey).  No matter who, I will vote for Joe. üòé
And you still deserve it. Sweden did no lockdown and flattened the curve anyway while keeping their economy strong. The economic devastation caused by The lockdowns has been Biden‚Äôs best asset and you should Apologize for being part of The movement that panicked trump into this.
I think he should pick    Biden has no good VP choices in the field under consideration
No masks. No social distancing! Good job!  Btw, why would there be Biden supporters at your crowd infection rally?
And they are still hiding biden in the basement until after the election......they are so afraid for biden to speak because they know he cannot speak intelligently.  Another dodge by the dems to try and steal the election. they are so corrupt they are losing all common sense.
Rest assured  secret police. When Biden is elected. We will out you. And you will pay a price for your betrayal to the American people. That's a promise.
Just like Republicans, lie and conspiracy theories. Biden ran the country for eight years done an excellent job. And the economy that he built, you take credit for! Lol you idiot
How many years after Biden is President do you think Trump will still be taking credit for everything that Biden does?
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton‚Äôs ex-WH spokesman says  #FoxNews  another coward move by democrats to steal the election.....keep biden from debating Trump and he wont show how mentally disabled he really is.

Their net worths increased because the government shut down their small government competition and they were able to take advantage because they were well connected. It wasn‚Äôt the result of brilliant free market capitalism. Also lol at you thinking Biden isn‚Äôt too senile.
Ignoring that not being Biden is a pretty good reason to vote for him since Biden is senile and would be a puppet of the radical left. How is pointing out the lockdowns have caused income disparity since massive corps have taken advantage of The closures not conservative?

Honor, honesty, civility, tolerance, compassion, spirit.  Biden might be able to uplift these virtues.  But each and everyone of us needs to live and breath these ideals to restore our society.

Funny parody of Biden.
Let‚Äôs go back to the years of Obama / Biden.  It‚Äôs at that point NOW with Economy &amp; Unemployment &amp; another Virus lije 2009-2010 from a China.    Also No jobs &amp; Food lines .
Right now America is back to the levels of Obama / Biden 8 years in office.  In the Dumpster for Americans.    Not going back to those years. !!
Where Trump came from was that 8 years of Obama/ Biden was a ZERO. Did nothing for the Blacks   All for just themselves.  Hillary was I the wings waiting but should have been charged for Treason acts &amp; many violations of The Govt rules she signed to do &amp; didnt !! That‚Äôs why Trump
Speaker &amp; Dem House Representatives &amp; Chuck Schumer are PRO China over USA.   FBI today said to US Congress members they are seeing China supporting &amp; trying to influence Americans to get Joe Biden In office. That per Director Chris Wray report.
Democrats NOT want these (4) Bills against China be allowed to go forward. They all Protect Americans ..  Is it because Joe &amp; Hunter Biden have deep $$$$ ties to (CCP ) China Party. Hunter still working for a China. Why wouldn‚Äôt Speaker Pelosi want to hold China accountable on..
QUESTION: WHAT KIND OF A PERSON IS JOE BIDEN? HE IS SCARED TO GO BEFORE ANYBODY ALONE &amp; HAVE A REGULAR CONVERSATION 1 ON 1 ABOUT ANYTHING.WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT WOULD THAT BE? ISN'T HE SUPPOSED TO TAKE A PHYSICAL &amp; TESTS TO QUALIFY FOR ANY GOV.JOB?

Pretty sad response.  99% of future Americans will be paying the bill on this for years to come.  Not just Tennessee.  Embrace Biden's economic plan and work together for better jobs and wages.  Tennessee voters expect more as well.

Biden is not the President! This is Trump‚Äôs legacy!
They know that anyone selected for Biden's Vice-President will be President in short order, either through the 25th Amendment or because he resigns. I don't believe he wants to be President, he just wants to go down in history with the title; Biden thinks he's entitled to it.
I think Biden pick for VP will be Susan Rice that will place the Obama admin right back in the White House of course I‚Äôm praying we never have to find out trump 2020

CNN has hooked another one I see. Joe Biden lied to all of us again about his cognitive problems. Test oh yea I've had many? 3 weeks ago, now he says hell no I won't take a test or have taken 1. Your insane if that's what you want for president. hahahahaha
Your wrong, Biden does condone Lenin's statue as this one in NW Seattle.

Thats why after that first Stimulus Bill was passed, talks about a 2 nd impeachment was going on, remember that? Now its hushed to the public because the first one was a joke, they want Biden to win
My point was while Hillary was running for president before June, the DNC finally meantion their VP, who was he and where is he today? Biden has ran for President before against who and how many times did he put his hat in for the job?
Mr. President, have a great golf round today!  You need and deserve it!  The polls are lies.  Beijing Biden is like a groundhog, popping up long enough to make another stupid gaffe.  Pls do what you can to urge AG Barr to indict and prosecute the Obama criminals.

Biden is definitely going to hurt the self proclaimed false god of the fake evangelicals &amp; that is DONALD TRUMP.
It‚Äôs well known that BIDEN stutters. That doesn‚Äôt mean cognitive function is impaired. Two different things. The clips here are too short to demonstrate those issues. What‚Äôs your excuse for being a mean- spirited petty Jerk? Oh right .... dad.
I think this has more merit than people think. It really only takes one large gaffe/action from Biden to illustrate that yeah he can‚Äôt be the nominee. However, who do you turn to? Harris? Warren? Klobuchar? Not exactly a bunch of needle movers as evidenced by the dem primary.
Why isn't Trump just replaying this idiot as his own campaign ads. Just replay what Biden says then announce at the end, "I approve this message"

They r going to be really upset when they learn how many former Democrat voters, (like myself) vote for Trump. Democrats have abandon the American people - Patriots. Trump will win in a landslide. Biden is self destructing. The debates will expose him and destroy his campaign.
Just imagine how wonderful it‚Äôs going to be when Trump wins by a landslide because of vote by mail. Or perhaps there will have to be a second round of voting because the voter fraud is so apparent and wide spread. Trump remains in office while Biden hides and hopes.

Omg, he is not going to be on all 50 states. Therefore he has no chance of being president. His main reason with the help of the Trump campaign is to siphon votes away from Joe Biden and putting asshole back in the White House
I figure the electoral college will steal the election from Biden.  Best hope, concentrate on Senate races.  Even if Joe wins he‚Äôll be needing a majority there or it‚Äôll be four years of spinning his wheels.
If Kanye West is not going to be on all 50 states, he is not a serious candidate. Can't the states that he is on remove him because he has no chance of being president and it's just a ploy to take votes from Joe Biden.
What y'all need to consider is that Biden isn't free from criticism; nobody, for that matter, is, including Bernie.

get this shit...! trump‚Äôs refusing to debate Biden in the 4th debate unless sean hannity is a moderator?
I heard what i heard and you both mocked his stutter. Stuttering is a disability. Mocking a disability has no place on radio. As someone who had delayed speech and still has issues speaking at times similar to Biden you cant change my mind.
There will be no ‚Äúfuture‚Äù for Bill Barr in the Biden Presidency
FYI, this isn't a #Trump vs #Biden issue  this is about mocking disabilities. Those comments made by  and  about questioning Biden's ability based on a stutter is bigoted and just plain wrong.
yall should be ashamed of yourselves.  and  should be off the air for mocking those with speech issues. I had delayed speech and it was disgusting  that #GaydosAndChad mocked Biden's stutter. I am NEVER listening to this station again. #Boycott
So Republican hacks are truing to get Kanye West on the ballot to steal votes from Biden. LoL
Either one would be great? If Biden were to choose Kamala and lost the election, would she lose her senatorial seat?
Wait. How did Biden get a car in his basement?
I'm sorry I disagree. I think Kamala Harris is a very intelligent lady and very capable of being VP and the president of the United States in 2024. That's right I said it. she's going to run for president in 2024!  We all know Joe Biden is a one-term president.
Republicans are helping Kanye West get on the ballots in key States. This will take votes away from Joe Biden, given Trump the win. He's not going to be on every state, just the key States. No one vote for this idiot Kanye West. Democrats need to band together and vote together!
I pretty much loathe Biden and his politics.  He is a liar and a dim bulb, but Democrats are heartless and cruel running this guy. It's appalling.  And our shit media is doing everything they can to ignore, prop up and promote this potted plant. Shameful.
Can Biden‚Äôs handlers throw in the towel if he‚Äôs getting beaten too badly during the debate???
Biden can multitask, I'm sure! Besides, he'll have a qualified AG to deal with it for him!
Then Pence better watch his back...he‚Äôs been complicit and I don‚Äôt think Biden would pardon him.
Now it all makes sense. The twitter young guns are Democrats. Makes perfect sense why they think they're always right when in fact they're usually wrong. Whoever is a Biden supporter is as mushy as Biden himself. Makes perfect sense now.

Trump does hours long combative interviews. Of course they are gonna get some hits in. Joe Biden can‚Äôt even do friendly interview from zoom without completely losing it. If I am the Biden campaign i legit don‚Äôt let him speak again. Surprised they did let him today.
They are pretty much dead set on hoping Biden can be entirely carried by the media to the White House.
I actually was sort of being sarcastic. I don‚Äôt think people will bitch because a) Biden has a penis and b) pandemic (please note which is the secondary reason!), but I will HOWL with laughter if they do.
The interview was a disaster. Trump's obviously unprepared, he came across as completely self-absorbed, Narcissistic and out of touch with reality. A total loser.  Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign
BREAKING: Biden Will NOT Travel To Accept Democrat Nomination
Oh, hush.
Considering there literally is a presidential candidate called Joe Biden who cant finish a sentence,  not sure why you're protecting
Sometimes I wonder if both Trump and Biden actually want to be elected...
I have a hunch Trump will back out &amp; not debate. I just don't see him capable of pulling it together enough with his current mental decline to do it, &amp; he can't bullshit himself around Biden with stupid slogans, name calling, or bullying.
Presidents who have lacked electoral experience have a tendency to be overmatched in domestic politics. If you care about the outcome of a Biden presidency if his brain hemorrhages two weeks in, it matters. This isn‚Äôt tearing anyone apart if I vote the ticket anyway. Get a grip.
It will be when Biden kicks your butt out of office!!!!
Sorta counting on Democrats/ would produce a better candidate than Biden. I‚Äôm an Independent, so lesser of two evils gets my vote. Trump: orange guy, did ok with economic gains. Biden: Career politician for over 40 years and did nothing. Proven racist.
Seriously, cut the shit: I would pick any of the women Biden had over Rice. My preference would be someone who has served as either a member of Congress or a Governor

Pay close attention to Biden's choice for VP, that's who is really running for President since Biden would be lucky to last long past inauguration day since any cabinet will invoke the 25th amendment quickly.
Just like Republicans to pick on people. You know Joe Biden has a stutter, that you want to make fun of handicapped people. Republicans are nothing but assholes and hypocrites. Have you heard Trump trying to speak
I hate that by criticizing biden people assume you're a trump supporter. UM, NOA
And Joe Biden helped him.
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden but I can‚Äôt honestly blame anyone for not voting for him because he sucks. About the only reason why I‚Äôll bother is that stacking the Supreme Court with ok justices may be a necessary precondition to the kind of changes I would like to see.
Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt even read his own tweet with stammering... there is no way in hell he writes these weak ass tweets.
If Joe Biden can‚Äôt debate Donald Trump, how could he possibly negotiate a trade deal with a a foreign leader?

Speaking about the oppressed people of color ..Republicans are going to key states to get Kanye's name on the ballot so they will vote for him and not Biden to ensure  Trump victory...help..see Bryan Tyler Cohen's tweets and video he is a fact checker and opinion writer.
Biden and Trump both talk like it‚Äôs last call at the bar.
so Kanyes gonna try to steal some Biden vote in swing states?  throw election to Trump?  that's strategy?

That is the way I look at Biden supporters!
KKK backs Trump American Communist party backs Biden. Biden is therefore a communist lackey.

Not a single sign, Flag or bumper sticker. Not even any mail from the Biden campaign.
the longer he waits the more it re-enforces trumps claim that biden is 'slow'  he needs to move already on this
91 days to the election. Joe is still the presumptive nominee. Joe has not identified his choice for VP. Joe is not on any official ballot. Joe rarely appears in public and speaks for himself. No Biden lawn signs/bumper stickers. Joe is a certain loser.

Yang gang could use some more vocal unpopular opinions.  If blue vibes dominate the vocal crowd, that‚Äôs cool. But I know it‚Äôs not the 50%+. Possibly a strategic Biden endorsement discouraged many non-Dems from openly rejecting bossmans plan?  Either way, we need red tolerance.
You need to have a word with Jill Biden!
Hell yes Biden has dementia. The disturbing aspect of this is that Jill Biden is allowing her husband to be USED by the Democrats. Disgusting!
So in other words zero elected experience. If Biden died midway through his first term could she successfully run on her own? I‚Äôm doubtful.
The corrupt in DC have no interest in the American people. Their mobs are killing people daily, ruining businesses, and terrorizing communities. They want to destroy America. Biden is a participating pawn. Less than 100 days to election and he‚Äôs still the presumptive nominee.
I can‚Äôt believe this either! Especially Biden Dementia voters!
She's a liar. She just got done posting for Biden that Latinos are suffering so much.  This is bullshit.  My entire family and everyone the people my family and I know are not suffering.   Several of us have had covid but we are all self sufficient.  Liars.

Advise Biden not to debate, really? Even if Trump was a trickster, how would Biden fair in the REAL WORLD if elected? Should he avoid any future debate with world leaders? Perhaps it would be best to keep Biden in the White House basement, and away from ALL public eyes.
I do not support democrats giving out a payment check for a Joe Biden vote.  Know what I am say make sense. And here's why.  It is only those that have been laid off because of COVID-19.  That would require some kind of stimulus to supplement their income for the moment.

Bernie's power in the Senate, where laws are made, is greatly enhaned if we win the presidency and the Senate. Bernie becomes the ranking member on committees.   Not voting for Biden works against Bernie.
No, I don't see that. We have a lot of great, talented, black women in the running. I can see Kamala Harris, Val Demings, Karen Bass, Susan Rice, &amp; Keisha Lance Bottoms as wonderful options. I'm still a bit undecided about Stacey Abrams, but it won't deter me from voting 4 Biden.
Mr Biden, please select a good candidate for your vice-president. None of the ladies shown on your list will win you any votes, as a matter of fact they will cost you my vote and most likely a bunch of others.  I am a registered Republican, willing to vote for you.
Not a subscriber, so I can‚Äôt read all of it... but I don‚Äôt need to.  Until the system is fixed, this is always a vote for the lesser of two evils. Now is not the time for mental masturbation on the woulda, coulda or shoulda... now is the time to make things better. Biden is that.

Who cares. Hopefully the IRS or the Biden DOJ can tie up his money forever.
This is Biden‚Äôs world....
You are right trump shifted course but from March to early June he let fauci run the country and supported lockdowns which hurt him politically because the economy was his best bet. I still hope trump will win because we can‚Äôt afford senile Biden to win that would be a disaster.
The economic devastation caused by the lockdowns has hurt trump and helped Biden‚Äôs chances. Also you keep citing polls to defend your policies on covid instead of defending the efficacy of the policy. You seem to not care what the best policy actually is but what polls say.
Imho Warren is not a great choice.  She can do much more for Biden, as AG.  The VP should be someone younger, just in case .  My fav. is gone (Stacey).  No matter who, I will vote for Joe. üòé
And you still deserve it. Sweden did no lockdown and flattened the curve anyway while keeping their economy strong. The economic devastation caused by The lockdowns has been Biden‚Äôs best asset and you should Apologize for being part of The movement that panicked trump into this.

100% Agree. Harris or Demings nullify all the Law and Order candidate BS.   And who better to negotiate Police reforms than someone who has been in law or policing.   Both are better orators than Biden.
I don‚Äôt want trump to win and if Biden was to come out strongly for #MedicareForAll then sure I‚Äôd vote for him, but after campaigning &amp; voting for  in 2016 trying to keep trump only to spend four years being blamed for her loss, I‚Äôm immune to accepting blame there.

Biden weighs in on trump &amp; Ducey and #coronavirus in Arizona. Definitely shows Democrats increasing confidence of their chances and pushes Trump to defend.
And if Biden loses the White vote (like all Democratic candidates since 1976) and "only" gets 51% of the Black vote, White pundits will blame Black voters because those pundits favor the status quo over liberty and justice for all.
Decency out numbers ignorant cult members. Joe Biden will be our next president. We're also flipping the senate.
And if Biden loses both the White vote (like all Democratic candidates since 1976) and "only" gets 51% of the Black vote, White pundits will blame Black voters because those pundits favor the status quo over liberty and justice for all.
And why didn‚Äôt he in the last 40 years in Washington, how did his son, not the entire country, be come wealthy when Biden was put in charge of Ukraine..I don‚Äôt believe in huge coincidences, but please do list the crimes you have emphatically stated so I too can‚Äôt hate trump.thnx

And I say he can be a Catholic just fine without having to agree with everything his church has ever felt. I‚Äôm pretty sure no one (including the popes) could ever have been a Catholic under these standards. Which is the #1 reason your entire hit on Biden is just so dumb.
You sure make a lot of assumptions about Biden and his church. Again, I‚Äôd love you kind of inside info. Everything is a political football and they are mostly all dumb. This one is particularity stupid.

I did that last time with Trump because Hilary Clinton is evil-minded. I want to vote Biden because I don't want Trump to win again. Biden is the lesser of 2 evils but I just can't vote for either of them. What if my vote counts as the single vote that could shut Trump down? LOL

Neither was I, but you spoke with so much certainly about Biden, his faith and his standing as Catholic that I figured you must have had some inside information.
This has been a mess in so many ways. Biden‚Äôs first mistake was to make his VP pick all about identity politics. I understand the reasoning for it but I still think it was a bad idea and out there for too long. The process has only gotten worse the longer it has gone on.

Biden is a hypocrite. Says he‚Äôs a Catholic but has gone even farther left concerning abortion. Biden has also been refused communion.
Democracy evolves.  But it sure shouldn‚Äôt move backwards.  If you think Biden won‚Äôt do as much in the area of rights for all groups, you have your head in a dark crevice somewhere.  That‚Äôs as romantic as I‚Äôd ever get with you.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS OUT, Mr. Biden. Ducey is killing Arizonans left and right and he only cares about pleasing the idiot in the Oval.
You have a serve and retirement economy that is unable to or afraid to go back to work. To your credit, you listen to Biden and asked AZ to wear masks and ramped up testing. Who hold a rally at a AZ mega church and  encouraged traveling on the 4th. That‚Äôs what caused a spike.

For all you pointing out that this tweet is pointless.   That's the point.   What's the point of this public exchange?: Politics.   Obvious: Biden was VP for an entire country. Ducey is governor of AZ. Biden has more followers. And, has been around in politics a lot longer.
Biden owning up to a mistake places him light years ahead of his opponent.
There is no way having Joe Biden in the White House wouldn‚Äôt be better for anyone who is of color.  You sit on your ass on Election Day, and should Trump win, enjoy watching him tear up what is left of the Bill of Rights.

All of the things leading up to this are his fault.  Even Biden, last October, posted a tweet about how foolish it was for Trump to eliminate the pandemic response team because Obama bad.
There has been 1 charge of sexual assault against Biden and it went nowhere, because it was made up.  Now let's do trump.
when Obama won you could feel the hype and love. That's what you need to win. Trump got a lot of that right now. there's no Joe excitement or hype. No bumper stickers, no lawn signs, no crowds cheering on the streets, no side organizations like "black voices for Trump". Biden L

Margaret, you just need to get over his personality and look at everything that he has accomplished the last 3 1/2 years. If you truly were a conservative Republican, then I don‚Äôt believe you could remotely even think about voting for Biden
in case anybody‚Äôs following the biden vs. ducey discourse about covid in az, things are still bad here. people don‚Äôt get test results for 2 weeks, and the main reason for slight improvement is that the mayors were finally allowed to mandate masks, which ducey blocked for months.

Joe Biden is a "devout Catholic" who supports the killing human beings in the womb.  There, I fixed it for you.
I like Harris and hope he picks her not Rice. Rice's connections with Benghazi is a PR disaster and a field day for the Republicans. It could cost Biden the election.
Proud to be a signer of this.  No other VP candidate has Bass's breadth of support across the Party. Joe Biden &amp; all who want to unify Dems should take that to heart.  You can still add your name as a delegate or DNC member to support #BassForUnityVP:

Biden hits a nerve and Ducey, sadly, gets down to Trumps level. Man he just keeps being more and more disappointing.  What if you just, ya know, admit we opened too fast and people died because of it.
they're both at least partly full of crap, though biden's criticism would be spot on if it were levied a month ago
I live in AZ and Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Testing has never been readily available and contact tracing doesn‚Äôt exist. But there‚Äôs more: if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have a test, it take sup to 2 weeks for the results. ONE lab     Processes results!

Thanks, Vice Pres. Biden: you are absolutely accurate. I almost choked on my coffee when Ducey was praised...role model my ass! And by the way, last I checked, the Navajo people wouldn‚Äôt be giving any governor gold star awards either.
v.  Twitter battle:  Biden wins !!!!!!
Yes, but Joe Biden blew me away when he was VP &amp; was asked if he supports abortion &amp; same sex marriage &amp; he said yes, even tho it‚Äôs against his church. That doesn‚Äôt sound very ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù or ‚Äúdevout‚Äù to me. Sounds more worldly. Against the church doctrine. Political, not godly.
Joe Biden flubs his intentions again.
Doug went to brown-nose Trump and now he's mad that Biden mentions how incorrect they were to act like Arizona is doing fine? Lapdog Doug failed Arizona!
I have to laugh at the ads Donald has about  Joe Biden. True to trumps nature they make for really good stand up comedy. Maybe after he loses the election he can work for SNL as a straight man.
Listen to me when I say that #team obama is a nothing burger. We all know that biden and Obama are on the same page.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a shadow third term. But if there were, George H W Bush and George W Bush would be the most guilty of it
The whole Phoenix metro area has become more centrist. Biden will win the City of Phoenix, Tempe as well as Tucson and Flagstaff. Trump will win rural areas and most of the Phoenix suburbs. AZ has a great chance of going blue.

At least Biden acknowledges that he was WRONG and has learned from his mistakes.  Trump says he NEVER makes mistakes.
Governor Ducey and Joe Biden are arguing on Twitter this morning.   LISTEN:
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Yup, trump found innocent every time, Biden should be in court and maybe will be soon thanks to Ukraine charging him, we have to see I guess..
A policy that existed for all 8 years that Biden was VP. Do your homework!
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.
Do you know anything about hunter Biden... the apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the Biden scumbag tree
Hey, Hey whataya say?  Let's give Trump a bad day!  Hey, Hey whataya gonna do? Vote for Biden, make Trump stew
Biden did hangout w/ Epstein at fundraisers &amp; such as did Obama &amp; Clinton. The policy of separating parents &amp; children at the boarder happened for all 8 yrs of his time at the Whitehouse &amp; he &amp; Obama took away much of the military benefits for members &amp; fam.

From what my Soros Antifa Thug Newsletter said, Biden is going to hide the identity of his VP for the duration of his term kinda like Masked Singer. That way we can continue the FDR presidency that HAS NEVER ENDED!

Give the biden thing a rest, Kristen!  If I didn't know better I would think she was reporting for Fox.
I mean, I‚Äôm a statistician, I know how the numbers work. What Ducey is saying is a boldfaced lie just as much as what Biden is saying is. We have improved but we are so far from out of the woods here.
Now is not the time to be tripping over your own feet Biden.  We can‚Äôt have that right now.  Don‚Äôt give any fuel to any possibility for trump to get re-elected.
The vulture circling his prey....Biden.
Joe Biden basically said that all black people think alike, and the media did not report on it at all until after he tried to 'walk back' his comments some time later.  And the media reports read like defenses of Biden.  Imagine what would have happened if Trump had said that.

Joe Biden just said the most racist thing a presidential candidate has ever said in the era of modern elections.  How does it make you feel that none of the big news organizations are covering it at all?

Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities   keep talking Joe  you numbers look worse everyday Great job !
Ducey and Biden yelling stats at each other. Ducey using the good stats, Biden using the bad ones. Only one that looks wrong to me is when Biden said AZ still has nearly 20% positive rate. Yesterday was 14% PCR positive rate.

why am i not surprised he‚Äôs a biden supporter but anyways this is soo cool!!
So, hi, Arizona resident here. You shouldn‚Äôt be bragging about anything. You‚Äôre doing everything Biden just mentioned. One of my friends had to take 3 Covid tests before it came back positive. You‚Äôre such a joke.

Your father is doing a wonderful job. At this rate if your dad keeps talking Biden could win this election taking a nap.
Just pointing out the truth. On 7/23 Brigette Gabriel posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo moment by voting for Trump. On 7/26 Lori Hendry posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo movement by voting for Trump.   Joe Biden would be proud of Lori‚Äôs plagerism.

S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
I completely agree. Let's do our best to ensure that scrutiny of Biden's female VP pick doesn't become sexist.
Is there anything Biden can say to sway votes? Dementia and some legit, racist comments (not clipped, edited, or assumptions out of context), legit racist comments but still has support. Is this the lack of diversity of thought he mentioned about the black community yesterday?
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!

The Biden Camp likes the radical Union activists who violate AZ rules by advocating for a state education ballot initiative at work. Strikes, Walkouts, Protests totally cool. Opening schools back up? Not so much.  The AZ Supreme Court later knocked that measure off the ballot.
Pro Biden means anti American
Washington Post fact-checker roasted for dismissing Biden diversity gaffe: 'He didn‚Äôt actually say this'  #FoxNews What didn‚Äôt he say?  Did it come out of his mouth, verbally, and re order by national media?  O, he meant to say...  yeah, right, HE SAID IT!
Biden can‚Äôt remember his lines. Can‚Äôt be done. I‚Äôd love to watch a silent screen for 15 minutes showcasing the shell of Joe Biden. Go for it Jim!

If Biden wins, so many people will just shut right back down and go back to sleep. Putting off any sort of hope for change for another 8-12 years and cementing neoliberalism in the Democratic Party for another decade at least.
2/ Biden will fill his cabinet, judge appointments, key positions with women and men who reflect the diversity of this nation. Not a bunch of old white men and millionaires and billionaires. People who know what it‚Äôs like for struggling families. So let‚Äôs PLEASE support the VP.
Still waiting, if anybody has a criminal record they are barred from serving...but since Biden won‚Äôt announce who will run the country if he wins, I don‚Äôt expect a speedy reply from you...enjoy
‚ÄúI never heard Aaron this concerned and worried in his entire life,‚Äù Mrs. Vaughn said in an interview. ‚ÄúHe called me and said, ‚ÄòMom, you and Dad have to take everything down. Biden has just put a huge target on everybody.‚Äô‚Äù
If Biden wins, there already is no hope of a peace process with Jewish supremacy.
guys biden just said ‚Äúobstreperous.‚Äù  Check and mate.
Make no mistake, I will still be voting for Biden in November, not because he‚Äôs a Democrat, but to get that dumpster fire out of the White House.
Why is it that  has been slow to act at virtually ever step through this pandemic but the second Joe Biden throws some shade his way he is all over that shit?  Nice priorities there, Douchey.
What has Trump done that makes him ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù? Biden is a puppet that will turn this country into an China 2.0. Full blown communist country

Biden should be praising Arizona's progress, not rooting for our state to fail. Glad to see Governor  calling him out for it!
I so hope North Carolina turns blue. Hopefully Biden and Democrats have better ads.
All of the things leading up to this are his fault.  Even Biden, last October, posted a tweet about how foolish it was for Trump to eliminate the pandemic response team because Obama bad.
There has been 1 charge of sexual assault against Biden and it went nowhere, because it was made up.  Now let's do trump.
uhoh.  Clyburn trying to take out  .  hope hes thought this through well.  his voice is very significant this cycle.  not sure she should be knee capped by him.  let Biden decide from top candidates.   seems call.  but dont force...
when Obama won you could feel the hype and love. That's what you need to win. Trump got a lot of that right now. there's no Joe excitement or hype. No bumper stickers, no lawn signs, no crowds cheering on the streets, no side organizations like "black voices for Trump". Biden L
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
I heard #MichelleObama  will be Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate!  That‚Äôs why the wait. I‚Äôd love to see Trump get smart mouthed with her. LOL.
Margaret, you just need to get over his personality and look at everything that he has accomplished the last 3 1/2 years. If you truly were a conservative Republican, then I don‚Äôt believe you could remotely even think about voting for Biden
in case anybody‚Äôs following the biden vs. ducey discourse about covid in az, things are still bad here. people don‚Äôt get test results for 2 weeks, and the main reason for slight improvement is that the mayors were finally allowed to mandate masks, which ducey blocked for months.
So... basically you are wavering between a vote for Biden and a vote for trump?  Bernie would say you suck...
No it was  Obama broke it, Trump broke it even more, Biden doesn‚Äôt know what to do
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess  via

The Dems have botched every aspect of the election AND the Covid economic recovery.   If Trump wasn‚Äôt record-setting incompetent they would be getting trounced.   Biden represents a Clinton/Obama fifth term ‚Äî but, that‚Äôs far from what most people want (or need).
Joe Biden is a "devout Catholic" who supports the killing human beings in the womb.  There, I fixed it for you.
Joe Biden has a communist platform your not Republican.
I like Harris and hope he picks her not Rice. Rice's connections with Benghazi is a PR disaster and a field day for the Republicans. It could cost Biden the election.
Proud to be a signer of this.  No other VP candidate has Bass's breadth of support across the Party. Joe Biden &amp; all who want to unify Dems should take that to heart.  You can still add your name as a delegate or DNC member to support #BassForUnityVP:
You mean Joe Biden
Biden hits a nerve and Ducey, sadly, gets down to Trumps level. Man he just keeps being more and more disappointing.  What if you just, ya know, admit we opened too fast and people died because of it.
they're both at least partly full of crap, though biden's criticism would be spot on if it were levied a month ago
I live in AZ and Joe Biden is absolutely correct. Testing has never been readily available and contact tracing doesn‚Äôt exist. But there‚Äôs more: if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have a test, it take sup to 2 weeks for the results. ONE lab     Processes results!

Thanks, Vice Pres. Biden: you are absolutely accurate. I almost choked on my coffee when Ducey was praised...role model my ass! And by the way, last I checked, the Navajo people wouldn‚Äôt be giving any governor gold star awards either.
v.  Twitter battle:  Biden wins !!!!!!
Yes, but Joe Biden blew me away when he was VP &amp; was asked if he supports abortion &amp; same sex marriage &amp; he said yes, even tho it‚Äôs against his church. That doesn‚Äôt sound very ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù or ‚Äúdevout‚Äù to me. Sounds more worldly. Against the church doctrine. Political, not godly.
Joe Biden flubs his intentions again.
Doug went to brown-nose Trump and now he's mad that Biden mentions how incorrect they were to act like Arizona is doing fine? Lapdog Doug failed Arizona!
I have to laugh at the ads Donald has about  Joe Biden. True to trumps nature they make for really good stand up comedy. Maybe after he loses the election he can work for SNL as a straight man.
Listen to me when I say that #team obama is a nothing burger. We all know that biden and Obama are on the same page.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a shadow third term. But if there were, George H W Bush and George W Bush would be the most guilty of it
The whole Phoenix metro area has become more centrist. Biden will win the City of Phoenix, Tempe as well as Tucson and Flagstaff. Trump will win rural areas and most of the Phoenix suburbs. AZ has a great chance of going blue.

At least Biden acknowledges that he was WRONG and has learned from his mistakes.  Trump says he NEVER makes mistakes.
Governor Ducey and Joe Biden are arguing on Twitter this morning.   LISTEN:
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Yup, trump found innocent every time, Biden should be in court and maybe will be soon thanks to Ukraine charging him, we have to see I guess..
A policy that existed for all 8 years that Biden was VP. Do your homework!
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.
For sure! That is why I have so much fear! The fat poopy bastard in the WH isn‚Äôt going to say ‚ÄúThank you for allowing me to be your president for 4 years. I wish Joe Biden every succes.‚Äù and then leave quietly. Not gonna happen

Biden did hangout w/ Epstein at fundraisers &amp; such as did Obama &amp; Clinton.

Miranda Devine, NY Post columnist just said and I quote "I don't think he (Joe Biden) is playing with a full deck".  In FNC.
Is this your way of making me believe the fear? If Biden &amp; Trump both tell me it's raining while the skies are clear, I'm still not going to believe it. #IndependentThinker #Rimmer
From what my Soros Antifa Thug Newsletter said, Biden is going to hide the identity of his VP for the duration of his term kinda like Masked Singer. That way we can continue the FDR presidency that HAS NEVER ENDED!
Hopefully you'll win Mr. Biden.
Joe Biden is a racist! His words yesterday:  ‚ÄúUnlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."
I know. So that makes soon to be President Biden amazing. Makes POS 45 the fool he's always been
2020 Election ‚Äúreality‚Äù‚Ä¶  HI, WA, OR, CA, IL, NY, NJ, DE, VT, MA, MD, CT, will certainly ALL go for Biden. That's 175, of the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the election right there.   As such, Biden needs just 95 more to win the White House.  BIDEN. Really?

Just going to remind you all that a vote for Kanye is a vote for trump. He literally said in the past week that he‚Äôs running to siphon votes from Biden, and he‚Äôs literally being funded by several GOP campaign organizers. Don‚Äôt be stupid. Don‚Äôt fall for it. For the love of God.
Obama won Indiana in 2008, but I think you are right. Indiana should stay red this year. If it goes blue, Biden will have won 400+ Electoral College votes.

Biden could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and I would still vote for him over Bonespurs. üòâ
It's been a bad week for Biden: Biden canceled the Wis convention.  Biden was massively outraised by Trump.  Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline was publicly questioned.  Biden made a racist comment.  Biden made another racist comment.  Biden was forced to apologize for racist comments
Give the biden thing a rest, Kristen!  If I didn't know better I would think she was reporting for Fox.
I mean, I‚Äôm a statistician, I know how the numbers work. What Ducey is saying is a boldfaced lie just as much as what Biden is saying is. We have improved but we are so far from out of the woods here.
Now is not the time to be tripping over your own feet Biden.  We can‚Äôt have that right now.  Don‚Äôt give any fuel to any possibility for trump to get re-elected.
The vulture circling his prey....Biden.
Joe Biden basically said that all black people think alike, and the media did not report on it at all until after he tried to 'walk back' his comments some time later.  And the media reports read like defenses of Biden.  Imagine what would have happened if Trump had said that.
The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community by
The idea of a conservative voting for Biden, is very un-conservative. I‚Äôm a conservative libertarian, I hate Trump, but I‚Äôm not gonna vote for a socialist!! There are 3rd party candidates people.
Predictable and transparent. Biden citing outdated numbers because the current trends don‚Äôt help him politically. Improvement in AZ is a detriment to Biden‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî simple as that.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'.
Is that the sound Biden makes when sniffing little girl‚Äôs hair?  Pshaw?
Joe Biden just said the most racist thing a presidential candidate has ever said in the era of modern elections.  How does it make you feel that none of the big news organizations are covering it at all?
Unlike African Americans, Latinos are incredibly diverse with incredibly different attitudes about different things.‚Äù  -Joe Biden
Biden is no Catholic.  However I‚Äôve no doubt he‚Äôs sniffed dozens of them.
Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities   keep talking Joe  you numbers look worse everyday Great job !
Ducey and Biden yelling stats at each other. Ducey using the good stats, Biden using the bad ones. Only one that looks wrong to me is when Biden said AZ still has nearly 20% positive rate. Yesterday was 14% PCR positive rate.
79 new COVID-19 deaths are being reported today in Arizona for a total of 4,081 known deaths.  And Ducey and Biden are in a Twitter feud.  Good morning, Arizona.
bro joe biden went for ducey‚Äôs throat
why am i not surprised he‚Äôs a biden supporter but anyways this is soo cool!!
So, hi, Arizona resident here. You shouldn‚Äôt be bragging about anything. You‚Äôre doing everything Biden just mentioned. One of my friends had to take 3 Covid tests before it came back positive. You‚Äôre such a joke.
At least Biden is not the Cold Stone Killer, Mr. Ducey
That‚Äôs not Biden tweeting.
How many times in a week does Joe Biden have to mention Obama?
A good ol' twitter argument this time Arizona Governor Doug Ducey takes on Democratic Presidental Candidate Joe Biden.
Donald Trump mispronounces Thailand and Yosemite and it‚Äôs wall to wall coverage about his incompetence. Joe Biden literally can‚Äôt speak full sentences, is gaffing every time he‚Äôs in public, making clearly racist comments, &amp; the media covers it for about 52 seconds.
Your father is doing a wonderful job. At this rate if your dad keeps talking Biden could win this election taking a nap.
Just pointing out the truth. On 7/23 Brigette Gabriel posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo moment by voting for Trump. On 7/26 Lori Hendry posted that she WAS STARTING a new MeToo movement by voting for Trump.   Joe Biden would be proud of Lori‚Äôs plagerism.

I have not seen one Joe Biden bumper sticker..
But then people will constantly be saying "WhErE's BiDeN???".  He just can't win with the people who already want to hate him, so imo he should just keep doing what he's doing which has him way ahead in the polls.

People want to know that their voice is heard, they want their representatives to REPRESENT them, and all Biden can do is cozy up to corporations and offer milquetoast platitudes about how things will be better. The DNC would rather have trump than Bernie and they torpedoed him.
It‚Äôs funny how Biden can be so articulate in a Tweet but barely put a sentence together during an interview ü§î
Information coming out today is that Joe Biden is declining so badly mentally that his handlers are worried they can't get him to November. So the decoder ring might not work. #azsen
Honestly doubt Biden himself even knows this tweet exists lmfao
Trump‚Äôs not Catholic. Biden is a terrible, apostate Catholic.
Those who are voting ahead of a debate know how much a moron you are. They don‚Äôt need to see more of that to vote for Biden. #Election2020
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."¬†...   Biden said it, whether you accept it or not. It's truth, it killed his 2008 campaign.
Joe Biden is the whitest man alive.
Sorry, Trump has proven he isn't a racist 1,000 times over.  Only a moron would think he is at this point.  Biden clearly is one.  And one with full blown Dementia.  You guys probably should have stuck with Bernie... at least he was coherent.
The crazy stuff Trump says is because he‚Äôs an entertainer to the public.  You know Biden is a pandering, babbling leftie..he will do more harm.
Biden is a stick figure.
Love James Carville! Is his Republican wife voting for Biden??
I am surprised they Keep letting him do interviews. They are worried if he just hides people will say he is hiding but that only appeals to those already against Biden. If he hides he holds serve. Having him do interviews risks him making mistakes and alienating voters.
I‚Äôm more and more convinced that their plan is to lie and say it‚Äôs a sure thing, so when Biden wins his base will think it was stolen.  They know they can‚Äôt win any legitimate way and they know their followers won‚Äôt question anything they‚Äôre told...

Nope. But it will be painful til them. I'm seeing a thousand percent increase in annoying unskippable ads on YouTube that are just attacking Biden for everything from mass murder to insanity. Very annoying.
Eek I missed that. The sad thing to me is Trump says horrible things about women and minorities and his base cheers him on. Biden says something not politically correct and people are tar and feathering him on social media. I worry Trump is going to use our comments against Biden
People want M4A, people want real systemic change in law enforcement, people want the government to take COVID-19 seriously and start paying people to stay home like Europe and Canada did, and Biden won't do any of that. Is he better that trump? Of course, but that's a low bar.

That Biden's team gets away with that tweet without reporters crying foul is just such an indictment of the institutional cowardice of the Media.

Yeah bro I get joe Biden making that crime bill that incarcerated mostly African American and people of color. He gave 20 billion for more police and prisons. What‚Äôs not to like ! You‚Äôve convinced me
Polls showing Biden with anything less than a 16-point lead equate to a Trump win.

You're not nearly as clever as you think you are.   Biden 2020
Yeah, but he won‚Äôt win. The votes against trump have to go to Biden for there to be any hope to get the guy out of office.

Biden was unable to clarify because he was too busy insulting Black Americans.
That may be but Rice is low on charisma, unlike Harris.  Rice can participate in the Biden Admin in other ways.  Rice has no campaign experience.  Nope, not happening.

Is there anything Biden can say to sway votes? Dementia and some legit, racist comments (not clipped, edited, or assumptions out of context), legit racist comments but still has support. Is this the lack of diversity of thought he mentioned about the black community yesterday?

For all you pointing out that this tweet is pointless.   That's the point.   What's the point of this public exchange?: Politics.   Obvious: Biden was VP for an entire country. Ducey is governor of AZ. Biden has more followers. And, has been around in politics a lot longer.

If Biden wins, there already is no hope of a peace process with Jewish supremacy.
guys biden just said ‚Äúobstreperous.‚Äù  Check and mate.
Make no mistake, I will still be voting for Biden in November, not because he‚Äôs a Democrat, but to get that dumpster fire out of the White House.
Why is it that  has been slow to act at virtually ever step through this pandemic but the second Joe Biden throws some shade his way he is all over that shit?  Nice priorities there, Douchey.

Biden should be praising Arizona's progress, not rooting for our state to fail. Glad to see Governor  calling him out for it!
I so hope North Carolina turns blue. Hopefully Biden and Democrats have better ads.
All of the things leading up to this are his fault.  Even Biden, last October, posted a tweet about how foolish it was for Trump to eliminate the pandemic response team because Obama bad.
uhoh.  Clyburn trying to take out  .  hope hes thought this through well.  his voice is very significant this cycle.  not sure she should be knee capped by him.  let Biden decide from top candidates.   seems call.  but dont force...
when Obama won you could feel the hype and love. That's what you need to win. Trump got a lot of that right now. there's no Joe excitement or hype. No bumper stickers, no lawn signs, no crowds cheering on the streets, no side organizations like "black voices for Trump". Biden L
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
in case anybody‚Äôs following the biden vs. ducey discourse about covid in az, things are still bad here. people don‚Äôt get test results for 2 weeks, and the main reason for slight improvement is that the mayors were finally allowed to mandate masks, which ducey blocked for months.
So... basically you are wavering between a vote for Biden and a vote for trump?  Bernie would say you suck...
No it was  Obama broke it, Trump broke it even more, Biden doesn‚Äôt know what to do
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess  via

Yes, but Joe Biden blew me away when he was VP &amp; was asked if he supports abortion &amp; same sex marriage &amp; he said yes, even tho it‚Äôs against his church. That doesn‚Äôt sound very ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù or ‚Äúdevout‚Äù to me. Sounds more worldly. Against the church doctrine. Political, not godly.
Joe Biden flubs his intentions again.
The whole Phoenix metro area has become more centrist. Biden will win the City of Phoenix, Tempe as well as Tucson and Flagstaff. Trump will win rural areas and most of the Phoenix suburbs. AZ has a great chance of going blue.

The vulture circling his prey....Biden.
Joe Biden basically said that all black people think alike, and the media did not report on it at all until after he tried to 'walk back' his comments some time later.  And the media reports read like defenses of Biden.  Imagine what would have happened if Trump had said that.
Predictable and transparent. Biden citing outdated numbers because the current trends don‚Äôt help him politically. Improvement in AZ is a detriment to Biden‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî simple as that.
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'.

Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities   keep talking Joe  you numbers look worse everyday Great job !
Ducey and Biden yelling stats at each other. Ducey using the good stats, Biden using the bad ones. Only one that looks wrong to me is when Biden said AZ still has nearly 20% positive rate. Yesterday was 14% PCR positive rate.

Joe Biden clearly believes he has the black vote on lock.  His words have shown this time and time again.  Don't expect a black VP.
I think he's messing around with us and acting like Joe Biden, hiding.  Biden does it and no one blinks, Trump does it and gets heavily criticized.  There's always a reason behind what Trump does.

He stopped at Biden, but the Democrat platform has removed God. Biden and Pelosi worship at the same church: Progressivism.
Despite who he picks as VP Biden needs to present a strong united front with all of the Democratic Presidential candidates. A wall of justice and reform. They all need to appear together and frequently. Not just one vulnerable man and a side kick

Forgive him for thinking you're a Trumper when you spout Bs. There are plenty of recent interviews and speeches with Biden going on for hours added up despite what Facebook propaganda tells you.
You crying like a wolf... common which things did Trump make a racist comments. Joe say this N word 1985 and the media is silent
Most people I know are Trump supporters... and I havent heard ANY voice support of Biden. And yesterday on Nextdoor when a neighbor complained about their Trump flag being removed from their flagpole, I saw the tremendous support for Trump (AZ). We're quiet but mighty üá∫üá∏
I vote for Biden no matter what.

How many times you apologize for being a racist. You are a racist joe! You used an ‚ÄúN‚Äù word during 1985 hearing and it‚Äôs just outright disgusting. If President trump did this, the media and the Democrats will having a feast 24/7.
No, hon. I said modernism *in the Church*. See, I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúa Biden rally,‚Äù so let‚Äôs stay focused. What sorts of things would come out of the Vatican or the USCCB if modernism (as opposed to orthodoxy/tradition) were the order of the day?

Your profile says you don't like racism sowhy are you identifying with the party that started the kkk and voted against stopping slavery? Have you heard all the horrible things Biden has said about our black brothers and sisters? He's majority racist. That's provable. Research.
Would Biden get to use these newly installed security gates too?
April? Are you really voting for a racist like  just because you hate  what has Joe Biden done for you? He hates all things Black. Gone put U in chains...Member that?
Holy shit! This is the dumbest shit I've heard today and I watched a joe biden interview earlier
People who hate Biden are the ones who would write stuff under "creepy Joe". There are so many conspiracy theories and lies on the internet. I try to stay away from all of them.

And Biden‚Äôs lead plummets from 31 points to 29.8 points, sending the Democratic hopeful‚Äôs campaign into a free fall. #SPOILED
I'd wait eight hours to vote for anyone except Trump and Biden.
I‚Äôm not banging the drum for Trump but how can you vote for Biden?
Twitter is a joke. Trump is trending because he mispronounced Thailand, meanwhile Biden insults every black person in the country and there is not a peep. Go ahead and elect this incoherent racist if you want to. See what you  get . #BidenCognitiveDecline #BidenIsARacist
Voting for Biden.
That‚Äôs why they won‚Äôt stop the armored men in Portland. These people that are tearing the streets and stores up are going to be your police if Biden wins. If you don‚Äôt do as you are told you will be arrested and will go to jail. Not the criminal. You will be safe nowhere.
Better watch this latest move by Democrat Socialist-run states..obviously out to destroy our ‚Äò2nd Amendment!!‚Äô New York‚Äôs (Democrat, of course!)Attorney General suing   NRA today to put it..‚ÄôOut Of Business!‚Äô A Biden election on 11/3 = a sure ‚Äògun confiscation‚Äô... Just ask Beto!!

Does biden even know that statement went out?
For me scruptuals are personal. Like Two Corinthians. I can assure you I know many scruptures, bcuz I have a great memory. Person, woman, man, camera, tv. Biden will hurt God. Toddler, girl, Rose Garden, pizza, bok choy. Many people say I‚Äôm smart and Joe is Satan. Elephant, giraf
My 1st impression was that there are enough Republicans that don't want to vote for Trump and would rather cast a vote for any other R over any D. Sane people that want Donald Trump out of office are voting for Biden, that's for certain. #VoteBiden #VoteBiden2020 #Vote #Vote2020
I assume when Biden accidentally said "millions" dead instead of thousands and shortly after corrected himself you didn't join all the MAGAts screaming he has dementia?
Biden released nothing. His handlers did.
You could... because in the end both he and Biden are propping the same unfixable corrupt system called Settler Colonialism. Doesn't matter who you vote for, Colonialism always wins! I know the real history of this regime though and I share that truth often to those who listen!:)
Donald Trump is reprehensible and despicable for attacking Joe Biden on his faith. Since Trump been in office, a lot of his statements and comments on various topics and issues, policies and actions taken, has been unconscionable, unfathomable, unchristian, unamerican and
I would crawl a mile thru Covid infected broken glass to vote for Biden.
Next up Dotard's gonna say that Biden's going to take the sunlight from the sun if he gets elected.
I‚Äôm not religious, but come on ‚Äî who can‚Äôt see that Biden is a devout practitioner and that Trump is a hypocrite with no religious affiliation?
People tend to say what they mean - and that is what Joe Biden did. It is rediculous that the guy that finished 76 out of 85 in his law class should put down anyone.
Biden liar back than...still a liar. Do not be fooled AGAIN!
Why hasn't the  or the  checked racist, Joe Biden? Their mantra is to protect the interests of all #BlackTwitter Black Lives. Unfortunately, if that Black person votes for  #crickets goes to show they don't seek upward mobility.
Do you think SE is using her platform to push Biden into not choosing Rice?

You must be young. I‚Äôve been watching Democrats govern like Republicans since 1981. They even governed like Republicans after the 2010 election when they had 60 Senate seats and could do anything they wanted. And with Biden in the WH?

Biden, hire me I‚Äôve got some ideas
You seem to be projecting - there is never stop misogyny directed at the First Lady, Melania, as well as Ivanka. And for a healthy dose of racism, just watch Biden speak without a script. He's been spewing his racist opinions of blacks, Hispanics, and others for decades.
No shame in my green vote.  Your opinion it is helping trump.  I would never vote for trump or biden.  Most of the country does not vote go tell them how scary trump is since you can't tell them how good Biden is
Trump is just speaking out of his ass now. He picks two big keywords that fire up his base and makes up a story. He's losing and the blatent pandering is pathetic  #TrumpIsNotWell #Biden #Biden2020 #VoteBiden #VoteBiden2020

Your‚Äôs or Biden‚Äôs?   Biden‚Äôs is trash, he‚Äôs a puppet of the Socialist Dem party. Good luck with that shit.   ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô was made famous by the great American philosopher Macho Man Randy Savage soooo....
Just how does he know so much about Biden's relationship with the Divine?
Biden is trying to rank and categorize races because he doesn't see all people as equal. He's descending deeper into dementia. The filters are all off. This is the real Joe Biden.
Biden hates puppies maybe? And rooms that have doors?
He told Americans that Biden is going to take away religion and the Bible.   Sick man
Joe Biden is not pro-abortion.  I get so tired of this spin.  He (and I) are pro-choice.  That means we are pro the woman and only the woman affected gets to make that decision.  I don't know anyone who is pro abortion.
Yay, Bill Kristol. I think it‚Äôs absurd to wait for Biden‚Äôs VP pick to make a decision. Democracy itself is at risk.
Information coming out today is that Joe Biden is declining so badly mentally that his handlers are worried they can't get him to November. So the decoder ring might not work. #azsen
Trump‚Äôs not Catholic. Biden is a terrible, apostate Catholic.
Those who are voting ahead of a debate know how much a moron you are. They don‚Äôt need to see more of that to vote for Biden. #Election2020
Joe Biden is the whitest man alive.
Sorry, Trump has proven he isn't a racist 1,000 times over.  Only a moron would think he is at this point.  Biden clearly is one.  And one with full blown Dementia.  You guys probably should have stuck with Bernie... at least he was coherent.
The crazy stuff Trump says is because he‚Äôs an entertainer to the public.  You know Biden is a pandering, babbling leftie..he will do more harm.
Biden is a stick figure.
Love James Carville! Is his Republican wife voting for Biden??
I am surprised they Keep letting him do interviews. They are worried if he just hides people will say he is hiding but that only appeals to those already against Biden. If he hides he holds serve. Having him do interviews risks him making mistakes and alienating voters.
I‚Äôm more and more convinced that their plan is to lie and say it‚Äôs a sure thing, so when Biden wins his base will think it was stolen.  They know they can‚Äôt win any legitimate way and they know their followers won‚Äôt question anything they‚Äôre told...
Eek I missed that. The sad thing to me is Trump says horrible things about women and minorities and his base cheers him on. Biden says something not politically correct and people are tar and feathering him on social media. I worry Trump is going to use our comments against Biden
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'
Biden backers talk COVID-19 inequities, make pitch for Latino vote in Arizona
Biden can give it his best shot but I think God will be ok.
If you were Joe Biden, who would you apologize to first on behalf of the US after you became president?
#TrumpKillsSeniors this senior stuck at home alone 6 months now will do what I have to in order to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden seems to think so. All the same.
That Biden's team gets away with that tweet without reporters crying foul is just such an indictment of the institutional cowardice of the Media.
Also, Biden's team literally said it every time Biden lost, trailed in the polls, or wet his pants during a debate.   It was a one-note song: We're not worries because Black people will all vote for us.  Where are the "fact-checkers?"
If all else fails the argument is ‚Äúhe has a unique way of expressing look at what he has accomplished‚Äù .  He is god. Oh no Biden is more powerful than god . I am confused now
Not relying on polls at all. We need to fight like Biden is 10 points behind.. Fuck the polls. They fucked us in 16
I mean, the Democratic party has counted on the Black community to be an electoral monolith for decades.   Biden says it out loud and we're all supposed to pretend otherwise?

Ain‚Äôt a chance in hell Biden wrote this
Yeah bro I get joe Biden making that crime bill that incarcerated mostly African American and people of color. He gave 20 billion for more police and prisons. What‚Äôs not to like ! You‚Äôve convinced me
Polls showing Biden with anything less than a 16-point lead equate to a Trump win.
Well I'm watching the Biden commercials panda he's going to do what's best for America and he don't even know how to wear his mask and hangs down off of his nose how stupid is that
Unfortunately no. This is unedited, raw, Joe Biden.
Here is your Joe Biden.Even if you hate Trump Biden is worse.
Unfortunately its not doctored. Biden makes these nonsensical ramblings all the time. Even called Arizona a city. Please do research.
Biden will not win AZ. That is my prediction.
I don‚Äôt think  has the balls to debate Biden. He‚Äôll say the moderators are biased and the questions will be unfair. Just wait and see.
You're not nearly as clever as you think you are.   Biden 2020
Yeah, but he won‚Äôt win. The votes against trump have to go to Biden for there to be any hope to get the guy out of office.
That because they‚Äôre looking at Biden‚Äôs VP pick to take over after Biden steps down
That asshole who claimed Biden would hurt God needs to open it.
Bob I love you but I totallt disagree. Biden has shown classic signs of demensia and is unfit for duty. I am convinced Bob we are not electing him, but his Vp choice!
Democrats are sitting on Biden because they don't want him out there having his mental health being scrutinized by voters and the media.
I try to avoid clips of 45 making an ass of himself, but this did make me laugh out loud. Biden is against "energy" OK.
Uncle Joe keeps digging.
Joe Biden is not mentally fit to hold any office let alone the presidency
Democrats hate Black people more than Republicans. Don‚Äôt get it twisted, Republicans hate black too. Biden is not the lesser of the two evils.
Are you aware of how many times Joe Biden has said racist stuff you can‚Äôt just point at trump and be like ‚Äúracist‚Äù and ignore Joe that makes you look so pathetic and so dumb.
Witness the pivot. Biden embarrassed himself today. This is how he's walking it back. This is why they are keeping him in the basement.
Biden was unable to clarify because he was too busy insulting Black Americans.
While I can understand the differences in political views with Democrats, the fact remain the same a vote for anyone but Joe Biden is a vote for Donald Trump. If Donald Trump remains in office our country will never be the same. #ARepublicIFYouCanKeepIT #CountryOverParty
This article from 538 is encouraging.
Is whoever tweets for Biden also planning on signing his EOs?
We have to begin looking at the intention. I‚Äôm tired of this cancel culture. Why are we pressing Biden so much on semantics when Trump will literally praise Neo-Nazis? We are going to destroy ourselves from the inside out.
This not joe biden...its his handlers writing this
Biden is doing a good enough job of smearing himself!
Its not surprising you would defend creepy joe.  America thanks God and Trump you were drained from the swamp 4 years ago.  God doesn't like grown men who bounce little girls on their lap while smelling their neck and hair.  Biden isn't religious nor are you.  Quit pretending
Lmao brilliant and can‚Äôt believe how happy Trump making Biden sound rad as fuck made me

When none of the other shit your tried to accuse Biden of sticks...
We all know that Joe Biden really isn‚Äôt running for President so let‚Äôs just slow down tweeting about him. Isnt everyone bored? So let‚Äôs wait until his VP is announced. In the meantime we should be more concerned over Trump stating that we might not see him for a while.

NEW: Kanye West indicates, in a Forbes interview via text, that he is in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
What a dork!  Palmer Report?  I hope people are not actually funding you as some sort of intellectual.  It is pronounced Thighland dumbass.  Biden hurts God every time he bounces little girls in his lap and smells their hair.  Only God has seen what goes on behind closed doors.
But they sure ain't going to vote for Trump. So yeah my money's on Biden
Okay. Somehow the Democrats and Joe Biden need to stop Trump's approval numbers from going up. This is freaking me out. Big time!!!!! If they or groups like Republican Voters Against Trump &amp; The Lincoln Group need more money, then billionaires like Bloomberg need to help out! Now
Now Biden is pissing me off. Yes, the criminal who has been in the oval office for four years must be prosecuted.

‚ÄúNo religion. Hurt the Bible. Hurt god.‚Äù -Trump ranting about Biden today making me almost excited to vote Biden.
Biden: "Unlike the African American Community, aside from a few notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community"  the U.S.: Did you just say all black people are the same?  Biden: "no unlike african americans, latinos are from all over the world"
C‚Äômon S.E. ! Are u that worried Joe Biden might not be able to finish his term?
Are you privy to information that isn't available to the rest of us? Is there some accusation out there against Biden that I don't know about, or are you just making this up?   Because i know about the actual accusations against Trump.
Mentally compromised is being kind. Biden is mentally unfit to serve and ignoring it only serves trump.
What do we say? Biden has a mental lapse nobody talks about it Trump spells Frorida it's front page news. Hell give them both cognitive test on live TV. Lol.
I won't be vote shaming people, but I won't tolerate claims that Biden is some great candidate either. He is garbage. He is slightly better garbage than our current garbage, but still garbage. It is almost certainly going to take protests/sit ins/walkouts/strikes to make him "ok"
Biden again praises Latino diversity as being 'unlike the African American community'
It does when you‚Äôre willing to forsake your morals and conservative values voting for a radical left puppet like Biden just to own your father‚Äôs worst enemy,

Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Why isn't Trump just replaying this idiot as his own campaign ads. Just replay what Biden says then announce at the end, "I approve this message"
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."

We need the $ since Biden has the MSM propaganda for free!
I feel like us conservatives are starting to call things racist that aren‚Äôt actually racist. We‚Äôre starting to use a more obscure, ambiguous definition of racism instead of the actual definition. I‚Äôm pretty sure even Candace has said something to the same effect as VP Biden did.

Be after almost 4 years the debate doesn‚Äôt really matter most good Americans already no who they want and the debate won‚Äôt change anything and we are tired of your lies / Joe Biden for president
Democrats party may need to elect a new presidential candidate quickly, Biden is losing it at a alarming rate. They will be begging the Republicans to delay the election.
Why is Joe‚Äôs wife, a doctor, displaying Joe‚Äôs in complement medical condition, it‚Äôs embarrassing for him and the Democrats party. Joe Biden will NEVER NEVER NEVER debate President Trump.
So do we really have to settle for Biden...........?
Biden is a disgrace to the American people. He has a just in politics for political and self interest gain.

You where suppose to do that about 3 years ago and now that you‚Äôre loosing against Biden your getting desperate and I‚Äôm still not voting for you
The first thing I want President Biden to do is to appoint a commission of Republicans and Democrats to find every official hired under Trump so they can be fired and review every agency rule changed and due process that change to ascertain if it‚Äôs a necessary change.
I WANT HIM, HIS FAMILY, AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TO CONTRACT COVID-19 AND DIE!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
I actually was sort of being sarcastic. I don‚Äôt think people will bitch because a) Biden has a penis and b) pandemic (please note which is the secondary reason!), but I will HOWL with laughter if they do.
Great point.  Bernie's actions after he dropped out and shamed his Berners to vote for Biden should give Berners pause on who to believe in the "women can't win a POTUS campaign" feud.
Oh, hush.
Yup. Who ever it is will be selected by Obama/.Hillary Biden's whole team and cabinet if he wins will be an extension of the Obama/Hillary regime.   My long long shot as crazy as it sounds is Warren.

As for me I am voting "one time" for Trump and hopefully we do get twice as many votes that will out match the double votes for Biden.
I agree but doubt Biden will ever debate at all.  Unless the Dems have a magic wake-up potion, Biden is incapable. If he does debate, watch out for the earpiece he'll be wearing so his handlers can feed him all his responses.
It's not only cognitive. Most of the time Biden is mumbling and slurring his words so we can't understand what he's even trying to say.  A sure sign of dementia.
I mean sure, but the issue is that they constantly accuse Biden of being senile and declining mentally.  He did take 2 tries at it and still couldn't get it.

Biden should be in prison. Lock him up! He was involved in the COUP to over throw a President, backrooms China dealing for his son, Ukraine threatened to lose billions in America aid if Hunter‚Äôs criminal investigations isn‚Äôt stopped.
You‚Äôre right Trump is on Earth while Biden is lost somewhere in the universe üòÇ
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.
I do not support democrats giving out a payment check for a Joe Biden vote.  Know what I am say make sense. And here's why.  It is only those that have been laid off because of COVID-19.  That would require some kind of stimulus to supplement their income for the moment.

Biden has already signaled Larry Summers will have a role in his further demolition of the American serf.
Yep, they need to protect Biden from his gaffes. Also, he would do very poorly against Trump even on his best day.
Biden‚Äôs pick for VP is not based on abilities, it‚Äôs based on color and sex
Maybe just maybe Dem never Trumpers should grow a spine and run a candidate that can win by and for the people. Not a sheepdog (Bernie) or a basket case (Biden). The people you know are cowards and hypocrites that are the problem not the solution.
The sad thing is EVERY Biden voter will be waiting in line for this...
IF he debates, he'll wear an earpiece and his handlers will be telling him what to say. If he doesn't, we all know why. Any of his VP possibles would be a disaster for U.S. (and the world) yet one would take over w/in months of a Biden election.
IF Biden debates, he'll wear an earpiece and his handlers will be telling him what to say. If he doesn't, we'll all know why.  The VP short list is a disaster, any of the possibles, for our country and the bet is Biden won't hold the presidency more than a few months.
According to Lincoln Project folks all they need do is persuade 3% of Trump voters to vote for Biden and Trump will be handily beaten.
Like I said I wasn‚Äôt a big Biden fan but you trump supporters are all the same no brains about what a conman is bu most Americans will remind you in November BOY
Well your not to bright when it comes to you support on trump but first of all you can say what ever you want about Biden I‚Äôm not a big supporter of hi ms but I‚Äôm voting for him over conman trump  get ready for a big let down in November
Schumer is a Sinophobe Zionist same as Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, Hoyer and the rest of the D's. They are trying to show they are tough on China while Israel continues with their ethnic cleansing and apartheid of the Palestinian people.
IS THER NO WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO YOU HOW MUCH PERIL, TRUMP HAS PUT US IN, IS THERE?????  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, 2020 AND VOTE BLUE!!!!!
Trump created better jobs for ALL, a strong economy and a reinforced military. despite your maliciousness and crucifixion of our president Mr. Trump has been MAGA! He did away with the divisive identity politics of Obama/Biden and was working hard to bring us together again.
Incompetent?  LOL that you'd think Biden w/ his half-mind working could have done even 1-% of what Mr. Trump has accomplished for our country.
See re Evan McMullin. Why are racists trying to help Biden win, why are GOP helping Biden win primary {or at least taking credit}, why are CIA officers backing this other GOP bag of white supremacists? They have a good thing going, Don‚ÄôT is too open.
...  or Covid19. You are as corrupt as they come with a page out of Hillary's book. Under a Biden presidency our country is lost - gone to the highest bidder.
#Vote Even if you‚Äôre not a Biden fan, vote Trump out and well sort it all out later. A non vote is a vote for Trump and we can‚Äôt do another 4 years with him. We‚Äôll be in a dictatorship!
I am not voting for Trump, Biden, or Howie even though I am a registered Green and have voted Green in the past.  I would not have voted for Bernie either as he is also a Dem. Maybe Biden will call Bernie to be his VP as a reward for being his sheepdog. :-)
Trumps now banning tik tok, so to now watch 15 year olds belly dance, now you‚Äôll have toget on a plane with Joe Biden

Biden is a President for all Americans not just a racist base #EveryonesLaughingAtYouDonald
That being said I wonder what Vegas has the odds at for Biden announcing Charli D‚ÄôAmelio as his pick for VP.
Chatter has it that Biden will pick Bernie.  Bernie is waiting for the call.

My updated non expert (but again no one knows more than me) opinion on who Biden should pick for VP
It's time to stop laughing and making fun of Biden's obvious mental decline and focus on his new leftist policies.  What's happened to him will happen to many of us and making fun of it will only alienate many older voters...and it's not really funny.  Seriously.
Come on...Harris is quite unlikeable, has tons of baggage and is very off-putting to many voters.  The only good thing about her as VP pick is that she will help Biden lose.

JOE BIDEN WILL LOSE! Trump 2020 Biooch!
I don't need anybodies propaganda or talking points as I look at the facts on the ground to make my own judgements. Biden was behind the 1990s crime bill that put many Blacks in prison, yet DNC is hiding that point.
Joe Biden seems to be having some serious issues with memory loss and possible dementia. The DNC knows this better than we do so I'm wondering if they'll pull a switch at their convention meeting.
And by that you mean like two or three people, none of which is the candidate, several of which are Warrenistas, right? Joe Biden has not been ‚Äúdrumbeating‚Äù against her for 12 straight months. He has had her front and center campaigning with him.
Well turnabout is fair play. Biden (Obama) is going to kick his ass in November as long as we get out the vote. So we need to make sure everyone votes.
How could she even be considered.  Biden campaign should have know this long ago!  Un-Figgen-believable!  Here‚Äôs to hoping he doesn‚Äôt have morons running his campaign.
Fr Joe just mad his only good song got remixes by Jay Z and he dissed tf outta him on his own beatüòÇüòÇüòÇbut what‚Äôs funny was that Joe Biden could even come back cuz Hov was the president of Def Jam at the time so if Budden dissed him back he was gonna be firedüòÇüòÇ

I'm ridin' with Biden amd just made my first donation!!
I think of Biden as the sorbet after bad oysters - a light, unobtrusive  palette cleanse to settle the nerves before embarking on dessert.
I see people saying it's a deal breaker, but what do you mean by that? If Biden picked her, you'd vote for Trump? Just trying to understand.
Get me a room with some AC and when Biden becomes president and I know I can return I‚Äôll come visit üòÇ

Biden's dementia must be catching.  Don't get too close, Bette.
I think it is you, who are running scared. If you are Biden's VP choice, your arrogance, unlike ability and baggage will lose the election for him for sure.
NO plan is Biden's plan. He's incapable of making any cohesive plan for anything. He says what his handlers tell him to say, and often he botches that. Tragic they are forcing this man to be their puppet, placeholder.
As I sit in the waiting room at the tire shop, they had the news on.  The news only talked about the same 3 things over and over.   1. Covid Bullshit  2. Trump is a bad person and president  3.  Vote Biden  Shit is annoying.
This is the truth behind why CHINA JOE BIDEN is acting how he is acting  To say he has DEMENTIA would lesson the jail sentence he might get if POTUS TRUMP &amp; true REPUBLICANS would investigate a life time 40+year government official&amp; family has become a millionaires on tax dollars
I do agree with you that Biden is a bad candidate. So, we do have something in common there.
Biden tells teachers Trump must offer plan to keep schools safe amid COVID-19 strike threat
I'm okay with not finding out until January, on the night before Biden is sworn in.
Zionists and Israel Firsters control the D Party. Biden himself once unashamedly declared he is a Zionist.   Palestinian-Americans sidelined during DNC platform debate

You forgot to tell Biden bots to vote often.
She is an obnoxious, toxic member of the House. Arrogant and a bully, who does she think she is? AG Barr is a proven  success; she is just another mouthy Leftist rep from the land of fruit and nuts. And she lies, almost as much as Biden!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
No Biden is NOT against fracking. Lies won‚Äôt work b/c 21,000 Trump lies are already system overload! This former Republican says NO MORE TRUMP! BIDEN ALL THE WAY!
My guess is Obama and Hillary will choose Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.   Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president

I am an old white haired white guy that is so tired of a bunch of old white haired white guys keeping the left down. Trump, Mitch, Biden, Bernie, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer.....should all be living in the basement of their grandkids.
Exactly.  Plus his handlers knew in advance and ran a scam and they should be held accountable. To me It is obvious that Biden is a front man for the Obama/Hillary cabal.
You literally tweeted a Biden ad....
"Only serve one term" ? ? I don't think he will even finish his term.  Should Biden win, why do some assume he'll only serve one term?
LOL! Dems can lead?! The most corrupt, self-interested hypocrites on the planet can lead?  Obama/Biden sure did a great job w/ H1N1, right? You have to be 50 paces behind stupid.
The 2007-2009 housing crash created more suburban rental properties in our neighborhood than any Obama-Biden fair housing initiatives. Our beautiful neighborhood is still being bought up by investors. #45LIES
Yes, a local Walmart here in Phoenix has a very bright autistic young man as their greeter. He is friendly and alert. I think Biden could do just as well as this young man. Maybe not better but just as well.

A $600 bonus, being paid not to work, is the most stupid idea ever. Obviously you are joining Biden in using half brains.
Once again we have proof that Biden does NOT think for himself and needs his handlers to give him printed talking points to get out a coherent word.  If Harris is his VP choice all the better. Not only is she very unlikeable, she has a ton of her own baggage to add to his.

Again you are only telling half the story.  Yes they object  to the platform which is meaningless once the regime is in power. But those same people said they will still support Biden.
I think it's ok to vote Biden on the 3rd and continue to dismantle the political establishment of both parties on the 4th of November.

It is fucked. Agreed. But we seem to need some moderates to vote for Biden so we beat t*ump where as the republicans don‚Äôt seem to care for moderates anymore they have gone totally bat-shit-fascist-crazy.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
If Biden were to debate Trump, his ears would have to be checked for two-way button transmitters......Theres no way he can debate without it!!
I‚Äôm sure Biden/Harris wil give this their utmost attention üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòò
I attended a Trump rally a couple of years ago. Narcissism is pretty much a given in presidents but does not disqualify them (consider the hundreds of times Obama used ‚ÄúI‚Äù in every speech). Trump talked off promoter for 1 1/2 hours. No incoherence. Biden can‚Äôt talk 5 minutes.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
My #1 Reason to vote Biden/Harris. Or you can bury your head in the sand and escalate/destabilize with Trump.

Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he opposes expanded uranium mining near Grand Canyon National Park.
A vote for Biden is a rebuke of Trumpism. It is a signal that you support democracy and constitutional government. It is a vote that says to the world that in this nation, the people hold the power, not a cabal of criminals hell-bent on destroying the country from within.
...Think about it!! Biden is speaking for muslims and talks about the Koran.....muslims throw gays off bldgs and behead them in the middle east..... Do really want that here?? I sure don't!!! You vote the way think you should vote...its your life, not mine!!
Figurehead?? More like a deadhead!! Biden is.....just there... He's a marionette and there could be about 5 people pulling his strings.... Biden is really a sick man....and his wife  should be ashamed of herself for putting Joe through this!!! Its definitely elder abuse!!
Oh....me....oh....my........If it does happen, she and Biden can surpass Obama as gun and ammo sales-reps of the century.......or ever!!!

Congratulations!! Biden/Harris 2020!
Biden has had a lot of personal tragedies. He is resilient. Like all of us Americans. That says a lot. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Biden lost a wife &amp; baby daughter in a car accident. He‚Äôs been a single parent. He lost his adult son to cancer, and now stays involved in his grandchildren‚Äôs lives. He looked after his own mother, who lived in a carriage house on his property, until her death in 2010 at age 92.
Lie: Biden "wants to double and triple everybody's taxes."  Fact: only your buddies, not "everybody." #trumppresser
I really don't look forward to voting for Biden (the Harris pick as VP definitely helps some) but he's the most realistic option for getting Trump out of the White House. If a Biden vote is what I have to do to get Trump out of office I'll gladly do it.
Biden and Kamala... Really... The best the democrats had was a bag of dust and a former prosecutor?
Good thread. Harris/Biden are baby steps in the right direction and I guess that‚Äôs about all we can hope for with them.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Do y‚Äôall want fascism? Y‚Äôall get to choose. Sure Biden and Harris have had their issues - what politician hasn‚Äôt? As someone I follow put it - voting isn‚Äôt marriage. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone‚Äù it‚Äôs like a bus you find the bus that gets you closer to where you‚Äôre going and take it!
Too bad biden and harris have done so much to ruin people's lives through the prison industrial complex
As if biden and harris are not also literal fascists?
Better than a vote for Biden. Rather go Jorgennson.
We all kinda knew Biden was going to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Most of us also know this pick makes no sense and doesn‚Äôt add anything to Biden‚Äôs campaign.
So happy that the Biden team chose to fight fascism with fire!  #BidenHarris2020
I think he‚Äôs being a first class prick sarcastically saying Biden is not a catholic because he‚Äôs a democrat. I like the other guys comment: well maybe listen to you about politics when you start paying taxes.
I have not forgotten. Harris is the nastiest woman in Congress. Women need to get out and vote against the Biden/Harris ticket. I will never forget Mrs. Kavanagh's poor face during those hearings.

Embarrassing how quickly the education community will rejoice when they see a cop get chosen as a VP.   Educational funding won‚Äôt stop Harris and Biden from being war mongers.   Educational funding won‚Äôt give us Universal Healthcare.
The "Sniff and Blow" bumper stickers will be out soon for Biden and Harris....
Obviously. We should definitely work to change the systems. But I‚Äôm simply pointing out that there isn‚Äôt much that can be done in 84 days. We can‚Äôt get another nominee. We get Trump. Or Biden come November. We must face that.
Who is yelling at people? I‚Äôm simply asking a genuine question. I think we should all certainly voice our concerns. Then I think we should step up and vote for Biden come November. And yes then we work to change the systems step by step
Biden definitely picked a wrong VP candidate, especially for Native American people, but as American politics go, Natives are always the last to truly be heard:
Kamala worked her ass off......literally....to get to where she's at!!! Now that Biden "tapped her" for the VP post, its just another "position" for her!!
Is anyone else worried about the possibility of being thrust into a complete polic state with this ticket? I‚Äôm still planning to vote for Biden but fuck am I scared to do so
#IAmANastyWoman And I will be voting for Biden/Harris !
She is a great foil to Biden's haphazard inability to speak extemporaneously. She is always on-message. Just not crazy about that prosecutorial thing.
I‚Äôm sorry this is happening again. But man life is not so black and white. As a trans man I‚Äôm supportive of Biden/Harris cause I want the current occupants out of the White House. I know that I‚Äôll never have the perfect candidate. No one will. But people can change and grow!
I‚Äôve heard enough of your lies and your CRAP. I‚Äôm heading off to donate to Biden/Harris and kick your ass to the curb.
did i want Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP? no. do i think it was a smart fucking move to sway independent/centrists? yes.
i will not hide my resentment for the Biden admin just because Harris is his vp. she‚Äôs a fucking moderate who doesn‚Äôt care about people any more than Biden does.  i just hope that our media can give Harris the grace she deserves as a black woman. benefit of the doubt engaged.
Ah yes. Biden/Harris are clearly the true socialist icons of our day. Most definitely.
It has been SOOOOOO long since I felt hope, I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it. I know it‚Äôs still a tough road ahead, but Biden/Harris will take us all the way.
Lmao im voting for Biden but I‚Äôll continue to shit on these bullshit centrist politics
Was I hoping for Elizabeth Warren? Yes. Am I still going to vote for Biden and Harris? Also yes. üó≥
she's still a cosponsor for bernie's bill. it think, at the end of the day, if there were/are enough senate votes (bernie won't let it go) then no one will care, it just not going to be what biden pushes.

There is literally no planet in which I vote for Biden or Trump.
Biden should tweet as much as possible so everyone can know what ‚Äúthey are getting‚Äù.
IMHO, any Christian who believes solely on faith what Trump said about Biden and God today is violating at least two of the ten commandments and is tacitly accepting a false idol in place of God. The Word is clear that pretenders will come to fool the faithful for his own gain.
Why aren‚Äôt those accusing Joe Biden of having cognitive decline doing the same here???
Wait dude, this is fake. We have plenty political ammo to take on Biden with the excellent COVID response where only like 500,000 tops people will die, booming economy and record high trust in government. Look at this chart. This says everything üëá owned the libs AGAIN!

I can guarantee that Joe Biden will crack 90% chance of winning 24 hrs before Trump landslides him into retirement.
Harris IS the focal point of the election and everyone knows it.  (Outside WaPo maybe)  Biden is out of the picture any time between now and 2024.    Not IF, WHEN?
Biden couldn't get mileage out of this hoax  without A. Masses of ignorant followers and/or masses of followers who are just as corrupt.
(2)take votes away from Biden. You're sabotaging the mail by firing 23 supervisors, slowing down mail delivery and removing sorting machines. You're Republican cohorts are trying to suppress votes by closing down polling places, purging the voter rolls, etc.,
If you would have told me 20 years ago that the presidential tickets in 2020 would be Trump-Pence and Biden-Harris I probably wouldn't have understood you because I was a fucking baby then
If this is what‚Äôs going on 24 hours after the selection of the VP candidate then we can expect nothing but lies for the next three months.  The media will not find fault with Biden‚Äôs lies it will be up to us to do the fact checking.
Biden said countless times Trump was too aggressive and racist for stopping flights from China. Pelosi had a party in Chinatown.  I‚Äôd blame Fauci. Flip flopped weekly.
Biden has a bona fide recorded video history of lying and racism going back to his first term in office.
biden slipsup best ever ad for trump ever watch it on this video
The Biden China connection is the real sell out of America. #CoronaTerror
biden losing in the pulls do to turmp supporters dems want it stoped lol no f way deepstate
You mean LIE, CHEAT &amp; STEAL?? And Biden‚Äôs only fight was with ‚ÄúCorn Pop‚Äù...
Biden is just another unrepentant corrupt politician!!
Tulsi has too much class to join the Biden ticket. Kamala Harris not so much!
Example of Liberals in a debate: Topic: Joe Biden being investigated Ukraine.  Liberal response: Well Donald Trump held the Bible up in the wrong way on his way to a historic church just for a photo op. Explain that. They only deflect because they have nothing intelligent to say.
i dont see just how given she is not african american but inda jomaicen so why would anyone would vote for two liers biden dienal as pedophilia and her lying about her bloodline we dont want anymore liers in office we have had anuff of that shit.
biden,hussin oboma,clinton,pelosi all have committed treason that tril is hald by military court with death penatly
Biden: Here‚Äôs the deal, I um, you know, um chose Pamela Harris after I thought hard about, with... you know... the thing. I thought she must be qualified since you know... Willie Brown... we are about the same age and she pleased him from her position.
Joe Biden spent his life sponging off the American people and has nothing to show for it except his exceptional wealth that he has emassed!
Excellent choice! I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris!!!
I‚Äôm all in for Biden/Harris!!!!!!
Creepy picture.....set they in love?
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate  via  this picture us freaking creepy! Are they in love?
An Albatross on Biden‚Äôs sinking campaign!
Why do they keep showing the creepy picture of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden gazing into each other‚Äôs eyes? I don‚Äôt believe President Trump and Vice President Pence took a photo like that ü§£üòÇü§£ freaking creepy!!!
Biden doesn‚Äôt hold grudges like a 1st grader. Working together to bring both parties together is beyond your comprehension. Division between the two solves nothing.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick her.....duh. He was told who is his running mate for the Senate ü§£üòÇü§£
Harris smells the best according to Biden! üëÉ üå∏
It‚Äôs hilarious that the Biden Campaign is trying to make it seem like we are all waiting on bated breath for his VP pick. Watching my dog üí© is more exciting!
Republicans are claiming sexist attacks on Biden‚Äôs VP pick are fair game because of Palin. The attacks on Palin concerned her intellect, absence of curiosity, and lack of experience and ability. Nothing exclusive to her gender.
In Biden‚Äôs basement? Watch out  he may try to feel YOU up too.
And we believe you must be as nuts as Joe Biden ! To even think he could run this country !
Hold onto this for those‚ÄùCognitive debates‚Äù President Biden! Lol
Biden signs I saw, ZERO! Not one sign in sight. My question is why? Don't you think you should have signs plastered everywhere? This route also takes you through Laughlin and Las Vegas, Nv.. I'm just pointing out the fact that if I took notice of this how /3
Not to worry, Joe Biden can‚Äôt be bought! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Share this with everyone you know. Regardless of what you believe it at least shows what a lying slime bag Biden is and who he will use to reach his goals.
I listened to Levin, how when Obama did the payroll tax cut he stated that it's funng that the Democrats, Biden,  Pelosi and Schumer all praised Obama. They never said a word about social security. Now they are screaming it! Too funny! Trump2020
Everyone knows that Biden (if elected-God Forbid!) wouldn‚Äôt make it much past the inauguration before the DemocRats have him committed or invoke the 25th amendment due to his obvious incompetence. So the VP pick is paramount!
FWIW, If he [#Biden] wants to pick her [#SusanRice]  that's fine,  just saying there's a potential liability.    Nonchalant af.    PS.  Notice the cameramen doing a double take at the question?
Juan ; How do you know how older voters will vote ? You sound like Biden.
mainstreem media is now looking like they share the very same mintil illness as biden and there reations to some of trump ads toltly bows there minds almost to the point where they cry on air lol trump needs to keep it up. checkout youtbue vid don lemon meltdown thanos meme
Biden will never debate Trump. He can say all he wants that he will show up! But when the rubber meets the road, he will  have some excuse and not show up! Biden is fraud and his campaign is a shambles. Jill Biden is the puppet master and pulling the strings.
Steve Hilton, Anthony Scaramucci battle over Biden support in fiery interview;  scaramucci is the biggest looser, just a big month blow hard who would not or could not answer any questions when interviewed. Go back to sleep Anthony!

Tim I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a troll , but Biden in WH 8 years with Obama now seems to have dementia and allegedly Democrats want Susan Rice as VP. She was also with Obama what did they do Tim?

For a long while it seemed the communists had no sense of humor at all.   Then they nominated Joe Biden for President.    I stand corrected.
I am disappointed I have to vote for Joe Biden, I think he wasn‚Äôt even my fourth choice, but I will damn sure vote for Joe Biden even if he picks Elmo as his running mate
Trump, Republicans, Russia and the RNC can try any and all the dirty tricks they want we will be an mighty army of voters to take them all down! We will come out in such force to vote for Biden they won't know what hit them!
weak and greed people fauci is a muder he can go live in china where he sent money whohon just like biden oboma
LOL...is that the best you got.  Guess you missed Biden saying "all blacks think alike", "poor kids are just as smart white kids", "if you don't vote for me then you ain't black. "  People miss pronounce words all the time, believe it or not we are ALL human.   Have a blessed day
Biden is harming himself every time he speaks. Don't need the Russian goverment to interfere. Biden is doing a great job on his own.  üòÇüòÇü§£
biden just lost his own state whit that statement
But Biden is going to hurt God and take away hamburgers!
nop that is what would be under biden and fema death camps with china runing the country no more america under biden
Are you mad because you‚Äôll never be president are you mad because you have all timers are you mad because you can‚Äôt have your sniffing children what‚Äôs really going on Joe Biden?
Someone told me 2 neighbors in CA had Biden signs in their yard.   They had both moved away from Santa Barbara because it was too expensive to live there.    So they packed up and took their poison politics to infect an affordable,  conservative area.

I just read a bunch of Biden supporters trying to trash talk President Trump and it is ridiculous. People who aren‚Äôt even Christian are making remarks about whether he knows any Bible verses. What is that to them? Morons!
Joe Biden is catholic they don‚Äôt read the Bible. Also he thinks he is running for the senate so naw...don‚Äôt think so. What about Joe calling black people the N word and all the other racial slurs. That is something real to talk about.
It was probably a die hard trump fan but there‚Äôs no way trump was like ‚Äúphotoshop joe Biden for me.‚Äù
Awww Michelle Obama has some low grade depression and it‚Äôs because of President Trump. What a scam. A last ditch attempt to get people who like her ü§Æ to vote for Biden. So sick and disgusting.
no becouse dopie joe biden clamed last week that he would pick his vp this week and has not boom
Did you ask him why he hasn't taken down videos of biden sniffing kids
Just because a bunch of teens punked him on his rally!!  Look out, I heard Biden likes chocolate shakes!  He wouldn‚Äôt dare!?
Joe Biden didn't invent systemic, unconscious racism.  But, he did perfect it 30 years ago.
fyi i know q and inter group that is so deep state is just like oil on the water we are cleaning it up biden will not make it nor will pelosi and all who back both them they are cursted QANON UNITED WE STAND UNDER JESUS SON OF DAVID  AMAN GOD IS WITH US
this country is 329,000 people i been keeping track of the nation of those who will vote and who they chose biden # is falling at one time he was at 75,000 at this time biden is now at 26,000 voter. as of this time trump is setting almost at 250,000 voters and still growing boom
Every Democrat initiative for the last century has worked to suppress the poor and disadvantaged, particularly POC, .  Racism has never been a deal breaker for a Democrat candidate.  Quite the opposite.  Biden is safe.
The White House has a basement, Biden would be safe.  No one actually believes Biden would run the country if he won the election.  That would be retarded.
If Joe Biden can hurt your god, it‚Äôs time to admit you don‚Äôt really believe in or have trust in your god and either find one that‚Äôs not so weak or just decline to bow to any of them.
Biden is a Chinese muslin? What‚Äôs his thread count?
Every time Joe Biden attempts to put a paragraph together it disqualifies him.
Biden has always been systemically racist.    Dementia has not cured him of this.
This is overwhelmingly depressing! It makes me feel hopeless. How do we guarantee a win for Biden, for American democracy?
The only person who‚Äôs going to be able to translate what Joe Biden is saying is a Democrat. Are you absolutely certain you want to sit in the presence of one of them and listen to them tell you about politics?
Joe Biden‚Äòs dementia may be something new but his inability to think and reason logically goes way way back.
Your campaign people and all the GOP operatives trying to get Kayne West on the ballot to run for President and try to take votes especially the black vote away from Biden isn't going to work!
biden is grand wiserd of kkk and unless u what to be band on here dont post on biden
yes becouse biden is one tooWorst President to date, America do let Biden become #1
Is Biden really going to be the candidate?  Something strange is happening.

Biden is losing his mind, hiding in a basement, think of this: Biden been in DC for like 50 years &amp; done what, BUBKAS. To think he is going to magically change is foil hat time. Harris a radical far left bomb thrower &amp; no way a moderate, as the MSM propaganda machine tell us
Question: I want Biden/Harris and Kelly signs.  I know you have to pay/order but will they be available through
Your guy Biden been in DC almost 50 years and done BUBKAS. You really think as he is losing his mind and hiding in a basement is going to magically change? OK think that, and keep that foil hat on.  Don‚Äôt buy the mantra that Harris is a moderate. She is no where near that.
is an intelligent man with good Morals, values &amp; Integrity unlike who we now have in the White House. Voting 4 Joe Biden will bring back the Values we once could be proud of.  We now live in a place that makes us lose sleep, fear what was done overnight by a President!
Ya Biden no innocent when it comes to crime. Put the foil hat away

While it‚Äôs true tax analysts estimate that all income groups, on average, would see an increase in their taxes under Biden‚Äôs proposal, the increases would be relatively small for all except high-income individuals and households.

Republicans rally around their candidates.  Democrats infight because they didn't get what they wanted.  Our all or nothing political system sucks, but now we have a ticket - focus.  Biden Harris 2020
You mean the fact as DA she did everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row.  Or that she was proud to be indian until she could ride the BLM movement and now she's a proud black woman. Or the fact she believed Biden's accusers until she could be on his ticket
To keep an innocent black man on death row. She also believed in Biden's sex assault victims until she could be on the ticket with him.  Ya, they care so much about morals ROFLMAO
Wasn't she Indian before she needed to capitalize on the BLM movement for votes? When she was DA didn't she do everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row? Didn't she believe in Biden's victims until she could get the nomination to run with him? She's a winner
anybody else scared about a   presidency ?   yep, no way will  will retain leadership.  VOTE !  Today was a disgusting love fest between Biden and Harris.   Political Whores !

America needs a competent president and Administration!! What's important is American lives! If if Trump and his administration would dedicate as much to the coronavirus as a due to sports and money we would not be in the situation. Biden 2020

Debate question to Biden
First you need a competent leader. Something totally lacking in Cities run by Democrats. Wise up America.  An remember Biden been in DC close to 50 years, what's he done, BUBKAS. You really think he is going to change at the age of 78? REALLY...
A secret stand in? A hidden ear piece to direct him? A little tiny backpack mike? Questions passed off by media to just the Biden handlers? We seen it all before. BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE
The point Trump is missing: the Right spent decades blowing up Hillary, so all he had to do was stoke the embers.  That did not, has not, happened with Biden.  He is liked by, and has friends on the Right.  Not gonna work this time.
It's true that I am not "excited" about the Biden campaign. I feel something much deeper and much more important. I am _determined_. I will not get sidetracked by fluff and optics. This is about saving lives and saving democracy. "Excited..." pfftttt...
When Biden wins can his Administration go back and actually charge all the people who had Hatch Act violations? Just curious because it seems like there have been a lot of them and I for one am sick of it!
At least I didn't will actually be a president and take care of Americans and this country! Trump has devastated this country and put us further into debt due to his golf games. Also lining his, his family's, and all his wealthy buddies pockets. Biden to save America!

Biden's first action in office should be an EO to add Obama's images up there. Sane and rational Dems will know it's realistically not gonna happen but the entertainment of watching repub's heads explode will be a glorious thing to witness! Down right spectacular!
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‚Äòbasement‚Äô
biden is not a catholic.  he is actions are contrary to the catholic teaching.  he should have been excommunicated 30 years ago

how convenient the Times thinks this now that Biden, who is in major cognitive decline, is the party's choice.  Im sure the Times thinks debates are a bad idea too.

I'm sure you agree racism is inappropriate by either party and should be wiped out completely, right? To me the left insults black Americans by telling them they are victims and can't get ahead without them, by stereotyping like Biden does, it's ugly and not true!
And it's only because of the fact that I live in a red state that your administration is sending out these emails.  Even your son's girlfriend is sending me bs emails after I responded to her to stop.  Biden didn't do that and I can't stand him just like I can't stand you.
Trying to convince their extremely ignorant base that Biden is infirm. More projection. Trump's the one that's spiraling before our eyes.
There's a lot of video out there of creepy Joe Biden like that
I've been a Bernie supporter for many years (since he used to do a hourlong call to Ed Shultz' radio show). Would I have preferred him over Biden? Yes. But any non-vote, write-in, or 3rd party vote IS NOTHING BUT A VOTE FOR TRUMP. We can't afford for this coalition to fall apart.
if it's a decisive victory for Biden-Harris we may never see that on the R side either
If you want jobs vote for Trump and Pence. If you want mobs vote for Biden and Harris.
Now that Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate, high. But he'll need to check w Evangelical leadership. Trump relies on their vote. Especially those that are also white nationalists beneath their Bible verses. Fortunately he will also find himself at odds w their misogynists.
So she believes Biden is guilty of sexual assault and has no issue with that?
The woman who accused Biden of racism! The woman who put 1000s of minorities in jail for marijuana busts! Do Black Lives really Matter, or is that just a pandering slogan for you? Hypocrisy again Joe!
Everyone seems scared to let Biden debate..
So fucking what? Yes, the hate is strong. Look what this asshole has done to our country. What's hard to believe is that you, supposedly an independent, doesn't hate him. Biden/Harris- perfect? No. Any ways near as bas as trump? FUCK NO
Which means if Biden is declared incompetent the Spraker golf the House becomes President
Sleepy Creepy Biden &amp; Side Slut Heels Up Harris...EEW!

You've got to lay this at the feet GOP leadership. They knew what he his &amp; still the party nominated him. They let him steal the election with his hate &amp; treason. Afterwards refused to convict the monster. Even today Cruz &amp; other GOP lie &amp; fear monger against Biden to crush all.
I'm white and the only stereotypes about blacks are coming from the Democrats. It's disgusting. I am embarrassed that white people still stereotype blacks. Biden the stereotype-in-chief. The left is dead wrong about black Americans

The CDC says between 60-90 million people contracted H1N1 during the Obama/Biden administration. Comparing fatality rates, that would have been over 2 million deaths to H1N1. Thank God we had the right president during this pandemic
Thank you, for the YouTube video.. my vote still stands. The news has never been fake, some may have exaggerate certain stuff..but fake it is not.. the only fake ones are the one that claim it to be. We all have our own juices and rights.. my will be for Biden..
Is that what it is? I thought it was a Biden fantasy during the democrat debates
During the Obama/Biden presidency, H1N1 infected 60-90 million people in the US according to the CDC. If the death rate was the same as Covid, there would have been well over 2 million deaths.

This is the third time I'm going to tell you this because you Must've missed this too ...I am not supporting Biden. I hate it when people assume shit.  Don't you know how to ask questions ?
Did you miss it when I said I'm not in line to vote for Biden or Trump?
I have NEVER been accosted in my emails by the Biden campaign.  Ever. I didn't sign up to support EITHER of them. Also explain why someone would send my daughter a hand written postcard AFTER i sent off our applications to the registration office ? We live in a red state.
I'm not planning to vote for Biden but maybe you can tell me since you are a die hard Trump supporter why aftr I mailed off my daughters' and my mail in applications I started getting a mails from the Trump Administration offering me free accomodations to his rally for donations
When did Biden build projects?
If you had read the article instead of just the damned title ...  Also...I take issue with Biden saying "if you don't vote for me you ain't black" ... But you sit there talking about how Trump isn't a racist and people are making accusations against him up. Trump hates minorites
Is that what you believe about Biden saying he doesn't want his kids growing up in a jungle, or around blacks?
Yep Biden said that bullshit and Trump around the same time was in deep shit for discrimination against black renters.  He told someone that he'd never let a black count his money.  But you keep telling uneven stories.
Biden‚Äôs cogntitive state should be enough for people to realize he cant do it!
Ive already been banned! I made the same comment as someone else. Wanna know the difference? I support Trump and them Biden!
Biden said Arizona wasn‚Äôt diverse?    I‚Äôve lived here for five years and he is wrong.    Maybe the different attitude about immigration is really pertaining to drugs and human trafficking?
I‚Äôd just hate for Biden to lose your vote because you don‚Äôt like his potential pick.
Biden campaign needs an ad that scrolls through every horrendous thing he's done with its emotional toll on the public. Maybe it will need to be a documentary film?
I guess his new WH plywood wall doesn't cut it when staring down peaceful protestors. He'll need to inspect the bunker again.
Joe biden is god believing catholic your the one that goes golfing instead going to church on sundays everbody everything trump says about Biden and the democrates Is just the opposite trump is this way , he dont like blacks,Hispanics dont believe in the bible .
She‚Äôll complain about trump but it‚Äôs only because of how he treated her father, not his politics.   I think her mother has come out for Biden.
The ads are already on my nerves and  it‚Äôs only going to get worse. The trump ad with someone breaking into a house &amp; police message saying they aren‚Äôt coming is particularly offensive.  Biden has never called for defunding the police.
Trump is buying the election. His handlers want to continue Koch's plan. Their goal is to destroy our democracy. Absolute power &amp; the riches it confers by rewriting our constitution into a #TheocraticKleptocracy  of rigid Christianity &amp; oligarchical rule.I think Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP choice pushed independents and Libertarians away from the Biden Camp
You think Joe Biden is against white Supremacist...
is there a single video of biden clearly stating his desire to do any of these things?

You don‚Äôt have to like him, but Trump has done a damn good job. Whether you like them or not, Biden and Harris both have terrible track records in office. And, they want to take the US in the opposite direction that had us flourishing as a country. No thanks.
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Despite the drama-evoking click-baity title of this article, it is a wonderful read, delving into the political intelligence differences between Biden and Obama. I see a generational thing going on, but the strengths Biden brings to politics shouldn‚Äôt  be overlooked.
Regardless of what Biden says, President Trump is doing the better than any other country with COVID19.
Hmmmm, so you recently saw the light after 40 years in public service? Oh, would the person handling this account for Mr. Biden please ask the question, as he does not know how to tweet, just saying.
Silly Hilly, If we wanted to fix it, we wouldn't be accepting Biden.
That was Biden.
The Biden/Obama administration also caged children, murdered civilians, and fucked over the working class just as hard.
Oh I fully understand. And I have absolutely ZERO hope that a Biden/Harris administration will be even an iota better for the working class.

If Biden was a stronger candidate he‚Äôd already be pushing trump to issue masks to citizens, but instead he puts out an ad about how he will do that immediately come next late January. Sweeeeet.

I find Joe Biden voters more repulsive than Trumpers. By a land slide! The difference is one can say and get away w/ more than the other! I view a vote for Biden as a vote for mainstream socialism and government expansion.

Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

On the other hand, if they DO think Biden is middle-class, we‚Äôve officially solved the question of why conservatives think middle-class families should be fine financially.
Trump ad on TV: ‚ÄúJoe Biden says, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre gonna pay more in taxes.‚Äô That means more taxes for the middle class...‚Äù Do... do Republicans think Joe Biden is middle class? (Also, lol that Republicans ‚Äî let alone Trump ‚Äî care about the middle class.)

Remember what #KanyeWest is going to be used for. In addition to trying to siphon black votes away from Biden, it may be that voting machines that are hacked push DEM votes to Kanye (instead of Trump) with the same effect, but without leaving trumps obvious fingerprints on it.

Hilarious anti Biden ad: "11 million illegal aliens competing for American jobs" and the video is farm workers. Oh so many Americans are horrified that they can't get a job working in the fields. LOL the incompetence of  and his minions. Can't even racist right.
Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
And once again, if you are a "blue no matter who" type liberal, you could help your own cause by actually admitting that our choices are shitty, and pledging your support and participation in direct action even IF Biden wins in November. Too many seem to think he is the solution.
Wait a tic. I hate Kanye as much as the next person but doesn‚Äôt this mean that he ISN‚ÄôT playing Biden spoiler since he is now running against Trump?
Vote for Biden.  Seriously, tRUmp will only get much worse if he is left in office.
So, Biden is no longer "Sleepy Joe" but is now "Slow Joe".  What is most interesting and will remain with you throughout history...FOREVER...is the fact that you are Impeached Trump.

Yes, glad I switched to Democrat to support Bernie. Party‚Äôs are way over-rated. It‚Äôs people that matter, Hope Republicans get that, looks like many are jumping ship to support Biden. I welcome them!
Can you explain why our initial purpose was to #FlattenTheCurve? I think we're in week 25? And fuck you if you're doing this  bc it helps Joe Biden get elected.
He's gotta be careful on this one. Plus he's not running against her, he's running against Biden. So my take no nick name for Flip Flop Kamala.
I am sure these characters are going to circle file Republican votes!
If this is what real leadership looks like then real leadership is dead. Biden looks like he's dead and no one told him.
Biden likes to smell women's hair and he has tiny blonde hairs on his legs?

Uh, no. It was the China virus that did the damage. And if Biden had had his way, there wouldn't have been a ban on flights from China and things could have been so much worse. But arm chair quartbacking is so much easier...
It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.

Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
Wrong. The Dems are the ones putting the election on hold - they want ballots to be counted even if they arrive a week after election day. What's the point of election day then?  The left always accuses conservatives of what they themselves are doing BTW China &amp; Russia want Biden
On a scale from 1 to glue fiend... how deeply will Biden sniff?
In other words you can‚Äôt name a single Biden policy. If I was in your shoes I would have at least googled his platform and cut and paste something in the hope of changing someone‚Äôs mind. But of course when Sanders was running I and all of his supporters could recite his platform.

There are two main Establishment factions in the Democratic Party: Obama/Biden centrists and Clinton/Harris woke hipster liberals. The Harris pick was a concession by the former to the latter. That‚Äôs all.

Biden and Harris sign documents so they can appear to seem busy and not answer tough questions from the press which could possibly destroy their campaign.*  There...fixed it!  #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I think Bernie only dropped out because COVID meant he couldn't actually campaign. So I think he gets a few more votes and delegates. But I think the majority still coalesces around Biden and Biden starts acting like the nominee in March either way.

I wonder if this may hv factored in VP Bidens choice of Harris over longtime colleague Susan Rice. This is intriguing. Wonder how involved Pres Obama was. Could VP Biden's lack of awareness save him from being Implicated? (May hv been unwitting, and sleeping thru briefings).
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
If Biden wins the 2024 election will be between Harris and Tom Cotton or Trey Gowdy. We'll just continue a slow slide to fascism. People like the frog in the boiling water will acclimate &amp; aqueous. NO THANKS! I'm done w/ the Democrats and 'slightly better' than GOP. BURN IT DOWN!

You believe the two party system IS viable?  History has proven the 2 party system is corrupt and useless (unless you're an oligarch). I'm 61 years old, been voting since '76'. EVERY 4 Years is more of a debacle than the previous 4.  Biden makes Nixon look like a flaming liberal.

This is a panic tactic born of Democrat weaknesses.  Mentally deficiant Biden can't articulate and Kamala is running from her past record.  The more Biden/Kamala hides from Press questions the more they signal fear and the worse it becomes for them.
No bc I do think Biden should be in the White House.
If you don‚Äôt want another 4 yrs of Trump, vote for Biden. Not voting at all, is not a solution.

No thanks. They‚Äôve told us that every election. Once these people are in office they care even *less* about us while most Dems believe whatever ‚Äútheir‚Äù president does is right/the best that they could do.  We need those people in the fight, but I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd fight biden.
Joe Biden says it‚Äôs his responsibility to take care of Americans. Unless it‚Äôs two weeks before his election. We had Americans in Benghazi and they were ignored and murdered.
If he wins, the US will be gone forever! Biden and Harris have so much work to do!!
This is why  needs an election night mandate.  340+ electoral votes, so even if they challenge NC NV etc Biden still wins without them.
wonder how much of a civil war lying about  Obama and Biden can start?  Who will be safe besides those of u who work for Putin and his lap dog Trump?
I just hope the media covers these the way they covered one accusation against Biden. Sure. Trump's supporters clearly don't care. But no one should forget!
Joe Biden has so far skated. He hasn't had any tough questions, and has just hid in his basement while voters assume whatever they want about him (and the media covers for him.)  Once people actually see Biden, his numbers go down.

One thing about Biden‚Äîevery year he gets more hair than he had the year before.
What part is an exaggeration? Are saying that Biden didn‚Äôt argue in favor of segregation in schools, or that multiple women haven‚Äôt accused Biden of touching them inappropriately.
He‚Äôs not leaving period, Biden alrady said he will prosecute.
Hillary wants to serve in a Biden administration. First of all there won't be a Biden administration. And secondly there won't be a Biden administration! Bye bye Hillary, bye bye pedo Joe, bye bye heels up Harris!
I wonder if melanin will vote for Biden
It is not just a vote against Trump it is also a vote against Biden. There is no arguement in the world that would get me to vote for a candidate with a history of racism and multiple sexual assault allegations.
The last stand of hate, fear and racism. the final days of Hitlers hate filled days in Germany, the last stand of apartheid in South Africa, the last days of the slavery fueled southern Confederacy. Yes, vote like your life depends on it. America depends on it. Biden/Harris 2020!

Is Kamala Harris coming from slave owners and Joe Biden being a pedo
Can you pin point what Biden has done in 40 years in office 8 being vice president?...that has helped us...anything...
Ahhh man....see I wish Biden would get asked questions..."After 40 years in office....can you tell us 1 thing you've accomplished?...Better yet..8 years vice president"
It was totally preventable - GET  out before Monday and me in - do not blow this off!!!!! This entire debate season was a nightmare for all of America with out my national presence - Change this for me - call Biden - get his head out of his....this is serious.
You and Joe Biden should be roommates in the old folks home. You both have dementia.
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
not a biden stan, he's just in favor of harm reduction. he hates biden but will vote for him to get trump out
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
Duh, he‚Äôs on a mission to take Biden out since his boss can‚Äôt beat him in a straight up fair election.
People in Hong Kong are laughing and asking how anybody in their right mind would vote for Biden.  They think he has lost his mind

The people that are going to vote for Trump, are going to do it.  The people that aren't, are going to vote for Biden, or stay at home.  Period.  People's minds are made up.  Now it is about ground game and getting people's asses to the polls, or getting their ballots in the mail
I've bought the Woodword book, the Wilson book, and the Anonymous book - but I couldn't stomach reading any of them. If Biden wins, I'll take another crack at them
'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical to defeating Trump. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.
I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states

not many ppl are saying you have to. some of them just want to have a discussion on this. they want to persuade others to vote for biden as well, which is no different from any other debating. but yes there are some who are vote shaming, though they are still leftist
Babies however are getting wise now to Biden and have learned how to duck, bobb and weave as Creepy Joe moves in for the kill.
When he opened his mouth as Obama‚Äôs VP he pushes things forward on gay marriage. So no we didn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut. You don‚Äôt know what Biden‚Äôs policy or record are. Obviously.

No wonder Biden picked her
I think you‚Äôre right, and the left is crying...  I don‚Äôt no where far plays into anything Biden has to say, other than the far away look in his puzzled eyes..
I am not a betting man, but I am willing to wager that Biden/Harris ticket will not be engaging in debate.  I sincerely hope I am wrong.
How do we start a voting buddy movement? Two pals or strangers that make sure they both get their vote in on time for Biden/Harris

A thousand Biden flubs and you're making fun of one of the times he was actually correct?
Biden is a fascist.
Biden and Harris give me hope.  Thanks for the walk and talks.  Love them.
That's not enough to get my vote for one sexist and racist over a more sexist racist person. It's great you and A D have healthcare and an education, but what how about all the poor people that Biden and Harris  will ignore after being elected? I can't support that.
Are you talking about Biden politicizing his sons death for sympathy?
Nothing anyone can come up with about Biden and Harris can hold a candle to the Cult45 and the most corrupt disgusting administration ever.
Joe Biden doesn't know the difference between "volunteering" and "mandating". This entire speech was a total lie. Move to China you authoritarian, unpatriotic f*ck #NeverBiden #NeverKamala #unmaskamerica
Be very afraid!  Biden wants caravans full of window snatchers!
You know I thought once Biden wins #bernie stuff will die down and when that happened then it became about the VP spot and all that infighting around that and now we really fighting again amongst ourselves over speakers/for how long they speak at the DNC it never ends on here ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I love this idea, but I feel it might be backwards? I decided to vote for Biden. Not b/c I want to, I don‚Äôt and I‚Äôm so upset I‚Äôm in this place, but I am b/c I feel slight hope we can get Trump outta there. It‚Äôs literately the 1 silver lining of 2020. But I live in purple state.

So we excommunicate bishops who don't recognize the Pope Francis as the true Bishop of Rome but we idly stand by and watch this embarrassment (Biden) as he defends positions that are contrary to Church teaching? Nice job, Hierarchy, in upholding our values.  It begins with you!!!
Biden/Harris are going to clean up after the mess you‚Äôve made of our country. I loathe you with every fiber of my being.
We found our true leader - Xi Jinping Biden - a wanna be dictator
Biden could easily say "Because Donald Trump has disgraced the office that we hold dear, with his unwarranted and untrue accusations about my running mate, I will not dignify this in any form".
Day one of Biden in office he should get a medal
i have this mindset, and i do question how the party nominated biden. bernie was a far better pick but either more voters chose "electability" over m4a, or it was rigged. but biden is the result, and i'd rather see him in office than trump
They are such doubled standard people.  The more Biden opens his mouth the more Americans see big government like China

I am so sick of people confusing Harris as the obvious choice with her being the "safe" choice. Every ticket with a woman on it in US history as lost, and Biden put a multiracial Black woman on his. That's not a "safe" choice.
Are you trying to convince me that Biden sucks? Why? When did I indicate I don't already know that?
Biden and the future MVP (madame vice president)!!!
I don‚Äôt think they stop even if Biden wins. They want chaos and revelation. Just electing a Dem isn‚Äôt enough for them.

Well Biden hasn‚Äôt lead us into a recession, record job losses and small business closures, and almost 200k deaths from a virus that we could have easily contained has YOU listened to experts and set your ego aside for the people you represent

SeeShell  How about you go into details of A) Reade's assertions &amp; history B) Blasey-Ford's assertions &amp; history  And  Kavanaugh's replies. Biden's comments.  I spent time digging.  I'll wait....
Biden cares less if we live or not.
I think Biden isn‚Äôt all well...
Wrong! The world is laughing at Trumpito now. Change is coming with Biden/ Harris.. Vote for your life vote Joe!!
You really classify Kamala as as smart woman?  She‚Äôs an opportunist and will do anything to advance her political career. Just like Biden she has sold her soul to Satan. You are obviously a die hard liberal so you stick with these traitors no matter what. That‚Äôs your choice.

Lifelong AZ Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
we all believe we're correct. let's just respect our comrades even when we disagree. i respect you and your decision to not vote for biden. i only ask for that same respect
i've had this conversation with a lot of ppl, and usually it's been respectful. i never intended to shame anyone for not voting for biden. if you vote green party i have nothing against that. but it seems like you take personal issue with my voting decisions
Kamala Harris last year on Biden's praise for racist segregationists  via
Fox's favorite lush said Biden won't make the ballot. Trump said he has an October surprise. Does Pirro know something we don't? Or is it just another pink elephant in the room?

If by Joe Biden you mean you do. Then yes
Arizona Republicans for Biden - we need someone to unite our country and someone we can believe in #BidenHarris2020
im not a big fan of the Biden/Harris ticket, but the fact that the right is already questioning Kamala‚Äôs birth in the US (born in California) is filthy
My gosh Marci. I obv meant in this conversation no one is denying racism/sexism exist. Biden is not a racist. Kamala Harris is not a white man. Biden won black support bc he earned it over decades. It‚Äôs offensive 2suggest that unless people voted your way they have false beliefs
Bwahahaha ok who was using press conferences as campaign rallies? Can you all remind me please?  Fox News: Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‚ÄòStop playing politics with the virus‚Äô.
The Amendment says Dec 15th 1791 this is going to be a tuff one for any politician read what I have posted for you Joe Biden.
Mark my words, if Biden wins, those kids are still gonna be in cages and the police will still be fucks
Hey Joe Biden I think you need to read this it's very important
well first of all not everyone arguing this point is a liberal. getting tired of the leftists who gatekeep the community over things like this. plenty of leftists are voting for biden, and that doesn't make them not leftists
Hey Joe Biden while your at it why don't you come and take all my black belts when you knock on my door.
I know I don‚Äôt know how you actually make the doc and support Biden. Especially if you really care about mass incarceration but she must just be a black trauma peddler.
Last month 10 million guns were sold Biden says if he wins he coming for your guns.
How do you not understand the very simple idea that if you are born in Oakland, California, you are a citizen? Is this something that you can imagine in your fever dreams that Biden‚Äôs vetting would ignore.
Totally unacceptable.  The  and Biden campaign need to address this now. They can start by giving  a whole lot more than 60 paltry seconds to speak and adding  to the roster as well.
Biden says he is coming for your guns well I say how will you defend our great nation
The fact that Biden has been so aggressively against legalizing marijuana and Kamala thinks locking people up for possession is hilarious should be enough to turn off... 78% of Democrats.
Are you going to hold Joe Biden to a standard? Just asking for 80 million friends?
. needs to be working to *strengthen* his support among Latinos &amp; progressive‚Äì‚Äìomitting the deportation moratorium in this way undermines both efforts. The campaign must correct this immediately.
So sick of seeing  and their fake ass polls.   Biden-Harris up seven points?   Give me a break.
He is calling you Kamala Harris and Biden Dumb and Dumber hahaha
Joe can destroy trump. Joe Biden has the brains heart to lead our country. #BidenHarris2020
Hopefully #friendOfThePod Sen Harris can finally help book VP Biden on the pod. COME ON THE POD
The promise of a deportation moratorium was one of the most important commitments  made on immigration &amp; human rights during his campaign.  It must be included on his website, and the ticket must own and defend this crucial policy.
Everyone who is preaching for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than Trump‚Äù preaching ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù that guy said ‚Äúpoor people are just as smart as white people‚Äù my god
thanks for the respect. i do know who they are and why i'm voting. in my eyes i just can't see how trump and biden are equally bad, so i feel an obligation to vote for the lesser evil. a nice end to the conversation tho, thanks!
Biden has been wrong about everything for 40 years the only thing he holds steady on is his constant racism! #Trump2020 #NowMoreThanEver
Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£
. is right. As a delegate to the  I joined with him &amp; 100s of Biden, Bernie &amp; Warren delegates in voting NO on the platform because it excludes #MedicareForAll.  Especially during this pandemic, it is time to #DrawTheLine and guarantee health care to all as a right.
Tulsi debunked Clinton and Harris, the DNC, Russian plant, 3rdy party spoiler conspiracy theory and did as she said she was going 2 do from day 1. Support the eventual nom. U dont see her actively push her supporters 2 vote Biden, say how Biden will b the next FDR.Bernie does tho
I know I speak for many, many Americans in saying "We're certainly glad YOU'RE here  with us right now so you and future-President Biden can help lead us out of this darkness". Your mother was so wise, and definitely raised you and your sister right!
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
"Murder of innocent children is essential healthcare service." - Joe Biden
Trump doesn't have a pet. Let's face it any pet he would own would bite him.  Why doesn't some journalist ask him why Biden and Harris don't like cows?
I sleep well every night. So no difference for me. Even if Joe Biden wins the election there is so much damage done to the country that will need to be fixed. Life isn't going to switch to all good like flipping a light switch. Anyone thinking it will isn't being realistic.
This might actually sway the polls in Trump's favor. If Biden is smart he won't commit to anything with her until after Nov 3.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team

i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention
I've been going through all the bad people in the OT Bible casting them w/ Dems... Some are easy Jezebel - HRC. Ahab is of course WJC. Haman is BHO. Working on Nanshy, Schumer, &amp; Biden. Kamala plays Potiphar's wife. Satan - Soros. Job - General Flynn...

People will suffer regardless of who is in office. Biden is rejecting a true need for healthcare reform as people die or lose their homes due to the cost/69% support. Biden supports our wars overseas where the last admin he was in had a 90% civilian casualty rate. No moral ground
that makes no sense wtf. i'm voting for biden because i don't want the literal white supremacist in the white house. is that hard to understand?
BS. My wife and I are older folk and we support Trump. Most of our friends feel the same way, too. You wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to lie unless you were already worried Biden will lose the election.
Biden issues a mandate for everyone to wear masks outside!  What exactly is he in charge of to issue said mandate? #Trump2020
My state is a swing state, but even then I would encourage people who believe in their convictions to vote how they feel. I'm voting Biden but it's definitely the cowards way out for those who want real change, but I can only live my life and do best by the people I love.

If you were 50/50 between Biden and Trump and went 3rd party instead, it wouldn't be an issue because they both lost an equal shot at your vote.  It's not so much a vote for trump as a reduction in possible votes for Biden.  That being said, vote shaming is wrong, vote your heart
Any 12 year old joe Biden supporter needs to be yelled at sorry
You were never going to vote for trump, but you might have voted for Biden if he wasn't such a colossal tool. You voting third party or not voting represents the loss of a potential vote for King Douche but has no impact on trump, so it benefits him that you're not voting Biden.
I know I am!  Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Not enough time. By electing Biden it becomes a moot point.
There's another ACE in his backpack Trump's got going in his hand of cards . A Jewish son in law ü§£üòÇü§£ Kushner.  Biden is a losing hand in the White House.  ü§£üòÇü§£
How's that  house you're living in now for backing down and rolling over to let Joe Biden become the presumptive Democratic nominee
yeah that shit was awful. i hate that we have biden now instead of bernie. it sucks, but my biggest concern at the moment is whether trump gets elected, because frankly i can't tolerate another 4 years of this shit
Let's be real it's not Biden/Harris or Harris/Biden Come October Quid Pro Joe will be replaced with
I am voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Any intelligent person would.
ok this is too bad of a take for me to even respond lmfao. "biden is further right than trump" jfk best joke i've heard in a while
Not voting is a vote for no one. It‚Äôs not a vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a vote for Biden. The way America has put all the blame of corrupt politicians on the working class is bizarre.
has been arguing with me about Biden and Harris and how I need to vote for them because at least it's a shuffle in the right direction.   A shuffle ain't big enough. I want a fuckin rocket.
You‚Äôve destroyed the country. Joe Biden is our only hope
Let‚Äôs not forget what Harris did to Kavanaugh. Whe WAS very nasty. Horrible horrible person. Does anyone think Biden is a racist?  Only Harris. #nasty
it really doesn't take much energy or time though. also never claimed voting for biden is "revolutionary", i claimed it's strategic to prevent a worse outcome
Please don‚Äôt trouble yourself to come on my account. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! #facts
Not hardly.  I'd sooner vote for a Pig than Biden.
amen sir, true blue in AZ, voting biden/harris by mail in nov.

I get it. We cannot allow someone with a disgusting track record on criminal justice like Biden/Harris into office. We must vote Trump to save our face.  #maga
Nope gotta see Trump smash Biden
By the way what message was Joe Biden sending when he put his hand above Kamala Harris‚Äôs rump Creepy Joe just can‚Äôt help himself or maybe there is a sinister message like ‚Äú I got your back African Americans‚Äù
The ouster of the incumbent is a beginning, no more, and if Biden's no more than an unimaginative repairman, we will need to press for more fundamental reforms across a broad front. The best Biden can do is to call for a national discussion of the issue.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket
If Trump willingly leaves office in January, a focus of the Biden/Harris administration should be a post card tax return. Many Americans will have confusing returns next year - at least make it less complicated for them.
Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA.
The difference between Biden and Trump. Biden sends Billions to Ukrain to save his own ass and lets his son profit millions. Trump sends his Son in law to broker a peace deal with Israel and the UAE and he gets it done. #TRUMPISMYPRESIDENT #MAGA2020
Fuck yeah she was! She was my first choice for president and the main reason I am excited to vote for Biden!  The  days are numbered.
Get used to this white people if you want to elect Joe Biden
No, I don‚Äôt believe he ran for POTUS, so was pointing out that Kamala obvs had more support than Pence did so Trumps ‚Äúargument‚Äù is silly (per usual). I agree that a Biden/Harris win would immediately start the healing process we desperately need. Love you too!
The difference between the two sides is that we don't expect gov't to make everything better. If you want to know the big appeal, it's what did Trump do to stay TF out of my way and let me make my life better. If you rely on Biden/Harris to make your life better, that's pathetic
There is a new facebook group called Latter day Saints for Joe. Biden is speaking to the group this Saturday
Putin thinks trump is his private pawn, we will show him he will not win and we will take care of yu Putin when Biden takes office. Big time sanctions against you for all the interference in our elections. Putin &amp; Trump, your days are numbered.
That‚Äôs not the narrative EVERY single ‚Äònews‚Äô outlet and ‚Äòjournalist‚Äô I‚Äôve seen/heard ‚Äòreport‚Äô on Biden/Harris has to say.  They‚Äôre selling it as though it‚Äôs America‚Äôs strongest and most popular ticket of all time.

Harris is a very good choice, for Biden.  Why haven't you told Trump that he is at a third grade level, by all, of his goofy name calling?
Jeanne Pirro even speculates Biden won't fulfill election calculations because of his condition. Not mentally or physically.  He's not sharp as Trump or as intelligent.
Obama most corrupt in history! Joe Biden right there with him.

What does it take to be qualified as black these days? From the sounds of it Biden was deciding between two Indians. Warren and harris.

Biden did nothing in office but line his and his family‚Äôs pockets with cash.
Don‚Äôt worry Mr. President The Biden Harris honeymoon will end very quickly when Biden realizes that Harris is running for president If Biden wins the presidency he will be asked by the left to step aside and resign and will protected from being impeached for his sons crimes

Local people did it.  Some on that list are voting Biden; I'm voting Jorgensen.  Others leaving their vote blank.  I do think Trump is that bad.  The guy is an incompetent moron.  Now that we got those SCOTUS seats, he does more long term harm than short term good.
Interesting you portray yourself as the fast moving train since you are a total train wreck.  And I've seen you and Biden do the basic function of walking and he runs circles around you.   #BidenHarris2020
James, how long. Write we start seeing shot like this again for 1% Biden and 2% Harris?
She‚Äôs not even the Trojan horse. Wait till after the convention.... they will declare biden unfit and throw in Hillary and Obama in their place.
It is the truth tho? Like demonstrably. Biden has overwhelming support from core dem constituencies - particularly black women. So that‚Äôs democracy. Not me trying to make myself feel better.
This shows me that you guys were woefully unprepared for her as Biden's running mate.  Is this seriously all you have?
Does the election ever become a market issue?  1. Biden presidency will be far less Wall Street friendly while a Senate/House sweep significantly raises odds for higher corporate taxes &amp; buyback rules.  2. Trump could refuse to leave  and set off a banana republic type crisis.
Ayo what the fuck are you on  We‚Äôre all agreeing on Trump needing to be kicked out,but the only way to do that is Biden/Harris. West won‚Äôt do shit except divide the vote as an independent, and two others are already doing that. We can‚Äôt afford that shit right now.
Fox News' Jeanine Pirro baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen to Joe Biden': "I just have this feeling."
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
That'll be a riot in my gizzard laughing myself sick if Joe Biden screws up and calls Kamala for Michelle Obama.  She'll never live it down! ü§´
Any parent who loses a child mourns the loss of what he could have been. I feel Joe Biden‚Äôs emptiness.
Joseph Biden, President of the United States. Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States. At this moment in time, there are no other REALISTICALLY POSSIBLE more important two sentences than those two. We have to insure the freedom of not just our country? But of the world
It's not something anyone has to try to do. Biden has already has many years of success doing it himself.
i feel the same. unfortunately so many leftists on here care more about purity. saying you'll vote for biden is guaranteed to get you called a liberal. gatekeepy af
honestly, as someone who will vote for biden, i think this is a pretty solid argument for why voting third party isn't a bad idea. i've seen so many weak arguments from bernie or busters that this is kinda a breath of fresh air to me
Herman Cain Twitter Account Shares Posthumous Attack on Biden and Harris
I get the sentiment but it isn‚Äôt entirely true. Kamala DID do a lot of those things. And more importantly, the actual Presidential Canidate Joe Biden did a lot of those things.
yeah the liberals suck. i'm just saying that the ppl you are seeing from the #NoComeradesUnder1k tag probably are leftists, you shouldn't dismiss them just because they say they will vote for biden. we have legitimate reasons for our decision

glad you don't shame anyone! i agree that the gaslighting from neolibs is bad, just know that not everyone voting for biden is a neolib. i hate that i have to vote for him, but i still will
Not caring about this info is a privilege imo...she never said to vote for Trump. It is important to acknowledge the harm she has caused so many different communities while still deciding to vote for her. Biden/Harris have to earn their votes they‚Äôre not entitled to zero crit
y'all gotta realize that it's possible for a leftist to vote for biden. because some of are adamant about preventing trump getting reelected. i understand taking issue with ppl trying to shame you into voting biden, but don't shame ppl voting for him either

if you think trump and biden are equally bad, please take a look at the covid-19 numbers and remember: trump did this
there is no way that biden would be treating the pandemic similar to how trump is. if you really think that biden and trump are the same on this issue, then i wonder if you are even aware of what's happening in this country
biden? he's not currently in any position of power to enact policies, but he's at least been using platform to promote scientific/medical consensus. trump is a science denier who doesn't even believe covid-19 exists. he encourages ppl to not wear masks. he's pushed for reopening
Kamala ran for Senator as an American Indian.    She ran for President as that poor little black girl.     When she and Biden lose, what will she be?........unemployed.

they aren't tho?? "i like this candidate" is an opinion. "these two candidates are different" is a factual statement. one of my claims is that voting for biden will help prevent trump's reelection, again a factual statement
Joe Biden was not my 1st choice. He wasn‚Äôt my first 5. There‚Äôs a few things I don‚Äôt agree with him about. But I do believe if he‚Äôd been president thousands would not have died. Millions would still have jobs. I do believe he‚Äôd listen to experts.And I do think he has a good heart.
honestly very concerned with how an attempted assault weapons ban under biden would play out. all right wing gun nuts talk about is prepping to use their guns to fight the govt if they have to. even if it didn‚Äôt make it very far i could see some fucked up shit happening
Rule for biden at debates or those interviewing  always bring up windmills ..... hates them.
Why is it that whenever anyone tweets anything remotely critical of joe biden - or in this case not even koe biden, but one of his followers - thousands of trump haters pop out of the woodwork? You realize that criticizing trump doesn make biden better, right? Surely? #BidenVP

Fighting for the people my foot.  U think u and Biden can do better job at COVID? Ha! I think not! You are dreaming.  You don't care about anything Ms. Harris. You are NOT fooling this lady at all. You embody the worst of people, sorry to say.
Biden also mispronounced his running mate's name. Seems  was okay until  tried to get rich quick. Ask  how it's done.
Trump‚Äôs running attack ads on Joe Biden like Ben Wyatt on Bobby Newport
It shows the Trump train blowing through small town, shuttered and shut down America while it shows Biden as hard working and determined on that handcar to repair what Trump has done.   Also, I made a better video in my 8th grade computer science class.
...the best you can do in this situation is vote for a leftist third party, but that party has no chance of winning. only biden or trump can win. so which will it be? one is worse than the other. do you really believe fascism is better than neoliberalism?

Please clarify:    Q: What do you mean by an "invasion" in the suburbs if VP Joe Biden is elected?  President Trump: "They're going to destroy suburbia. And 30 percent of the people in suburbia are minorities.  They say 35 percent, but I like to cut it lower."What about Obama‚Äôs lies? Biden? Hillary? Pelosi? Schumer? How did they get so rich while they‚Äôre in public office? You never thought of asking these questions of your party? Perhaps you should before casting your vote in November
Keep on believing that Biden will save you. You are in for a rude awakening if he wins.
Biden chooses communist to head his digital Arizona campaign. Keep this in mind as we head to November.
Why not recommend that Congress stay in section until a compromised deal can get done? They might listen to you and you might even get a cabinet spot under a Biden/Harris administration
So many people on my tl are employing each other to settle for Biden/Harris. But will think that anyone that voted for Trump/Pence is full throated MAGA. Like Republicans didn‚Äôt settle for Trump when it came to him and Clinton.

Disappointed, but not surprised about Kamala. The other highly unpopular candidate that the establishment chooses for us? Of course. Considering Biden's age she might actually be president.  Only going to be that much harder to bully them from the left now.
Very possible that I might change. She emphasizes the worst parts of Biden‚Äôs political history.
NEW: Pres. #Trump already out with a campaign ad against #Biden‚Äôs VP pick Sen. #KamalaHarris
Fortification pick; if Biden has to resign or otherwise makes it through his first term (if elected) and decides he doesn't want to re-run, Harris will be "in the pipe" and ready to roll.  I think she was always the right choice strategically and politically.

Don‚Äôt think Biden is completely stupid. He has to know that he just threw the election by his choice of running mate. I think it was intentional. It‚Äôs his own way of ensuring he does not have to be president. Buzarre
Biden my take on him he does not want to be president. He wants to retire but for some reason he won‚Äôt just admit
OMG you really put this out there.  Seriously, like it's going to work.  People have seen the ignorance of trump, the whole no tests, no cases BD he keeps bring up pretty much sealed the deal!! Trumps an idiot.  Biden believes in science and would have from the get go!
An idiot would. Also, President dumpster fire says he knows about top secret meetings he had with middle eastern countries and you don‚Äôt know them. I‚Äôm like Biden probably does because he was that close to the president before you got into this game, Donny boy.
Stupid. That means giving the asshole tRump 4 more years to destroy our country irreparably. Baby steps. Vote Biden/Harris. It's the ONLY sane choice.
So when Biden goes to the pasture does Nancy Pelosi take over as President or Vice President?
Vote on policies, if you want America turned into Venezuela vote for Biden and Harris if you want America restored to its constitutional vote for Trump.

I don‚Äôt think so. But policy wise he has better policies. The Dems support endless depraved policies. Until yesterday my vote was third party or write in. The story about James Younger pushed me over the edge. I will vote trump, but more so against Biden.

I'm sorry but is  running for President or is  ? We have heard more from Kamala in the last few days than we have heard from Biden in months. ü§î
Joe loved Beau and was a real father. ‚ù§Unlike  He was Never a dad to  and  That is why they are so jealous of biden and Obama.
Kamala is a strong leader, a daughter of immigrants, and has a passion for justice. Like us, she is a happy warrior in the battle for the soul of America. We will spend every minute of the next 85 days making sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris replace Trump  Pence
Biden will be able to clean up the mess from day one.
I have one question for you, do you believe in the human race? Then why in Gods  name would you not be voting for Biden!
He's been in politics and in one leadership role or another for many years. Many many years and we have accomplished very little.  No on Biden, He's been a politician for too long, we need new choices with business mind. The United States is a business not a school ground

Demo-rat funded orgs have been rioting, looting and murdering for nearly 100 days causing sheer chaos  Biden has admitted publicly the plan is to use his name to get Kamala Harris into the oval office for her globalist backers  but... Republicans are dishonest.
How funny that the democrats are using Biden who‚Äôs a open racist with dementia and Kamala Harris which put thousands of black people to jail for minor crimes and is a defendant of black slave owners.
Agree,  Can and should however point out her Leftist Senate Voting r√©cord and the Biden/Harris  Leftist Agenda!
Even the Dems didn‚Äôt want Kamala, but DS will push wicked &amp; ruthless on the People. Biden is one step away from a nursing home. Even so Kamala can‚Äôt win unless a massive cheat by mail &amp; computer fraud happens.
100% Biden kamlala supporters rioting and looting. Democrats provide sanctuary, bail, encouragement.

Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'   Her voting record is further left than Bernie Sanders.
You‚Äôre gonna have to do a lot better than that if you want a pardon. Endorsement and complete and total oppo against Biden. Maybe float some fake conspiracy theory. ‚ÄúInsider leaks never before released‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have to be believable. Pucker up buddy.
which begs the question:  Which will be worse, 4 more years of Trump and then we're done with him, or 12 years of corporate controlled neoliberals Biden/Harris?
There's also this:  Trump wins and we're stuck with him for another 4 years, then he's out.  Biden wins, and we're likely stuck with him and Kamala Harris for 12 years if Biden bows out after 2 years due to "health reasons". Kamala takes the reins and can run for reection twice.
The Biden/Harris Campaign Launches four more Ads in¬†Arizona
That's my thinking too. Biden is a figurehead POTUS for the first 2 years, then bows out due to "health reasons".  Kamala officially becomes POTUS and because there's less than two years remaining in the term, she would be eligible to run for reelection twice.  So yeah, 12 years.
It keeps Biden from aimlessly meandering around the "set". He stays seated long enough to video him. Kind of like a baby pen.
I understand the other. I understand Trump, though it is problematic. How the heck can you vote for Biden?
UAE Publicly Recognize The State of Israel. HISTORIC. There are Democrats in Congress who do not. Breaking News Biden says wear a Mask.

Wrong.  It's like having Trump shit on you and taking a shower to wash it off.  Then moving away from Trump and getting Biden who won't shit on us.
Bill Biden?
Failure - Worst President Ever!!! 2nd Fattest! Worst Leadership Style. Most Americans dies in one year due to inaction on his watch. Most divisive President. Racist, Orange, Wild Comb Over. One Term. Defeated by an older man a black woman. This is what he will be known for.
The world will CELEBRATE WHEN YOU ARE GONE.  My bet is you will be in Russia before Biden moves into the "PEOPLES HOUSE'.  It is the only way you will stay out of jail.  I'll bet he makes a deal with Biden and sends you back...roflmao
I don't understand how this is satire. It's simply the kind of bad argument certain kinds of politically pretentious types would make, no indication you aren't serious. Your bio says "Never Biden" in it. You may know you're kidding, but to random Twitterites, how do we know?
I could care less for Kamala (and Biden for that matter).  But how much control did she *really* have over those issues?  To what degree was she truly involved?   And how much power did she have to reverse these issues?
So Refreshing to read all this and Not hearing any name calling!  Just so Peaceful and Facts Thank You Joe Biden !!   üá∫üá∏‚≠ê
USPS sucks because Bruh is cutting services so SEE USPS sucks? What the hell is wrong with you? Would this be okay if Obama or Biden did it? Mail in voting in AZ, FL, NC. Trump says those places are a-okay but not anywhere else!
Of course taxes will be raised, after the mess you created. The difference when PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN raises taxes is it will be the rich 1% that have to pay!

Pelosi is as out of touch as Biden. TRUMP SAID THE MEDIA'S REPORTING ABOUT THE VIRUS WAS A HOAX NOT THE FACT OF THE VIRUS! Why in the name of truth can't conservatives tell the truth about this every time this cow says that? To quote Biden,  "C'mon man."
But there is no backwards for people in my position. When you hit rock bottom you have nothing to lose. YOU might have something to lose, but I don't care about you, I care about me. And since Biden will do nothing to improve my life I'll be staying home. D party can suck it
It‚Äôs Biden for Christ sake! They know he‚Äôs a republican!
Uugh, I owe you nothing,  don't know you and once again,  since you rely on the leftwing rag Politico for contemporary Church history you're not looking for truth and therefore you're as untrustworthy as a Joe Biden apology or as Kamala Harris being African American.
Best revenge is buy face shields, wear a mask, distance 6 feet and vote in person and lets be counted so overwhelming on election night Trump gets to hear the election called for Biden-Harris.
All voting Biden buy face shields. wear over masks &amp; vote in person. Horse is out of the barn. Trump has already set up vote by mail with chaos, confusion &amp; in person votes will be counted on election night preventing Trump tying election up in court or Barr SCOTUS interference.
Biden raises $26M in 24 hours after VP announcement...  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Most people are OK masking-up indoors where one can't socially-distance. But if Biden becomes associated with the masked alone in their cars/hiking in the desert/jogging in a park folks, he'll just look like a nut, and will turn off the 'middle ground' folks he needs to win over.

Nope someone‚Äôs wrong somewhere trump is running the country the right way instead of the wrong way Biden wants everyone and there brother to come in and blow up everyone and he wants illegals to roam freely and gangs as well think about it we want trump
Why should the  want COVID-19 relief?  If Trump wins, they have four more years of graft and corruption.  If he loses they blame Biden for the mass death and depression.   They obviously don‚Äôt give a damn about anything or America.
It's really simple- all Kamala has to do to get my unwavering support, is to just keep her word! #MedicareForAll   Unfortunately, there's about 0% chance she will keep her word; she will fall in-line behind Biden.
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!

45 will always be 45. 46 will be Biden, or 45 will continue for another 4 yrs. DNC &amp; Dem elites rejected the will of the people and gave us a corporate controlled career politician with dementia as their candidate. If Dem's lose again, they have no one to blame but themselves.

Let's talk money, #Biden's plan isn't "sever" since - Most players can gain as short-term that are taxed as ordinary income. Currently long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15%, 20% depending on taxable income &amp; filing status. Hire a good accountant, - be LLC - it works out.
This is why democrats can't get their party in line. Too many republicans like the Clintons, Obama, Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer are dividing it. About 40% of dems are progressive, that leaves 60% divided among the other factions. Dissing 40% of the base is not smart, especially now.
YOUR TURN: Joe Biden running mate Sen. Kamala Harris called the Trump administration "failed government" &gt;&gt;   Do you agree?
With every possible step the DNC could take to help Biden win progressive votes, they're doing the opposite. Kamala antagonizes them &amp; Biden's campaign mirrors Hillary's with no hope of progressive policies only offering the "Biden's not as bad" line. They're going to lose again.
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.
Opinion | Biden and Harris are the perfect rebuke to ‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô
There needs to be a daily fact check press conference by any Democrat in Congress or even Biden/Harris.
Ignore the solicitations, that‚Äôs fine. But Bernie very badly wants you to vote Biden in Nov ( and so do I!).
So anyway Trump is literally trying to take away our ability to vote but yeah  keep telling me why Biden is just as bad
There‚Äôs a whole sect of liberals who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden/Harris because they have done nothing but attempt to woo current trump voters. You‚Äôre not going to. Work on getting the left back, not going more central. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll win.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSeniors for Biden: Social Security Anniversary Event hosted by Jill Biden and Louis Gossett Jr.‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
And this is what I LOVE about a Biden/Harris administration. They can pivot-when they are alerted to something amiss, they fix it. Happy for all of us! Will be watching üëç
Do K Harris and J Biden not have access to the same testing Trump and Pence and their people have? What's with the masks on stage? Statement? "We're with the sheep?"
I mean... one of them is Veep, and it‚Äôs not the one I was rooting for. And I loved Tulsi. She let us all down when she could‚Äôve gone for Biden‚Äôs jugular.
It's OK sir, no need to ship your pants, we'll get through this Biden/Harris ticket
Last night I dreamt I was riding Splash Mountain with Joe Biden and RuPaul.   Anyone have any interpretation for that?
If Joe Biden expressed confidence in me I would file a defamation law suit.
You have taken every bit of dignity out of this country you have destroyed it from the inside out Joe Biden will bring us out of the darkness
The video I retweeted of joe Biden talking about little boys rubbing his leg hair and how he likes little kids jumping on his lap got deleted, it‚Äôs too bad they can‚Äôt rid the internet of chid porn the way they do embarrassing videos of joe Biden.
It makes sense Kamala was chosen by Biden. Her family owned slaves and Biden is quoted as saying "I'll be damned if I will pay reparations for the sins of my father and grandfather ". Google it. And then watch the deflecting.
The banks saw record profits under Trump, making them among the main beneficiaries of his 40 percent cut in the corporate tax rate and easing Obama-era regulations.  They‚Äôre backing Biden anyway.   via
I‚Äôm a man I‚Äôm not insulted I think she‚Äôs a great pick.... I think she‚Äôs exactly what we need coupled with Joe Biden
So they're getting children to phone bank for Biden? Are they the ones from the cages?
Trump announces 'Historic Peace Agreement' between Israel, UAE   Just the kind of deal a Biden could never pull off because the UAE would never give Hunter a Board seat on anything they control.
Do you think its likely that joe biden ever became president  ?
They've also killed more ppl than Obama/Biden. 160,000+ and growing. That's just the pandemic, doesn't include mass shootings and bountied soldiers. Also more lies than anyone in any admin. More corruption than admin.
What a joke.  A white dude pretending to be biracial (#phony) to attend a #black college now leads an arm of #BLMAntifaTerroristsThugs  A phony for a #PhonyKamalaHarris   Does it get any phonier?    Remember when he pointed out #Biden &amp; #Kamala had WORST #racist record?
That's awesome, a #phony for a #PhonyKamalaHarris   Can we get any phonier? A white dude pretending to be biracial (phony) to attend a black college‚Äînow leading an arm of #BLMAntifaTerroristsThugs   Remember when he pointed out #Biden &amp; #Kamala had WORST #racist record?
If ever there was a reason to INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE this is it - Judge Jeanine Makes Ominous Biden Prediction   Why did she say that? Does she know something? Is she psychic or psycho?
You mean Tucker said her name the same way Biden did. Perhaps Biden was also disrespecting her.
Doesn't matter what your intent or personal outlook on third party voting is, I'm telling you the effect it has in reality. Depending on the state you're in, Trump or Biden thank you for your support.
And?? That is why I am thrilled she's was pick for PP for Biden..#NastyWomenVote
So Biden and Harris weren‚Äôt your first choice and you‚Äôre thinking about not voting in protest?  Think again.
in reality, only by being critical can anything actually improve. left media is not covering these things because a biden+harris ticket is so problematic that reporting on it would seriously impact the election. journalist are afraid to be labeled pro-trump for just being honest
This is flat out untrue. Anyone who took the time to listen to all of the words that Trump spoke would know he was referring to the normal people on both sides of disagreement. NOT the extreme of either. Biden...take your Aricept.
Just saw a Trump ad attacking Biden. Narrator sounded like Sam Elliot. I REALLY hope it wasn't actually him and just an impersonator.
#BidenHarris2020 Yep, I said it. Your only excuse is you‚Äôre sure Biden is so senile that it‚Äôs not really him you‚Äôre voting for.
Goodbye tRump!  Hello Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   üß¢BUILD BACK BETTERüß¢ üá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏ üó≥ üì¨
my instructor told me do a paper specifically on ‚Äúhow NOT to do business-And fail in life‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know who to pick, he said why don‚Äôt you do the next runner-up for president he‚Äôs a businessman and it was downhill from there in my thought process of him, and his family
Ur just jealous because ppl support them and ur ratings once again as always is in the shitter. I am voting for Biden and Harris. They will lead our country back to where it should be. He will work for the ppl not the other way around like Frump has done 4 the last 3 1/2 yrs.
Yeah no shit huh that‚Äôs not even a joke I really did do a research paper on the Trump business when I was in business school and I found out all sorts of shit and that was one of them zero military service (that I could see anyway)
No, .la, Trump "inherited" a huge mess!  He changed a crippled economy to booming one. He revived our military which obummer had nearly depleted.  The housing industry soared. Most of those biden and obummer had put on food stamps became proud independent employees.
So I watch the history channel documentary which I put up on this feed a couple of times when Trumps grandpa Went back to Germany, Germany refused to take them back, so they had to come back to the United States because of exactly that - he dodged the German mandatory military
A little etymologious disclosure...  Biden is Saxon of the genitive; Button which was a given name to those of nobility who made garments.  Harris is the English form of "harry" or "Harold" which means to "call forth" or take from or off.  Biden Harris - Take off your clothes.
Joe Biden lying to the American people for 50 years!
Biden needs to debate President Trump! That will show what a shame he is. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory #MAGA
RUN DONNY RUN! Ur going to get ur ass kicked so hard when Biden/Harris wins that ur ass is going to get between ur shoulders and then u will be talking out of ur ass. I know ur scared shitless so start running. And no cheating like u did in 2016.
Biden should know better, to no avail.  Will you trash him?
Progressives throwing a temper tantrum every time Biden does something is annoying as hell.  This election is a binary choice.  You couldn't get coalition or consensus when it came to the Dem ticket.  Move on and make things better.
im so conflicted and none of the posts i see like this seem to mention that BIDEN IS A RAPIST
Will the choice of Harris for VP make a difference?   Biden for President announced that in the 24 hours since announcing Kamala as the running mate, the campaign has raised $26 million from 150,000 grassroots donors.
I agree üíØ%. He has been attacking Biden and now Harris because he is scared because he knows that they r going to beat his ass. The only way he will win is by doing the same thing in 2016. He is a cheater, liar and that is all he knows how to do things. Biden/Harris2020
Guess she doesn't know  The Kennedys. Biden Pelosi are/were all Catholics? Not to mention the Pope? None of them would be fit to be judges? Did she notice that the pastors of her Baptist faith are among the RICHEST people in the WORLD? Priests take the vow of Poverty?
She is and will always be better then u. Biden and Harris are a good team. And I know u hate that he picked Harris for a reasons. 1.She is half African American 2. Half Asian  and  3. She is a woman. All these that u r racist toward. Ur going to lose!
Biden is just as much Fascism as Trump. The difference is one hides it
Democrats are desperate to get Trump to add $3 Trillion to his credit card to give Biden, if elected, a Bank Account &amp; more room to spend.
No, she's not. Unless the GOP is actually threatening to kill Biden just to make that happen, in which case ... isn't that illegal? Even implicitly?
Whoever is writing Joe Biden's tweets must have learned from Saul Alinsky. No lie is too great - with the expectation that if you repeat it enough, people will come to believe it's the truth. Can our country survive this level of misinformation, flat out lies and propaganda?
I am not charging you or others that I have seen with this. Jemar worries me a bit. Yeah. When I see ANYONE publically support or like or give the impression of supporting people like Biden and Harris, it worries me. Same with Trump. I am only leaning more Trump because of Biden.

Reasons not to vote for Joe Biden?
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Joe Biden is a deteriorating shill of a Value Brand politician, way passed his prime... whatever that was... who can‚Äôt even stop himself from groping children when in front of the cameras   They think the American people are dumb.
Dear stupid, Biden is walking UP a dry ramp. Trump is walking DOWN a damp slippery ramp. He knew the media would have had great joy in watching him fall. Trump made a wise choice to slow walk the ramp. Pres. Ford fell and media never left it alone.
Joe Biden who stated that Communist China is NOT an economic threat to America. Biden who stated blaming Communist China for CCP virus is xenophobic! Biden who pushed to give China Most Favored Nation status. A vote for Biden is a vote for Communist China!
Biden has accomplished a great deal when it comes to helping Communist China take American jobs, pushed through Most Favored Nation State for China and made himself and his cocaine snorting dishonorably discharged son filthy rich.
Can‚Äôt wait for President Biden and vice President Harris to walk into that White House
Look what amazing shape Biden is in!!
#racist #Trump must only know the name of 1 black person in the Senate- #CoryBooker
I know. COVID took round 2 away from us and Biden is getting to slide by ‚òπÔ∏è
... Is this a thought trapped in Joe Biden‚Äôs brain?
Yeah she is, she could‚Äôve destroyed biden, had it teed up and everything, and fumbled because she‚Äôs just a shiny set of keys meant to distract
Seriously ya'll.  Vote like Biden is down by 20 points.
Why am I voting for Biden? Well, aside from the fact that I am tired of hearing about the president, and for something stupid or scary every damn day, Biden have an typical experienced and functional administration that wont getting fired and arrested constantly.
Bashing Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt gonna help us beat Trump. Biden could pick a carrot for running mate and I will still put on my clown makeup every day and pretend it‚Äôs the best carrot for the job in hopes of convincing other Democrats to vote for him- aka not vote for Trump.
I want the debates.  I want to see Biden crash and burn.
That might be so for you, but you only get 2 choices, Biden or Trump, which one do you choose?
Yes he is. Confident people like Joe Biden are not afraid of criticism or different view points. They listen to good consul and hire the most qualified individuals and demand that they always tell how it is. Week individuals like Trump just want to be praised and adulated.
You want a battle??? GOOD. WE are ready. WE have 35K personnel who are all former military and liars like Biden/Obama are on our list. (just so you know the truth- HRC bought those votes) The votes were cast by illegals &amp; dead people. You want to fight.... Bring it. SEMPER FI
Economically, years, but I know this, the minute Biden gets elected, world leaders and allies will reach out to him. We will once again be respected around the üåé
The party of Joe Biden!

If Joe Biden was a ray
What a difference listening to Biden and Harris as opposed to Trump and Pence. The first speak of compassion, hope and concrete plans to help us against COVID-19, rebuilt our country and economy. The later speaks of self praise, adulation, hate, division, lies and indecision.
Every time the MAGA crowd accuses Biden of "hiding in his basement," I like to point out that this means he's beating Trump without really trying. What's gonna happen when he really kicks in to gear?  We saw it today, and it was beautiful.
Hey Deb do you think she‚Äôll call him a racist like she called Joe Biden in a debate
I wonder if she‚Äôll call him a racist like she call Joe Biden
i think you‚Äôre over thinking this. she could mean, he‚Äôs old and could die. either way she‚Äôs theorizing about Biden‚Äôs demise. but it is an open question.
honestly if the Biden/Harris campaign wanted to get the Buster lefties on their side they'd use the right wing attack ads as their slogans lol
the right will think socialism wins even when the most conservative democrat gets in office!   Imagine how many garbage memes we'd get if Biden wins. tbh I kinda prefer that to the Ben Garrison deification of Trump.
The only worse choice for VP Biden could have made would be Nancy Pelosi
so what this video tells me is biden is a hard worker whos more relatable to the masses, and also not a fat out of shape fuck

Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
1. People going back to work is not ‚Äújob creation‚Äù 2. Obama/Biden created more jobs each year of their administration than Trump/Pence 3. Jobless rate is over 10% and the economy contracted by over 1/3.  4. You have destroyed the growing economy you inherited
Remember when we pithed the live frog in Biology so we could dissect it? Save the pithing because Biden is already motionless.

I agree they are trying to rig the election, but arresting Obama, Biden, Clinton is not worth the trouble it will cost. Barr is not stupid. He‚Äôs putting his energy into Comey, whose arrest would support their theory of the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù w/o enticing riots.
and Biden running on a position of "let's diversify rich white neighborhoods through zoning!" certainly would not be a winning strategy. (nor would it align with his past positions on such issues... like, *at all*.)
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòa Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
Hey DJ, You must be confused. Your tweet is for BIDEN-HARRIS!!!!
Barr is evil, he‚Äôs not stupid. He‚Äôs after Comey, et al, not Obama, Biden, Clinton. Even he said the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of would not be illegal. Clinton was cleared, yet again, by Barr‚Äôs own DOJ. The political cost is not worth it.
The DOJ is going after Comey, et al. Barr has already said that even the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of was not illegal. Barr‚Äôs own corrupt DOJ cleared Hillary yet again.
Any vote against Biden-Harris in first past the post voting, which the US uses, is a vote for Il Cheeto and Penny.
I just got a letter from Blue Cross.  They made too much money last year and are sending everyone a check.  Thanks Obama/Biden!
A Biden-Harris dynamic will not only bring better policies for poor &amp; middle class, they'll bring integrity, competence, honor, and grace to the WH. Unlike Trump who only deals in fear, hatred, racism, misogyny, and stupidity. So happy when he leaves office; he never deserved it.

I believe the Biden/Harris campaign should make it clear that when elected, they will look into which Trump appointees have actively used their positions to disrupt government in order to reelect Trump.

Joe Biden is a Thief and a Liar, Corrupt to the Core !
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
The thing is though, like 90% of what Trump says, that's a bald faced lie.  Biden has released plans for policy, unlike Trump who literally has no plan, and he plans on increasing police budgets. Aren't you supposed to be a journalist? How about you do a modicum of research?
Anyone who chooses not to vote is essentially de facto voting for Trump. Biden/Harris were not my first choice but 4 more years of Trump is unthinkable! Please reconsider your decision not to vote.
Best I can say to people who are really upset their guy didn‚Äôt make it, and hate Biden and Harris is to think of it this way:  This election, you don‚Äôt vote FOR, you are absolutely voting AGAINST.
If you all have been screaming "defund the police" "ACAB" "fuck 12" or anything of the like but you gonna vote Biden/Harris just because it's not Trump......you're fuckin stupid, beyond stupid  There are more than those 2 choices......
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden huh!
Says the clown who has Biden/Harris 2020 as their Twitter handle.  The irony is epic
...Under President Barack Obama, Biden was wrong to advise against the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. And when President Trump ordered the successful and helpful killing of Iran‚Äôs terrorist-supporting Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Biden opposed that, too.
...Biden was wrong on the Reagan doctrine, wrong on the 1980s defense buildup, wrong on the Strategic Defense Initiative. He was wrong to oppose the first Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition deftly kicked Saddam Hussein‚Äôs troops out of Kuwait.
Former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served presidents of both parties, famously said that Biden had been wrong about ‚Äúnearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.‚Äù

I don't really like Joe Biden. But Kamala is smart, quick, &amp; competent enough to make up for most of it. Plus, I'm honest enough to admit I'll vote for just about anyone to get #45 out. I voted for Hillary in 2016, and I'll vote for Biden (again) in 2020. #BidenHarris2020

If that's how you want to look at it but the truth is I'm fighting against Biden because Biden is the person who wrote the laws that have mass incarcerated black people since the 90's so I'm actually fighting FOR yall and trying to pull the wool off your eyes.
Arizona Reaction to the Biden/Harris Democratic¬†Ticket
I tell people not to vote for Biden because his history is the reason trunp has so much power to do whatever he wants. He wrote, voted, and co sponsored Bill's we are currently fighting. I will not vote for that.
Remember, President Trump talked about grabbing pussy, Biden actually did.
So- you're not going to vote for Biden/Harris?  They will be the most progressive people in the white house since FDR.  But- not good enough for you?
Tucker Carlson warned last night that if Biden is elected, everything Trump has done to this country will be reversed!  I think this is a genius plan......thanks,
You need to ask a simple question my nephew knows how to do a video call but apparently joe doesn‚Äôt know unless he doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know.  üò≤ collusion we need to get a special counsel for biden what‚Äôs up. Come on, man !!
I don't want to hear what a great job  has done with the economy.  Obama / Biden did a better job!

Joe Biden Represents Failed Consensus | Opinion
did all of the negotiations. You know you're a rascist, a mysogenest, and a low life sexual deviant. Quit the charade. Resign your presidency or Biden and Harris will humiliate you beyond your gravest fears. You're going to prison regardless of the route you travel.
SOUND OFF: Joe Biden selected his former rival, Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election.   Harris is the first woman of color named to a major-party national ticket.
With a Biden Victory would Hollywood feel loved again in Europe?
We have 4% of the worlds population we have 25% of the worlds cases of Covid we have 20% of the deaths that is news that other story is just tragic.....VOTE BIDEN
so you aren‚Äôt voting? and you literally have been shaming me as a biden voter this entire conversation. lmfao
Trump is not running against Harris. However, Biden is so incompetent that is probably the Goal. I don‚Äôt even see an appearance with Yrump &amp; Harris on a TV Show. Harris will now replace Jill Biden who‚Äôs been taking questions in place of Joe.
Biden gave over his seat on the bus. ‚òÆÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üëäüèΩ
They won't. It's on us. We need to focus on local countywide gov and vote downballot. Lets say Biden gets in, that gives us at least 4 years to work on our ground game and build from the bottom up.
Again. Watching TV. And are there no mirrors in the White House?  No one could call you gaunt. Maybe you should get a bike like Biden and go for a ride every now and then.

Madam Satan as VP with Biden admitting he is old &amp; Harris May become President.
I agree with people holding Kamala and Biden accountable for mass incarceration, deportations, etc. Now, when they go ahead and support violent regimes in countries like Venezuela and Bolivia all at the same time...that‚Äôs when I can see the HUGE disconnect.
Terry Sullivan‚Äôs comments about Joe Biden ‚Äúhiding in his basement‚Äù and comparing the excitement of Kamala Harris as VP pick being equivalent to sitting on a football to beat the clock we‚Äôre unhelpful, and unwelcome to me. His ‚Äúman cave‚Äù decor was a total, unappealing distraction
Not only did Pres Obama predict it, it's part of a cycle and Health Services have always predicted one.  And Joe Biden had written up an Op Ed in Jan 24th, 2020 telling everyone, everyone that the new Corona Virus could be the pandemic that Obama/Biden had prepared for.
Joe Biden should debate Diaper Donnie only if the Diaper releases his tax returns for the last 20 years first.
no i‚Äôm not. Biden is not who i want as president but i cant do anything about the candidates. all i can do is vote. i believe he is the lesser evil and will not attack blacks and mexicans and other minorities like trump has during these last 4 years.
"She Never Called Biden Racist" Watch Fox News Fact Check Trump Statement on Kamala Harris  via

He flip flops. Now he‚Äôs mad that Kamala will be VP. Get ready for a lot of anti Biden content now.
you prefer an open racist? obviously i would rather have someone who is not racist or homophobic or sexist but we don‚Äôt have any in our options. realistically it‚Äôs between trump and biden, so i prefer biden.
If it's proven that Joe Biden is guilty of withholding a billion dollars to remove a prosecutor looking into Burisma...  Can Ukraine extradite him?
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris   Normally I would not belittle anyone for such petty things, but in this toxic environment of politics where the Left has put our side under the microscope, all is fair game.
Biden Harris campaign slogan  I'll get paid, you blow them.
Lol if Biden cant win without my vote then biden simply cant win and should have never stole the election from the candidate polling higher than everyone
And as for Joe Biden, Trump shows no signs of ceasing the same old lies about Joe Biden being a far-left destroyer of the American city that made the President lose many, many times before.
Trump is going into a lot more than overdrive on that front. In fact, he's headed straight into a state of personal confusion regarding Biden's VP, as his quickly rushed ad on her demonstrated. He can't decide whether he wants Kamala Harris to be a far-leftist or a phony leftist.
(Coming up) Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
For Biden?  Reach out and touch someone.  For Harris?  Reach out and incarcerate black people and Kavanaugh, all without evidence.  Not sure how you combine the two.  I guess ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black?‚Äù
You know the Trump team will lose to the Biden one when Trump can't even decide what kind of leftist he wants Kamala Harris to be.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will answer to God for their silence and non action regarding the death of the aborted babies. Knowing God I hate to be in their shoes when it happens. Just the thought causes me to shudder. God help their deceived followers they will receive the same.

I‚Äôm just pointing out that your faith in the polls and what you see online betrays you. Many Patriots are not included or do not respond to these polls, and that is why the mainstream media didn‚Äôt see Hillary‚Äôs landslide loss coming, and the same reason they don‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs.
Lol, it's also misleading because 538 is hedging for what they think it'll be on election day. Right now Biden has a 92% chance to win.
This is accounting for changes post-debates and post-conventions.  The article says if the election were held today, Biden would almost surely win (90+% chance).
Whaat's wrong with this picture?? Biden's choice of Kamaltoe is making it too easy... something's up.
Harris has zero to do with Trump. Democrats want him to fight with her not wimpy limply Biden. Pence will take in Harris just like Tulsi Gabbard.
Harris Skin is as White as Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt think morally trump or Biden should be in office. We haven‚Äôt heard anything in Jorgensen and she‚Äôs honestly and clearly the better candidate with the goals she wants. No one lets her speak it‚Äôs a 2 party system in the media when clearly there is a 3rd party.
Kamala Harris says Joe Biden isn't racist and you are IRRELEVANT.
I am so happy that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Trump didn‚Äôt attend John Lewis‚Äô funeral because Lewis hadn‚Äôt attended his inauguration. Trump is a petulant child.  Biden knew that Kamala Harris had called him out on the debate stage &amp; still decided that she was the best choice for VP. Biden is an an intelligent adult.

At least it's now crystal clear that Kanye's intentions are for one reason only, to take votes away from Joe Biden in an attempt to steal another election for Donald Trump.  What a shameful legacy. And a massive failure.
I don‚Äôt see how any progressive sees a Biden/Harris ticket and gets excited about it. It‚Äôs as establishment as it gets right there.
What about the millions of little girls that will never grow to be women because Biden and Harris and those like them choose to keep murder in the womb legal?  They don‚Äôt get a voice huh.
My bias?  I'm pointing out that the same "problems" Joe Biden has are celebrated proudly when coming from Trump.  Trump has divided us and brought out the worst.  He has got to go.  There is my bias.

In fairness Trump attacked everyone in  the 2016 Republican primaries too, and now most of them either work for or closely with him.  It happens. I‚Äôm not defending Harris or Biden and refuse to vote for them, but primaries aren‚Äôt about inspiration.  They are about mudslinging.
Time to show Trump and his enablers, what America is really about. The racism and hatred that Trump and his campaign are trying to spread about Biden and Harris is not what America is about.
BIDEN is a senior of whom the DEMOCRATS are taking advantage of.  THIS IS ELDER ABUSE!
A continuance of the Obama Biden spirit. First Joy I have felt since the occupation of 2017.
Everyone‚Äôs already thinking Biden will only do a 1 term then hand it over to her for 2024 ü§î I agree Harris will be great even if she wasn‚Äôt my pick
Wow Biden in the 70s for the most part.  And you cry when loncoln project does this to you and their stuff is more recent.  Booohooohoooohooo! Trump is going down as the biggest crybaby in the history of the world. Bidens going to literally ride circles around you.
Vote Joe Biden
Anarchist If I'm locked up and die in jail under Trump/Pence, there will be an outcry  of "tyrannical oppression" If I'm locked up and die in jail under Biden/Harris, it'll be "business as usual" Both reach the same outcome for my life, but one will be dismissed as unimportant.
How funny - two tweets above this you're accusing Biden of racism.   What the fucking fuck, dude???   Are you serious?
You ain't kidding!    Biden's mind is gone and all that is left is a "shell", a body that doesn't speaks much.   Everything he says he's told to say it, reads from a teleprompter just like a child.  Not making fun of him, my mother died of dementia so I know.

During these historic times the Democrats chose an even Older White Man from the Corporate state of Delaware to show that the Dixiecrats haven't forgotten what they truly value? The dementia is real in both Biden and Trump, but we must not be ready for a Castro at the top yet?
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
I agree; I thought that once I got over the elation of Biden choosing Harris.  Should he do that, though, they won't be able to attack Harris for not being black enough.  Both of Nikki‚Äôs parents immigrated from India.
My reply was kind of confusing. It was more to illustrate Ingrahm‚Äôs messed up logic, by us asking ourselves that question. Fox can‚Äôt accept that maybe Biden wanted a woman because we bring a different experience to the table with only helps in governing.
Let‚Äôs face facts here Biden is disgusting. You see pictures of him touching young girls and making them uncomfortable but then say it‚Äôs okay cus he‚Äôs fighting for what? Trump might be an idiot but he‚Äôs not pedophile level creepy. My side LET #JoJorgensen2020 speak!

I keep hearing people complain that voting for Biden/Harris is voting for the lesser of two evils and it‚Äôs like why the fuck is that a problem? Why wouldn‚Äôt you want less evil? Jfc.
Idk I just see Trump out here mispronouncing common words, slurring his speech, and bragging about "passing" cognitive tests almost everyday, so it's odd to me when people focus on Biden's mental decline.

Biden is weak and will hurt God.  Kamala was too tough on crime and is a radical leftist.
Since Kamala Harr is Joe Biden's running mate, let's not forget she tried to deny a transgender inmate healthcare and endangered trans women by forcing them into men's prisons which lead up to the torture and rape of trans inmates.
Since Kamala Harr is Joe Biden's running mate, you should know THIS
being able to discuss kamala‚Äôs flaws AND voting for biden in 2020 thank you
Don‚Äôt forget that Joe Biden himself will be the first man in history to share the robes of leadership with a minority: first as VP with our first AA president, and then as President with our first WOC VP. Pretty special guy.

5/Biden's justice program is worse! Consent decrees to address "systemic police misconduct", Indi Task Force on Prosecutorial Discretion. They will be able to override Cops decisions regarding arrest, when to charge &amp; what to charge! Decriminalize drug use (possession? Amount?)
These particular ads don‚Äôt mention Trump. Because when they say ‚ÄúJoe Biden is weak,‚Äù the last thing they want you to remember is the guy struggling to walk down a ramp. Anyway, it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine anyone who‚Äôs not already a cult member falling for this kind of crap.
The only con is that She is not the presumptive nominee and we are forced to vote for Biden.
She will cost Biden the office
I really like the show HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS.  Thank God or who ever your creator is. Joe Biden did the right thing by picking Kamala Harris. I thought Stacey Abrams but that would of been a mistake. (She's to nice or to sweet) Harris is the hard hitter we need to take Pence out
4/Biden's "research shows" that just one Black teacher in elementary keeps Black kids from dropping out. That's ridiculous! Skin color does not a role model make! This is why these policies don't work--wasting $$$$$ on BS that has nothing to do with learning--HUGE TAX HIKE!

Harris never called Biden racist.  As a matter of fact, she prefaced her criticism of his opposition to busing by saying,  "Now, I KNOW you're not a racist..."  Lying is all the Trump fans have, because they're desperate at this point.
Congratulations and you have my and my wife‚Äôs support.  Biden/Harris
A political stroke of genius by Biden. Qualified, competent and a real threat to Republicans. I will enjoy when she tears Pence to pieces during the debate.
3/In 2019, New York spent $23,091 per pupil on public education. If they can't give a child a quality education on that then the problem is not money. These teachers don't need any more money! Biden want $23 Billion to "eliminate funding gap", "improve teacher diversity"!

2/Biden/Harris' policies will gut School Choice while pouring more money into a P.S. system that failed decades ago.Stacks the system with psychologists, guidance counselors, social workers, nurses--basically turns P.S.'s into mental health care clinics.Unacceptable.Unaffordable.
The Obama/Biden administration gave us DACA. Not a perfect policy but it helped the undocumented community.
As much as she is Biden‚Äôs VP Pick
Yeah, Biden chose a fucking cop as his VP. It‚Äôs almost as if the Democratic Party still refuses to listen to any of the people that would support them and instead pulls their own centrist bull shit over ans over.
Not even hiding the fact that Biden will step down. Kamala will be pur next president if the Left wins. #TuckandRoll
I‚Äôm sorry but you seriously sound like you are trying to convince yourself of this pick more than your followers. This is a punch in the face for progressives everywhere. I will never vote for Biden/Harris just the same as I won‚Äôt vote for Trump! #GreenParty #RankedChoiceVoting
If you want Trump out of office you must vote for Biden and Harris. Not voting is a vote for Donald Trump
Why is it that you Trump minions don't have any idea to get the country out of the mess you got us into. The only thing you can talk about is useless labels and slogans. Democrats and Biden have a plan to make this country great again and help the middle class, you betrayed.

IMO biden having to bow out of the 2020 race seems more of a reality today than ever before. Timing is behind everything especially with the DNC.

I dont care who Biden picks for his VP. I would vote for a broken PS2 if it ran against Trump.
If Trump was racist like Biden, there would be no end of the coverage of it. Biden still lets the phrases slip that prove he's racist and gets a pass from the entire movement that's been calling US racists for 3 years.
I have very little confidence that Biden will win. But the only thing im hanging on to is that the MAGA heads I talk to also feel like trump is guna lose. So I guess both parties think there party is guna lose? And that's what keeps me going at this point? lol idfk

So when Biden goes to the pasture does Nancy Pelosi take over as President or Vice President?
(W) NEW: Former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Trump by 11 percentage points, according to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist Poll I hope this is true and holds up. Trump is doing everything he can to cheat his way into another term.

Joe loved Beau and was a real father. ‚ù§Unlike  He was Never a dad to  and  That is why they are so jealous of biden and Obama.
Kamala is a strong leader, a daughter of immigrants, and has a passion for justice. Like us, she is a happy warrior in the battle for the soul of America. We will spend every minute of the next 85 days making sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris replace Trump  Pence
Agree,  Can and should however point out her Leftist Senate Voting r√©cord and the Biden/Harris  Leftist Agenda!
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!
You call this ‚Äúleadership‚Äù??!! In my world this government overreach or #communism. No thank you. Not in my country üá∫üá∏
Who is 'they'? Are you talking about democrats? Biden, Harris?  You are fearmongering, which can be argued is not Christian - especially when there are no facts to support it.
Biden isn't the one playing politics. You are. Case and point. You went to
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.
It makes sense Kamala was chosen by Biden. Her family owned slaves and Biden is quoted as saying "I'll be damned if I will pay reparations for the sins of my father and grandfather ". Google it. And then watch the deflecting.
They've also killed more ppl than Obama/Biden. 160,000+ and growing. That's just the pandemic, doesn't include mass shootings and bountied soldiers. Also more lies than anyone in any admin. More corruption than admin.
If ever there was a reason to INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE this is it - Judge Jeanine Makes Ominous Biden Prediction   Why did she say that? Does she know something? Is she psychic or psycho?

Guess she doesn't know  The Kennedys. Biden Pelosi are/were all Catholics? Not to mention the Pope? None of them would be fit to be judges? Did she notice that the pastors of her Baptist faith are among the RICHEST people in the WORLD? Priests take the vow of Poverty?
He and   would be fast friends seeing as how they both have that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anything...‚Äù alibi going on. #ChildMolestor
I agree!! Why did they have that #sourpuss  on after Biden/Harris speech. I changed it quick to #CNN He brought my excitement to the ground when he spoked .. ugh!!  needs to get his butt out!!

He punishes America every day...unfortunlty I am sure he will continue out of his petty little self. Such a small man on many levels He's already Petulant &amp; has disappointed People by his do nothing attitude during this #Pandemic. #Trumpvirus
I am convinced that everything is concerning the  team because America has enough of the #ConMan and his cronies trying to sabotage the American Dream to benefit their rich friends. üá∫üá∏Biden/Harris
Joe Biden picked such an excellent VP in Kamala Harris.  She is a super strong speaker and never backs down from any fight on the horizon.  Kamala Harris also has her facts at hand and whips out her responses so fast that she makes your head spin.

Joe Biden should debate Diaper Donnie only if the Diaper releases his tax returns for the last 20 years first.
Time to show Trump and his enablers, what America is really about. The racism and hatred that Trump and his campaign are trying to spread about Biden and Harris is not what America is about.
I BELIVE HE IS RIGHT! AND I BET CHINA TRY'S VERY HARD TO GET BIDEN ELECTED! AND I BELIVE CHINA DILIBERITLY CREATED AND SPREAD THE VIROUS TO DISTROY OUR ECONMY TO DEFEAT TRUMP.HE WAS KICKING THEIR ASSES AND HE WILL CONTINUE IF RE-ELECTED. AND THEY KNOW IT.

Senator Harris and VP Biden, make me hopeful for our democracy, our civil rights, equal justice for all and the  rule of law. Her soul and Biden‚Äôs are in stark contrast to Trump‚Äôs lack of everything, empty suit~stupid tie~
Kamala Harris now kneels down to the racist Biden. After years of fighting RACISM, she now accepts it
Biden saved big bucks using payroll tax loophole
Sleepy Joe Biden.
or that he knows better than the CDC, Fauci, or any scientists at all, for that matter. No, Biden will be a team player rather than a crazy, and I mean crazy, autocrat.
He also has Obama, a much respected and admired past president as his mentor, advisor, and supporter. He is surrounding himself with good people because, evidently, he doesn't think he is the chosen one, he alone can fix it, that he is a stable genius,
KAMALA HARRIS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF BIDEN WINS. SHE WILL BE THE ONE WITH THE CODES. BIDEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ZIP CODE HE LIVES IN. KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENT. LET THAT SINK IN
For democrats, This purity test needs to be stopped . No candidate will satisfy everyone. Biden,&amp; Harris are millions times better thanTrump and his swamp.If you can‚Äôt see that ( many of them show themselves in the comments here. You are helping to re-elect Trump for another 4yrs
was for her before he was against her.Trump has become irrelevant.  He is nasty, mean, insulting and low class. He is going down on November 3, and he knows it.  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!üíô

I was not happy with the way she torpedoed VP Biden during the debates but she's tough and if she is his choice I will support this ticket 500% to get this country away from this constant hatespeak and delusions perpetrated by the current administration.
Kamala Harris is born on Oct. 20th, and Joe Biden was born on Nov. 20th. That is definitely 2020. If I am Pence, I‚Äôll be afraid, very afraid !!!  Let‚Äôs debate !!!She has a mouthpiece.
Bring it on   No body give a damn. I will still vote for Biden. Who would believe a attorney whose former clients were Russian Oligarchs...No one fucking believes #barr anymodu. #LyingDogs
He just wants to get back into vote for Biden then he wont have to Sneak anymore! And he can have a lot of his buddies come here to help him with his hobby. THATS WHAT DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND VOTING DEMONCRAT WILL GET FOR YOU.
More breaking news today.   Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.  #Election2020
Lmao run away you coward...not surprised you are unable to back up your claims, about as much I can expect from a Biden fan
Sure they have. And trump is going to have our government buy millions of doses and foist them on us just before the election and claim credit to get reelected. My October surprise will be I'll already have voted for Biden.
Either way it's going to be an issue, but most importantly Biden has to take into consideration the "Electorial" snowflakes who will have a problem with a woman!
Idiots ..Biden is not the president ..Your moron is and he has not done nothing for this #TrumpVirus he has  leadership on this Pandemic. BIDEN IS DOING MUCH MORE OrangeMan is playing golf most of the time.

Bike like Biden.

Biden owns his home. Trump doesn't have or own a home. He just has seedy hotels, golf props infested with bedbugs   How much does he owe China, Russia, Deutsche Bank?   The WH is not his. Going to take years to get that vile trump stink and stain out of our house.

Very powerful visual. Looks like something The Lincoln Project would do. Biden's campaign is catching on to what captures the truth about the Trump administration, and they're running with it. Keep going!
To hurt Biden‚Äôs chances. Oooopsie. I can send you the link to article if you wish.
In an interview with Forbes yesterday he was asked if he was chosen to run against Biden to hurt Trump‚Äôs chances. He said he was ‚Äúwalking FOR the president‚Äù.
TRUMPSHIT! UNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND MORE SMOKE AND MIRRORS!
COME LETS GIVE EQUAL TIME TO BIDEN? ESPECIALLY SINCE HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME TALKING?
On day one Biden should sign an executive order that cancels each and every one of Trump's EOs and list them so that it's clear they are canceled. "The following EOs are hereby declared null and void...."
China is Communist we have fought them in Cuba, N .Korea, Vietnam THEY ARE OUR ENEMY! They KNOWINGLY released a Virus on the world, Costing TRILLIONS in DESTROYED Economies and Killed over 1 million people WITHOUT FIRING a SHOT. You want Biden to STAND UP TO THEM?
She's has a Doctorate in education  She and Joe have been married since 1977. She loves God, her family &amp; country!  She is Dr. Jill Biden.Oh, she wasn‚Äôt in any naked pictures? Whew, that‚Äôs a relief. Hopefully, we can sweep out the trash out of WH real soon.

I wonder if  depression deepens today when Trump bails out the country? Is she still trying to process Biden calling integration a "racial jungle" and advocating on behalf of his constituents to keep Delaware schools segregated? Come on Man, that would depress me!
Thinking Harris just because she's limiting her public appearances now until her surgery heals (last TV appearance was a disaster and way too early) but has tweeted multiple pro Biden messages like something from a VP campaign.
How did Biden's turn out the other day. Come on man, do blacks really have no diversity? I'm pretty sure that won't go over well in my family.
I think Kamala Harris will not go over well with older Biden supporters. Too independent to be a teammate to Biden. I think Rice would be a better choice due to her ties to European leaders, her knowledge of Foreign Policy and the fact she worked closely with  Biden for years.
Biden isn't going to take guns away. He can't. Stop listening to Trump's b.s., turn off Fox news, and read the Constitution.  The GOP is taking things away: mail-in ballots, Social Security, Medicaid/Medicare, Health care, raising taxes on middle/low income earners...
If anyone is going to Jail it‚Äôs Biden for spying on Trump, Biden for Ukraine scandal with his son .... Obama for spearheading the most corrupt sting in American history ..... Muller came up empty ... fact ..... high officials confirm that under oath .... sit down Holly
How about moving the election up so we can be done with him.  is a threat to our lives!!
HUFFPOST How GD Obvious can you GET! Biden cant Finish a Sentence, Cant Pronounce any words, Makes up his Own words AND YOU DONT WRITE PIECES ABOUT HIS ETERNAL SKREW UPS? WHY IS THAT? YOU MAKE ME SICK YOUR SO IN THE BAG FOR DEMONRATS.
If  loses and is indicted after leaving office, he apparently shouldn't call Joe Biden looking for a favor. Biden's new comments probably weren't what Trump wanted to hear.
Joe Biden carries the Rosary in his pocket everywhere he goes!
The only way I‚Äôll vote for Biden is if he picks Kamala
Just listen, please... I just listened to trump speech. All he did was feed fear, and dis Biden. He hasn't told you what he CAN do for you, at all! He promises and doesn't follow through. Doesn't that make you think about your choices? you can do better!
stated she is depressed because Trump has racially divided this country. How was her depression when Biden stated blacks don't have any diversity, unlike Latinos. Or, maybe, how she feels about Biden stating in the 70's that integration would cause a racial jungle.
You just lost the Latino vote with that incredibly stupid misinterpretation of Biden's words. Considering you have a vocabulary the size of a typical seven year old, I wouldn't be putting Biden's speech or intelligence down if I were you.
And WHY would the HUFFPOST PROPOGANDA MACHENE DISAGREE WITH THAT? HOW IS THAT AN UNREASOANBLE DEMAND? Is it BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS Biden  has Dementia and cannot even say a complete sentence without a teleprompter?
Everything about Biden bothers me!
THEY have an ACE up THIER sleeve, THEY know Biden cant debate Trump. THEY know BIDEN has DIMENTIA they have a PLAN IN PLACE. THEY ARE INSANE BUT NOT STUPID! We better be ready to FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY!
Yes, show America how Biden really isn't capable of being in office anymore, not even dog catcher.I think Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP choice pushed independents and Libertarians away from the Biden Camp

This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)

You don‚Äôt have to like him, but Trump has done a damn good job. Whether you like them or not, Biden and Harris both have terrible track records in office. And, they want to take the US in the opposite direction that had us flourishing as a country. No thanks.
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Despite the drama-evoking click-baity title of this article, it is a wonderful read, delving into the political intelligence differences between Biden and Obama. I see a generational thing going on, but the strengths Biden brings to politics shouldn‚Äôt  be overlooked.
Regardless of what Biden says, President Trump is doing the better than any other country with COVID19.
Hmmmm, so you recently saw the light after 40 years in public service? Oh, would the person handling this account for Mr. Biden please ask the question, as he does not know how to tweet, just saying.
Silly Hilly, If we wanted to fix it, we wouldn't be accepting Biden.
That was Biden.
The Biden/Obama administration also caged children, murdered civilians, and fucked over the working class just as hard.
Well everyone you should asked Biden and Harris since they raised 50 million dollars in two days  maybe they should give everyone 1200 dollars or as much as they can until the Democrats come back from there break.
Oh I fully understand. And I have absolutely ZERO hope that a Biden/Harris administration will be even an iota better for the working class.

If Biden was a stronger candidate he‚Äôd already be pushing trump to issue masks to citizens, but instead he puts out an ad about how he will do that immediately come next late January. Sweeeeet.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

Trump doesn't want mail in ballot because it can be rigged.  By the by . Who wants a feeble like Biden in office who can't make a quick wise decision in office anyway. Trump didn't become successful having Alzheimers.

So he's saying Biden-Harris will lose? Sounds good to me.
I find Joe Biden voters more repulsive than Trumpers. By a land slide! The difference is one can say and get away w/ more than the other! I view a vote for Biden as a vote for mainstream socialism and government expansion.
we can vote trump out while holding biden/kamala accountable for their atrocious careers
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.

My FB friends seem to understand that electing Biden doesn't fix anything (other than the issue of Trump of course) and know we will have to keep up the pressure, even increase it, IF he is elected...but seeing far too many who think he is the solution.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

The left never forgives us for our past actions. So here? "My gut reaction," Joe Biden reportedly declared in 1973, "is that they [homosexuals] are security risks [in the federal govt], but I must admit I haven't given this much thought‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be darned!‚Äô‚Äù
On the other hand, if they DO think Biden is middle-class, we‚Äôve officially solved the question of why conservatives think middle-class families should be fine financially.
Trump ad on TV: ‚ÄúJoe Biden says, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre gonna pay more in taxes.‚Äô That means more taxes for the middle class...‚Äù Do... do Republicans think Joe Biden is middle class? (Also, lol that Republicans ‚Äî let alone Trump ‚Äî care about the middle class.)
Not any blue will do  even Biden's VP has done so much damage to so many communities. But yeah, sure back up what you say not what you do, right????

I still believe anyone kicked out of the military for drugs before and at the same thing as Hunter Biden, should get the same discharge he got.  If not then Hunter Biden should have his discharge changed to an OTH.  They didn‚Äôt for political reasons and clearance reasons

One more reason (as if you needed one more) not to vote for Biden.
Of all the groups to remain on the sidelines during this election cycle... vote how you like, but when half the country thinks mail in ballots could be tampered with...  Postal Workers‚Äô Union Endorses Joe Biden for President
Clearly, one can be both gay and an idiot voting against his interests. Every vote not tallied for Biden is a vote for Trump and Mike Pence. If you can‚Äôt see the difference between those men I can‚Äôt help you.
Biden should appoint Warren "Empress of Fixing Shit."
Remember what #KanyeWest is going to be used for. In addition to trying to siphon black votes away from Biden, it may be that voting machines that are hacked push DEM votes to Kanye (instead of Trump) with the same effect, but without leaving trumps obvious fingerprints on it.
So why on earth would you back up &amp; endorse Joseph Biden???
Arizona‚Äôs superintendent of public instruction Kathy Hoffman formally endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, arguing their administration would better serve Arizona public schools.
Hilarious anti Biden ad: "11 million illegal aliens competing for American jobs" and the video is farm workers. Oh so many Americans are horrified that they can't get a job working in the fields. LOL the incompetence of  and his minions. Can't even racist right.
Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù
And once again, if you are a "blue no matter who" type liberal, you could help your own cause by actually admitting that our choices are shitty, and pledging your support and participation in direct action even IF Biden wins in November. Too many seem to think he is the solution.
Wait a tic. I hate Kanye as much as the next person but doesn‚Äôt this mean that he ISN‚ÄôT playing Biden spoiler since he is now running against Trump?
Vote for Biden.  Seriously, tRUmp will only get much worse if he is left in office.
So, Biden is no longer "Sleepy Joe" but is now "Slow Joe".  What is most interesting and will remain with you throughout history...FOREVER...is the fact that you are Impeached Trump.
i wonder if joe biden is going to campaign in the whatthefuckican and whatthefuckicratic counties of ohio
3) ironically tankies declaring Biden ‚Äúthe Maoist‚Äôs choice‚Äù does far more to validate Trump‚Äôs attacks than anyone bring up Tara Reid every could, straight up Trump‚Äôs strategy this time around is literally just tie Biden/Harris to tankies &amp; antifa
Yes, glad I switched to Democrat to support Bernie. Party‚Äôs are way over-rated. It‚Äôs people that matter, Hope Republicans get that, looks like many are jumping ship to support Biden. I welcome them!
Can you explain why our initial purpose was to #FlattenTheCurve? I think we're in week 25? And fuck you if you're doing this  bc it helps Joe Biden get elected.
He's gotta be careful on this one. Plus he's not running against her, he's running against Biden. So my take no nick name for Flip Flop Kamala.
I am sure these characters are going to circle file Republican votes!
If this is what real leadership looks like then real leadership is dead. Biden looks like he's dead and no one told him.
Biden likes to smell women's hair and he has tiny blonde hairs on his legs?
HA--love how the Russia thing is still relevant to you losers.   Biden is literally being investigated by the Ukrainian govt. for extortion and bribery.
Biden / Harris will milk America dry supporting radical agendas.  Say goodbye to growing 401k's, IRA's, small businesses, entrepreneurs, American companies, farmers, etc.
You‚Äôre going to lose to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris . How is your misogynistic racist self going to handle that defeat? Maybe you should just quit now.
Uh, no. It was the China virus that did the damage. And if Biden had had his way, there wouldn't have been a ban on flights from China and things could have been so much worse. But arm chair quartbacking is so much easier...
It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.
Never wanted to be active on Twitter until now... Biden/Harris 2020üá∫üá∏
Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
And now....more lies and conspiracy theories out of the trump camp about our VP. He is an endless liar. We have to have Kamala's back.  Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
No we don't think Joe Biden is bad &amp; Kamala Harris is a strong, bad ass woman. They are a terrific team who will clean up Trump's mess. The GOP is going down &amp; it's a beautiful thing to watch #DumpTrump2020  #WorstPresidentEver
Wrong. The Dems are the ones putting the election on hold - they want ballots to be counted even if they arrive a week after election day. What's the point of election day then?  The left always accuses conservatives of what they themselves are doing BTW China &amp; Russia want Biden
Come on fellow citizens of the great state of Arizona. Vote what is best for our country.  #Biden2020  'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
On a scale from 1 to glue fiend... how deeply will Biden sniff?
In other words you can‚Äôt name a single Biden policy. If I was in your shoes I would have at least googled his platform and cut and paste something in the hope of changing someone‚Äôs mind. But of course when Sanders was running I and all of his supporters could recite his platform.
I‚Äôm 20 year old daughter who was a Bernie supporter and volunteer has informed me she will either be voting 3rd party or not at all. She doesn‚Äôt like Trump, but she doesn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris any betterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Joe Biden could walk on stage at a debate, drunk as fuck, slurring his words in a track suit and sandals promising to raise my taxes and I would STILL, without doubt, in a heartbeat, wait outside 8 hours during a pandemic to vote for him #VoteBlue

I honestly liked his take that Marx and Lenin would be Bernie staffers endorsing Biden  I would pay to see that happen

The USPS will be fully restored when Biden takes office.  If we get the Senate we can repeal that despicable law that made them have to fund their health care for 50 years and froze their ability to raise rates.
I'm sure if we bully Biden enough we can get that number down to 4,999!
Am I lost? People have continuously brought up Joe Biden being a pedophile in an attempt to justify why Trump is the better choice... but Trump associated himself with Epstein &amp; wished Ghislaine well soooooo????

Its really easy man! Biden means ending tRump! If you vote any other way or dont for Biden thats a vote to keep the Orange Moron! Like Biden or not we have another election in 4 yrs where u can not vote for him then, but for now u MUST vote Biden or we keep tRump! IT'S THAT EASY

There are two main Establishment factions in the Democratic Party: Obama/Biden centrists and Clinton/Harris woke hipster liberals. The Harris pick was a concession by the former to the latter. That‚Äôs all.
Uhhh... Joe Biden is the one who claimed he would defund social security. We need to replace SS with an individual investment account that is tied to a hedge fund that gov isn‚Äôt allowed to steal money from unlike SS. IIA‚Äôs are the only way to go. Everyone would retire with $1m+
Voting for Biden/Harris is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Trump may be flawed, but the country has been great up until Covid. I have confidence that the country will continue to excel under Trump, but I'm scared of what life might be like under the other guys.
I feel like a racist jackass assuming just because of the last name jumping to that conclusion. But at least I didn‚Äôt pull a Biden and ask if either of them ran a 7-11.

And Biden has repeatedly said sen Kkk byrd was his mentor. My how history is a bitch for dems, so is truth it seems.  Harris said that so many unemployed is due to trump. Did she forget the virus?
You gave the Trump experiment a shot, probably because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a politician‚Äù, the experiment obviously failed. At least the Obama/Biden administration brought the economy back from the brink in ‚Äò08 &amp; handled the H1N1 virus without 100‚Äôs thousands of deaths. VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS!

I think Bernie only dropped out because COVID meant he couldn't actually campaign. So I think he gets a few more votes and delegates. But I think the majority still coalesces around Biden and Biden starts acting like the nominee in March either way.

If I were working for team Biden at this point I would start buying as many N95 masks as possible to donate to supporters who will have to stand in long lines on election day.  Request the day off now, and wear a mask, it's the only way to save the Republic and democracy.
Joe Biden will raise your taxes. Joe Biden will take your healthcare. Joe Biden will take away oil and gas. Joe Biden will let Kamala ruin America faster than he would.
Biden is center to center-right. The ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù in the party are just corporatists, imperialists and standard banners of the same status-quo shit that gave us Trump.
Force biden to stop sniffing and touching kids!!!! Lol
We need to see these numbers if Biden/Harris lose. I bet it will become a 3 way race between Cuomo, Buttigieg, and Yang. But of the top 5 listed here, Yang is the only one whose stock rises from the Dem voters to General voters. The others falter, which is a hugely good sign.

All you do is complain about meaningful change. Well, here‚Äôs a piece of information that it actually RELEVANT instead of senseless whining: you won‚Äôt get anything done if you don‚Äôt elect Biden. If you want change, vote, or you‚Äôll never see that change happen.
I wonder if this may hv factored in VP Bidens choice of Harris over longtime colleague Susan Rice. This is intriguing. Wonder how involved Pres Obama was. Could VP Biden's lack of awareness save him from being Implicated? (May hv been unwitting, and sleeping thru briefings).
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
If Biden wins the 2024 election will be between Harris and Tom Cotton or Trey Gowdy. We'll just continue a slow slide to fascism. People like the frog in the boiling water will acclimate &amp; aqueous. NO THANKS! I'm done w/ the Democrats and 'slightly better' than GOP. BURN IT DOWN!
A Picture Worth 1000 Words! Do You See It!? Here‚Äôs What Joe Biden Is¬†Hiding!
Thank God the GOP is finally taking some action on some of the items the House approved THREE MONTHS ago.  The do nothing Senate and WH waited to see how many 10‚Äôs of thousands would die first. Can‚Äôt wait for the payment so I can send it to Biden and Mark Kelly to save the US!
Let's not forget that with Biden we get a wife who's got a PhD. And Harris is married to a successful attorney!
Sucks we can‚Äôt vote for anyone beside Trump or Biden. Either way you look at it it‚Äôs a lose lose situation
You believe the two party system IS viable?  History has proven the 2 party system is corrupt and useless (unless you're an oligarch). I'm 61 years old, been voting since '76'. EVERY 4 Years is more of a debacle than the previous 4.  Biden makes Nixon look like a flaming liberal.
Here we go folks...1st words from Biden contain control words! Mandate masks is just the beginning. Socialism already raising its ugly head...
When will the lies and corruption stop?! Oh, yes, January 20th when Biden moves in and Trump is dumped!
üåπ: we must destroy this system!  Also üåπ: we must vote for Joe Biden to preserve the system a little longer and tear it down slowly and less painful  Bitch WHAT?!
This is a panic tactic born of Democrat weaknesses.  Mentally deficiant Biden can't articulate and Kamala is running from her past record.  The more Biden/Kamala hides from Press questions the more they signal fear and the worse it becomes for them.
No bc I do think Biden should be in the White House.
If you don‚Äôt want another 4 yrs of Trump, vote for Biden. Not voting at all, is not a solution.
Biden leads in all of the latest polls.. the only way Trump can win is if he cheats, which is exactly what he is trying to do by means of disrupting the USPS and of course foreign interference, among other ways.
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

The media complaining about Trump not responding to questions while Biden has staffers throwing themselves in front of reporters to block questions directed at Biden.
I'm not surprised. To vote for the Biden-Harris ticket is to cut off your nose to spite your face.  You may not like everything about Trump, but American has been pretty great under his presidency (up until the rona, and that wasn't his fault).
Biden and the new Democratic Congress must work on protecting our democracy from future presidents like Trump through safeguard legislation.
No thanks. They‚Äôve told us that every election. Once these people are in office they care even *less* about us while most Dems believe whatever ‚Äútheir‚Äù president does is right/the best that they could do.  We need those people in the fight, but I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd fight biden.
FYI-the Repubs, Ron Johnson and some other low-lifes are doing "investigating" again to smear Obama and the Bidens.  Get tough Team Biden/Harris. trump is corrupt to the very core. How dare they continually bring up Obama or the Bidens. We don't back down. #BidenHarris2020
This guy üëáRon Johnson continues to bring up Obama era conspiracy theories and threaten the Biden family.  HYPOCRITE! Why doesn't he investigate the ORANGE criminal president??? There's some dirt for him. Someone buy a copy of Michael Cohen's book for him
Joe Biden says it‚Äôs his responsibility to take care of Americans. Unless it‚Äôs two weeks before his election. We had Americans in Benghazi and they were ignored and murdered.
Vote for Biden.
If he wins, the US will be gone forever! Biden and Harris have so much work to do!!
This is why  needs an election night mandate.  340+ electoral votes, so even if they challenge NC NV etc Biden still wins without them.
wonder how much of a civil war lying about  Obama and Biden can start?  Who will be safe besides those of u who work for Putin and his lap dog Trump?
I just hope the media covers these the way they covered one accusation against Biden. Sure. Trump's supporters clearly don't care. But no one should forget!
Joe Biden has so far skated. He hasn't had any tough questions, and has just hid in his basement while voters assume whatever they want about him (and the media covers for him.)  Once people actually see Biden, his numbers go down.

Why do you not want to vote for Biden/Harris ticket? Trump is a rude, uncouth, racist, liar. He cares for no one, probably not even his own family. Is the bottom line your only criteria in choosing a President. Is taxes all you care about. What about your self respect/self worth

After watching hours of News, researching and seeing pictures of innocent people being hurt, murdered and our cities destroyed, it comes down to this.  DO YOU WANT LAW AND ORDER? THEN VOTE TRUMP! Do you want t I've in FEAR, CHAOS, BLM/ANTIFA &amp; DESTROYING OF AMERICA?  Vote Biden!
The people that are going to vote for Trump, are going to do it.  The people that aren't, are going to vote for Biden, or stay at home.  Period.  People's minds are made up.  Now it is about ground game and getting people's asses to the polls, or getting their ballots in the mail
I've bought the Woodword book, the Wilson book, and the Anonymous book - but I couldn't stomach reading any of them. If Biden wins, I'll take another crack at them

Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.

I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states
"Under Prime Minister Biden, the buck will never stop anywhere.  "This is the point. Democrats didn't pick Mr. Biden because he's moderate, they picked him because he's weak. Voters need to understand the implications as they make their choice."
not defending the other dude at all bc he‚Äôs also a white supremacist.. but i hate to break it to you.. joe biden is also not going to do any good unless u are white...the alternative would be to not play into the two party system by voting 3rd party or simply become ungovernable
Most Democrats are not 'leftist' they're center/right. FFS Kasich is speaking at the conv!! I give them very valid reasons for not voting for Biden, they admit what I say and respond with "Then you're voting for Trump".  They admit Biden's shit but won't consider voting Green.

I normally agree with u Paul, but I think here we should've given our gov't benefit of the doubt. I knew something was up when Biden's campaign also booted Tiktok. Now there's this:
doctors office and hospital are low in patients. This is a scam and I believe it. It‚Äôs all political because Democrats candidates are low and cannot debate with Trump and they don‚Äôt have any platform. Joe Biden copy‚Äôs  accomplishment.
this. Heck, he was honored by the NAACP several times in NYC for his work with blacks. I support Trump because supporting Biden is against the Faith. Only one is actually not a racist, not a sexist, not an abuser, not a sexual harasser, not a corporate whore, not an abortionist,
not many ppl are saying you have to. some of them just want to have a discussion on this. they want to persuade others to vote for biden as well, which is no different from any other debating. but yes there are some who are vote shaming, though they are still leftist
shut the fuck up. my shit is going to be stripped regardless bc i‚Äôm QUEER AND BLACK &amp; joe biden is a white supremacist. you not acknowledging that is part of the problem, not me.
He has nothing to lose. If he wins reelection it just gets worse. If he loses, he'll step down a month before inauguration so Pence can pardon him.   There is literally nothing to stop him from openly committing crimes. If Biden wins, I hope NY state throws the book at him.
Notice the child gravitates towards Trump. Ever watch a video with Biden and kids. Never see any of them feel comfortable approaching him. They all squirm to get away from his groping and sniffing.
Babies however are getting wise now to Biden and have learned how to duck, bobb and weave as Creepy Joe moves in for the kill.
Sounds like Biden is racist by those accounts
When he opened his mouth as Obama‚Äôs VP he pushes things forward on gay marriage. So no we didn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut. You don‚Äôt know what Biden‚Äôs policy or record are. Obviously.

A thousand Biden flubs and you're making fun of one of the times he was actually correct?
Biden is a fascist.
Trump is saying a lot of really, not so good things, the likes of which people have never seen.  But, we‚Äôre going to replace him with Joe Biden, which many people are saying, will do very good things.
No. Literally the White House is the most important take. He isn‚Äôt listening to Congress nor the Supreje Court. Campaign for Biden. If we take the White House and lose the house and they keep the senate, we will be OK. But we‚Äôre not going to lose the house.
That's why dems and Biden are hiding in basement and eant shutdowns while conservatives want to work and make country better hmm which one seems scared. Hmm tough one I'm sure.
This tells me that Biden‚Äôs depth of support is fairly weak, meaning we could very easily see another 2016 scenario
‚ÄúEr- actually this is actually a 4 point shift for joe in 4 months &amp; 13 days‚Äù  MF‚Äôer just admit you‚Äôre in the bag for joe, few things are more annoying than   twisting reality in order to argue Biden‚Äôs consistently gaining ground
Biden and Harris give me hope.  Thanks for the walk and talks.  Love them.
That's not enough to get my vote for one sexist and racist over a more sexist racist person. It's great you and A D have healthcare and an education, but what how about all the poor people that Biden and Harris  will ignore after being elected? I can't support that.
Are you talking about Biden politicizing his sons death for sympathy?

I don‚Äôt think they stop even if Biden wins. They want chaos and revelation. Just electing a Dem isn‚Äôt enough for them.
I was definetly a critic of hers.  I did prefer Whitmer or Rice.  But on another level I get why he picked her.  And her beauty and dynamite smile and relatability r good for the welcoming optics of a Biden campaign.  And shes been very disciplined and a pro the first 2 days.

If you think Biden is even remotely like Trump you should really do some research. Your mindset is why Trump is in office now. It's unfortunate and unrealistic for you to think things can't get worse cause believe me they can.

You‚Äôre going to lose to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris . How is your misogynistic racist self going to handle that defeat? Maybe you should just quit now.
And now....more lies and conspiracy theories out of the trump camp about our VP. He is an endless liar. We have to have Kamala's back.  Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris

Biden sold us, America, out in so many ways to foreign powers. He clearly doesn‚Äôt put America first which is why Trump will win in November.
I honestly liked his take that Marx and Lenin would be Bernie staffers endorsing Biden  I would pay to see that happen
You can replace ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù with ‚ÄúObama‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and your narrative remains true.
Biden cozied up to our enemies? Maybe it was to assault them, as is the republican narrative completely forgetting their rapist-in-chief? Or was it how Biden calls Putin privately while tacitly OK-img the pay-for-murder of American soldiers? Oh wait, that was your guy too.

Fuckin SAME  but for now it's just biden harris :/
Vote for Biden by all means! Honestly he can‚Äôt wreak the amount of havoc America that Trump has (and will do even more if he‚Äôs re-elected.
Uhhh... Joe Biden is the one who claimed he would defund social security. We need to replace SS with an individual investment account that is tied to a hedge fund that gov isn‚Äôt allowed to steal money from unlike SS. IIA‚Äôs are the only way to go. Everyone would retire with $1m+
I feel like a racist jackass assuming just because of the last name jumping to that conclusion. But at least I didn‚Äôt pull a Biden and ask if either of them ran a 7-11.
let‚Äôs entertain this hypothetical for a moment  in this case, assuming the 6,000 comes from Trump, Biden signifies a 1,000 person net gain in # of lives saved (unironically good)  of course, the hypothetical is a hypothetical. in a non-hypothetical sense, there‚Äôs no other choice.
This is the first decent Biden tweet ive seen.  Too bad he didn't come up with it
The Chinese and Gov Cuomo are responsible for the deaths. Maybe you need to go back and look at the timeline, what the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were saying, Biden calling Trump xenophobic for closing down boarder and Pelosi encouraging everyone to come to Chinatown to celebrate w/o a mask.
Vote for biden!!!!
Biden and Harris better light some sage up in there before they move in
Aside from not being the one who would take office? A vote for Biden is really a vote for Harris at this point. If that motivates you.
Lmao Biden spent his whole career doing nothing for the left and now he‚Äôs the democratic nominee and supported by every major progressive leader. Let‚Äôs start a new party now!
How is our country gone forever if Biden wins??? We did just fine when he was VP

" ain‚Äôt right" because Joe Biden didn't pick Stacey Abrams as his VP running mate? So stupid &amp; divisive.  1) Was Abrams promised the VP position? 2) You, I assume, know the harm caused by racism, yet YOU are being a racist by rejecting Kamala as a Black woman. #nuts

But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£

would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team

i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

Marxism at its worst. Biden is a puppet but a dangerous puppet. He has sold his soul to Satan.
I‚Äôm not saying ¬´don‚Äôt vote for Biden¬ª I‚Äôm saying that the Ds are sick assholes who are saying ¬´fuck you if you want #MedicareForAll or someone who isn‚Äôt horrible, if you don‚Äôt want trump you‚Äôll vote for Biden !!!¬ª like they‚Äôre damned terrorists.
i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention
I've been going through all the bad people in the OT Bible casting them w/ Dems... Some are easy Jezebel - HRC. Ahab is of course WJC. Haman is BHO. Working on Nanshy, Schumer, &amp; Biden. Kamala plays Potiphar's wife. Satan - Soros. Job - General Flynn...

People will suffer regardless of who is in office. Biden is rejecting a true need for healthcare reform as people die or lose their homes due to the cost/69% support. Biden supports our wars overseas where the last admin he was in had a 90% civilian casualty rate. No moral ground
that makes no sense wtf. i'm voting for biden because i don't want the literal white supremacist in the white house. is that hard to understand?
BS. My wife and I are older folk and we support Trump. Most of our friends feel the same way, too. You wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to lie unless you were already worried Biden will lose the election.
Biden issues a mandate for everyone to wear masks outside!  What exactly is he in charge of to issue said mandate? #Trump2020
My state is a swing state, but even then I would encourage people who believe in their convictions to vote how they feel. I'm voting Biden but it's definitely the cowards way out for those who want real change, but I can only live my life and do best by the people I love.
Bit by the Biden Ants
Its 112 and higher next week in Arizona.  I will not wear my mask outside. Way to hot for that. Biden can get lost.
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Biden and Harris want a nationwide mask mandate
Sorry, you can‚Äôt convince me most Vets would prefer Marxism/Socilalism over voting for Trump. That‚Äôs BS. He has at least tried to change the terrible conditions at VA hospitals and how Veterans are treated. Remind me again what branch of service Biden and Harris served in?
Biden isn't our president,  so he can shove it. Not wearing my mask outside!

Hey if Al Gore invented the internet, I'm sure Biden/Obama were in some part responsible for the US landing on the moon.
sure but i just dont see how this is an argument against voting for biden. like yeah a lot of things have lead to trump, but am i supposed to say "well guess i should go with the flow of history"?
They're probably gonna give it to Biden
So all that to say you are part of the 1% that voted for Joe Biden in his previous 2 attempts to run for president or the 2% that voted for Kamala Harris for President in the primaries? Which is it?

You mean the virus will magically go away under Biden? Hmm? Maybe it was the intended goal of the corrupt Marxist Democrats from the start? Handcuff Trump till the next election then suddenly turn everything around. You guys are so FOS. True Americans see right through your BS.
This is one of the many reasons I will be voting for Biden in November. We HAVE to keep moving forward, not backwards. Betsy wants to take leaps backwards.
Are you REALLY going to not congratulate the President and his administration on this Middle East deal? You post this but no ‚Äúhey credit where credit is due, great job on this, can‚Äôt wait for Biden to broker treaties between the rest of the Middle East?‚Äùthats petty &amp; pathetic.
Economic expansion?  For China maybe? You guys are pathetic. You know who was responsible for the boost in our economy and it wasn‚Äôt Obama and Biden. You guys always get away with lying. Things were going good until China‚Äôs virus hit. Hmm? China. Dems preferred ally and ideology.

If you were 50/50 between Biden and Trump and went 3rd party instead, it wouldn't be an issue because they both lost an equal shot at your vote.  It's not so much a vote for trump as a reduction in possible votes for Biden.  That being said, vote shaming is wrong, vote your heart
Any 12 year old joe Biden supporter needs to be yelled at sorry
You were never going to vote for trump, but you might have voted for Biden if he wasn't such a colossal tool. You voting third party or not voting represents the loss of a potential vote for King Douche but has no impact on trump, so it benefits him that you're not voting Biden.
I know I am!  Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Not enough time. By electing Biden it becomes a moot point.
How's that  house you're living in now for backing down and rolling over to let Joe Biden become the presumptive Democratic nominee
yeah that shit was awful. i hate that we have biden now instead of bernie. it sucks, but my biggest concern at the moment is whether trump gets elected, because frankly i can't tolerate another 4 years of this shit
Let's be real it's not Biden/Harris or Harris/Biden Come October Quid Pro Joe will be replaced with

ok this is too bad of a take for me to even respond lmfao. "biden is further right than trump" jfk best joke i've heard in a while
Not voting is a vote for no one. It‚Äôs not a vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a vote for Biden. The way America has put all the blame of corrupt politicians on the working class is bizarre.
has been arguing with me about Biden and Harris and how I need to vote for them because at least it's a shuffle in the right direction.   A shuffle ain't big enough. I want a fuckin rocket.
You‚Äôve destroyed the country. Joe Biden is our only hope
Let‚Äôs not forget what Harris did to Kavanaugh. Whe WAS very nasty. Horrible horrible person. Does anyone think Biden is a racist?  Only Harris. #nasty
it really doesn't take much energy or time though. also never claimed voting for biden is "revolutionary", i claimed it's strategic to prevent a worse outcome
Please don‚Äôt trouble yourself to come on my account. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! #facts

Nope gotta see Trump smash Biden
By the way what message was Joe Biden sending when he put his hand above Kamala Harris‚Äôs rump Creepy Joe just can‚Äôt help himself or maybe there is a sinister message like ‚Äú I got your back African Americans‚Äù
The ouster of the incumbent is a beginning, no more, and if Biden's no more than an unimaginative repairman, we will need to press for more fundamental reforms across a broad front. The best Biden can do is to call for a national discussion of the issue.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket
If Trump willingly leaves office in January, a focus of the Biden/Harris administration should be a post card tax return. Many Americans will have confusing returns next year - at least make it less complicated for them.
Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA.
The difference between Biden and Trump. Biden sends Billions to Ukrain to save his own ass and lets his son profit millions. Trump sends his Son in law to broker a peace deal with Israel and the UAE and he gets it done. #TRUMPISMYPRESIDENT #MAGA2020
Fuck yeah she was! She was my first choice for president and the main reason I am excited to vote for Biden!  The  days are numbered.
Get used to this white people if you want to elect Joe Biden
No, I don‚Äôt believe he ran for POTUS, so was pointing out that Kamala obvs had more support than Pence did so Trumps ‚Äúargument‚Äù is silly (per usual). I agree that a Biden/Harris win would immediately start the healing process we desperately need. Love you too!
The difference between the two sides is that we don't expect gov't to make everything better. If you want to know the big appeal, it's what did Trump do to stay TF out of my way and let me make my life better. If you rely on Biden/Harris to make your life better, that's pathetic
There is a new facebook group called Latter day Saints for Joe. Biden is speaking to the group this Saturday
Putin thinks trump is his private pawn, we will show him he will not win and we will take care of yu Putin when Biden takes office. Big time sanctions against you for all the interference in our elections. Putin &amp; Trump, your days are numbered.
That‚Äôs not the narrative EVERY single ‚Äònews‚Äô outlet and ‚Äòjournalist‚Äô I‚Äôve seen/heard ‚Äòreport‚Äô on Biden/Harris has to say.  They‚Äôre selling it as though it‚Äôs America‚Äôs strongest and most popular ticket of all time.

Harris is a very good choice, for Biden.  Why haven't you told Trump that he is at a third grade level, by all, of his goofy name calling?

Local people did it.  Some on that list are voting Biden; I'm voting Jorgensen.  Others leaving their vote blank.  I do think Trump is that bad.  The guy is an incompetent moron.  Now that we got those SCOTUS seats, he does more long term harm than short term good.
Interesting you portray yourself as the fast moving train since you are a total train wreck.  And I've seen you and Biden do the basic function of walking and he runs circles around you.   #BidenHarris2020
James, how long. Write we start seeing shot like this again for 1% Biden and 2% Harris?
She‚Äôs not even the Trojan horse. Wait till after the convention.... they will declare biden unfit and throw in Hillary and Obama in their place.
It is the truth tho? Like demonstrably. Biden has overwhelming support from core dem constituencies - particularly black women. So that‚Äôs democracy. Not me trying to make myself feel better.
This shows me that you guys were woefully unprepared for her as Biden's running mate.  Is this seriously all you have?
Does the election ever become a market issue?  1. Biden presidency will be far less Wall Street friendly while a Senate/House sweep significantly raises odds for higher corporate taxes &amp; buyback rules.  2. Trump could refuse to leave  and set off a banana republic type crisis.
Ayo what the fuck are you on  We‚Äôre all agreeing on Trump needing to be kicked out,but the only way to do that is Biden/Harris. West won‚Äôt do shit except divide the vote as an independent, and two others are already doing that. We can‚Äôt afford that shit right now.
Fox News' Jeanine Pirro baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen to Joe Biden': "I just have this feeling."

Any parent who loses a child mourns the loss of what he could have been. I feel Joe Biden‚Äôs emptiness.
Joseph Biden, President of the United States. Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States. At this moment in time, there are no other REALISTICALLY POSSIBLE more important two sentences than those two. We have to insure the freedom of not just our country? But of the world
It's not something anyone has to try to do. Biden has already has many years of success doing it himself.
i feel the same. unfortunately so many leftists on here care more about purity. saying you'll vote for biden is guaranteed to get you called a liberal. gatekeepy af
honestly, as someone who will vote for biden, i think this is a pretty solid argument for why voting third party isn't a bad idea. i've seen so many weak arguments from bernie or busters that this is kinda a breath of fresh air to me
Herman Cain Twitter Account Shares Posthumous Attack on Biden and Harris

yeah the liberals suck. i'm just saying that the ppl you are seeing from the #NoComeradesUnder1k tag probably are leftists, you shouldn't dismiss them just because they say they will vote for biden. we have legitimate reasons for our decision

Not caring about this info is a privilege imo...she never said to vote for Trump. It is important to acknowledge the harm she has caused so many different communities while still deciding to vote for her. Biden/Harris have to earn their votes they‚Äôre not entitled to zero crit
y'all gotta realize that it's possible for a leftist to vote for biden. because some of are adamant about preventing trump getting reelected. i understand taking issue with ppl trying to shame you into voting biden, but don't shame ppl voting for him either

if you think trump and biden are equally bad, please take a look at the covid-19 numbers and remember: trump did this
there is no way that biden would be treating the pandemic similar to how trump is. if you really think that biden and trump are the same on this issue, then i wonder if you are even aware of what's happening in this country
biden? he's not currently in any position of power to enact policies, but he's at least been using platform to promote scientific/medical consensus. trump is a science denier who doesn't even believe covid-19 exists. he encourages ppl to not wear masks. he's pushed for reopening
Kamala ran for Senator as an American Indian.    She ran for President as that poor little black girl.     When she and Biden lose, what will she be?........unemployed.

they aren't tho?? "i like this candidate" is an opinion. "these two candidates are different" is a factual statement. one of my claims is that voting for biden will help prevent trump's reelection, again a factual statement
Joe Biden was not my 1st choice. He wasn‚Äôt my first 5. There‚Äôs a few things I don‚Äôt agree with him about. But I do believe if he‚Äôd been president thousands would not have died. Millions would still have jobs. I do believe he‚Äôd listen to experts.And I do think he has a good heart.
honestly very concerned with how an attempted assault weapons ban under biden would play out. all right wing gun nuts talk about is prepping to use their guns to fight the govt if they have to. even if it didn‚Äôt make it very far i could see some fucked up shit happening
Rule for biden at debates or those interviewing  always bring up windmills ..... hates them.
Why is it that whenever anyone tweets anything remotely critical of joe biden - or in this case not even koe biden, but one of his followers - thousands of trump haters pop out of the woodwork? You realize that criticizing trump doesn make biden better, right? Surely? #BidenVP

Biden also mispronounced his running mate's name. Seems  was okay until  tried to get rich quick. Ask  how it's done.
Trump‚Äôs running attack ads on Joe Biden like Ben Wyatt on Bobby Newport
It shows the Trump train blowing through small town, shuttered and shut down America while it shows Biden as hard working and determined on that handcar to repair what Trump has done.   Also, I made a better video in my 8th grade computer science class.
...the best you can do in this situation is vote for a leftist third party, but that party has no chance of winning. only biden or trump can win. so which will it be? one is worse than the other. do you really believe fascism is better than neoliberalism?
moveon endorsed biden. After 20 years, I‚Äôm done with them. pass
biden is bread in a dishwasher.

I don't think you understand. In my previous tweet..in the thread I said there is a huge difference between h1n1 and covid.  But at the same time....what prep did Obama and Biden do to prevent future pandemics?  Obviously zero.  Hence the situation we have today.

Maybe, but Biden certainly has plenty of underage girls‚Äô names written in his book.
Did he really choose her Christiana? I thought you were a smart lady This is Joe Biden‚Äòs resignation speech, as I said before he will resign before his term is over and let his vice president take the lead
Hmm. Mass sickness, mass death, mass unemployment. You‚Äôre talking about Biden‚Äôs record, right? Surely you‚Äôre not that confused.
The radical left-wing exists in your heads &amp; it's NOT Kamala Harris. Biden/Harris MODERATE ticket for 2020. #DumpTrump2020
I guess that didn't work did it?  So I guess instead of blaming Trump we can blame Obama and Biden for not doing their jobs better preparing our country. ü§î  Let alone Obamas wonderful $37m Donation to the lab that produced the virus.

I am a suburban widow and I am definitely voting for Biden.
I am a suburban wife and mother who hasn‚Äôt worked for the past 8 years.  I will be voting for Biden/Harris.
Democrats plan to make over America and it involves getting rid of suburbs and putting low housing into our neighborhoods,to make it more equitable for minorities. This would ruin our communities. Cliburn who got Biden nominated got that promise from him
That's be the perfect ¬´thank you !¬ª for him spending so much time and effort pushing Biden
Biden the liar.
that 4 more years of trump will "accelerate" societal suffering to a point that unrest allows for a leftist revolution to be more likely, thus it is preferable that trump win the election over biden. it's naive and absurd
Look Mom, I‚Äôm on TV!  Humbled to have had the chance to go on  w/ to talk about the nomination of  for VP and what it means for our community in AZ.  We can work to defeat Trump AND hold a Biden administration accountable to put our people first.

Joe Biden is kicking your ass in the polls &amp; in all swing states. You're going to prison, Trump. #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison  #WorstPresidentEver  #DumpTrump2020
Here you go.
We're fine with Kamala Harris having whatever influence or power that Biden gives her. We had primaries. There was a result. That's behind us. There's nothing urgent about the fever dreams you're pretending to have and the main thing now is send Trump away for good.
i‚Äôve talked to a lot of people, including my friends and mentors about voting for biden, but ultimately, it‚Äôs his job to convince me, not theirs and idk if i‚Äôm convinced.
If we lived in a blue state and not a swing state, that‚Äôs what I would do.   I vote for every down ballot race. They often have a more immediate effect on our lives. They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. You can hold your nose and check the Biden box and then vote for down ballot.

Look.   I‚Äôm voting for the Biden/Harris ticket for two reasons.   1. Trump is a borderline fascist.  2. If he gets another Supreme Court pick, we‚Äôre fucked for a generation.   I‚Äôd rather eat half a plate of shit rather than a whole plate. This sucks.
Sure they are... just like Biden is running away with the election. No way Biden wins in a legitimate election. If he does win their will be a second American revolution in this country. I know who I‚Äôm betting on. One American Patriot is equal to three Marxist terrorist.
Why does the media consistently talk about Biden's kids? Why don't they talk about the one who's been working in the Ukraine and how that son was sleeping with the other's wife after he died? Why don't they continue to talk about the morals of this man and his family?
I think the point of that is to expose Biden/Kamala as hypocrites
For all those republicans who say Biden will being the economy down...

No, of course Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt own
Bye! Bye! TrumpPence.  Hello, President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris!
Honestly, if it gets Trump out of office, I'll put up with it.  There are worse people Biden could've picked.
Our moment is galvanized by Harris as Biden's running mate. November 3rd.  We're going to get our country back.
Why is it that Joe Biden is the one that sounds like he has a dick in his mouth üòù
And if Biden and the Dems win they will also protect Social Security and the Post Office as well as clean up the environment and work on Climate Control. Vote for  and vote for
i too am fed up with neoliberals. i despise them. but i still recognize that they are a lesser evil compared to trump. never biden leftists want to have their cake and eat it too
We're on the right track k following Biden and Harris
...there is a fucking pandemic happening, and trump has been accelerating us into devastation. his anti-intellectualism has lead to 5 million infected. biden at least is not a science denier. he at least would take real action to slow the pandemic to a halt...
When Joe Biden inevitable bows out or is hospitalized during his first year in office, a self-described ‚ÄúSuper Cop‚Äù who was pushed out of the race before Iowa because of her damning record and didn‚Äôt receive a single delegate in the primary will become the President.

Another great reason to not vote for Biden-Harris! Keep HRC from doing another Benghazi.
All I know is y are we sitting around like mushrooms. Y is it nobody can ask or open up Biden an Harris on they‚Äôre bullshit
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.

Kamala is NOT a Natural Born Citizen and not, therefore, hold a position in the line of succession of the office of President. It was an act of insurrection for Biden to nominate her and it is an act of treason for her to accept the nomination.

Please tell me how Biden could lead? I‚Äôll wait
Maybe a neuro-physiologist should explain to Brian how psychomotor activity and higher cognitive processes like decision making differ. Apparently he is totally unaware of how little they are related. Glad to see Biden getting cardio-vascular expercise tho. Good for body &amp; brian.
I miss Robin Williams and his joke about rambling Joe Biden.   ü§£üòÇ.... We can always have comedy but then there's Old Rambling Joe!
Why would anyone believe that? Looking back over his career, Biden could have done that but never did. This is just another empty, hollow, Dem promise not worth znyone's serious consideration. In a word, it's just more Dem MALARKEY.
That is why it's beyond my understanding how anyone could vote for Joe Biden when he was in there for eight years with Obama and did nothing for American people. The only thing Obama and Joe Biden did was give money to foreign countries and terrorists. Like China and Iran!
I don't have room in my life for people who just can't accept who they are and think making a marked statement it about it will change them . Meghan Markle is one , Joe Biden is another.  A copycat politician who uses Donald Trump as an excuse to think he's better.

Ah, &amp; no mention of China working for Biden. How blind, how deaf. If foreign intervention is worth worrying about, then it's worth worrying about with respect to both candidates or neither, but showing partiality is not the solution.
Shove Joe Biden back where he belongs.  It's not in the White House either.  He's so stupid he copycats Donald Trump's campaigns.
Some professor tried to push Biden 101 on us at FAU in the mid 70's, or FAA-EWW  as it was known on the party circuit. We plied him with so much Jagermeister ,that he's now pen pals with Newt.

Why aren't you investigating interference FOR Biden by China and Iran.  Both know that Biden is weak and will do their bidding, he'll bow to them same way Obama did.
You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...

Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.

Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
He advised Biden not to extend an invitation to her! So it seems even Willie has had enough of her!!
And there is an even simpler reason: Biden would absolutely not have taken someone from a Senate seat who would be replaced by a GOP governor. Warren could have checked every box and he wouldn‚Äôt risk losing the seat.

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!

You bet we do want Biden-Harris in the White House b/c Harris is not ultra liberal. But play your little tired games of ohhhhhhhhh that‚Äôs socialism. Socialism is giving $2T tax breaks to the 1% on the backs of the middle &amp; working class, Debbie.
You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.
Biden could‚Äôve picked Howdy Doodie &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt have lost my vote. Oh &amp; Black folk miss me with the argument about prosecutors, prosecuting crimes! When a criminal attacks your family you don‚Äôt see color.
I love how they paint Biden and now Harris as far left.
If I had a choice to vote for Trump, Biden or Putin I would gladly vote for my comrade Vlad.
I totally agree and understand why Kamala was picked for him.   Biden will not run for a second term IF he wins. This gives her a head start for 2024.  Most likely Joe will not finish his first term which is the only way she could ever be POTUS.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP - ABC News -  via
So, who do you think KH will pick as her VP when Biden, if he wins, steps down for the good of the Nation? AOC?
Biden will be hearing Kamala's spike heeled foot steps in the shadows while he sleeps.
Team Biden is FkED! Trump 2020
Proud to support the Biden Harris ticket. Less than 90 days to get 45 out of the White House.
Will Michael Bloomberg be the Ambassador to Israel if Joe wins.   Biden won‚Äôt rule out naming donors as envoys, despite criticism  via
They saw record profits under Trump. Bankers are backing Biden anyway.  via
What Bull. Biden, the real racist, supported segregation, KKKByrd, and worse. He can't do or say a thing his handlers don't script for him. And you should have taken Willie's advice bc you will not help him win. You won't get near the WH.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden
Business as usual.  üîΩüîΩ  Wall Street executives are glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his VP running mate
Kamala Harris attacks Joe Biden on busing, race in Democratic debate
And this is who you all want as your vice president really LOL. Isn‚Äôt Biden bad enough
Can Bernie shame  his Berners into voting for a Biden/Kamala ticket?
Biden/Harris 2020 uh US Senate ü§£
Trump took the bait and called Kamala a ‚ÄúNasty Women‚Äù.    Where have we heard that before?    He consistently puts down stong Women.   Smart Women Against Trump (SWAT).  We the women of American are coming for you Agent Orange. #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden   #TrumpIsLosing
I know y‚Äôall not gonna let trump win AGAIN. ü§° we know joe Biden and Kamala suck ass GET OVER YOURSELF
The Obama/Hillary mantra has always been to purge the left.   Even a Dem center left leaner should not vote for this center right Biden/Harris Republican ticket.
I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden but am less than thrilled with this choice.
A Biden/Kamala ticket proves Hedges is spot on again.
Im just glad Biden‚Äôs VP pick isnt also a million years old
Joe Biden is excited and ready time sniff!
In roughly 60 days, Arizonans will receive early ballots with the historic team of  and  at the top of the ticket. Biden Harris WILL win AZ,  the White House and WILL restore the soul of our nation. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Press conf in Wilmington tomorrow.  Just a stunner.  What's the over/under on how many days it takes Biden to get west of the Mississippi?
Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.
You Democrats are the most scurrilous, malicious group to come down the road in decades. And YOU will help Biden lose -- big.
Joe Biden Is Back At It Again, Just Chose Kamala Harris As His Running Mate. ü§î #BidenVP
I think it speaks volumes about the type of person Biden is to choose Harris. That he can forgive the primary debates.
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, HARRIS AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
HELLO EVERYONE, FROM FACEBOOK JAIL, TIME FOR MORE WORDS OF WISDOM FROM UNCLE JOEL!!!!!  JOE BIDEN, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MADE A GREAT CHOICE!!!!!  KAMALA HARRIS, A WONDERFULLY, BRILLIANT, STRONG BLACK WOMAN FOR VICE PRESIDENT!!!!!
Can't wait to see the mental and emotional gymnastics people are going to ask of leftists. I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden, don't ask me to be fucking excited please.
IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, HARRIS AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!

It‚Äôs better than what we have now and it‚Äôll get Biden more support.. so I‚Äôm all for it
Bogart is a Biden pooch!
It would seem as if I have not been chosen as Biden's running mate.

Ratings bc of Trump? How absurd! 1. CNN ratings didn't rise. They are way down with most of the public doubting what CNN spouts. 2. Biden would NOT be boring if CNN were to actually investigate all the corruption surrounding him, including his financial ties to China...

Ok so...I feel it‚Äôs unfair to keep you all in suspense any longer. Here is a picture of Biden‚Äôs VP candidate. Biden/Tiniest and crankiest calico cat 2020!
I think its a confusing inside baseball game. I think if they feel comfortable with the vetting its Rice, however between her being worth 25-50 million, and years in the Obama WH that is a big if. I think the political people want Kamila, the Biden people don't
FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO US, I WANT HIM, HIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS FAMILY TO CONTRACT THE MOST VIRULENT FORM OF COVID-19 AND SUFFER GREATLY!!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!

At least he has them and takes numerous questions that aren't pre-approved from 'reporters' he's been told to call upon.  What's the journalistic value of Biden's TWO 'press conferences' other than comedy?
23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...
Joe Biden for President
JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Bullshit! Obama-Biden didn‚Äôt do shit for the American people.
My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.
"Is there an equivalent on the left tearing down Trump?‚Äù Observant, aren't u? CNN wouldn't exist w/o liars &amp;propagandists for Dems/now Biden like u to string public along with your constant lies, omissions, and fictions. Look at yourself in the mirror to answer your question.UGH!

Ask me again why I despise Dems as much as Repubs and why I will not vote for either one of the Israel Firsters.   Report: Biden personally intervened to get the word 'occupation' removed from the Democratic Party platform
Biden‚Äôs up 10%
Biden, lol.
My MIL accused me of brainwashing my husband into voting for Biden. Not the craziest thing she‚Äôs said about me, but it‚Äôs new, at least.
Someone PLEASE stop Biden from talking
The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.
make more you tube videos.....give your opinion on 2020 riots,BLM, trump, Biden whatever. There great
Chuck Schumer does an irrupt change in Democrats stand against school‚Äôs opening up. Now pushing hard to get teachers unions on board to open schools. The reason, if kids get sick on a large scale, President Trump will be blamed hurting him in November. Dems can‚Äôt win with Biden

Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
Meh. I‚Äôve heard that Biden can destroy God himself, so removing some extra melanin isn‚Äôt impressive.

Based upon Joe's recent videos....Joe Biden is working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden......
VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."
please sir stop STOP ATTACKING CHINA JOE BIDEN.  WAIT LET HIM KEEP FUMBLING WITHOUT YOUR COMMENTS.  WHEN YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING DURING YOUR PRESS QUESTIONS.  all you have to do is say this  There is a reason I CALL YOU FAKE NEWS-- YOU REFUSE TO TELL THE TRUTH

Just saw segment on ‚ÄúInside Edition‚Äù about your interview with VP Biden and the Cognitive Test question.  Given the context vis a vis the President, I think it was entirely appropriate to ask.  VP Biden‚Äôs response was a little over the top.  You did ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Joe Biden is not a devout Catholic because he does not accept the Church's teaching on abortion and same sex marriage.

‚ÄúA third misleading use of an image in that ad, they also show Biden sort of looking down, hands clasped, looking defeated,‚Äù Well, he was actually praying at an African-American church in Delaware after the death of George Floyd.‚Äù Because DJT doesn‚Äôt know what praying looks like.
I just don‚Äôt know how Biden will be able to take your guns if Obama already took them.
We need the $ since Biden has the MSM propaganda for free!
I feel like us conservatives are starting to call things racist that aren‚Äôt actually racist. We‚Äôre starting to use a more obscure, ambiguous definition of racism instead of the actual definition. I‚Äôm pretty sure even Candace has said something to the same effect as VP Biden did.
I‚Äôm with Biden! All the way Biden!
Be after almost 4 years the debate doesn‚Äôt really matter most good Americans already no who they want and the debate won‚Äôt change anything and we are tired of your lies / Joe Biden for president
Democrats party may need to elect a new presidential candidate quickly, Biden is losing it at a alarming rate. They will be begging the Republicans to delay the election.Tensions linger between Biden and Obama---‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate Joe‚Äôs ability to f--k things up,‚Äù one Democrat who spoke to the former president recalled him saying
Every duly-elected living president supports  Biden ;   emphasis on "duly elected" !
How about when Biden and Obama allowed the H1N1, the SWINE FLU, to INFECT MILLIONS of Americans before declaring it a health emergency....           Was the press losing it's minds and calling it the OBAMAFLU AND BLAMING OBAMA and BIDEN for the spread ? SILENCE!
What has Joe Biden ever done in his entire life to create a private-sector job?                What has Joe Biden done to help the American middle class worker?                  Let me also ask you this...Why do you think there are so many people tearing down statues, our burning
you just closed your mind to ANYTHING he does?          Please ask yourselves the following questions, if you dare...            What has Joe Biden done for America for the last 47 years that he's held an office?
But Trump is the current President, not Biden. Trump DOESN'T even try to handle it. All we hear is BULLSHIT, alot of words, alot of stupidity, alot of nonsense.
Wow, not only is Hiden Biden refusing to answer questions at a press conference, Hedging Harris isn‚Äôt answering questions either.

So Biden's going to win, because everyone likes BJs? This poll can't be right, can it?
This is what Google says ! Bernie Sanders tweeted support for the pic. Don't buy the hype !
Still would be voting for Biden. I think Harris would be a great voice for the criminal justice reform. I'd prefer a President Booker and or a President Sanders. But I really don't want a 4 year term of Trump..
I love this pick. I‚Äôve been a Kamala fan for a long time. She will eviscerate Pence in a debate. She will be the fighter that Biden needs.  #BidenHarris2020

Again, this could be a while thread by itself, but Biden needs to learn to choose his words more carefully.   This is why Christians can‚Äôt be loyal to any party. They‚Äôll both fail us eventually. Only Jesus is perfect.

With all those deaths, why are we worried about the kung flu again?  Why does our population continue to grow as well?  It's like we're losing over 10% of our population every year.  Are you sure that's not joe biden?
Just a Trump ploy to siphon votes from Biden. Maybe if there was a normal candidate, it would be a good try.  Voting for Kanye would be a waste of time
I've also endorsed Mr. Biden.
I am a delegate in my precinct and I will be voting for Mark Kelly and Joe Biden this year. I wish them great success.

You have to wonder why Biden picked Harris? She can NEVER be President of the United States, she is not liked she only had 2% of the vote in the democrat Presidential race, from her home state of California she finished 5th. She treated everyone in front of congress like a dog.

Bernie was the compromise, asshole. ‚ÄúPerfect reflection‚Äù couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. If Biden is at all a reflection of your values, then you have terrible values.
And conservatives regard them as marxist. Unfortunately it‚Äôs actually progressives who see past them, most liberals will consider Harris and Biden as progressive and this their vote earns them some savior complex.
It‚Äôs not a moderate dem. Biden‚Äôs positions aren‚Äôt moderate anymore and he is legit gone mentally so he won‚Äôt even be president anymore. No I have no interest in having a weekend in bernie‚Äôs presidency where radical left people run domestic policy and neocons run foreign policy
Joe Biden is not thinking about anything.
Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.
You Still For Heels Up Harris and Racist Biden?
Do you realize how much I don‚Äôt want this? I hate this, I hate Biden and Harris, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm okay with my family dying which DeVos makes that a possibility. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better under Biden but I can say it‚Äôs certain under Trump. That‚Äôs it.

Biden doesn‚Äôt even give a damn about white people.

I just did it, it defaults to  and is a fundraiser.  Biden is openly tied to BLM?  Too bad we don't have a MSM to talk about that.
Well so here we are, we have a Prez candidate that hides in the basement and cognitive powers are under suspicion.  He can't pronounce his running mate's first name. Biden says DJT is soft on terrorism, but his Admin gave Iran 1.5 Billion dollars. DJT took out Sulimani and ISIS.
Kamala Harris‚Äôs analogy of  how the Obama-Biden administration successfully controlled and eradicated the Ebola virus epidemic of 2014-2016 doesn‚Äôt quite square with the facts. Get used to the fabrications because that‚Äôs all they have to offer.

If you're in a swing state, then you should vote Biden. If you're in a firmly blue state, I'd argue that you should vote third party.
We'll go backwards either damn way, dude. Total stagnation isn't enough anymore, and if Biden doesn't push actually decent progressive policies during his presidency, then we'll prolly be left with a Cotton or Carlson presidency in 2024, both of which are worse than Orange Man.

Kamala Harris relentlessly ripped into Joe Biden during the debates especially early on. I'm sure Trump will try to seize on that. Not saying it will be successful, just pointing it out.
apparently, Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, who is among other things a black woman as his running mate.  just get prepared for the takes you'd see on this from AA, from the fact that she is light skinned to the theory that Biden may be condescending.

I will be extremely upset if it‚Äôs Susan Rice. She has never held office nor run a political campaign. The person Joe Biden picks for VP will in all likelihood run for president in 2024. We need somebody who can do that and I don‚Äôt think Susan Rice qualifies

biden will give china anything they want......china will own America if biden is elected.  Trump does NOT let china get away with screwing America....Trump is tough on china. biden would give away our Freedom.

Someone mentioned the idea that Biden is taking as long as he has because he's going to announce his entire cabinet at once. I really like this idea.  It shows he's ready to go on day 1 and it spreads out the GOP campaign to avoid the cannon hitting a single person.

china wants biden elected because biden will send American business to china if he is elected. American jobs will be sent to china because biden is getting a pay off and his son is working for a communist china company....if biden is elected...china wins and America loses.
Biden says he'd bring back lockdowns despite drop in COVID-19 cases   democrats want to lock down America so they can have power and control over all Americans.  They want us to submit to them so we depend on them....this is pure socialism....then communism

I think Biden winning the election could trigger Trump to start a coup, that's why I think Biden's the accelerationist candidate. I could be wrong, and wouldn't be sad if I was.  Other than that, Biden and Trump are both part of the problem. One's just more acerbic.
My conscience precludes voting for Trump. Biden is, at best, a slower burn leading to the same explosion. Third party is vainly waving a flag saying "fuck you" to an establishment that doesn't hear me.
Do you believe Biden choosing Harris actually helps him or hurts his chances of winning?
That‚Äôs kind of the thing: Biden may be the accelerationist vote. If he wins Trump may do everything possible, including seizing power to hold onto office. If Trump wins, no Trump coup, Trump has a harder time not standing down in 2028. This is pure rumination.

The Libs will be complaining about the protests but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna matter to the protestors. Biden/Harris aren‚Äôt going to have any more luck putting down protests than Trump did, and if they try to escalate the level of force that‚Äôll just end badly.

One people! One country! One leader! Vote Biden 2020!
No it should be based on who is best qualified to assume the Presidency. Especially for Biden.
No, it won't be. Biden doesn't want someone strong who will challenge him when he does something questionable. He wants someone who will stand in the background smiling and looking pretty, not someone with ideas and opinions.
Anyone that believes anything Biden says or any of the left are brainwashed!!!üôÑ

"Joe Biden, master debater", is about as unserious a label as "Joe Biden, senile old fool who can't escape his own basement"
Needing a running mate to shore up black support defeats the entire point of the Biden candidacy

First reason I like this pick, her prosecution experience.   When Biden/Harris win the investigations begin.  A wise choice for this alone.
Just as Democratic Presidential candidate, Joe Biden made his big announcement of Kamala Harris as his Vice President-elect, VP Mike Pence was landing in Tucson.  AZ Dems claim the VP is distracting from President Trump's "reckless coronavirus response."
No, she called him a rapist.
I think now that Kamala is on the ticket Trump doesn‚Äôt make it to November. He was waiting to see if Biden would pick Whitmer thereby potentially weakening the black vote. Now he‚Äôll plan his exit strategy so he can get his pardon from Pence.
Does she still believe that  sexually assaulted and harassed women?
That‚Äôs gotta be awkward.

My take is he'll go with Rice. She's been part of the Obama-Biden team for a while know and her only flaw is Benghazi (not her fault). The Pod Bros (PSA) are already doing damage control for her. Add that Kamala was a cop and you can see it's rice.   Either one's a bad choice.
Biden doesn't need any help doing that.

Again the LIBERAL RADICAL DEMOCRATS CRIMINALS twist everything. The do nothing democrats continue the same Joe Biden in 40+years is proof that nothing gets done with democrats.
If he was centre left like you say he is, then he'd be a SocDem. People like Bernie are economically centre-left, Biden's centre-right to moderate right economically.
Be careful. Soon there could be no eating or drinking in airports. The silliness of mask requirements will not be accepted by authorities &amp; most the media until Biden is elected....maybe....if we are lucky.
expect MUCH more of this as you vote for Biden &amp; Harris.  they too are shi*-stains
Not only did I not like Biden winning the Democrat race, but when Kamala Harris was announced, I did some hopeful research. In the end, turns out Kamala Harris might be one of the most horrible choices to go for.  I hope I'm wrong, but sadly -HORRIBLY- Trump might win again. :(
Vote the Biden/Harris ticket. There's a number Progressives in the House &amp; we are working on the Senate. We are OversightüëÅ
You don‚Äôt like Trump but how can you as a Conservative vote for Biden? Just sad!!! You have no business representing Republicans in this state.
Let's be sure to elect Biden so we can stop this Middle East peace crap.  We can't have this.
You have to wonder why Biden picked Harris? She can NEVER be President of the United States, she is not liked she only had 2% of the vote in the democrat Presidential race, from her home state of California she finished 5th. She treated everyone in front of congress like a dog.

Yes it is, one needs prescribed speed to function(funny when you see trump need another bump) and Biden is now better, what‚Äôs worse is the DNC sees this and still gives you this candidate as a slap in the face.

Biden speaking is far worse.
Democrats autocracy 2020 Joe Biden issues an edict that everyone should wear a mask everywhere anytime for 90 days. No evidence. No science. Kamala Harris threatens congress to pass gun buybacks or she will take executive action. Hell no to Democrats.
Susan Collins said..... so when will she begin to campaign against Joe Biden?

Because they know she can‚Äôt be president and if Biden wins and steps down, Pelosi becomes President. Heels Up Harris is an Anchor Baby.
If the chump has made it this long I personally don't believe there is any reason a person can't be president right now in this country. I am hoping we have learned and implement something to prevent this situation in the future. Joe Biden/Kamala Harris will guide us to health.

The Democrats should ask Biden to step down for his own good and the good of their party. Who should replace him? I guess  He got the 2nd most votes and he could stand toe to toe with Trump in a debate.  But Dems: Please spare Joe Biden any more humiliation. 8/8
Biden looks weak, sometimes even physically weak. I hate to see it. I'm serious.  The man that was vice president could have challenged Trump. The man stuck in his basement and struggling in interviews cannot.  He won't last four years. 4/8
There is obviously something wrong with Biden.  His mind just isn't where it used to be.  His memory and his cognition are failing.  He doesn't seem to be able to talk very long without a prompter either in front of, or behind, the camera. 3/8
But Biden picked a VP and it looks like the Democrats are going through with this. I wish they wouldn't. 2/8
I honestly thought Joe Biden wouldn't be the nominee, even after he won the primaries. I thought the Democrats would keep him from embarrassment and shame. I don't like seeing people humiliated. 1/8

I'm sorry, I voted for Obama &amp; I can't find a reason to vote Biden because of policies I know will not work in this country.

As an Independent, I don't care. People receive their degrees regardless if they have A, B, or C. I care more about policies &amp; right now I cannot support Liberal policies. I can't find 1 reason to vote for Biden &amp; I voted for Obama.
Antifa and BLM is why Biden receives so much campaign funds! The left supports them for the money! They are evil!
Biden chose a strong woman and that scares the bejesus out of Trump
When and if there is a presidential debate I am hoping to see it moderated on OANN. Forget fox news. There would be a good chance Donna Brazille would give the questions to Biden. Not that he could remember them.
Yes, we do. We went Biden early on &amp; never wavered. True #KHive also said we'd vote Biden regardless of VP. We are overjoyed it's our beloved #Queen , but support for Joe was never conditional.
Funny. New anti- ad playing in AZ saying how Biden is against opening schools right now. It‚Äôs supposed to make you mad but just made me happy. So your saying Biden doesn‚Äôt want people to die, and somehow that‚Äôs a bad thing? So much for Republicans being pro-life
Sigh. Looks to me like the Biden accounts with 10 followers are much more prevalent
Amazing how this imbecile is putting VP debates up on a pedestal since in the entire history of VP debates...No one gives a crap about VP's...until 2020 as Biden sleeps in the basement. How pathetic Bill Kristol's transformation has become.

Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
About as much as Biden
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.
You Still For Heels Up Harris and Racist Biden?

Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
Who would have thought this tweet would generate such fervant defense of Joe Biden's religious orthodoxy? We need a clear discussion before November. You cannot be Catholic and pro-abortion.

In politics... you are NEVER going to get what you want. So stop bitching. It is a game of compromise. When you don‚Äôt get compromise, you get Trump, and a country in total disarray. Am I happy with Biden, no, but I know he is the correct direction. We can get back on track.
Biden is acting. just like out of the sopranos pretending to lose his mind to avoid prison
I'm not making a case not to vote for Biden, I'm making a case for him to actually adopt decent policies.
Trump, before your Dems made Covid happen but thats for another day, the economy was great, unemployment was at 50 yr.low among many things Trump did well. What have Dems done? Attack trump for 4 years. Class act. Lied about Russia, Quid quo Pro? And Biden gets away with it? 1/2
I hope, but I fear that Trump losing and a Biden presidency will somehow lead to Carlson or Cotton winning in 2024 using the same tactics trump's been using.
Biden should have gone full Kamala logo with the ticket logo.
Trump will win but wont become president. The Democrats have figured a way to steal the election and the biggest upset in recent history, Biden steals presidency and Trump wont leave white house
I‚Äôm not a staffer yet‚ô•Ô∏èhowever I do consider myself a Warren Democrat!! I would never attack Kamala b/c she‚Äôs not a Progressive nor Biden. However I do,thoughtfully, speak my mind. And the truth mattersüòâ
Anyone up for a survey? OFFICIAL: TRUMP-PENCE vs BIDEN-HARRIS  Pres Trump wants all responses sent to his office in 1 HR. Who will you vote for in November? Answer here:
Ummm Beavis huh huh uh why don‚Äôt you give some of that money to the  so the mail in election goes as planned unless your and your cronies plan to corrupt that too! #CNN #BidenHarris2020 #Biden
What I'd advocate for is that if you live in a firmly blue state, then try and vote Green or DSA; if you're in a Red or Swing State, vote Biden.
We won't trust anything tRump recommends. I'm waiting for President Biden to recommend a vaccine.
I'd ultimately rather have Biden, but it's like picking between a Tankie and a Nazi; one is slightly worse than the other.
Getting progressives in Congress is playing the long game to dismantle the corrupt establishment. Remember Biden said himself ‚ÄúNothing will fundamentals change‚Äù. God, how inspiring. üòç
T had been full of talk about Harris and deservedly so.  However don't forget that in the end Trump has to beat Biden not Harris.
CNN Is Already Suggesting That Biden Could 'Step Aside' For Kamala Harris

Interesting perspective  Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness
PHOTO: Joe Biden Needed A Script to Understand Why His Handlers Chose Kamala Harris
I find it interesting that Biden, who supported segregation, picked a running mate related to a slave owner of Irish slaves.
That's a very uneducated take. For one there's a video of Yang saying "I don't get a fuck about a spot in the Joe Biden administration." And Yang has publicly stated he would run against Biden in 2024 either as a Dem or independent.
Either Kamala lied about believing Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers &amp; used those women for a political jab or she did believe them &amp; decided to ignore them to be try and become Vice President.   Neither one of these actions demonstrate the morality Democrats claim to have the high ground on.

I was upset by the letters from Black professionals also. What happened?? Was Biden going to choose Warren or Whitmer?&amp; the Black Community found out?? I‚Äôm sure Corporate America weighed in on Warren and Biden caved once again ‚ÄºÔ∏è
I want you to know üßêEvery Black person is not excited about this pick. Warren is my champion and I‚Äôm upset b/c I feel Biden played Warren. Biden knew Kamala for yrs, and she worked with Biden‚Äôs favorite deceased son. Biden knew who he was picking. Political Theater.
Are you sure, With the support of many moderate republicans that are going to vote for biden in a way to kick out trump of the white house.
Sun City West, Arizona in what was once the bastion of Republicans has loads of Biden signs everywhere. It is quite a warm feeling to behold and hoping my state is responsible for overturning the tables at The White House.
That's all fine and dandy, but which of Biden's policies do you prefer over Trump's?
LMAO. The dumbest thing I saw on the internet this year. Who is afraid of Biden? Besides little girls and former staffers. Oh but I forgot MeToo and Trust all women not for libtards.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Is this the face she makes when she locks up black men then suppresses evidence that would free them? Perfect VP for a crook rapist like Biden. Oh yeah me too and trust all women not vs. Libtards

Fuck  who in 2020 thinks it‚Äôs the duty of the peasant to blindly please the king - it‚Äôs not. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt entitled to shit. He needs to earn our votes and between choosing a cop as VP and doubling down on no #M4A, he‚Äôs actively pushing away voters.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You will make a great team. I‚Äôm so proud to be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
solid pick.  shes got charisma to do job.  not sure Rice did.  and Whitmer self selected self out due to push for woman of color which is sad.  but Biden still got solid 2.
this is where Dems and 2020 Biden supporters need to be careful.  Dont get too excited or build Kamala to be something shes not.  Pence held his own against Kaine who was a very smart and capable guy and debater.  Kamala did not always shine in debates..
And she‚Äôll have an important role in Biden‚Äôs administration.
I knew about her lackluster performance when she was in Cali but I choose to hope she‚Äôs become a better person since then. I‚Äôd still prefer her and Biden over Trump and Pence

If #Biden is elected with #Harris he will quickly be pushed aside (or taken out) so that she can become the "real" communist president the #FarLeft is dying to have.
If you're in a swing state, then you should vote Biden. If you're in a firmly blue state, I'd argue that you should vote third party.
We'll go backwards either damn way, dude. Total stagnation isn't enough anymore, and if Biden doesn't push actually decent progressive policies during his presidency, then we'll prolly be left with a Cotton or Carlson presidency in 2024, both of which are worse than Orange Man.

Hi Kat the problem with doing them online is how do you know that Biden does not have a off camera monitor where smart people type the answers to questions?
It just seems agitated. What about Biden? Obviously he can‚Äôt be trusted. He‚Äôs that suave, ‚Äúin plain sight‚Äù type of untrustworthy. Most presidents before trump have been. Why don‚Äôt you talk about trump? Everyday something awful comes out about him. Just desensitized to it?
Sorry, but that would be misspelled since it is Biden!!!!! Lol

It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.

Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù
And once again, if you are a "blue no matter who" type liberal, you could help your own cause by actually admitting that our choices are shitty, and pledging your support and participation in direct action even IF Biden wins in November. Too many seem to think he is the solution.
Wait a tic. I hate Kanye as much as the next person but doesn‚Äôt this mean that he ISN‚ÄôT playing Biden spoiler since he is now running against Trump?
Vote for Biden.  Seriously, tRUmp will only get much worse if he is left in office.
So, Biden is no longer "Sleepy Joe" but is now "Slow Joe".  What is most interesting and will remain with you throughout history...FOREVER...is the fact that you are Impeached Trump.

3) ironically tankies declaring Biden ‚Äúthe Maoist‚Äôs choice‚Äù does far more to validate Trump‚Äôs attacks than anyone bring up Tara Reid every could, straight up Trump‚Äôs strategy this time around is literally just tie Biden/Harris to tankies &amp; antifa
Yes, glad I switched to Democrat to support Bernie. Party‚Äôs are way over-rated. It‚Äôs people that matter, Hope Republicans get that, looks like many are jumping ship to support Biden. I welcome them!
Can you explain why our initial purpose was to #FlattenTheCurve? I think we're in week 25? And fuck you if you're doing this  bc it helps Joe Biden get elected.
He's gotta be careful on this one. Plus he's not running against her, he's running against Biden. So my take no nick name for Flip Flop Kamala.
I am sure these characters are going to circle file Republican votes!
If this is what real leadership looks like then real leadership is dead. Biden looks like he's dead and no one told him.

Uh, no. It was the China virus that did the damage. And if Biden had had his way, there wouldn't have been a ban on flights from China and things could have been so much worse. But arm chair quartbacking is so much easier...
It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.

There are two main Establishment factions in the Democratic Party: Obama/Biden centrists and Clinton/Harris woke hipster liberals. The Harris pick was a concession by the former to the latter. That‚Äôs all.
Voting for Biden/Harris is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Trump may be flawed, but the country has been great up until Covid. I have confidence that the country will continue to excel under Trump, but I'm scared of what life might be like under the other guys.

You gave the Trump experiment a shot, probably because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a politician‚Äù, the experiment obviously failed. At least the Obama/Biden administration brought the economy back from the brink in ‚Äò08 &amp; handled the H1N1 virus without 100‚Äôs thousands of deaths. VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS!

If I were working for team Biden at this point I would start buying as many N95 masks as possible to donate to supporters who will have to stand in long lines on election day.  Request the day off now, and wear a mask, it's the only way to save the Republic and democracy.
Joe Biden will raise your taxes. Joe Biden will take your healthcare. Joe Biden will take away oil and gas. Joe Biden will let Kamala ruin America faster than he would.

All you do is complain about meaningful change. Well, here‚Äôs a piece of information that it actually RELEVANT instead of senseless whining: you won‚Äôt get anything done if you don‚Äôt elect Biden. If you want change, vote, or you‚Äôll never see that change happen.
I wonder if this may hv factored in VP Bidens choice of Harris over longtime colleague Susan Rice. This is intriguing. Wonder how involved Pres Obama was. Could VP Biden's lack of awareness save him from being Implicated? (May hv been unwitting, and sleeping thru briefings).
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
If Biden wins the 2024 election will be between Harris and Tom Cotton or Trey Gowdy. We'll just continue a slow slide to fascism. People like the frog in the boiling water will acclimate &amp; aqueous. NO THANKS! I'm done w/ the Democrats and 'slightly better' than GOP. BURN IT DOWN!
A Picture Worth 1000 Words! Do You See It!? Here‚Äôs What Joe Biden Is¬†Hiding!
Thank God the GOP is finally taking some action on some of the items the House approved THREE MONTHS ago.  The do nothing Senate and WH waited to see how many 10‚Äôs of thousands would die first. Can‚Äôt wait for the payment so I can send it to Biden and Mark Kelly to save the US!
Let's not forget that with Biden we get a wife who's got a PhD. And Harris is married to a successful attorney!
Sucks we can‚Äôt vote for anyone beside Trump or Biden. Either way you look at it it‚Äôs a lose lose situation
You believe the two party system IS viable?  History has proven the 2 party system is corrupt and useless (unless you're an oligarch). I'm 61 years old, been voting since '76'. EVERY 4 Years is more of a debacle than the previous 4.  Biden makes Nixon look like a flaming liberal.
When will the lies and corruption stop?! Oh, yes, January 20th when Biden moves in and Trump is dumped!
This is a panic tactic born of Democrat weaknesses.  Mentally deficiant Biden can't articulate and Kamala is running from her past record.  The more Biden/Kamala hides from Press questions the more they signal fear and the worse it becomes for them.
No bc I do think Biden should be in the White House.
If you don‚Äôt want another 4 yrs of Trump, vote for Biden. Not voting at all, is not a solution.
Biden leads in all of the latest polls.. the only way Trump can win is if he cheats, which is exactly what he is trying to do by means of disrupting the USPS and of course foreign interference, among other ways.
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

I'm not surprised. To vote for the Biden-Harris ticket is to cut off your nose to spite your face.  You may not like everything about Trump, but American has been pretty great under his presidency (up until the rona, and that wasn't his fault).
No thanks. They‚Äôve told us that every election. Once these people are in office they care even *less* about us while most Dems believe whatever ‚Äútheir‚Äù president does is right/the best that they could do.  We need those people in the fight, but I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd fight biden.
FYI-the Repubs, Ron Johnson and some other low-lifes are doing "investigating" again to smear Obama and the Bidens.  Get tough Team Biden/Harris. trump is corrupt to the very core. How dare they continually bring up Obama or the Bidens. We don't back down. #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden says it‚Äôs his responsibility to take care of Americans. Unless it‚Äôs two weeks before his election. We had Americans in Benghazi and they were ignored and murdered.
If he wins, the US will be gone forever! Biden and Harris have so much work to do!!
This is why  needs an election night mandate.  340+ electoral votes, so even if they challenge NC NV etc Biden still wins without them.
wonder how much of a civil war lying about  Obama and Biden can start?  Who will be safe besides those of u who work for Putin and his lap dog Trump?
I just hope the media covers these the way they covered one accusation against Biden. Sure. Trump's supporters clearly don't care. But no one should forget!
Joe Biden has so far skated. He hasn't had any tough questions, and has just hid in his basement while voters assume whatever they want about him (and the media covers for him.)  Once people actually see Biden, his numbers go down.

Yesterday during my FB live, I used the example of Biden's movement on the Hyde Amendment. He moved because he was pushed by progressives and organizations like Planned Parenthood. He wasn't moved by silence and capitulation. He was moved by activism and accountability. 2/

Liberals are the purveyors of bigotry and reverse discrimination they teach the lesson of hatred to all hatred unreasonable blind poisonous is what drives the Biden/Harris ticket
The media wants shut downs having their throat on the neck of the American people and stressing out the American family by keeping children at home is the Biden/Harris strategy for winning the election and the media fully intends to keep the hysteria going

The person you are replying to protected their tweets so I can't see them. But this has NOTHING to do with whether you like or want to vote for Biden/Harris. Questioning people's right to citizenship status because of who their parents are is bad.
Yet his supporters say that Biden has dementia. This guy can‚Äôt even read a script. This is frightening. Not even funny.
Absodamnlutely correct. No debate will happen. Dimms can‚Äôt afford to expose Biden.
Biden came out &amp; slowwwwly stammered on about mask mandates &amp; lack of PPE.  Did anyone else feel that nobody told him what‚Äôs already been going on the last 5 months while he was in the basement?  #hidenbiden #trump2020 #covid #Trump2020LandslideVictory
U can give up &amp; vote for Biden believing there is no other way. I REFUSE! We've been fed a LIE abut how the system works. What if suffragettes believed they didn't have any choice? What if the civil rights movement gave up &amp; cowered in corners rather than taking 2 the streets?
Coronavirus is being used as an excuse to push a political agenda keeping a foot on the neck of the Americans by using shut downs making families suffer by keeping kids locked in is the political strategy of the Harris/Biden ticket

I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden while still pushing for a revolution. Biden is a bandaid not a solution. It is up to is to force this government to change by holding the economy hostage. Once enough people are on board, we have all the power.
It‚Äôs not cancel culture, though.  didn‚Äôt call for him to be ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù. They are making legitimate points to this person and their sense of character.  If this guy works for Biden, it is absolutely fair game to find out who he is and what he stands for.

You don‚Äôt have to like him, but Trump has done a damn good job. Whether you like them or not, Biden and Harris both have terrible track records in office. And, they want to take the US in the opposite direction that had us flourishing as a country. No thanks.
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Despite the drama-evoking click-baity title of this article, it is a wonderful read, delving into the political intelligence differences between Biden and Obama. I see a generational thing going on, but the strengths Biden brings to politics shouldn‚Äôt  be overlooked.

Hmmmm, so you recently saw the light after 40 years in public service? Oh, would the person handling this account for Mr. Biden please ask the question, as he does not know how to tweet, just saying.
Silly Hilly, If we wanted to fix it, we wouldn't be accepting Biden.
That was Biden.
The Biden/Obama administration also caged children, murdered civilians, and fucked over the working class just as hard.
Oh I fully understand. And I have absolutely ZERO hope that a Biden/Harris administration will be even an iota better for the working class.

So he's saying Biden-Harris will lose? Sounds good to me.
I find Joe Biden voters more repulsive than Trumpers. By a land slide! The difference is one can say and get away w/ more than the other! I view a vote for Biden as a vote for mainstream socialism and government expansion.
we can vote trump out while holding biden/kamala accountable for their atrocious careers
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.

Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

On the other hand, if they DO think Biden is middle-class, we‚Äôve officially solved the question of why conservatives think middle-class families should be fine financially.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù

Interns for Biden are funny
Why answer a dumb question. Why not ask that to Biden and Harris? They are both liars
Joe Biden is like an oiled black snake insurance seller to Americans. He sells that is already exist in America and never going to happen if he wins!
There are two main Establishment factions in the Democratic Party: Obama/Biden centrists and Clinton/Harris woke hipster liberals. The Harris pick was a concession by the former to the latter. That‚Äôs all.
Voting for Biden/Harris is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Trump may be flawed, but the country has been great up until Covid. I have confidence that the country will continue to excel under Trump, but I'm scared of what life might be like under the other guys.
I feel like a racist jackass assuming just because of the last name jumping to that conclusion. But at least I didn‚Äôt pull a Biden and ask if either of them ran a 7-11.
We Americans were ‚Äòtold‚Äô yesterday by Joe Biden, along w/liberal  Kamala Harris.. that ‚Äòwe all MUST wear masks indoors + outdoors for  at least the next 3 months or longer!!‚Äô.says Joe Biden!! We ‚Äòfree‚Äô Americans want Joe to know something; ‚ÄòWho The Hell Died And Made You King?!‚Äô
Ya wanna know why I'm calling you white? Here's why: - You still support/believe that voting in an corrupt, oligarchal political system is gonna change anything - You still like Capitalism - You're overlooking all of the terrible shit Biden/Harris have done in the past.

And Biden has repeatedly said sen Kkk byrd was his mentor. My how history is a bitch for dems, so is truth it seems.  Harris said that so many unemployed is due to trump. Did she forget the virus?
You gave the Trump experiment a shot, probably because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a politician‚Äù, the experiment obviously failed. At least the Obama/Biden administration brought the economy back from the brink in ‚Äò08 &amp; handled the H1N1 virus without 100‚Äôs thousands of deaths. VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS!

Joe Biden is a political coward. He was concerned about votes, not Americans in Benghazi. Now he wants us to believe he cares about us.
Oh no. Joe Biden IS A RACIST. plain and simple. He's the real deal! Racist to the core.

It's frightening that Biden is so prone to gaffes he is incapable of answering questions from the press, yet this is a regular function of being president. So why is he running for president if he can't handle the job?

If I were working for team Biden at this point I would start buying as many N95 masks as possible to donate to supporters who will have to stand in long lines on election day.  Request the day off now, and wear a mask, it's the only way to save the Republic and democracy.
Joe Biden will raise your taxes. Joe Biden will take your healthcare. Joe Biden will take away oil and gas. Joe Biden will let Kamala ruin America faster than he would.
Biden is center to center-right. The ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù in the party are just corporatists, imperialists and standard banners of the same status-quo shit that gave us Trump.
Force biden to stop sniffing and touching kids!!!! Lol
We need to see these numbers if Biden/Harris lose. I bet it will become a 3 way race between Cuomo, Buttigieg, and Yang. But of the top 5 listed here, Yang is the only one whose stock rises from the Dem voters to General voters. The others falter, which is a hugely good sign.
I saw more Hillary signs in 2016, I haven‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign anywhere yet.

All you do is complain about meaningful change. Well, here‚Äôs a piece of information that it actually RELEVANT instead of senseless whining: you won‚Äôt get anything done if you don‚Äôt elect Biden. If you want change, vote, or you‚Äôll never see that change happen.
I wonder if this may hv factored in VP Bidens choice of Harris over longtime colleague Susan Rice. This is intriguing. Wonder how involved Pres Obama was. Could VP Biden's lack of awareness save him from being Implicated? (May hv been unwitting, and sleeping thru briefings).
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
If Biden wins the 2024 election will be between Harris and Tom Cotton or Trey Gowdy. We'll just continue a slow slide to fascism. People like the frog in the boiling water will acclimate &amp; aqueous. NO THANKS! I'm done w/ the Democrats and 'slightly better' than GOP. BURN IT DOWN!
Your so full of shit! You need to read more and stop listening to Pelosi, Biden can't make decisions and Kamala is an anchor baby, In the event that the President or Vice cant do the job, the next person in line is speaker of the house! PELOSI' God help us!
Be genuine about your true concerns.  Unlike Trump, Biden is capable of taking in information that challenges him.  That is what Obama asked of him, and what he asked of Senator Harris.
A Picture Worth 1000 Words! Do You See It!? Here‚Äôs What Joe Biden Is¬†Hiding!
Thank God the GOP is finally taking some action on some of the items the House approved THREE MONTHS ago.  The do nothing Senate and WH waited to see how many 10‚Äôs of thousands would die first. Can‚Äôt wait for the payment so I can send it to Biden and Mark Kelly to save the US!
Let's not forget that with Biden we get a wife who's got a PhD. And Harris is married to a successful attorney!
Sucks we can‚Äôt vote for anyone beside Trump or Biden. Either way you look at it it‚Äôs a lose lose situation
...and like I (and so many)said, your hubris is laughable. Overly ambitious, not as smart as you think you are.  Knowing Biden is mush brain you want to step in and take control. The Democrat Party has become the modern Fascists and you are part of the malicious, scurrilous mob.
You believe the two party system IS viable?  History has proven the 2 party system is corrupt and useless (unless you're an oligarch). I'm 61 years old, been voting since '76'. EVERY 4 Years is more of a debacle than the previous 4.  Biden makes Nixon look like a flaming liberal.
Why aren't you investigating interference FOR Biden by China and Iran.  Both know that Biden is weak and will do their bidding, he'll bow to them same way Obama did.
Here we go folks...1st words from Biden contain control words! Mandate masks is just the beginning. Socialism already raising its ugly head...
When will the lies and corruption stop?! Oh, yes, January 20th when Biden moves in and Trump is dumped!
üåπ: we must destroy this system!  Also üåπ: we must vote for Joe Biden to preserve the system a little longer and tear it down slowly and less painful  Bitch WHAT?!
This is a panic tactic born of Democrat weaknesses.  Mentally deficiant Biden can't articulate and Kamala is running from her past record.  The more Biden/Kamala hides from Press questions the more they signal fear and the worse it becomes for them.
You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...
No bc I do think Biden should be in the White House.
If you don‚Äôt want another 4 yrs of Trump, vote for Biden. Not voting at all, is not a solution.
Biden leads in all of the latest polls.. the only way Trump can win is if he cheats, which is exactly what he is trying to do by means of disrupting the USPS and of course foreign interference, among other ways.
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

And that's what's great about this pick. Biden isn't afraid of his rivals, and instead of treating them like shit, he reaches out to them and adds them to his team.
Joke of the century. Obama had the SLOWEST economic recovery since the Great Depression. He/biden were a disaster for our country in EVERY way. Trump fixed it all - despite the malicious, vicious fictions you Demons devised to harass him. YOU WILL LOSE again bc you are EVIL.

The media complaining about Trump not responding to questions while Biden has staffers throwing themselves in front of reporters to block questions directed at Biden.
I'm not surprised. To vote for the Biden-Harris ticket is to cut off your nose to spite your face.  You may not like everything about Trump, but American has been pretty great under his presidency (up until the rona, and that wasn't his fault).
Biden and the new Democratic Congress must work on protecting our democracy from future presidents like Trump through safeguard legislation.
No thanks. They‚Äôve told us that every election. Once these people are in office they care even *less* about us while most Dems believe whatever ‚Äútheir‚Äù president does is right/the best that they could do.  We need those people in the fight, but I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd fight biden.

Vote for Biden.
If he wins, the US will be gone forever! Biden and Harris have so much work to do!!
This is why  needs an election night mandate.  340+ electoral votes, so even if they challenge NC NV etc Biden still wins without them.
wonder how much of a civil war lying about  Obama and Biden can start?  Who will be safe besides those of u who work for Putin and his lap dog Trump?
I just hope the media covers these the way they covered one accusation against Biden. Sure. Trump's supporters clearly don't care. But no one should forget!
Joe Biden has so far skated. He hasn't had any tough questions, and has just hid in his basement while voters assume whatever they want about him (and the media covers for him.)  Once people actually see Biden, his numbers go down.

Why do you not want to vote for Biden/Harris ticket? Trump is a rude, uncouth, racist, liar. He cares for no one, probably not even his own family. Is the bottom line your only criteria in choosing a President. Is taxes all you care about. What about your self respect/self worth
I think more like total fucking chaos until the inauguration.     The November, December, and most of January before Biden get sweetie in is going to be fucking insane.

If you think that the civil unrest goes away with Biden winning this election... wake the hell up. If anything, it will intensify, far and fast. Or do you really think they are afraid of Biden dropping the hammer on them? #riots2020 #Trump2020
One thing about Biden‚Äîevery year he gets more hair than he had the year before.
Sure.   I think the unrest will increase because they KNOW that with Biden, there will never be anybody to drop the hammer on them.

we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states

this. Heck, he was honored by the NAACP several times in NYC for his work with blacks. I support Trump because supporting Biden is against the Faith. Only one is actually not a racist, not a sexist, not an abuser, not a sexual harasser, not a corporate whore, not an abortionist,
not many ppl are saying you have to. some of them just want to have a discussion on this. they want to persuade others to vote for biden as well, which is no different from any other debating. but yes there are some who are vote shaming, though they are still leftist

No. Literally the White House is the most important take. He isn‚Äôt listening to Congress nor the Supreje Court. Campaign for Biden. If we take the White House and lose the house and they keep the senate, we will be OK. But we‚Äôre not going to lose the house.
That's why dems and Biden are hiding in basement and eant shutdowns while conservatives want to work and make country better hmm which one seems scared. Hmm tough one I'm sure.
This tells me that Biden‚Äôs depth of support is fairly weak, meaning we could very easily see another 2016 scenario

That's not enough to get my vote for one sexist and racist over a more sexist racist person. It's great you and A D have healthcare and an education, but what how about all the poor people that Biden and Harris  will ignore after being elected? I can't support that.

I read that trump leads Biden nationally like 67-33 for likely in person voters but Biden leads trump 87-13 for likely mail in voters. I fear and suspect trump will declare victory on election night before thousands of mail in votes are counted (if they ever arrive in time)
Because they know she can‚Äôt be president and if Biden wins and steps down, Pelosi becomes President. Heels Up Harris is an Anchor Baby.

There are two main Establishment factions in the Democratic Party: Obama/Biden centrists and Clinton/Harris woke hipster liberals. The Harris pick was a concession by the former to the latter. That‚Äôs all.
Voting for Biden/Harris is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Trump may be flawed, but the country has been great up until Covid. I have confidence that the country will continue to excel under Trump, but I'm scared of what life might be like under the other guys.

We need to see these numbers if Biden/Harris lose. I bet it will become a 3 way race between Cuomo, Buttigieg, and Yang. But of the top 5 listed here, Yang is the only one whose stock rises from the Dem voters to General voters. The others falter, which is a hugely good sign.

If Biden wins the 2024 election will be between Harris and Tom Cotton or Trey Gowdy. We'll just continue a slow slide to fascism. People like the frog in the boiling water will acclimate &amp; aqueous. NO THANKS! I'm done w/ the Democrats and 'slightly better' than GOP. BURN IT DOWN!
Be genuine about your true concerns.  Unlike Trump, Biden is capable of taking in information that challenges him.  That is what Obama asked of him, and what he asked of Senator Harris.
Thank God the GOP is finally taking some action on some of the items the House approved THREE MONTHS ago.  The do nothing Senate and WH waited to see how many 10‚Äôs of thousands would die first. Can‚Äôt wait for the payment so I can send it to Biden and Mark Kelly to save the US!
Sucks we can‚Äôt vote for anyone beside Trump or Biden. Either way you look at it it‚Äôs a lose lose situation
...and like I (and so many)said, your hubris is laughable. Overly ambitious, not as smart as you think you are.  Knowing Biden is mush brain you want to step in and take control. The Democrat Party has become the modern Fascists and you are part of the malicious, scurrilous mob.
You believe the two party system IS viable?  History has proven the 2 party system is corrupt and useless (unless you're an oligarch). I'm 61 years old, been voting since '76'. EVERY 4 Years is more of a debacle than the previous 4.  Biden makes Nixon look like a flaming liberal.
Why aren't you investigating interference FOR Biden by China and Iran.  Both know that Biden is weak and will do their bidding, he'll bow to them same way Obama did.
Here we go folks...1st words from Biden contain control words! Mandate masks is just the beginning. Socialism already raising its ugly head...
When will the lies and corruption stop?! Oh, yes, January 20th when Biden moves in and Trump is dumped!
This is a panic tactic born of Democrat weaknesses.  Mentally deficiant Biden can't articulate and Kamala is running from her past record.  The more Biden/Kamala hides from Press questions the more they signal fear and the worse it becomes for them.
You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...
Biden leads in all of the latest polls.. the only way Trump can win is if he cheats, which is exactly what he is trying to do by means of disrupting the USPS and of course foreign interference, among other ways.
Isolating Biden/Kamala from Press questions is not going to end well for Democrats  For Second Day in a Row Biden‚Äôs Handlers Swiftly Move in to Protect Biden and Harris and Kick Out Reporters as They Shout Questions
And that's what's great about this pick. Biden isn't afraid of his rivals, and instead of treating them like shit, he reaches out to them and adds them to his team.
Joke of the century. Obama had the SLOWEST economic recovery since the Great Depression. He/biden were a disaster for our country in EVERY way. Trump fixed it all - despite the malicious, vicious fictions you Demons devised to harass him. YOU WILL LOSE again bc you are EVIL.
The media complaining about Trump not responding to questions while Biden has staffers throwing themselves in front of reporters to block questions directed at Biden.
I'm not surprised. To vote for the Biden-Harris ticket is to cut off your nose to spite your face.  You may not like everything about Trump, but American has been pretty great under his presidency (up until the rona, and that wasn't his fault).
Biden and the new Democratic Congress must work on protecting our democracy from future presidents like Trump through safeguard legislation.
No thanks. They‚Äôve told us that every election. Once these people are in office they care even *less* about us while most Dems believe whatever ‚Äútheir‚Äù president does is right/the best that they could do.  We need those people in the fight, but I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd fight biden.

Vote for Biden.
If he wins, the US will be gone forever! Biden and Harris have so much work to do!!
This is why  needs an election night mandate.  340+ electoral votes, so even if they challenge NC NV etc Biden still wins without them.
wonder how much of a civil war lying about  Obama and Biden can start?  Who will be safe besides those of u who work for Putin and his lap dog Trump?
I just hope the media covers these the way they covered one accusation against Biden. Sure. Trump's supporters clearly don't care. But no one should forget!
Joe Biden has so far skated. He hasn't had any tough questions, and has just hid in his basement while voters assume whatever they want about him (and the media covers for him.)  Once people actually see Biden, his numbers go down.

Why changing USPS 3 months before a major election that will be using that service a lot because of a pandemic? Makes no sense.  What makes sense is to undermine that service because all polls show mostly Biden voters want to use the mail in ballots. Capice?

I‚Äôm just here for someone to tell me what Biden was saying &amp; why?
Yes. That‚Äôs exactly right. Actually they‚Äôll get worse. This idea that the looters and the arsons and the riots will stop is childish. Or do you really think Biden will put a stop to them?
If you think that the civil unrest goes away with Biden winning this election... wake the hell up. If anything, it will intensify, far and fast. Or do you really think they are afraid of Biden dropping the hammer on them? #riots2020 #Trump2020
Sure.   I think the unrest will increase because they KNOW that with Biden, there will never be anybody to drop the hammer on them.
You didn't "create" any of those jobs you idiot. People just got back SOME of the jobs they lost due to yours and your boss' incompetent handling of COVID. Many of those jobs were created under Obama - Biden. Unemployment under you is worse than almost ever in American history.

Vote for Biden anyway. It's a no brainer.
You have to wonder why Biden picked Harris? She can NEVER be President of the United States, she is not liked she only had 2% of the vote in the democrat Presidential race, from her home state of California she finished 5th. She treated everyone in front of congress like a dog.
Biden doesn‚Äôt know a thing. Where did he get that number?

Poll: Biden maintains clear lead over Trump nationally  via
Nah, most of those 27% are progressives who know what's at stake.  They're the 80% that voted for Hillary and are gonna vote for Biden.  The internet one we see on Twitter is like fraction of a fraction of the voters who went for Bernie. Most are anarchists or actual marxists.
I'm not sure how to handle that. Except with voting. Legally, anyways....   After we get done with the dictator, we need massive reform on all levels. I think Biden is up to it. He will have experts around him. Not window lickers.
Maybe in time Joe and Kamala will change your mind. The proof is in the actions, not just the words. Biden has already laid out plans and policies as soon as he gets in office. Check out his site

Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!

You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.

BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden
Business as usual.  üîΩüîΩ  Wall Street executives are glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his VP running mate
Kamala Harris attacks Joe Biden on busing, race in Democratic debate
And this is who you all want as your vice president really LOL. Isn‚Äôt Biden bad enough
Can Bernie shame  his Berners into voting for a Biden/Kamala ticket?
Biden/Harris 2020 uh US Senate ü§£
Trump took the bait and called Kamala a ‚ÄúNasty Women‚Äù.    Where have we heard that before?    He consistently puts down stong Women.   Smart Women Against Trump (SWAT).  We the women of American are coming for you Agent Orange. #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden   #TrumpIsLosing
I know y‚Äôall not gonna let trump win AGAIN. ü§° we know joe Biden and Kamala suck ass GET OVER YOURSELF
The Obama/Hillary mantra has always been to purge the left.   Even a Dem center left leaner should not vote for this center right Biden/Harris Republican ticket.
I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden but am less than thrilled with this choice.
A Biden/Kamala ticket proves Hedges is spot on again.
Im just glad Biden‚Äôs VP pick isnt also a million years old
Joe Biden is excited and ready time sniff!
In roughly 60 days, Arizonans will receive early ballots with the historic team of  and  at the top of the ticket. Biden Harris WILL win AZ,  the White House and WILL restore the soul of our nation. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Press conf in Wilmington tomorrow.  Just a stunner.  What's the over/under on how many days it takes Biden to get west of the Mississippi?
Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.
You Democrats are the most scurrilous, malicious group to come down the road in decades. And YOU will help Biden lose -- big.
Joe Biden Is Back At It Again, Just Chose Kamala Harris As His Running Mate. ü§î #BidenVP
I think it speaks volumes about the type of person Biden is to choose Harris. That he can forgive the primary debates.
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, HARRIS AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
HELLO EVERYONE, FROM FACEBOOK JAIL, TIME FOR MORE WORDS OF WISDOM FROM UNCLE JOEL!!!!!  JOE BIDEN, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MADE A GREAT CHOICE!!!!!  KAMALA HARRIS, A WONDERFULLY, BRILLIANT, STRONG BLACK WOMAN FOR VICE PRESIDENT!!!!!
Can't wait to see the mental and emotional gymnastics people are going to ask of leftists. I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden, don't ask me to be fucking excited please.
IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN, HARRIS AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
HELLO BOYS AND GIRLS, FROM FACEBOOK JAIL, TIME FOR MORE WORDS OF WISDOM FROM UNCLE JOEL!!!!!  JOE BIDEN, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MADE A GREAT CHOICE!!!!!  KAMALA HARRIS, A WONDERFULLY, BRILLIANT, STRONG BLACK WOMAN FOR VICE PRESIDENT!!!!!
I wanted  as VP. I‚Äôm still voting Biden 2020 though.
It‚Äôs better than what we have now and it‚Äôll get Biden more support.. so I‚Äôm all for it
Bogart is a Biden pooch!
It would seem as if I have not been chosen as Biden's running mate.
Joe Biden is gonna stop climate change, and control all viruses üòÆüôÑü§°
...If CNN did real investigative reporting on Biden and family, its ratings would soar!  3. Biden will not win the Presidency!  Come on, man -- Most voters are smarter than that.
Ratings bc of Trump? How absurd! 1. CNN ratings didn't rise. They are way down with most of the public doubting what CNN spouts. 2. Biden would NOT be boring if CNN were to actually investigate all the corruption surrounding him, including his financial ties to China...

Can‚Äôt wait to see the complaints about Biden‚Äôs VP pick.  Americans need to unite to rid us of the parasites in the White House. #EvictTrump
Um...is it just me? I suspect sex with Biden would not be horrible. *ducks and runs*
IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR BLIND SUPPORT OF "TRAITOR TRUMP"?????  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Ok so...I feel it‚Äôs unfair to keep you all in suspense any longer. Here is a picture of Biden‚Äôs VP candidate. Biden/Tiniest and crankiest calico cat 2020!
I think its a confusing inside baseball game. I think if they feel comfortable with the vetting its Rice, however between her being worth 25-50 million, and years in the Obama WH that is a big if. I think the political people want Kamila, the Biden people don't
FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO US, I WANT HIM, HIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS FAMILY TO CONTRACT THE MOST VIRULENT FORM OF COVID-19 AND SUFFER GREATLY!!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
UNTIL JOE BIDEN IS SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20, 2021, AT WHICH TIME HE WILL BRING THE FULL FORCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT COVID-19 IN ALL ASPECTS!!!!!
At least he has them and takes numerous questions that aren't pre-approved from 'reporters' he's been told to call upon.  What's the journalistic value of Biden's TWO 'press conferences' other than comedy?
23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...
Joe Biden for President
JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Bullshit! Obama-Biden didn‚Äôt do shit for the American people.
My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.
"Is there an equivalent on the left tearing down Trump?‚Äù Observant, aren't u? CNN wouldn't exist w/o liars &amp;propagandists for Dems/now Biden like u to string public along with your constant lies, omissions, and fictions. Look at yourself in the mirror to answer your question.UGH!
can you ride a bike?Joe is in better shape than you. Tell your conspiracy creators Joe does not need a nursing home.       Joe Fox-Trolling Mask Bike Ride Sets Twitter Ablaze
My point is this.  You were blessed to be born free and  now that‚Äôs being threatened.  Look  Portland/around you.  Don‚Äôt believe me?  Go to Fla, 90 miles So. is Cuba.  They don‚Äôt have a country. Thats why they‚Äôre fleeing. Take a look.  Vote Biden, that‚Äôs your future.
Me trying to explain how Joe Biden can win the election
Ask me again why I despise Dems as much as Repubs and why I will not vote for either one of the Israel Firsters.   Report: Biden personally intervened to get the word 'occupation' removed from the Democratic Party platform
Biden‚Äôs up 10%
Biden, lol.
My MIL accused me of brainwashing my husband into voting for Biden. Not the craziest thing she‚Äôs said about me, but it‚Äôs new, at least.
Someone PLEASE stop Biden from talking
The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.
make more you tube videos.....give your opinion on 2020 riots,BLM, trump, Biden whatever. There great
Chuck Schumer does an irrupt change in Democrats stand against school‚Äôs opening up. Now pushing hard to get teachers unions on board to open schools. The reason, if kids get sick on a large scale, President Trump will be blamed hurting him in November. Dems can‚Äôt win with Biden
Joe Biden has a plan! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why is Biden going to church regularly when Delaware is recommending those over 65 stay away?
And Biden? Is he um...masterful!  Lol
Biden 2030. Good one
The  is amongst the greatest of God‚Äôs creations on Earth. It would be a desecration to allow uranium mining in such a sacred place. I join  in opposing uranium mining at the Grand Canyon.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
How about them Biden comments? Lol can‚Äôt condemn one without the other ü§°
Hungry Joe Biden üò±
Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
Meh. I‚Äôve heard that Biden can destroy God himself, so removing some extra melanin isn‚Äôt impressive.
Media watches Biden...media in full out desperation mode.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Joe Biden is actively working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden.
Based upon Joe's recent videos....Joe Biden is working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden......
VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."
please sir stop STOP ATTACKING CHINA JOE BIDEN.  WAIT LET HIM KEEP FUMBLING WITHOUT YOUR COMMENTS.  WHEN YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING DURING YOUR PRESS QUESTIONS.  all you have to do is say this  There is a reason I CALL YOU FAKE NEWS-- YOU REFUSE TO TELL THE TRUTH
Or you could act like a fucking grown up and vote for Biden because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. But that would be hard. üôÑ
Still don‚Äôt see Biden taking it...
Still don‚Äôt see Biden taking it..

He told Americans that Biden is going to take away religion and the Bible.   Sick man
18 followers... troll ! Go Biden
That because they‚Äôre looking at Biden‚Äôs VP pick to take over after Biden steps down
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible' - 159000 DEAD- no plans. You are a disaster 45 Yo...se....mite
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'- 88 days to get rid of this moron #45
Just saw segment on ‚ÄúInside Edition‚Äù about your interview with VP Biden and the Cognitive Test question.  Given the context vis a vis the President, I think it was entirely appropriate to ask.  VP Biden‚Äôs response was a little over the top.  You did ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
Biden owns a Hattori Hanzo sword.
Yes can‚Äôt wait for Biden to make you look üëÄ like the babbling fool you are
It‚Äôs Shrodingers Biden. Until he and He face off, he‚Äôs both a normal Biden and a Superior Biden.
Joe Biden should start a debate with this verse:
Joe Biden is not a devout Catholic because he does not accept the Church's teaching on abortion and same sex marriage.
people are crazy! Voting for fucking Biden?! What the hell! Even if you don‚Äôt like trump whatever the reason is you honestly want to see Biden as our president for the next 4years! think this country is fucked up now you wait till he gets a hold of it!üíôüñ§üíôüá∫üá∏Trump!
Biden is Not taking away your guns!!! Not defunding police!!!Not taking away religious rights!!Trump will lie fraud steal and do anything to get re-elected.   SHAME #NobodyLikesTrump
if Biden is so ungodly, why don‚Äôt you give your DNA to  ? Show what a man of God you are!! #TrumpIsNotWell #DonaldTrumpIsAPedo #DictatorTrump
‚ÄúA third misleading use of an image in that ad, they also show Biden sort of looking down, hands clasped, looking defeated,‚Äù Well, he was actually praying at an African-American church in Delaware after the death of George Floyd.‚Äù Because DJT doesn‚Äôt know what praying looks like.
I just don‚Äôt know how Biden will be able to take your guns if Obama already took them.
We need the $ since Biden has the MSM propaganda for free!
I feel like us conservatives are starting to call things racist that aren‚Äôt actually racist. We‚Äôre starting to use a more obscure, ambiguous definition of racism instead of the actual definition. I‚Äôm pretty sure even Candace has said something to the same effect as VP Biden did.
I‚Äôm with Biden! All the way Biden!
Be after almost 4 years the debate doesn‚Äôt really matter most good Americans already no who they want and the debate won‚Äôt change anything and we are tired of your lies / Joe Biden for president
Democrats party may need to elect a new presidential candidate quickly, Biden is losing it at a alarming rate. They will be begging the Republicans to delay the election.
